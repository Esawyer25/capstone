"9161133","PROJECT SUMMARY Determining how neurons are correctly specified and assembled into functional circuits will provide insight into developmental disorders of the nervous system and may suggest therapeutic approaches to promote nerve regeneration. Slit and Netrin, and their Robo and Fra/DCC receptors, are evolutionary conserved families of signaling molecules that play important roles in regulating neuronal development; however, the understanding of how these receptors are regulated and how they signal to direct axon growth and guidance is incomplete. These are important questions because perturbations of these signaling pathways are implicated in diseases of nervous system development. Slits, Netrins and their receptors also play essential roles outside of the nervous system and disruptions of these pathways are associated with several kinds of cancer. Our research program focuses on three broad areas related to the roles and regulation of these molecules in neuronal development using the genetically tractable Drosophila embryonic nervous system as a model. First, we are working to define functional and molecular links between conserved transcriptional regulators that impart neuronal subtype identity and the Robo and Fra/DCC receptors that coordinate axon guidance and dendrite morphogenesis in response to Slit and Netrin. Here, we will use genetic and molecular screening approaches, including Fluorescence Activated Cell sorting (FACs) of defined subsets of motor neurons, together with transcript profiling in wild type and mutant backgrounds, to systematically identify additional effectors of these transcriptional programs. Second, we are characterizing a newly discovered mechanism through which the Frazzled/DCC receptor intracellular domain (ICD) itself can act in the nucleus as a transcriptional activator to regulate commissureless expression to ensure that commissural axons avoid premature responses to midline repellent Slit. Here, we will use genetic and molecular approaches to identify factors that cooperate with the Fra ICD to regulate transcription and transcript profiling methods to identify additional targets of the Fra ICD. In addition, we will explore whether signaling from the nucleus is a common property of axon guidance receptors and through collaboration we will test if this is a conserved property of guidance receptors. Third, we are determining the molecular mechanisms underlying Robo and Fra/DCC receptor signaling during axon guidance using molecular, genetic, biochemical and cell biological approaches. Specifically, we use in vivo genetic manipulation, together with fluorescently tagged receptors and reporters of signaling molecule activity in vitro, to define the cell biological outputs of receptor activation with sub-cellular resolution. Our research program will define new concepts in the molecular biology of axon guidance, inform studies of related proteins in mammalian systems and will likely enhance our understanding of neural developmental disorders."
"9174899","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are >400,000 older ESRD patients in the United States; adults over 55 are the fastest growing age group, and also the most challenging to treat and counsel. In older ESRD patients, risk prediction for patients undergoing the 2 available treatment modalities -- dialysis and kidney transplantation (KT) -- is based on generic metrics derived from national registries that cover patients of all ages and focus on one dichotomous endpoint (survival/death). These outcomes may be of limited relevance to older ESRD patients who are at high risk of adverse health outcomes of aging (AHOA). Novel risk prediction metrics developed in community-dwelling older adults may be uniquely suited to risk prediction among older ESRD patients. One potentially important metric is frailty, an independent syndrome of decreased physiologic reserve. Systemic inflammation is thought to mediate the association of frailty and AHOA due to increased vulnerability to stressors. Frailty is associated with doubling of dialysis mortality risk and a doubling of early KT allograft dysfunction. However, other outcomes are important for older ESRD patients. In response to dialysis and KT, older patients are at high risk for AHOA (cognitive dysfunction, ADL disability, depression, and low quality of life). We will test the following specific aims in 1 cohort of older dialysis initiates and 1 cohort of older KT recipients: (1) To estimate frailty trajectories and factors associated with frailty decline; (2) To determine the association of frailty and AHOA; and (3) To evaluate the inflammatory pathway between frailty to AHOA. We have designed a mentorship plan that includes in-depth course work in aging research and will be carried out in a well suited environment. The mentorship team includes expertise in aging research, kidney disease research, and mentorship of junior faculty. This team will help the candidate meet her career goals: (1) Widen experience in aging research; (2) Applying for and obtaining R01 grant funding; and (3) Improving treatment and outcomes of older ESRD patients. Our exploration of novel predictors and outcomes specific to older ESRD patients will directly benefit this population, and their providers, by informing risk prediction, helping guide clinical decision making, and possibly even providing insights into underlying biological processes."
"9252882","The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism that controls organ size by regulating cellular growth and death. The Hippo pathway exists in the heart and controls apoptosis, autophagy, hypertrophy, and proliferation in cardiomyocytes (CMs). YAP is a transcription co-factor and one of the most prominent terminal effectors of the Hippo pathway. Core kinases in the Hippo pathway, including Mst1 and Lats2, assemble with the help of hWW45, a scaffolding protein, and their activation induces nuclear exit and degradation of YAP, thereby negatively regulating YAP function. YAP controls both proliferation and hypertrophy of CMs and apoptosis in adult CMs, and plays an essential role in maintaining cardiac function and promoting regeneration in the heart subjected to chronic myocardial infarction (MI). Despite the generally detrimental effects of the Hippo pathway and the salutary role of YAP in the heart under stress, cardiac-specific Mst1 and Mst2 double knockout (KO) (Mst1/2cKO) mice and cardiac-specific hWW45 KO (hWW45cKO) mice develop more severe heart failure (HF) than control hearts in response to pressure overload (PO). These mice exhibit de-differentiation and decreased contraction of individual CMs. A fundamental question is why CMs possess the Hippo signaling pathway, if the sole function of the Hippo pathway is to induce cell death. We hypothesize that: Physiological activation of the Hippo pathway plays an essential role in maintaining CM function during PO by inhibiting unopposed activation of TEAD through YAP, at the expense of CM survival. To test this hypothesis, we will first demonstrate the physiological role of the upstream canonical Hippo pathway in the heart during PO and the role of YAP in mediating the detrimental effect of Hippo pathway downregulation. We will use Mst1/2cKO and hWW45cKO mice to demonstrate that the absence of the nuclear Hippo pathway and persistent activation of YAP are detrimental during PO. We will show that the detrimental effect of Mst1/2cKO and hWW45cKO is mediated through activation of YAP, using cardiac-specific heterozygous YAP KO (YAPhcKO) mice. We will then show that unopposed activation of YAP induces de-differentiation of CMs through TEAD1- mediated activation of fetal-type contractile proteins in the presence of PO. We will cross YAP gain-of-function mouse models, including hWW45cKO and YAP transgenic mice, with TEAD1+/- mice and show that persistent activation of YAP in CMs induces de- differentiation of CMs through activation of TEAD1 in the presence of PO. Suppression of the Hippo pathway and activation of YAP have been considered for treatment of HF, whereas the physiological function of the Hippo pathway has never been considered previously. We here propose the novel concept that the heart carries this cell death pathway in order to maintain the differentiation status of CMs. Furthermore, our study will shed light on a group of cardiomyopathies caused by persistent activation of YAP and consequent de- differentiation of CMs, as well as the possible treatment of these diseases with YAP inhibitors."

"9185961","During the past five year period, this Merit Award has permitted us to focus on molecular ?epigenomic? strategies that combinatorially regulate programs of gene transcription. These include identifying new epigenetic regulators; defining signatures of active enhancers; and providing evidence that enhancers mediating actions of liganded nuclear receptors are themselves regulated transcription units, transcribing functionally important eRNAs. We have also identified new histone modifications and elucidated their biological functions, and contributed to the growing evidence for dynamic three-dimensional interaction/reorganization of specific genomic regions. Finally, we have provided initial evidence that lncRNAs could exert their biological functions based on their actions to allosterically modify functions of RNA-binding proteins, and of retinoic acid receptor regulation of Pol III-dependent Alu repeat transcription units and their roles in biological processes. Specific contributions include: elucidating the roles of PHF8, PHF2 and SMYD5 in transcriptional regulation; identifying roles of a tissue-specific splice variant of LSD1; finding a novel tyrosine phosphorylation of H2A and; demonstrating the role of JMJD6 demethylase as a regulator of pause-release by actions on specific enhancers. We characterized the E2-regulated enhancer program and the ligand-dependent increase in eRNA transcription as a signature of functional enhancers. We identified the recruitment of the MegaTrans complex and Condensins I and II to these functional enhancers. Using Pit1 as a model, we also demonstrated the requirement for Pit1-dependent enhancer interactions with the Matrin3-rich network for effective activation of homeodomain-dependent transcriptional programs in the endocrine system. We propose to continue our work in this extension by exploring the roles of nuclear receptors in regulating negative, as well as positive, enhancer-dependent transcriptional programs, defining the roles of JMJD6 in these programs, and roles of modified long-distance interactions in dictating the chromosomal alterations underlying regulated transcriptional response. We will use genetic approaches to elucidate the mechanisms of super-enhancer regulation of endocrine developmental programs in the endocrine system. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Under this MERIT Award, we have contributed to understanding the enhancer-dependent strategies regulating broad gene transcriptional programs. We will continue and extend these studies in the MERIT Extension period by investigating global enhancer interaction networks; mechanisms of negative as well as positive gene transcriptional regulatory programs; and elucidating developmental roles of component enhancers in superenhancers in the endocrine system."
"9182810","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol use is considered to be a significant risk factor among those who die by suicide, especially among those who drink to regulate their emotions. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of treatment outcome research for suicidal heavy drinkers. Further, treatments that target this population must be maximally effective and widely disseminable. The application of technology has been increasingly utilized as an efficacious and acceptable way to rapidly disseminate evidence-base treatment. However, these methods are used infrequently for individuals deemed too high risk for computerized treatment. Along these lines, the goal of this project is to begin a line of research focused on developing interventions o reduce heavy drinking and risk for suicide through the use of technology. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills training is an effective intervention for behaviors associated with emotion dysregulation including addictive and suicidal behaviors. Further, DBT skills use has been identified as the active ingredient for treatment effectiveness; thus, a skills training interventin delivered via the Internet has the capacity to be a potent and efficient method of treatment delivery. The goal of this research is to establish a proof of concept for developing and evaluating a potentially efficacious and acceptable intervention for heavy episodic drinkers who are suicidal. Specifically, this project proposes to conduct a randomized controlled pilot trial ofa computerized DBT skills training intervention for suicidal individuals who engage in heavy episodic drinking (HED) to regulate emotions."
"9186516","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is a global health care challenge and is poorly controlled by existing therapeutic strategies. This medical reality urges the development of safer and more effective analgesics. One approach is to identify novel analgesic targets. Our recent studies have suggested imidazoline I2 receptors as a novel drug target for acute nociception, although its role in chronic pain is less clear. As the etiology of many chronic pain conditions is multifaceted, combination therapy may be particularly effective against chronic pain by integrating multiple analgesic mechanisms of action. Although opioids are the most effective analgesics, their use is limited by concerns about abuse and the development of tolerance and dependence during chronic administration. Thus, combining opioids with other analgesics such as I2 receptor agonists may achieve better analgesic effects while decreasing some adverse effects of opioids. Building on exciting preliminary findings, studies described in this application will examine the antinociceptive and unwanted (tolerance and abuse liability) effects of I2 receptor agonists and test the feasibility of combining morphine and I2 receptor agonists against chronic pain. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia measures will be used to characterize the antinociceptive effects of I2 receptor agonists and morphine, alone or in combination, in models of complete Freund's adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain and chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain (Aim I). Repeated treatment with I2 receptor agonists alone or combined with morphine will be performed to investigate the development of antinociceptive tolerance using the same procedures (Aim II). An intravenous self-administration procedure will be used to assess the reinforcing effects of I2 receptor agonists alone and how I2 receptor agonists modify the reinforcing effects of morphine (Aim III). Collectively, these experiments address two related and highly significant questions: (1) Do I2 receptor agonists represent a novel class of effective and safe analgesics for chronic pain and (2) Does the combination of I2 receptor agonists with morphine increase pain relief without increasing, or possibly decreasing, the abuse liability and development of tolerance."
"9195613","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study is designed to provide evidence for convergent validity, discriminant validity, predictive validity, sensitivity, and specificity fr the two-item underage drinking screening instrument designed by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the American Academy of Pediatrics. The study will use an accelerated longitudinal design with three cohorts (400 6th graders, 400 8th graders, and 400 10th graders). Each cohort will be assessed 7 times over a 31/2-year period, supporting longitudinal analyses across the 7-year period from 6th grade until the year after 12th grade. Participants will be sampled from public schools in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC. Students will be assessed in their classrooms twice per year. We will measure alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, alcohol use disorders, illicit drug use, sexual risk behavior, and externalizing problem behavior through well-validated self-report measures. We will also examine the extent to which the validity and effects of the screener vary according to the density of alcohol outlets within walking distance (a practical 1/4 mile radius) o each adolescent's home and school addresses, and according to Census-level poverty, affluence, residential stability, and family structure indices. Our analytic objectives will be to examine the extent to which scores on the screener items predict current and subsequent alcohol use, alcohol-related problems, diagnosable alcohol use disorders, illicit drug use, sexual risk behavior, and externalizing problem behavior - as well as to identify cutoff scores for the screener items that maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the instrument to identify adolescents at risk for alcohol problems. The present study will be the first to use the screener in a school setting, where the vast majority of adolescents can be accessed."
"9182903","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the prevalence of childhood obesity may have started to plateau for some groups of children, other groups such as low-income and minority children are experiencing increases in childhood obesity. These growing disparities may be linked to unanswered questions regarding the home environment and childhood obesity. For example, research has shown that healthful food availability/accessibility in the home, frequent family meals, and authoritative parenting style are associated with healthful dietary intake, bette psychosocial health, and fewer unhealthy weight control behaviors in youth, but findings are inconsistent across studies with minority and low-income families. These conflicting findings suggest that mixed- methods studies are needed for an in-depth examination of the home environments of diverse families to identify potential explanatory mechanisms of childhood obesity that may have been overlooked in prior research. In addition, previous studies have not included state-of-the-art measures that may help illuminate factors in the home environment that differ by race/ethnicity. The primary objective of this study is to identify how familial factors, including interpersonal relationships that exist between family members, of racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children act as risk or protective factors for predicting childhood obesity. To achieve this objective, a two-phased incremental mixed-methods approach will be used. Phase I (yrs. 1-2) will include in-home observations of diverse families (n=120; 20 each of African American, American Indian, Hispanic, Hmong, Somali and white families) to identify individual, dyadic (i.e., parent/child; siblings), and familial factors that are associated with, o moderate associations with, childhood obesity. The in-home observations, using our community-based participatory research partners, will include: (1) an interactive observational family task and family interview; (2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) 17 of parent stress, mood and parenting practices; and (3) child accelerometry and 24-hour dietary recalls. Using state-of-the-art measures, such as EMA, will allow for identifying within-day fluctuations in parenting practices or parent stress levels, which may help to identify nuances within the home environment that amplify or exacerbate childhood obesity risk. Results from the in-home observations will be used for rich analyses and to inform the development of a culturally-appropriate survey in Phase II (yrs. 3- 5). The survey will be administered at two time points to a diverse sample of up to two caregivers (n=2400) of children ages 5-7. Individual, dyadic, and familial factors that are longitudinally associated with child BMIz score and weight-related behaviors will be identified. Phase I and II recruitment will occur via the electronic Primary Care Research Network in Minnesota primary care clinics (n=82). This comprehensive evaluation of diverse home environments will identify potential factors that increase childhood obesity risk in order to create culturally-tailored interventions that will be effective in reducing childhood obesty disparities."
"9185312","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies have demonstrated that Olfactory Receptors (ORs) play important physiological roles as chemosensors in tissues beyond the nose. We have reported that one of the ORs expressed in the kidney, Olfactory Receptor 78 (Olfr78), plays an important role in blood pressure (BP) regulation. Intriguingly, the ligands for this receptor are short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are metabolites produced by the gut microbiota. The key role of Olfr78 in modulating BP is clearly demonstrated by the hypotension (~13mmHg) observed in mice null for Olfr78 (Olfr78 KO). However, Olfr78 localizes to multiple tissues that influence BP regulation - it is not only found in the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), which plays a role in renin secretion, but it is also expressed in the peripheral vasculature, where it appears to modulate vascular tone. In this proposal, we will utilize the flox cre system to determine which site of Olfr78 expression is the primary contributor to the hypotension seen in the KO mice (SA1). In addition, because Olfr78 KO mice are hypotensive, we hypothesize that an Olfr78 antagonist would likewise lower BP and would be an extremely useful tool for teasing apart the role of Olfr78 in BP regulation in vivo. Therefore, in SA2, we wil carry out in vitro studies to characterize Olfr78 antagonists (building upon our strong preliminary data), and will determine which compounds are the best candidates for in vivo use. In SA3, we will utilize Olfr78 antagonists in vivo in both wild-type and various KO mice in order to advance our understanding of Olfr78 function. In sum, our data implies that a novel renal OR plays a role in modulating BP regulation in response to changes in gut microbial metabolism. The proposed work invokes a variety of in vitro and in vivo techniques in order to advance our understanding of BP regulation by studying an entirely novel pathway involving a novel renal OR. These studies have the potential to lead to potentially exciting future clinical implications, as our dat suggests that manipulating Olfr78 in vivo has the potential to significantly alter BP."
"9189713","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal motility and visceral sensation disorder that affects 30 million people in the United States.  IBS is twice as common in women as men and IBS symptom severity is related to fluctuations in circulating female sex hormones and to episodes of stress.  In addition, drugs which act at some 5-hydroxytryptamine (5- HT serotonin) receptors relieve IBS symptoms, including visceral pain, in some patients.  Finally, many IBS patients have a polymorphism in the promoter region of the gene that encodes the serotonin transporter (SERT).  This polymorphism leads to low SERT expression.  These data indicate that there is an interaction between serotonin and female sex hormone signaling that leads to IBS symptoms especially visceral pain.  The underlying pathophysiology of visceral pain is unclear and this is partly due to a lack of animal models where mechanistic and interventional studies can be conducted. We will use This hypothesis will be tested using male and female serotonin transporter (SERT) knockout (KO)  rats, which we propose is an animal model of sex specific visceral hypersensitivity.  This project will test th hypothesis  that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and estrogen signaling interact to  increase neurotransmission of primary afferent neurons supplying the colon to second order spinal sensory neurons and  that probiotic bacteria L. reuteri (Lactobacillus reuteri 6475) can be used as a safe and effective treatment for visceral pain in IBS.     The overall hypothesis will be tested in 3 specific aims.  Specific aim 1 will tes the hypothesis that 5-HT3 and CRH1 antagonists can reduce visceral hypersensitivity as measured by the visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal balloon distention (CRD).  Specific aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the probiotic bacteria L. retueri can reduce visceral hypersensitivity in female SERT KO rats and this this probiotic may be a safe and effective treatment for visceral pain in IBS. Specific aim 3 will test the hypothesis that serotonin, 17-beta estradiol and CRH interaction to alter the excitability of colon projecting sensory neurons and that colon projecting neurons from female SERT KO rats will show reduced excitability.  The data would indicate that the SERT KO rat is a model for studying changes in the sensory nerve supply of  the gut that leads to visceral hypersensitivity."
"9197595","PROJECT SUMMARY (See Instructions): Expenditures around episodes of hospitalization vary widely across hospitals. In our recent national study. Medicare payments for inpatient surgery differed 10% to 39% between the least and most expensive hospital quintiles, after adjusting for price differences and case mix. Aiming to reduce such variation, CMS is moving steadily toward bundled payments, which would provide a single lump sum to hospitals, physicians, and other caregivers involved in care around hospitalizations. The hope is that bundled payments will give hospital and physicians stronger incentives to coordinate care and reduce the use of unnecessary services. Extending our previous P01-funded research, this project will explore determinants of variation in hospital payments, incorporating both claims data from the under-65 population and clinically rich outcomes and safety culture information from 50 hospitals in Michigan. We will also evaluate the direct and indirect consequences of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation's (CMMI) recent bundled payment initiative. This subproject has three goals. First, we plan to examine the association between hospital quality and Medicare episode payments. Taking advantage of Michigan's unique clinical outcomes data infrastructure, we will examine surgical cohorts to understand relationships among patient-level outcomes such as risk adjusted morbidity and mortality, measures of technical quality such as hospital safety culture and teamwork, and price-adjusted episode costs. Second, we propose to evaluate the direct impact of the CMMI bundled payment initiative on costs and quality. For the subset of Michigan hospitals participating in the CMMI bundled payment program, we will evaluate the direct effects of this intervention on episode payments and quality of care with targeted conditions and procedures. And finally, we plan to assess spillover and substitution effects of episode payments for the under-65 population, and for Medicare patients with unbundled conditions. Using the CMMI bundled payment program as a shift in relative prices for post discharge services, we will also assess the program's spillover effects on procedures for the under-65 population, and for unrelated and untargeted conditions in the over-65 population."
"9197590","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  We have proposed five projects that together address many of the shortcomings in our understanding of how to measure, study and improve efficiency in healthcare. Core B is responsible for data management and analytic support for the data on which the five projects rest. To understand the causes and consequences of differences in the efficiency of healthcare, it is crucial to have: (1) a comprehensive database with sufficient power to characterize detailed patterns of healthcare utilization at the regional, hospital, physician and network levels, (2) a broad array of additional measures drawn from diverse sources that can augment these data, (3) the analytic capacity and oversight to ensure the timely preparation of analytic datasets, and (4) appropriate access to these resources for other investigators. We plan first to maintain a comprehensive and secure database of administrative data including Medicare and Medicaid enrollment files, claims records, and supplementary files. Second, we hope to obtain and manage additional data files required for this P01 and to develop subproject-specific analytic files. We will obtain data from a variety of sources, including the American Board of Internal Medicine, the Minimum Data Set of nursing home care, and Michigan and Texas Blue Cross Blue Shield data. Third, we seek to maintain a computing infrastructure and procedures capable of managing a high volume of patient identifiable, confidential data while ensuring timely and appropriate access to authorized investigators. And finally, we plan to make the research files developed under this P01 available to the research community to the extent permissible under law."

All subjects received either levetiracetam or placebo and Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment (BBCET)  intervention. Patients were stratified on  clinical site, and  SSRI use.   No significant differences were detected between the levetiracetam XR and placebo groups in either the primary outcomes (percent heavy drinking days and percent subjects with no heavy drinking days) or in other secondary drinking outcomes. Treatment groups did not differ on a number of nondrinking outcomes, including depression, anxiety, mood, and quality of life. The only difference observed was in alcohol-related consequences. The levetiracetam XR treatment group showed significantly fewer consequences than did the placebo group during the maintenance period (p=0.02). Levetiracetam XR was well-tolerated, with fatigue being the only significantly elevated adverse event, compared with placebo (53% vs. 24%, respectively; p=0.001).

"9206997","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Priapism associated with sickle cell disease affects several thousand men in the US and millions worldwide. At present there is no pharmacological treatment to prevent the onset of priapism in these patients, in part because the mechanisms involved in the development of priapism are complex and not well understood. Our group has established that a family of pentapeptides called opiorphins play a role in the development of priapism. Our most recent work has discovered that opiorphins are up-regulated in corporal smooth tissue in response to hypoxia and that opiorphins then regulate expression of genes that function in smooth muscle relaxant pathways. This has led us to propose the following hypothesis: Sickle cell disease causes hypoxia/ischemia in corporal tissue which results in increased opiorphin expression. Opiorphin then acts as a master regulator of compensatory smooth muscle relaxant pathways. The excessive activation of these relaxant pathways in corporal tissue is generally considered to lead to priapism.  Our hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine if opiorphin expression is increased in response to hypoxia in mouse and human cells in vitro and if up-regulation of opiorphin expression in turn activates pathways involved in corporal smooth muscle relaxation. We will confirm that the in vitro response to hypoxia correlates to similar changes in relaxant pathways in an in vivo corporal mouse model of hypoxia and if in this animal model there is heightened relaxation of corporal smooth muscle strips in organ bath studies. In Specific Aim 2 we will focus on a mouse model of sickle cell disease and determine if up-regulation of opiorphin expression in corporal tissue is an early event in sickle cell disease. We will determine in the sickle cell mouse corporal tissue if a similar set of genes involved in relaxant pathways are activated as in models of hypoxia (identified in Specific Aim 1). We will correlate changes in the genes involved in relaxant pathways with increased erectile tendencies and heighted relaxation of corporal smooth muscle tissue. In addition, we will determine changes in gene expression in a chemically-(blebbistatin)-induced mouse model of priapism. Analysis of the blebbistatin mouse model will distinguish genes that are changed secondary (ie. in response to priapism) rather than causative of priapism. In a clinical study we will compare the expression of opiorphin in the blood of sickle cell and non-sickle cell patients, and determine if opiorphin levels are increased during, or predictive of, a priapic-crisis. In Specific Aim 3 will develop opiorphin over expression or knock-down mouse models to directly demonstrate that opiorphins play a role in priapism/erectile function. These studies will utilize a novel delivery system developed by Dr. Joel Friedmans (Co-I) at Einstein- a paramagnetic nanoparticle carrying opiorphin-siRNA which can be targeted to the penis. We will use this system to specifically knock-down expression of opiorphin in the corporal tissue of sickle cell mice and determine if knock-down of opiorphin expression results in decreased erectile tendencies or decreased activity of smooth muscle relaxant pathways. If evidence confirms that knock-down of opiorphin reduces priapic-like activity in this animal model it would provide proof-of-principle to support this approach, or other strategies targeting opiorphin, to prevent priapism in sickle cell patients."

"9208680","Project Summary/Abstract - Genomics and Computational Core (Kraus - PI)  State-of-the-art genomic technologies combined with cutting-edge computational tools have dramatically advanced our understanding of signal-regulated gene transcription in a wide variety of biological systems. Next generation sequencing-based assays, such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), have revealed new information about the regulation of steady-state RNA levels, as well as the localization and regulation of actively transcribing RNA polymerase, transcription factors, and histone modifications across the genome. The global views generated by these assays provide a uniquely informative perspective that cannot be achieved by analyzing one or a few genes at a time. Although the field of reproductive biology has begun to incorporate genomic tools into its repertoire, it has yet to maximize the use of these unique discovery and analysis tools.  The goal of this project is to establish a Genomics and Computational Core (GCC) that will serve the needs of all four research projects, all of which propose to use genomic approaches as discovery tools and as assays to probe molecular mechanisms. The GCC will eliminate the need for each lab to establish these methodologies on its own, or to use fee-for-service alternatives that typically only provide first pass data analysis and do not see the experiment through from start to finish. In this regard, the GCC will provide comprehensive service that includes experimental design, genomic library preparation, data analysis, and data archiving. In addition, the GCC will act to promote and facilitate collaborations between the personnel working in different labs. To save costs and increase efficiency, the GCC will leverage infrastructure and expertise already present in the Green Center for Reproductive Biology Sciences.  Specifically, the GCC will (1) provide consultation to the PIs and their laboratories during the planning and design stages of all genomic experiments, (2) prepare high-quality genomic libraries from samples collected by the PIs and their laboratories for next generation sequencing, (3) perform quality control analyses on the genomic libraries and the resulting data, and (4) analyze the genomic data generated by the PIs and their laboratories. We anticipate that the GCC will greatly enhance (1) the ease of performing genomic experiments, (2) the quality of the data obtained and the analyses performed, and (3) the efficiency of doing genomic experiments and concomitant waste reduction. Most importantly, the GCC will greatly enhance the efforts of the PIs and their laboratories in obtaining meaningful biological information from genomic experiments."
"9214602","ABSTRACT Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor, is among the most lethal of cancers. It is also among the most immunosuppressive, impeding the success of immune-based therapies. The tumor has an especially devastating impact on T cells, which either vanish from the blood and lymphoid organs or persist in a state of pronounced dysfunction. While T cell dysfunction has been well characterized, their disappearance has not, instead remaining a mystery for decades. Our novel data reveal that the missing T cells are frequently found in large numbers in the bone marrow. This proves true in both patients and mice with GBM, each of which harbor a 3 to 5-fold expansion in bone marrow T cell counts. Such expansion contrasts starkly with observations of AIDS-level CD4 T cell counts in blood and gross contraction of other lymphoid organs, including the spleen. Sequestration in bone marrow is suggested as T cells transferred into GBM- bearing mice accumulate in the marrow disproportionately over the ensuing 24 hours. Furthermore, when marrow-sequestered T cells from GBM-bearing mice are transferred back into controls, they preferentially re- accumulate in the bone marrow, suggesting T cells acquire alterations eliciting their sequestration. Notably, these phenomena are observed when other cancers are implanted intracranially, but never when the same tumors are placed subcutaneously, including GBM. This implies a unique role for the brain environment in mediating the T cell sequestration. Our preliminary studies suggest that T cells become sequestered in bone marrow in the GBM-bearing state as a result of diminished levels of T cell surface sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1). We propose to: 1) further define the role of S1P1 in mediating bone marrow T cell sequestration in GBM; 2) delineate the upstream determinants of S1P1 downregulation in the tumor-bearing state; and 3) devise means of reversing T cell sequestration, with the ultimate goals of replenishing the missing peripheral T cell pool and improving the efficacy of immune-based GBM therapies."
"9216195","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Megakaryocytes (MK) are rare very large marrow cells that give rise to blood platelets. Recent evidence has implicated MKs in regulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) activity by the many cytokines and extracellular matrix components produced by these cells. Many hematologic malignancies are associated with MK abnormalities. The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by HSPC expansion and overproduction of mature blood cells. The acquired mutation JAK2V617F plays a central role in these disorders, but the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for MPN HSPC expansion are not fully understood, limiting the effectiveness of current treatments. MK hyperplasia is a hallmark feature of MPNs. We have shown that JAK2V617F-bearing MKs cause a murine myeloproliferative syndrome with HSPC expansion and increased marrow sinusoidal vascular density. In addition, we have demonstrated that the MPN vascular niche is important for JAK2V617F HSPC clonal expansion. Based on these initial results, we hypothesize that JAK2V617F-bearing MKs have altered hematopoietic niche function which not only enhances stem cell function directly but also affects the vascular niche to indirectly promote HSPC expansion in MPNs. The objective of the proposed work is to determine the physiological effects and the molecular mechanism(s) by which JAK2V617F-bearing MKs maintain and expand HSPCs in MPNs. In particular, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To study the effects of JAK2V617F-bearing MKs on stem cell function using both a transgenic murine model and human induced pluripotent stem cell lines; 2) To study the effects of JAK2V617F MKs on endothelial cell function in vitro, and the vascular niche and HSPC expansion in vivo. The role of thrombopoietin/MPL signaling in JAK2V617F MK niche function will be assessed; 3) To systemically investigate how JAK2V617F mutation affects megakaryocyte intracellular, membrane, and secreted proteins by quantitative proteomics. The function of selected proteins in HSPC function and vascular niche function will be explored. The long term goal of this research proposal is to identify the complex network of MK signaling in both normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis and develop additional, more effective therapeutic strategies in MPNs and potentially other hematologic malignancies.

"9218535","Altered regulation of signaling in response to persistent cellular stress is associated with a number of complex human diseases, including cardiovascular, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, genetic studies have shown that silencing of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) ameliorates many of the phenotypes manifest in mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis, cardiac hypertrophy and neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, ASK1 has been highlighted as a therapeutic target where antagonists are anticipated to provide significant benefit in multiple disease states. Under the auspices of GM103957 our research team has recently completed a high throughput ASK1 screening campaign and identified a series of small molecule inhibitors from six different structural classes. We have narrowed the focus of our medicinal chemistry efforts to three scaffolds and the goal of this proposal is to develop an in vivo active ASK1 small molecule probe. In the studies of Aim 1 we will use an iterative medicinal chemistry approach to optimize the potency, selectivity and in vivo properties of ASK1 inhibitors aimed at peripheral targets. In addition, to develop compounds with suitable brain penetrant properties we will apply a multi-parameter optimization strategy focusing on physical and chemical properties that are hallmarks of the majority of current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- approved CNS penetrant small molecule drugs. We will use structure based design to facilitate chemistry strategies and we will triage compounds through a battery of biochemical and cell-based assays as outlined in our research operating plan (ROP). As improved leads emerge, we will obtain enzyme selectivity for a select few, through full scale kinome (Reaction Biology) and receptor profiling (Riserca). For key leads we will also assess target engagement lifetime through biochemical and cell-based studies through measurement of ASK1 downstream substrate phosphorylation. Integrated into the ROP, we will also triage new compounds through a series of drug metabolism studies including assessment of in vitro microsomal stability, CYP450 inhibition, solubility, protein binding and P-glycoprotein efflux, with lead criteria integrated into the ROP for compound progression. In Aim 2, advanced leads for both peripheral and CNS exposures will be assessed in mice for adverse effects in acute dose range finding and 28-day toxicity studies. We will measure gross toxicity effect and vet scan analyses as well as TUNEL staining and histopathology of major organs. Finally, we will use inhibition of MKK6, JNK and p38 phosphorylation as in vivo reporters of ASK1 inhibition to quantify the maximum biological effective dose and through kinetic studies establish the PK/PD relationships of our lead in vivo probes. Our Multi-PI research team at the Scripps Florida campus of TSRI has both the expertise and infrastructure to perform these experiments, and we submit that the successful completion of our studies will identify a series of potent, selective and in vivo active molecular probes that will help define the role(s) that ASK1 plays in normal physiological processes as well as in disease states."
"9220295","The purpose of this grant is to define the role of endogenous stem cells in coronary collateral growth. This problem is significant because patients with ischemic heart disease, who have well developed collaterals show a lower incidence of sudden death, have smaller infarcts in the event of an occlusion, and demonstrate a better prognosis than patients with poorly developed collaterals. Currently, there is no evidence (pro or con) that endogenous stem cells are even involved in coronary collateral growth. One goal of the present application is to rectify this deficiency by establishing if stem cells participate in coronary collateral growth and then the mechanisms underlying this effect. Within this context we propose three aims. In the first aim, we will determine the factors produced by the myocardium and coronary vasculature that induce homing and reprogramming of bone marrow stem cells. In this aim, we will define which factors that are produced by the heart and/or growing vasculature activate stem cell homing to the heart and coronary collateral vasculature. Studies will be performed to examine gain and loss of function of 4 key factors to establish their roles in this adaptive, important process. We also will determine if these factors also induce reprogramming of bone marrow in addition to their effects of homing. Reprogramming is used in this context to suggest that these factors will increase the population of sub-classes of bone marrow cells that are committed to a vascular differentiation program. In the second aim, we will determine if stem cells that are recruited to the heart or to the growing vasculature are essential for the process of collateral growth. We will first establish the sub-types of stem cells that home to the heart and coronary vasculature. Then will we study if depletion or enrichment of these cells (during the creation of the chimeric model) will blunt or magnify, respectively, coronary collateral growth. After we have established the type of stem cells that are critical for coronary collateral growth, our studies will focus on the third aim to delineate the fate of the stem cells in the heart by addressing the question: Do they engraft in collateral arteries and differentiate into smooth muscle or endothelium? The overarching goal of these studies is to fill the current void in our understanding about the role of endogenous stem cells in the growth of coronary collaterals. If coronary collateral growth could be stimulated it would theoretically obviate the need for a bypass as a collateral is ?nature?s bypass.? Our overall approach is to use the experience of diverse research team in many disciplines?physiology, vascular biology, in vivo imaging, biochemistry, molecular biology?to address this problem."
"9222288","PROJECT SUMMARY Relevance. Leishmania parasites infect an estimated 12 million individuals, and no satisfactory treatments are yet available. This proposal will advance 3 scaffolds that have emerged from a phenotypic screen for development of leads towards novel effective orally-bioavailable drugs against leishmaniasis. Summary. A previous phenotypic screen against the disease-causing intracellular amastigote stage of Leishmania parasites has identified 3 chemical scaffolds with potent efficacy against amastigotes. Each hit compound exhibits nanomolar efficacy against amastigotes growing in tissue culture macrophages and has physical and chemical properties suggesting promise for development of a novel orally bioavailable drug. Analogs of each scaffold will be prepared and tested for efficacy against amastigotes in vitro, optimal absorption/distribution/metabolism/excretion/toxicity (ADMET) profiles, acceptable in vivo pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy in controlling disease in a murine model of visceral leishmaniasis. Following establishment of initial structure-activity relationships, an extensive medicinal chemistry program will be undertaken to develop analogs with the best overall properties for orally bioavailable drugs and to improve upon any potential deficits that emerge in the original hits. The efficacy of each scaffold against multiple species of Leishmania and against drug resistant field isolates will be tested at an early stage to ascertain the potential of each scaffold for applicability against a broad range of parasites causing distinct types of leishmaniasis and with or without pre-established resistance to other currently employed, albeit non-optimal, antileishmanial drugs. The rate of development of resistance will be monitored to ensure that leads that are pursued will be reasonably stable against emergence of resistance during use in the field. In association with an extensive medicinal chemistry program, in vivo pharmacokinetics and acute toxicity studies and ability to control visceral infections in mice and hamsters will be determined to arrive at the top synthetic leads originating from the original 3 hits. The overall objective is to develop several leads with highly promising characteristics for ultimate development of desperately needed novel and effective drugs against this widespread and poorly controlled parasitic disease."
"9224807","PROJECT SUMMARY Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and is characterized by aggressive growth, significant neurologic morbidity and eventually death. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the most widely accepted chemotherapy drug used to treat GBM, although its efficacy is limited in almost 50% of GBM patients. Therefore, novel treatment approaches, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors are being investigated for GBM. Immune checkpoints are immune inhibitory responses that are co-opted by tumor cells to down regulate T cell targeting of tumor antigens. Antibodies to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) allow for T cell activation against tumor neoantigens. This approach has had tremendous success in the treatment of solid tissue tumors and are now being tested for efficacy in GBM. This research proposal will investigate the mechanisms by which dose-modified TMZ may prime host T cells and tumor neoantigen expression to improve response to PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade. The rationale for this proposal include several factors. First, TMZ has been found to be advantageous when used in combination with immunotherapy for GBM due to conditioning of host immunity during the recovery from TMZ-induced lymphopenia. Second, immune checkpoint inhibitors enhance anti-tumor T cell responses against tumor neoantigens. This phenomenon can be leveraged since TMZ is known to be mutagenic and result in an increase burden of tumor neoantigens in malignant glioma. Third, combination TMZ and PD-1 blockade has a unique role for resistant phenotypes of GBM since these tumors have an increase in PD-L1 expression. This proposal will test the hypothesis that TMZ induces host immunologic and tumor genetic changes that will result in increased response to PD-1 blockade. This hypothesis will be tested by completing three aims. The first aim will determine the effects of TMZ dose and timing on host immunologic changes and the impact on PD-1 blockade efficacy for GBM. This aim will be tested by evaluating PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on host immune cells after various TMZ dosing strategies, and evaluating the effects of combining TMZ with PD-1 blockade on host immunologic function and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a syngeneic murine GBM model. The second aim will evaluate the utility of combining dose-modified TMZ and PD-1 blockade for resistant GBM tumors. This aim will utilize an MGMT-mediated TMZ resistant tumor model to determine the efficacy of combinatorial treatment for resistant phenotypes of GBM. The final aim will explore the mechanism by which dose-modified TMZ alters the tumor mico-environment and changes response to PD-1 blockade. The experiments will test the differences tumor genetic mutations and T cell clonality in tumors that respond to PD- 1 blockade compared to those that are resistant. Tumors that have been pre-treated with TMZ will also be tested to determine how post-treatment tumors may differ in response to immune checkpoint blockade independent of TMZ's effects on host immunity. At the completion of this proposal, the role of PD-1 blockade in combination with dose-modified TMZ for GBM and its efficacy for resistant phenotypes of GBM will be understood. These results have the potential for immediate impact for GBM patients as there are ongoing trials. The proposed research will be conducted by Dr. Rahman at the University of Florida Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program (UFBTIP). She is well-suited to successfully complete the proposed research as an academic neurosurgeon with sub-specialty training in neuro-oncology. She has completed research fellowships under the direction of Dr. Brent Reynolds and Dr. Quinones-Hinojosa in studying tumor stem cells in malignant glioma and overcoming treatment resistance. She has completed an NIH funded program in clinical investigation and obtained her Master's degree from the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Her primary mentor, Dr. Duane Mitchell, is the director of the UFBTIP, and has a strong record of extra-mural funding and success in investigating novel immunotherapeutic platforms for malignant brain tumors. Her co- mentors are Dr. Mark Gilbert and Dr. Amy Heimberger. Dr. Gilbert is chief of the Neuro-Oncology divison of the NCI. He has considerable clinical trial experience and lead an RTOG trial investigating dose-intensified TMZ for GBM and is currently leading a clinical trial exploring immune checkpoint blockade for GBM.

These safeguard mechanisms are universally lost in cancer cells; nevertheless, some causes for the checkpoint perturbation in cancer remain to be investigated. In addition, it remains a challenge to translate our knowledge in this field into practical cancer therapy. The main goal of this project is to develop novel therapeutics aiming at cancer checkpoint perturbation. In this proposal, first we will study how certain hotspot mutations of tumor suppressor p53 actively inhibit the checkpoint response. Second, we will determine whether some mutant p53 directly promotes DNA replication, and if so, by what mechanism(s). Third, we will identify small molecule inhibitors targeting these molecular events. Lastly, we propose a ?synthetic targeted therapy? strategy and leverage our new findings with the existing knowledge for cancer therapy. In our preliminary study, we have identified several lead inhibitors targeting this event. With the aid of one lead inhibitor we have obtained proof-of-concept to support feasibility of the proposed concept. In short, the proposed study will elucidate novel mechanisms of checkpoint perturbation and translate our discoveries into new therapeutics for a broad range of cancers."

"9225822","PROJECT SUMMARY ?-lactams comprise more than half of all antibacterials used globally for treatment of bacterial infections. Carbapenems, a sub-class of ?-lactams, are one of the most potent antibacterials available and often used as the last resort to treat infections that are not readily treatable with other antibacterials. Among ?-lactams, only carbapenems have therapeutically valuable activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the pathogen that causes tuberculosis) and Mycobacterium abscessus (an opportunistic pathogen that is highly resistant to most antibiotics and is emerging as a major cause of chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients). Older carbapenems such as meropenem and imipenem are used for treatment of infections with strains (of these mycobacteria) that are resistant to commonly used drugs. M. abscessus that is resistant to meropenem and imipenem, two powerful carbapenem drugs that are currently in clinical use, are routinely seen in US hospitals. Enhanced potencies of newer carbapenems such as doripenem and biapenem against these mycobacteria has resulted in an increasing use of these carbapenems for treatment of drug resistant forms of tuberculosis and Mycobacterium abscessus infections. It may only be a matter of time before strains of mycobacteria that are resistant to newer carbapenems emerge and thereby reduce the arsenal of antibiotics available to treat these infections. As a proactive measure, we propose to identify genetic mutations that confer mycobacteria resistance to doripenem and biapenem and determine the molecular mechanism of such resistance. Both clinically isolated carabpenem resistant strains and those generated in a controlled setting in the lab will be used to unveil genetic mutations and mechanism that confers resistance to carbapenems. Data from this study will facilitate development of new regimens that are urgently needed for treatment of drug resistant forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium abscessus infections."

"9238376","ABSTRACT Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by progressive decline in social behavior, emotion, and language. In behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), the most common FTD subtype, impairment in emotion and empathy are hallmark features that arise due to degeneration of emotion circuits. Although bvFTD begins in frontoinsula and anterior cingulate cortex, brain regions with known roles in visceromotor emotion generation and autonomic integration, the earliest signs of emotion system dysfunction are unknown. Approximately 40% of FTD cases are genetic and due to mutations in C9ORF72, GRN, and MAPT. Gene-positive mutation carriers offer a novel inroad into early emotion alterations in FTD because these individuals can be identified, studied, and followed during the asymptomatic, preclinical phase of disease and in the early symptomatic clinical phase. Changes in emotion physiology and behavior may occur early in the disease, reflect decline in emotion-relevant brain networks, and relate to affective symptoms. The proposed studies will help to characterize preclinical emotion deficits and their underlying circuitry and to determine whether these deficits are early indicators of decline in FTD. Anatomically-specific markers could be used to monitor symptom progression or to track disease-related dysfunction in clinical trials of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals. This proposal integrates laboratory measures of autonomic nervous system reactivity and facial expression with multi-modal neuroimaging techniques to identify how emotion systems change in the earliest stages of FTD. We will study 100 asymptomatic gene-positive subjects (50 C9ORF72+, 30 GRN+, and 20 MAPT+), 50 healthy controls (age-matched, gene-negative family members), 40 patients with bvFTD, and 40 older age-matched healthy controls at two annual research visits. Subjects will undergo laboratory testing of emotion in addition to a clinical work-up and structural and functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that objective measures of emotion physiology and behavior are direct readouts of vulnerable brain systems that can be measured noninvasively and track progression in the in preclinical and early symptomatic phase of FTD. We will address three key aims. In Aim 1, we will isolate the domains of emotional dysfunction in early FTD and determine how specific emotional deficits relate to behavioral and affective symptoms. In Aim 2, we will delineate the neural circuitry underlying identified emotional deficits in bvFTD and preclinical FTD. In Aim 3, we will identify laboratory measures that track emotion network decline over time in early FTD. This project has the potential to advance current models of the biological basis of emotion dysfunction in FTD and other clinical disorders that have similar emotional symptoms but lack obvious brain lesions."
"9236656","Project Summary: The goal of this proposal is to characterize a protein complex called the myddosome, which is uniquely assembled during Toll-like Receptor (TLR) signal transduction. The myddosome is one of several newly- defined receptor-proximal complexes that control innate immune signal transduction. Analogous complexes operate to control inflammasome assembly and the RIG-I and TNF receptor signaling pathways. A common feature of these complexes is that they operate as organelles that are assembled ?on-demand?, or upon ligand binding. As such, these complexes are only present in cells after microbes have been detected, and they may serve as critical hubs for coordinating downstream signaling enzyme activation. Despite the recognition that these organelles control innate immunity, we have little understanding of their regulation (or composition). Our proposal is founded on our recent discovery that the myddosome is assembled within macrophages upon treatment with TLR ligands. This finding is important because it had been unclear whether the myddosome is a pre-existing protein complex, or if it is assembled inducibly. The inducible assembly of this complex provided us with a tool to study its regulation, and we recently identified the TLR sorting adaptor TIRAP as the first regulator of myddosome assembly. These discoveries establish the myddosome as an important model to study receptor-proximal protein complexes that define the signaling pathways of the innate immune system. In this application, we propose to explore how known myddosome components interact to regulate TLR signaling in vitro and in vivo (Aim 1), to explore how a new myddosome component regulates TLR signaling (Aim 2), and to explore the mechanisms underlying several mutant myddosome components that cause mouse or human disease (Aim 3)."
"9238432","ABSTRACT: In healthy individuals, non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serotypes (NTS) are associated with gastroenteritis, a localized infection with low mortality manifesting as diarrhea, vomiting and intestinal cramping. However, certain populations have long been known to be at increased risk of developing life-threatening systemic infections, including the very young, those infected with HIV, and individuals undergoing cancer chemotherapy. In these individuals, NTS infections are associated with bacteremia, which can progress to meningitis and sepsis, often with a fatal outcome. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is currently an epidemic of disseminated NTS infections, for which epidemiological associations suggest that the principal underlying factors in children are young age, malaria and malnutrition. The basis for the effect of malnutrition on the outcome of Salmonella infection is poorly understood, and it is unknown which specific nutrient deficiencies are responsible. One of the most widespread micronutrient deficiencies in sub-Saharan African children is vitamin A deficiency. However, it is unknown whether vitamin A deficiency renders individuals susceptible to disseminated NTS infection, and if so, what the underlying mechanisms are. Given the high burden of Vitamin A deficiency in sub- Saharan Africa, this gap in knowledge is important to address, as it could provide an intervention to reduce development of disseminated NTS infection in young children. Our experimental evidence suggests that this micronutrient, via its active metabolite, retinoic acid, is essential for preventing replication of NTS at systemic sites. Further, we have shown that vitamin A-deficient mice are unable to generate mature neutrophils during NTS infection. Based on these preliminary results, the overall objectives of this application are to define Vitamin A-dependent immune mechanisms that control development of disseminated NTS infection, and to explore feasibility of vitamin A administration as a adjunct to antibiotic treatment of multidrug resistant NTS infection. The proposed work is highly innovative since specific mechanisms by which malnutrition affects susceptibility to invasive NTS disease are not known. The fact that conditions predisposing to disseminated NTS infections are understudied, even though they represent a major cause of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, makes the proposed work highly significant. We expect that the proposed research will provide important new insights into specific immune mechanisms that are important for controlling invasive NTS disease, that may extend to systemic infections with other bacteria as well. Therefore, the outcome of our proposed research is likely to provide novel paradigms of how underlying conditions in the host affect the outcome of an infection."
"9239303","Project Summary/Abstract This is a basic research study to analyze the earliest corneal changes induced by an obesogenic diet. We are attempting to understand the pathogenesis of an important corneal condition before it reaches the far advanced stages of the metabolic syndrome. There is a heightened concern given the epidemic of obesity in children. We will use diet-induced obesity and full thickness corneal epithelial abrasion in C57BL/6J mice for studies in vivo. The pathogenic effect of a diet is not simply determined by the nutritive content or quantity of the food source, but includes the timing of food intake as shown by recent investigations. Our studies will incorporate this expanded understanding of dietary influence to provide a database necessary for specific investigations into mechanisms by which an obesogenic diet compromises corneal function.Our most recent data in vivo reveal that 10 week old mice fed a high fat diet for 5 weeks show systemic inflammation with increased proinflammatory cytokines in blood as well as leukocyte activation and infiltration into adipose tissues. These mice exhibit significant reductions in nerve density in the epithelial branches of the corneal nerves, and when challenged, they exhibit abnormal wound healing after corneal abrasion with reduced regeneration of damaged corneal nerves. This extends our analysis of the inflammatory cascade activated by epithelial injury, defines corneal dysfunctions induced by an obesogenic diet, and seeks to define new targets for potential therapeutic intervention. Our most recent data in vitro reveal expression of receptors on human corneal epithelium for cytokines that in the mouse model promote epithelial healing. Specific Aim 1. Determine changes in the cornea induced by feeding mice an obesogenic diet, the reversibility of these changes, and the contributions of diet-induced systemic inflammation to these changes. Hypothesis 1: Dysregulated inflammation induced by an obesogenic diet contributes to corneal pathology. Specific Aim 2. Analyze the cascade of events required for normal corneal wound healing in mice fed an obesogenic diet that induces systemic inflammation, and determine if therapeutic intervention directed at restoring specific aspects of the healing cascade will promote efficient corneal wound healing. In addition, analyze the effects of specific interventions derived from the mouse studies on healing functions of human corneal epithelial cells in vitro. Hypothesis 2: The cascade of events required for normal corneal wound healing is disrupted by diet- induced systemic inflammation, thereby leading to poor corneal wounding healing. "
"9239718","SUMMARY Neovessel guidance in angiogenesis Vascular connectivity between adjacent vessel beds within and between tissue compartments is an essential aspect of any successful neovascularization process. To establish new connections, growing neovessels must locate other vascular elements during angiogenesis, often crossing matrix and other tissue-associated boundaries and interfaces. This is perhaps best highlighted in situations of tissue grafting (e.g. tissue free flaps) during which the vasculature of the graft must cross the graft-host tissue interface before connecting to the surrounding host circulation in order for the graft to survive. An inability for a tissue graft vasculature to connect to the host vasculature is the primary cause for tissue graft failure and necrosis. How growing neovessels traverse any tissue interface, whether part of the native tissue structure or secondary to a grafting procedure, is not known. In a series of preliminary experiments, we have determined that actively growing neovessels are unable to spontaneously cross a stroma-stroma interface during angiogenesis. Our published findings that tissue stromal biomechanics, specifically the biophysical aspects of the matrix, has a profound influence on the direction and branching of growing neovessels suggests that this interface is biomechanically incompatible with interface invasion. In addition, we have evidence that a sub-population of tissue-resident, stromal macrophages facilitates neovessel invasion of the stromal interface during angiogenesis through a VEGF-A-dependent process. Importantly, it appears that stromal cells need to migrate across the interface in order to promote interface invasion by the neovessels, suggesting that spatial gradients of VEGF-A are required. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that the graded angiogenic factor signals overcome the biomechanical barriers to directed angiogenesis caused by a stroma-stroma interface to promote interface neovascular invasion. The project will involve a combination of in vitro and computational models of angiogenesis across tissue-tissue boundaries to test this hypothesis and determine the mechanism by which stromal cells use VEGF-A signaling to regulate neovessel behavior in coordination with stroma biomechanical dynamics. These studies will provide new insights into a poorly understood aspect of vascular biology and tissue-vascular dynamics as well as create opportunities for therapeutic strategies to facilitate tissue healing, improving angiogenesis-based treatments, and tissue grafting/transplantation."
"9240357","PROJECT SUMMARY Tip60 protein, also known as Tat-interactive protein 60 kD, has been associated with induction of apoptosis, the DNA damage response (DDR), and cell-cycle senescence -- functions that are not mutually exclusive -- in cell-lines and in cancer cells. We have shown that Tip60 is a vital protein in the early embryo, and that it undergoes a curious isoprotein shift as neonatal cardiomyocytes (CMs) enter replicative senescence, an event that was recently shown to be induced by activation of the DDR in these cells. Although the heart is enriched in Tip60 protein, its role in this organ remains unclear. A recent study using cultured neonatal CMs revealed that ischemia increases Tip60 content and consequent apoptosis, effects that were prevented in Tip60- depleted cells. This result is consistent with our previous finding in heterozygous Tip60+/- mice showing that modest reduction of Tip60 protein in the adult heart caused release of CMs from cell-cycle arrest while inhibiting apoptosis. Taken together, these findings suggest that reduction or inactivation of Tip60 should enhance cardioprotection during ischemia, by suppressing CM death and permitting CM regeneration. To test this possibility we have developed an animal model in which Tip60 can be conditionally depleted. Using these mice we are addressing Specific Aims to test the twofold hypothesis that Tip60 is recruited to the telomere during early neonatal stages to induce the DDR and replicative senescence in CMs (Aim 1), and that depletion or inactivation of Tip60 in the adult heart confers cardioprotection from ischemia by inhibiting apoptosis and permitting CM regeneration (Aim 2). Experimentally, the first Aim will determine whether Tip60 becomes associated with the CM telomere at early neonatal stages, and whether its depletion reduces telomere length and disrupts the DDR while extending the window of neonatal CM proliferation. The second Aim will determine whether knockdown or transient inactivation of Tip60 in the ischemic adult heart inhibits apoptosis while permitting CM regeneration. Fulfillment of this hypothesis will advance our understanding of how the post- mitotic differentiated state of CMs is attained, while establishing Tip60 as a cardioprotective target. "
"9242205","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Long?s long-term goal is to improve patient- and family-centered outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure and their family members. This award will provide Dr. Long with essential research training to support her goal of becoming an independent investigator in the fields of palliative care and pulmonary and critical care medicine. Through this proposal Dr. Long will acquire new skills through four specific learning objectives designed to provide structured training in: 1) the role of mood disorders and the use of psychological outcomes in critical care research; 2) advanced epidemiologic and biostatistics techniques; 3) rigorous qualitative methods; and 4) the design and implementation of randomized trials. These objectives will be achieved through a career development plan that incorporates formal coursework, mentoring by experts in clinical outcomes research, and protected time to gain research experience in an exceptional learning environment. Research: Patients transferred from acute care to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure represent a population at high risk for poor clinical outcomes. These patients and their family members are likely to benefit from high-quality palliative care tailored to their needs. Palliative care is care focused on patients with serious illness with the goal of improving quality of life for both the patient and family by providing high-quality communication, symptom control, and emotional and spiritual support. Interventions to improve palliative care for patients transferred to the ICU for acute respiratory failure will require a substantial improvement in our understanding of the experiences and needs of patients and their family members. To date, studies of transfers from acute care to the ICU have focused on predictors of ICU transfer and mortality after ICU admission. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from these approaches. The primary objective of this K23 is to develop an understanding of the transfer process from a patient- and family-centered perspective in order to facilitate implementation of an intervention to improve palliative care for patients and their family members after patient transfer from acute care to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. To achieve this objective, Dr. Long will identify a cohort of patients transferred from acute care to the ICU for acute respiratory failure at two medical centers. With this cohort of patients and their family members, Dr. Long will: 1) conduct a prospective cohort study to identify elements of the transfer process associated with family member symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress; 2) use qualitative interviews of patients, family members, and clinicians to define the palliative care needs of patients and family members; and 3) conduct a pilot randomized trial to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an intervention to improve palliative care for patients and their family after patient transfer from acute care to the ICU. Environment: The University of Washington (UW) is an ideal setting for Dr. Long?s research training. UW is an outstanding biomedical research institution with a strong commitment to promoting the academic careers of promising investigators. The UW Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine is widely recognized for its Clinical Research Training Track and offers an intellectual environment that supports development of the skills necessary to achieve academic success. In addition to the resources provided within the Division, Dr. Long will also have the full support of the Cambia Palliative Care Center of Excellence at UW (directed by her primary mentor) and will have access to clinical research and biostatistical support through the UW School of Public Health and the Institute of Translational Health Sciences (the Clinical and Translational Science Award program at UW)."
"9244298","PROJECT SUMMARY Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a severe systemic autoimmune disease that leads to substantial morbidity and mortality in approximately 1 to 2 million Americans. A critical step in the pathogenesis of SLE is a breakdown in immune tolerance, which leads to a T-cell dependent and B-cell mediated disease. The resulting abundant pathogenic autoantibodies produced from the autoreactive B cells are a defining hallmark of SLE. The abrogation of disease in SLE-prone mice deficient in B cells, validates them as a viable therapeutic target. Indeed, several different B-cell directed therapies have been successful at attenuating progression including the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, and the anti-BAFF (BLyS) antibody belimumab ? the first FDA approved drug for SLE in decades. Despite these exciting developments, the limited clinical response in only half of the treated patients, calls for further exploration of the extent and efficacy of B cell depletion. Overall the goal of this application is to optimize a B-cell targeted therapeutic intervention for SLE using CAR-T cells. Adoptive immunotherapy with genetically modified T cells expressing Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) has shown remarkable therapeutic success in killing select cell populations. In particular, CARs that recognize CD19 have displayed impressive efficacy toward previously unresponsive B cell malignancies, and even plasma cell neoplasms. Here, we propose to employ our multiplexed mRNA-mediated T cell reprogramming technology to transiently eradicate aberrant, CD19-positive B cells. In comparison to antibodies, cellular immunotherapy has the advantages of active tissue penetration and no requirement for FcR-mediated uptake, which is blocked in SLE. In comparison to DNA reprogramming of T cells, an mRNA approach will permit a transient B cell depletion that can be deployed to match the relapsing-remitting nature of SLE. We will test the hypothesis that our mRNA approach will improve the functionality of the damaged SLE T cells by introducing mRNAs, coding multiple beneficial proteins in a single rapid step. Aim 1 will correct the propensity of SLE T cells to undergo apoptosis by reprogramming with a combination of mRNAs encoding an anti-apoptotic protein in addition to the CD19 CAR. Aim 2 will improve SLE T cell metabolic stability with an mRNA encoding a growth stimulatory cytokine that is diminished in SLE in addition to the CD19 CAR. Aim 3 will reprogram SLE T cells with the CD19 CAR and a chemokine receptor that will direct the CAR T cells to B cell rich areas. We will test these individual factors with complementary studies in early and established murine SLE as well as in lymphocytes from patients with SLE. Success of a CAR-T approach in SLE would be novel for autoimmune disease therapy and would lead to many potential opportunities for therapeutic exploration."
"9242928","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Thousands patients with end-staged liver failure die every year world-wide due to the lack of donor livers. Our long-term goal is to improve the usage of the livers from older donors to ameliorate the shortage of donor livers. Toward this goal, we have found that by treating old mice with ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) protocol, we can restore the regenerative capability in the livers of 24-month old mice, the equivalent of 70-year old humans. Based on these results, we hypothesized that old hepatocytes, once reactivated by GABA, can readily regenerate in response to a mitogenic stimulus. We will test our hypothesis in the following specific aims: (1) Identify that hepatocytes in the livers of GABA-treated aged mice readily regenerate within 6 h to 8 h in addition to the improved regeneration at the usual 36 h following mitogenic stimulus; (2) Identify GABA-A and -B receptors and their individual roles in hepatocellular reactivation providing impetus for hepatocyte regeneration in livers of aged mice; we will use selective agonists and antagonists and hepatocellular specific genetic deletion of each receptor type in delineating the role and contribution of the receptors to liver regeneration in aged mice; (3) To corroborate that the unused livers from human donors, after being treated with GABA, will have augmented ability to regenerate upon mitogenic stimulus. The rationale for the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms by which GABA makes old hepatocytes functionally young again which will provide a mechanism-based foundation of safety and usefulness of GABA as we translate this knowledge clinically to make aged livers becoming usable donor livers. The results from the proposed work will improve the liver-related health and will effectively expand donor pool for transplantation."
"9244614","Summary/Abstract Aberration of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypes cause structural defects and impaired mechanical properties of artery wall, leading to artery stiffness, which correlates with high blood pressure and is an independent risk factor for the resistant hypertension. It is well-known that arterial wall stiffens with aging. In addition to hypertension, vascular aging is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases including coronary artery disease, stroke and heart failure. However, the factors and mechanisms that control vascular aging, especially SMC aging and artery stiffness, remain largely unknown. Our exciting preliminary data demonstrate that Smad2 plays a critical role in maintaining SMC and vascular homeostasis and blood pressure. SMC-tissue specific deficiency of Smad2 (Smad2sm-/-) in mice causes alterations in elastin and collagen content and structure in the vessel wall, resulting in decreased artery distensibility, increased pulse pressure (indicator of artery stiffness), and increased mean artery pressure. The vascular wall remodeling/stiffness in Smad2 SMC- deficient mice appears to be caused by a premature SMC aging with an elevation in p53 level. In fact, the increase in p53 level along with the decrease in Smad2 expression in artery SMC correlates with the aging in mouse and human. Importantly, the correlation of decreased Smad2 with increased p53 is also closely associated with the onset of hypertension in human. These data strongly support a novel hypothesis that Smad2 maintains vascular homeostasis and blood pressure by inhibiting p53 expression and/or activity in SMC. Using primary culture of SMCs, in vivo Smad2 and p53 SMC-specific knockout mouse models combining with molecular, cellular, histological, and pharmacological approaches, we will 1) test if Smad2 is essential for maintaining the vascular wall elasticity and blood pressure homeostasis; 2) elucidate the mechanism by which Smad2 regulates SMC homeostasis through inhibiting p53 expression/activity; and 3) determine if blockade of p53 attenuates Smad2 deficiency-caused artery stiffness and hypertension. Successful completion of the proposed study will establish a novel mechanism regulating SMC aging and blood pressure homeostasis. It will also allow us to identify potential novel approaches that may be used to develop effective therapeutics for treating aging or artery stiffness-related hypertension."
"9245534","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Nearly one-third of the world population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This reservoir contributes towards an increasing incidence of tuberculosis, with about 11 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths every year. The emergence of multi-drug resistant strains combined with low diagnostic and therapeutic coverage in many developing countries, has worsened the disease burden caused by TB. The profound success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in causing disease depends on its ability to successfully utilize the host?s cellular machineries including the lipid biosynthesis pathway to subvert the immune system. Our understanding of these processes especially that of the host lipid biology in the context of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is limited. The aim of the proposed work is to study the role of host?s lipid biosynthesis in the entry, replication and killing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For this purpose, individual knockout macrophage cell lines that lack genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipids will be generated using CRISPR/Cas9-technology. Understanding these pathways or processes essential for the life cycle of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is crucial, as they represent potential targets for new therapeutics."
"9245274","Project Summary Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease caused by species of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), remains one of the major public health problems worldwide, with nine million new cases and about 1.5 million deaths each year. In addition, improper use of antibiotics in chemotherapy of drug-susceptible TB patients results in anti-TB drug resistance, which complicates TB care and control. About 95% of lethal cases occur in resource-limited high-burden countries, where there is a lack of diagnostic capacity. Undiagnosed or improperly diagnosed patients develop more severe disease and remain a source of infection for the wider public. At the same time, efficient point-of-care (POC) TB diagnostics in low resource settings can improve health outcomes by facilitating more effective treatment, reducing the patient dropout rate and limiting spread of the infection. The tests of such format are lacking for drug susceptibility testing (DST) of TB. Therefore, new diagnostic tools that are simple enough to be used ?in the field? and still be able to correctly diagnose for TB and identify drug-resistance are needed. The goal of this high-risk, high-reward exploratory project is to take advantage of the recent advancements in DNA nanotechnology and molecular sensing to significantly improve diagnostics capabilities for TB. We propose to develop POC-compatible highly selective sensors based on cascades of deoxyribozymes with visual signal readout for detection of active pulmonary TB and testing for mutations conferring multidrug resistance (MDR). Visual deoxyribozyme cascade sensors will be able to produce highly reliable results within the period of usual doctor's visit, and be able to detect less than 104 cells of MTC species without the need for expensive equipment. We will design cascade sensors targeting MTC rRNA and fragments of the genes containing point mutations conferring resistance to the most potent first-line anti-TB drugs rifampicin and isoniazid. We will optimize the assay using isolated bacterial nucleic acids, whole bacterial cells and bacteria-spiked human sputum samples. We will compare the assay with acid fast smear microscopy and culture-based tests, which are currently used for TB detection and DST in the resource-limited settings. The technology proposed here is promising for diagnostics of TB, as well as other pathogens, particularly in resource-constrained high-burden countries, which may revolutionize healthcare worldwide."

"9246701","Project Summary/Abstract Exercise is an effective intervention for both the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases, but the mechanistic underpinnings of the health benefits of exercise remain incompletely defined. Recent work highlights the importance of inter-organ circuits in mediating healthful exercise responses. We identified ?- aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) as a novel small molecule ?myokine? that increases the expression of brown adipocyte-specific genes in vitro, and improves glucose disposal and decreases weight gain in mice. In humans, plasma BAIBA concentrations are increased with chronic exercise and demonstrate a strong inverse association with metabolic risk factors. Our team has also been a leader in characterizing within-tissue responses to exercise and dietary interventions. These experiences, coupled with the high translational relevance of the research problem, motivate us to take a systems wide approach to studying the health benefits of exercise in humans and animal models. To this end, we have formed a multi-institutional, multi-omics center to engage in collaborative studies under the aegis of the NIH MoTrPAC initiative. Our core builds upon ongoing collaborations between teams at Duke, Harvard and the Broad Institute with complementary strengths in metabolomics and proteomics technologies and decades of experience in cardiometabolic research. The core will provide a deep menu of analytical tools for targeted and non-targeted metabolomics, protein profiling, and the analysis of key protein post-translational modifications. Each of the core components has a track record for handling large sample sets, and is well- poised to analyze the expected tens of thousands of tissue and blood samples generated by a national consortium of investigators studying exercise interventions in animal and human cohorts. An additional distinction of our team is the ability to integrate new findings from MoTrPAC with previously collected genomic, proteomic and metabolomic data from large human cohorts. We hypothesize that integrating the metabolomic and proteomic profiles of human tissues and blood during exercise with genetics and detailed human phenotyping will provide novel insights into the inter-organ circuits and within-organ responses that mediate the salutary effects of exercise. All of the primary data generated by this multi- disciplinary proposal will be made rapidly available to the scientific community via a novel information portal at the Broad Institute. Importantly, all four leaders of this proposed core (Carr, Clish, Gerszten and Newgard) have strong track records in the use of metabolomics and proteomics tools for the identification of novel cardiometabolic regulatory and disease mechanisms. These experiences position this proposed core as one that can have maximal impact on the generation, analysis, and interpretation of molecular profiling data."

Toxicity testing is an important aspect of public health research in that it serves to identify chemicals that are hazardous to human health. Proper chemical analyses are required to ensure that, in toxicity studies, the test species are exposed to the prescribed chemicals at the specified dose concentrations. This contract contributes to the ability of toxicity studies to provide evidence of heightened cancer risk along with other toxicological outcomes, by providing characterization of the chemicals studied, confirmation of the dose levels administered, and internal dose determinations. This information is critical to evaluation of toxicity tests and development of sound, scientific conclusions about the potential toxicity of the study chemical in the test species and ultimately supports the risk assessment efforts of National Toxicology Program and other federal agencies. With internal dose information provided by this contract, extrapolations to humans can be made so that the public can be adequately informed about risk factors arising from exposure to studied chemicals."
"9246770","PROJECT ABSTRACT It is well established that regular physical activity, including endurance (aerobic) exercise training and resistance exercise training has important effects on the prevention and treatment of numerous chronic diseases. Determining the molecular mechanisms or ?map? of the exercise response has become an important focus of biomedical research. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Exercise in Humans Consortium (MoTrPAC) will define the molecular footprint that underlies the enormously beneficial effects of exercise in humans. This application is for a Preclinical Animal Study Site (PASS). This Investigative team has the potential to play an important role in the design and execution of the MoTrPAC project based on our extensive experience and strong record of collaboration. The aims of Phase 1 are: 1) To provide outstanding intellectual contributions and advice, and work in a highly cooperative and collegial manner with the other members of the Steering Committee, to design the best possible experiments for the PASS studies. 2.) To use the wide variety of expertise in the laboratory to carry out highly controlled and accurate exercise studies and collection of animal tissue and blood samples. For this Phase, the rat has been identified as the animal model that most closely mimics humans and the most feasible to study. An emerging concept in exercise biology is that physical exercise activates tissue-to-tissue communication throughout the organism, and this tissue cross- talk can mediate some of the beneficial effects of exercise on health. The goal of Phase 2 is to carry out mechanistic studies to investigate newly and Consortium-identified circulating molecules involved in exercise- regulated tissue cross-talk, including identification of the function and source of the molecules. Skeletal muscle-derived myokines and adipose tissue-derived adipokines will be studied. The Specific Aims of Phase 2 of this project are: 1) To identify novel exercise-regulated adipokines and myokines based on data generated by MoTrPAC; 2) To determine the physiological targets and functions of candidate myokines and adipokines; 3) To determine if exercise-regulated myokines and adipokines can have beneficial effects on metabolic health in normal and metabolically compromised animals; and 4) To determine if putative exercise-induced myokines and adipokines are secreted from skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. These highly innovative studies will dramatically increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which physical activity improves human health and may provide the basis for future therapeutics to combat many chronic diseases."
"9246861","Abstract Exercise is a powerful and pleiotropic physiological stimulus that helps prevent many chronic diseases and is used as a therapeutic for disease. While the beneficial effects of exercise are extensively acknowledged there is still very little understood about the molecular transducers of the systems-wide effects. The goal of this University of Florida Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Preclinical Animal Study Sites application (UF PASS) is to conduct experiments in animals that will provide tissues/blood (i.e. biospecimens) to the Chemical Analysis Sites for identification of molecular transducers induced by defined models of physical activity from tissues that cannot be obtained from humans as well as to conduct mechanistic studies that can support screening of novel transducers to quickly move the field forward. In Phase 1, UF PASS proposes to collect biospecimens for the Chemical Analysis sites following endurance (run-training) or resistance exercise protocols on male and female Fischer 344xBrown Norway rats (F344-BN) at three different ages. To better capture the dynamics of the exercise/adaptation responses we propose to: 1) Collect biospecimens at 5 selected timepoints following an acute bout of exercise on nave and trained rats; 2) Collect biospecimens following short duration training (after 5 bouts) and 3) Collect biospecimens following long-term (8 weeks) training. For Phase 2, our hypothesis is that factors released from muscle (i.e. myokines) are the molecular transducers that function throughout the system to improve the well-established stress tolerance. The goal of these studies will be to employ high throughput screening technologies to test up to 1500 myokines. We will then use secondary screening techniques to test 100 candidates from which we will select up to 3 candidates for in vivo testing. The results of the experiments in Aim 3 will provide molecular evidence identifying a set of transducers, released from muscle, that are necessary for exercise induced systemic health. The goals of the UF PASS will be pursued by the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Center Coordination Phase. Specific Aim 2: Phase 1 Studies. To perform endurance and resistance exercise using male and female F344BN rats at 3-4, 16-18, and 27-29 mo. Specific Aim 3: Phase 2 Studies. The goal in Aim 3 is to test myokines as the exercise transducers for improved stress tolerance."
"9247687","Summary Despite recent advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, heart failure (HF) continues to be the leading cause of death in the U.S., and the rest of the western world. Therefore, our long-term goal is the development of new, minimally invasive tissue-engineered therapies for the treatment of ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. While cell therapies have been extensively studied for the treatment of MI and HF, meta-analyses of initial cell therapy trials suggest only a modest effect on cardiac function. More recently acellular biomaterials have shown great promise in providing similar or greater functional benefit without the complications associated with cell delivery. Injectable biomaterials that stimulate endogenous repair are an attractive alternative since potential therapies could still be delivered minimally invasively via catheter, yet could be off the shelf and have significantly reduced costs compared to cell products. The PI's lab developed the first cardiac specific injectable hydrogel, which is derived from decellularized porcine myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) and is deliverable via a transendocardial injection catheter. This material is liquid at room temperature and forms a porous and fibrous scaffold upon injection, which we have shown promotes endogenous cell infiltration and cardiac repair in subacute MI models (injection 1-2 weeks post-MI). This initial work lead to the recent initiation of a clinical trial in post-MI patients. In pre-clinical studies, we showed that injection of the material alone post-MI results in decreased borderzone cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis, activation of potential endogenous progenitor cells, a pro-remodeling vs. pro-inflammatory environment, increased neovascularization, reduced fibrosis, a shift in CM metabolism, and increased cardiac muscle, yielding significant improvements in both regional and global cardiac function. Under our previous R01, we were successful in beginning to decipher mechanism of action of this material as well as push forward with translation into patients. In this renewal, we will continue to pursue both basic and translation research goals. We propose to continue to better understand the mechanism of action of the material in the context of subacute MI, specifically answering the remaining question of how the hydrogel increases cardiac muscle. Given the strong need for therapies for acute MI, ischemic HF, and nonischemic HF, we are also proposing studies to enable translation of this material into other patient populations. We hypothesize that the myocardial matrix hydrogel, which contains cardiac specific cues, results in the generation of new cardiac muscle in the context of MI, and that the material can be delivered alone to improve cardiac function in acute MI, as well as ischemic and nonischemic HF.

"9247569","Myofibroblast activation of Valvular Interstitial Cells (VICs) is considered to be a primary driver of valvular fibrosis and stenosis. For this reason, the external cues that act to control the myofibroblast phenotype of VICs have been topics of considerable attention in the field. Increasing evidence suggests that beyond receptor-mediated activation of VICs by soluble growth factors, physical cues from the matrix play a critical role in this process. Unfortunately, traditional methods used to culture VICs inherently leads to their myofibroblast activation, such that it becomes difficult to determine the effects of environmental stiffness on activation and especially de-activation. To address this issue, our group has demonstrated that unique hydrogel materials can be used to create soft, non-activating substrates for VIC culture that allow VICs to maintain a phenotype that more closely resembles that of freshly isolated cells. Now, we aim to examine how matrix stiffness in combination with pro-inflammatory cytokines influence the VIC fibroblast-to- myofibroblast transition, the epigenetic changes that may occur to these cells over time, and the pathways in matrix signaling that might be useful in reversing the pathogenic myofibroblast phenotype. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use a combinatorial approach to study the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on VIC phenotypes as a function of microenvironmental stiffness 2) Identify the effects of mechanical and inflammatory cues on the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and its reversal using hydrogels with dynamically tunable mechanical properties, and 3) Discover new molecular targets for therapeutics to temper pathogenic VIC myofibroblast activation under inflammatory conditions. Together, work completed within each of these Aims will provide unique insight into the progression of fibrotic aortic valvular stenosis. The creation of tunable cell culture platforms will allow us to answer questions about differences between reversible (transient, wound healing state) and irreversible (persistent, pathogenic state) VIC myofibroblasts that cannot be adequately addressed with traditional methods. Subsequent analysis of the signaling pathways and genes will be used to identify new targets with therapeutic potential to reverse VIC activation and treat valve disease. Moreover, successful completion of these Aims should be of general interest to the field of medicine, as mechanisms of fibrosis are likely shared among most fibrosis-related diseases."
"9249300","Abstract  Our laboratory was the first to demonstrate unequivocally that several isoforms of small conductance Ca2+- activated K+ channels (SK or KCa2 channels) underlie Ca2+-activated K+ current (IK,Ca) in cardiomyocytes. Indeed, interests in cardiac SK channels are fueled by recent studies suggesting the possible roles of SK channels in human atrial fibrillation (AF) and up-regulation of SK channels in heart failure (HF). Therefore, SK channel may represent a novel therapeutic target for cardiac arrhythmias.  Even though the activation and trafficking of SK channels are Ca2+-dependent, the Ca2+ source remains undefined. In addition, the Ca2+-dependence of SK channels is inextrictably linked to calmodulin (CaM), whose mutations have been shown to be associated with human arrhythmias. Since CaM is ubiquitous, it is paramount to disentangle the web of CaM-regulated ion channels from the roles of SK channels in calmodulinopathy. Moreover, SK channel expression is upregulated in HF but the exact mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Blockade of SK channels has been shown to be both anti-arrhythmic and proarrhythmic in various models. These aforementioned challenges are the premises of the present proposal. Thus, the essence of this proposal is to deploy innovative imaging, functional analyses, and molecular modeling to address successively the regulation of cardiac Ca2+-activated K+ channels in normal and failing cardiac myocytes."

"9233717","Project Summary Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in host defense against pathogens is important for the development of novel anti-infective therapies. Type I interferon (IFN?/?) and type II interferon (IFN?) are potent cytokines involved in the regulation of multiple cellular processes, including anti-viral, anti-tumor, and immunomodulatory functions. IFNs signal through the JAK-STAT pathways to regulate the transcriptional activation of over 2000 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Studies from many laboratories have identified the important role of a number of ISGs in host defense against pathogens, including the IFN?-inducible 65kD guanylate-binding protein (GBP) family. However, the molecular mechanism that selectively regulates the induction of anti-infective ISGs during host defense is poorly understood. The Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of proteins are methylcytosine dioxygneases that function to facilitate DNA demethylation through regulating cytosine hydroxymethylation. Previous studies have demonstrated that TET proteins play important roles in the regulation of stem cells and tumorigenesis. My laboratory has recently discovered an unexpected role of TET2 in host defense. We showed that Tet2 deficiency results in enhanced protection against bacterial and viral pathogens, and that TET2 specifically affects the induction of the Gbp genes in response to IFN? stimulation. This application is to explore a previously unrecognized role of TET2 in in IFN signaling and host defense against pathogenic infection. We propose to test a novel hypothesis that TET2 functions to suppress host immunity through the selective regulation of a subset of IFN-mediated gene transcription. Specifically, we will study the molecular basis of TET2-mediated regulation of Gbp genes in host defense, and we will further characterize the role of TET2 in pathogenic infections using animal models. These timely studies, if successfully completed, will uncover a novel molecular mechanism in host defense, and will advance our ability to design more effective anti- infective therapies."
"9235080","ABSTRACT Cell therapy holds promise for CNS disorders. This is suggested by clinical benefits in some Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who received transplantation of human fetal mesencephalic tissues to replace degenerated midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons. The ability to produce functional neurons efficiently from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) expands the prospect of cell therapy. However, cell therapy for many neurological conditions faces major hurdles. In particular, transplanted neurons often fail to reconstruct a functional circuit that is specific to lost function. In PD, DA neurons are often transplanted directly into the striatum, rather than their home location substantial nigra. Consequently, the grafted cells and their repaired circuit lose appropriate inputs for functional modulation. To address these critical issues, we will reconstruct the nigra-striatal circuit by cell transplantation to the nigra in a PD model mouse and determine if the grafted human mDA neurons project specifically to the striatum to form functional circuit and if the reconnection is sped up by regulating graft activity (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will explore to regulate the neural circuit repaired by transplanted cells by expressing active or inhibitory form of DREADD (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) in hPSCs so that the therapeutic outcomes may be refined (Aim 2). Information gained from this study will be instrumental for restoring and regulating neural circuitry in PD and other neurological conditions."
"9237414","The arterial microenvironment at atherosclerosis-prone sites primes the endothelium for activation by a variety of systemic atherogenic factors, in part through enhanced endothelial NF-?B expression at sites of disturbed flow. Additionally, disturbed flow patterns are permissive for subendothelial matrix remodeling, and work from my group and others have shown that fibronectin deposition enhances the endothelial proinflammatory response to both disturbed flow and oxidized LDL. Current research into the mechanisms of fibronectin deposition at atheroprone sites focus on altered fibronectin expression. However, our preliminary data show that oxidized LDL elicits robust fibronectin deposition driven by dynamic talin1-dependent integrin activation without altered fibronectin expression, suggesting a novel model for atherogenic matrix remodeling. In the previous grant period, we demonstrated that integrin-specific signaling differentially mediates flow and oxidized LDL induced NF-?B signaling and proinflammatory gene expression, and our published and preliminary data show that inhibiting or deleting endothelial fibronectin-binding integrins reduces early atherogenic inflammation in vivo. Despite the importance of integrin-mediated NF-?B activation in multiple systems, the signaling pathways linking integrins to NF-?B activation remain relatively unknown. The I?B kinase IKK? activates canonical NF-?B signaling, and both flow and oxLDL stimulate IKK?-dependent NF-?B activation. Nonproteolytic ubiquitination (K63-linked and Met1-linked ubiquitin chains) drives the formation of signaling microdomains that classically couple IKK? to its upstream activators through the recruitment of ubiquitin-binding proteins, such as obligatory IKK?-binding partner IKK?. Our preliminary data demonstrate robust K63 ubiquitination in integrin adhesion complexes associated with IKK? targeting, and blunting K63 ubiquitination prevents oxLDL-induced NF-?B activation. In addition, we show that endothelial cells lacking fibronectin-binding integrins display reduced responsiveness to proinflammatory stimuli, suggesting that integrin signaling contributes to endothelial priming associated with the atheroprone phenotype. The research outlined in this proposal will test the hypothesis that dynamic integrin activation in endothelial cells drives fibronectin deposition and integrin-specific signaling to promote endothelial activation. We will accomplish this by examining the mechanisms regulating talin1-dependent integrin activation and fibronectin deposition in vitro and in vivo using the endothelial talin1 L325R transgenic mice deficient for integrin activation (Aim 1). We will delineate the mechanisms regulating integrin-dependent nonproteolytic ubiquitination in IKK?/NF-?B activation and characterize how fibronectin-binding integrins prime the endothelial cells for activation (Aim 2). Lastly, we will utilize inducible endothelial-specific deletion models to determine whether endothelial fibronectin-binding integrins contribute to endothelial priming in vivo, to atherosclerotic plaque progression following early matrix remodeling, and to flow-induced arteriogenic inflammation (Aim 3).

"9237367","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury with very high mortality and few therapeutic options. Patients with acute lung injury are often initially treated with oxygen by mask, and if the disease progresses they will be mechanically ventilated with high levels of oxygen (typically 50 to 100%). Although both mechanical ventilation and hyperoxia (HO) can independently cause injury, the combination of the two has been shown to accelerate and cause more extensive lung injury than either condition alone. There is a critical need for understanding these mechanisms in order to develop strategies to reduce or prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The long term goal is to improve understanding of the mechanisms by which the combination of exposure to high levels of oxygen (HO) and overdistention (or stretch) of lungs contributes to VILI. The overall objective of this application is to demonstrate that apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1 (ASK1) is a central mediator of HO-induced exacerbation of VILI. The central hypothesis of this application is that HO-induced activation of ASK1 promotes VILI by enhancing cell death through p38- mediated apoptosis and increased inflammation, and by preventing cell survival through suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase- (ERK1/2)-mediated pathways. These mechanisms will be investigated using ASK1-deficient mice in a clinically relevant mouse model with pre-exposure to HO (24 hr) followed by mechanical ventilation with high tidal volume. We will also investigate these mechanisms in mice with lung injury caused by LPS or influenza virus prior to exposure to HO and mechanical ventilation in order to model the clinical scenario of ARDS. In addition primary cultures of alveolar type II epithelial cells and macrophages, as well as cell lines with knockdown of ASK1 and other key mediators, will be subjected to HO and cyclic stretch. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that HO/VILI is exacerbated by ASK1-induced activation of p38 that promotes stretch-induced apoptosis via inhibition of survivin and through activation of the inflammasome. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ASK1 activation prevents ERK1/2-mediated pro-survival pathways, including expression of survivin and Nrf2-mediated production of antioxidant enzymes. These studies will elucidate new signaling pathways involved in HO-induced exacerbation of VILI."

"9240392","Project Summary  Transendothelial migration (TEM) of leukocytes is a critical step in the inflammatory response, since most of the damage due to unwanted inflammation occurs after leukocytes cross blood vessels. TEM is regulated by molecules such as platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM, CD31) and CD99 expressed on both the leukocytes and at endothelial cell (EC) borders. On EC, these molecules also reside in an interconnected membrane reticulum of membrane called the lateral border recycling compartment (LBRC) that is ?targeted? to the site of TEM. Homophilic interactions between leukocyte PECAM and EC PECAM control the start of diapedesis. Homophilic interactions between leukocyte CD99 and EC CD99 are important for the completion of TEM. In this proposal, we will build on the knowledge gained in the last cycle to test the overarching hypothesis that these leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions recruit the LBRC to promote efficient TEM and that their distribution on the leukocyte is responsible for the sequence in which leukocyte/EC interactions trigger signaling pathways that promote TR to facilitate TEM.  In Aim I we will test the hypothesis that the distribution of PECAM and CD99 on the leukocyte is responsible for the sequential regulation of TEM. Preliminary data show that during TEM, PECAM is concentrated in the front of the leukocyte and CD99 at the rear. We suspect that this concentration is critical to clustering PECAM and CD99 on the endothelial cell. We will test our hypothesis in vitro by switching the cytoplasmic domains of PECAM and CD99 to reverse their distribution on the leukocyte and determine whether this affects the order in which they regulate TEM. We will also test whether they regulate TEM sequentially in vivo using spinning disc confocal intravital microscopy to study the process in real time.  CD99L2 (L2) is a molecule we recently discovered to play an important role in TEM. In Aim II we will identify how L2 functions to regulate TEM. L2 is diffusely distributed on the leukocyte surface. We will test the hypothesis that it regulates a step between those regulated by PECAM and CD99 using the ?sequential block? assay that we have developed and published. We will identify the signaling pathways used by L2 to carry out its function and determine whether it plays a significant role in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We will study response to I/R injury by intravital microscopy in the cremaster muscle circulation over hours and in a mouse model of myocardial infarction over days.  We recently identified the long-sought mechanism by which endothelial cell CD99 signals in TEM. It resides in a multimolecular complex that activates protein kinase A (PKA). In Aim III we will identify the CD99 signaling pathways downstream of PKA. Based on preliminary data we hypothesize that Rac1 is a critical downstream effector of PKA to promote targeted recycling. We will test the role of CD99 in I/R injury in the two models as above."
"9238576","Project Summary/Abstract The applicants' long-term aim is to gain insights into mechanisms and therapies of heart failure (HF). In this study, we will examine the way that cellular architecture and calcium (Ca) handling proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling are modified in human HF. Further studies will be performed on patients that undergo implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) to establish (1) a microstructural basis for functional remodeling in HF cells, and (2) if microstructure of HF cells can predict long-term sustainability of cardiac recovery by LVAD unloading. Our studies are motivated by the finding that nearly 20% of our patients respond to unloading with cardiac recovery and that recovery in patients required integrity of the transverse tubular system (t-system) before unloading. In Specific Aim 1, three-dimensional reconstructions of the t- system and associated ryanodine receptor (RyR) clusters will be obtained with scanning confocal microscopy. We will investigate ventricular tissues from normal donor hearts and hearts from patients in end stage HF. The studies are based on the hypothesis that structures in control myocytes are altered in HF cells. We found that human cells exhibit a very different phenotype in HF than previously described in animal models. In particular, we found that the t-system remodels to axial, sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma in HF. We will then establish the extent to which RyR clusters are not associated with sarcolemma (primarily t-system) for control and HF cells. Findings in intact tissue will be compared with isolated cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will study the changes in Ca transients that produce contractions as a consequence of alterations in the t-system and proteins associated with EC coupling. This includes measuring Ca movements in normal and HF cells with rapid two-dimensional confocal microscopy. We will test the hypothesis that Ca transients in HF are disorganized compared to control. We will measure L-type Ca currents and calculate the gain of EC coupling. We expect that remodeling of the t-system leads to decreased gain in HF cells. Also, we will measure Ca extrusion from the cell and Ca uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and relate those to t-system remodeling. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that alterations that we observe at the time of LVAD implantation predict cardiac recovery. Integrity of t-system and improvement of functional properties induced by LVAD unloading are expected to underlie cardiac recovery. We will investigate whether LVAD unloading can reverse effects of HF on protein densities, t-system, Ca release, gain of EC coupling and decline of Ca transients. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that microstructural alterations observed at time of LVAD implantation predict long-term sustainability of recovery in patients undergoing LVAD explantation. Together, the proposed studies constitute a crucial step towards understanding effects of human HF and LVAD unloading at the cellular level. Clinical applications of our results and conclusions include the identification of patients that are likely to be sustained responders based on cardiac biopsies that are acquired at time of LVAD implantation."
"9245322","Abstract Improving the accumulation of drugs in cancer and minimizing their exposure to other parts of the body have been pursued to achieve targeted cancer therapy. The key challenge lies in the identification of `unique' receptors in cancer area and development of corresponding targeting ligands. Several types of targeting ligands including folate, small peptides, and aptamers have been developed. However, their corresponding receptors are rarely cancer specific and the binding affinity between protein receptors and these ligands is relatively low. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been developed as by far the most promising targeting technology. Advances in this area have made it possible to create a mAb specific to almost any extracellular/cell surface protein, and several cancer-exclusive proteins have been identified. Despite being the most successful targeting ligands in clinic currently, mAbs suffer from multiple drawbacks such as high production cost, severe immunogenicity, receptor saturation, and poor solid tumor penetration. In addition, each mAb developed only works well for certain types of cancer because the targeted protein receptors vary from cancer to cancer. Completely different from conventional targeting strategies, we propose a general cancer targeting strategy making use of cell surface sugars as receptors. By selectively labeling cancer cell surface with azido groups through intravenously injected Ac3ManAzO-P which can be activated by histone deacetylase and cathepsin L, cancer cells could be well targeted by dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-drug conjugates via efficient copper-free click chemistry. We have designed a library of sugar derivatives that could label cell surface with azido groups only in the presence of specific triggers. One of these sugar compounds, E-S, Enzymatically-responsive Sugar, is activated only in the co-presence of histone deacetylase and cathepsin L, thus possessing excellent selective labeling capability. By optimizing the structure and property of E-S, we may achieve selective labeling of cancer cells in vivo and develop this targeting strategy into a potentially clinically applicable technology for cancer treatment."
"9245367","Carol E. Schrader Regulation of Antibody Diversity by AP Endonucleases Project Summary  Error-prone repair of lesions made by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region (V) genes in B cells is known to cause somatic hypermutation (SHM) of the antibody genes and, when coupled with selection mechanisms in germinal centers (GCs), leads to increased affinity of antibody. AID also induces double-strand breaks in switch region DNA that are necessary for antibody isotype switching. These processes are essential for maturation of the antibody response and defects in this pathway cause immunodeficiency syndromes. However, AID-induced lesions also cause genome-wide mutations and breaks that are associated with chromosomal translocations and lymphomagenesis. The cause of error-prone repair is unknown, and is one of the key remaining questions in AID biology.  We recently discovered a dramatic decrease in the expression of an essential DNA repair protein, AP endonuclease 1 (APE1), in mouse GC B cells, and propose experiments that will explore whether this is the cause of error-prone repair and SHM at the Ig locus. APE1 is replaced in the germinal center by an inefficient homologue, APE2, about which very little is known. APE2 could recruit error-prone polymerases through its interaction with PCNA. I will test the hypothesis that differential expression of APE homologues in germinal centers is a major reason for error-prone repair of AID-induced lesions.  In contrast to GC B cells, activated, cultured B cells do not undergo SHM and highly express APE1, which may promote accurate repair of AID-induced mutations in the V genes. By genetically reducing the expression of APE1, coupled with retroviral over-expression of APE2, we have developed a novel system that mimics ratios of APE1:APE2 protein in the GC, and can now detect AID-induced VDJH4 mutations in primary B cell cultures for the first time. Our preliminary data support that we are detecting bona fide SHM, and I propose to further optimize this system using VHb1-8 knock-in mice crossed to our mice with reduced APE1 and no APE2 (apex1+/-apex2Y/-) and analyzing mutations by deep sequencing. I expect mutation frequencies to be even higher in the VDJ region allowing us to analyze the spectrum of mutations. I will analyze functional domains of APE1 and APE2 that likely promote error-free vs. error-prone repair, and identify proteins that interact with APE1 and APE2 in B cells by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy, which I expect will provide new insight into error-prone repair.  In Aim 2 I propose to enforce expression of APE1 in the GC in vivo by introducing a transgene into mice that will express APE1, contingent upon AID, since AID is only expressed in activated and GC B cells. We will examine the effect of enforced APE1 expression on SHM. I expect these experiments will show that low expression of APE1 is the cause of error-prone repair of AID lesions in GCs."

"9250573","PROJECT SUMMARY Artemisinin-based combination therapies are the most effective frontline treatments for Plasmodium falciparum malaria; therefore, the recent emergence and potential spread of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia, the epicenter of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum, has raised global concerns. Studies of clinical isolates from western Cambodia and genetically modified laboratory strains have established a causal link of artemisinin resistance with mutations in the K13 gene (Pf3D7_1343700), but the molecular mechanism of K13-mediated artemisinin resistance is not understood. Population genetic studies of parasites from Southeast Asia showed independent emergence of the K13 mutants in multiple parasite populations. To further address this urgent problem, this U.S.-China joint project will (1) identify novel molecular markers associated with artemisinin resistance through a genome-wide association study of P. falciparum parasite isolates from the China- Myanmar border area, where artemisinin family drugs have the longest history of deployment; (2) perform functional studies to determine the role of the K13 gene and its polymorphisms in artemisinin resistance; and (3) elucidate the molecular mechanism of artemisinin resistance through the identification of the molecular complex of the K13 protein. This joint project, built on a solid foundation of our past collaboration, encompasses the complementary expertise and resources from the collaborating institutions. The proposed studies will take advantage of the large archive of culture-adapted P. falciparum clinical isolates collected from the China-Myanmar border area and the significant inroad we have made into this field from our earlier collaborations. Information generated from this study will be highly useful for monitoring, curbing and deterring the spread of artemisinin resistance, and will have far-reaching impacts on both regional and global malaria elimination campaigns."

"9258790","PROJECT SUMMARY Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been considered to be the main pathogenic factors in the development and progression of vascular dysfunction in diabetes. However, the mechanisms of ROS-induced microvascular complications and the interplay of ROS with nitric oxide (NO) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) under diabetic conditions remain poorly understood. Currently, ROS-induced endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and NO deficiency-mediated vascular dysfunction have been extensively studied in cultured endothelial cells and arterioles. Very little is known about the direct effect of ROS on eNOS activity and permeability in venules, a crucial site for solute and fluid exchange and a major site of inflammation. Our preliminary studies conducted in intact rat venules revealed the roles of H2O2 in eNOS activation, NO production, peroxynitrite formation, and cellular and molecular mechanisms of H2O2-mediated permeability increases. Our findings that diabetic rats have increased plasma H2O2 and decreased catalase activity suggest that the mechanisms of H2O2-mediated changes in microvascular permeability may resemble those involved in ROS-mediated microvessel complication in diabetes. We hypothesize that ROS do not reduce NO production, but rather cause excessive NO production and peroxynitrite formation in venules. The NO-derived peroxynitrite further activates eNOS, resulting in augmented peroxynitrite formation. This self-promoting mechanism is the key for H2O2-induced peroxynitrite-mediated cell injury, Ca2+ overload in endothelial cells, and microvascular barrier dysfunction. The hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) investigate the cellular mechanisms of H2O2-induced NO production and NO-mediated microvascular barrier dysfunction; 2) investigate the role of NO-derived peroxynitrite in H2O2-induced microvascular barrier dysfunction; and 3) investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ROS-mediated microvascular dysfunction in diabetes. The designed experiments with combined quantitative measurements of microvessel permeability along with confocal and electron microscopic investigation in individually perfused microvessels enable ROS-mediated changes in signaling molecules, enzyme activities, and vascular structures to be directly linked with changes in vascular barrier function. The addition of newly developed Nrf2 knockout rats that genetically modify antioxidant defenses into the proposal will benefit the mechanistic investigations of ROS-mediated microvascular complications in diabetes. The results derived from this proposal will provide new information that bridges studies using whole animals, organs, or vascular beds with studies using cultured endothelial cells and provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated microvascular complication and benefit the development of targeted therapeutics."

"9263817","pNGVL4a-hCRT/E6E7L2, is a naked DNA vaccine directed at HPV E6, E7, and L2 proteins, with the goal to develop a therapeutic vaccine capable of inducing cellular immunity to eliminate HPV infection and HPV-associated lesions. The newly licensed HPV vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, both based upon L1 virus-like particles (VLPs), are effective only for prevention of new genital infections by the HPV genotypes included in the vaccines. Unfortunately, the L1 VLP vaccines do not alter the course of established HPV infections, and thus will not reduce rates of HPV-related cancer for several decades; additionally, they are not effective against all oncogenic HPV types. There is a clear unmet need for a broadly protective HPV vaccine that is also able to trigger the clearance of established HPV infections and associated neoplasia, particularly in immunocompromised persons such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)+ patients who have higher rates of HPV-related cancers. pNGVL4a-hCRT/E6E7L2 was generated by fusing human calreticulin (CRT) to HPV16 E6 and E7 genes, each containing multiple inactivating mutations and codons optimized for high level expression, and capsid L2 protein amino acid residues 11?200. In proof-of-concept (PoC) studies in mice, vaccination with the pNGVL4a-hCRT/E6E7L2 DNA vaccine was shown to be capable of generating a strong E6/E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune response that resulted in a potent therapeutic effect against E6/E7-expressing TC-1 tumor cells. Furthermore, significant L2-specific antibodies were generated that were able to neutralize HPV 16 virions. In another PoC study in mice, vaccination with hCRTE6E7L2 DNA elicited a potent antitumor effect against E7-expressing tumors even in mice depleted for CD4+ T cells, suggesting that this vaccine may be active even in immune-compromised hosts. A head-to-head comparison of various administration methods for delivery of a DNA vaccine encoding CRT linked to HPV16 E7 (pNGVL4a-CRT/E7) was performed in a preclinical model, and tested with conventional intramuscular (IM) needle administration, electroporation (EP)-mediated IM delivery, and particle-mediated epidermal delivery via gene gun. Results showed that EP-mediated IM delivery generated higher levels of circulating protein and higher numbers of E7-specific CD8+ T cells among splenocytes compared to conventional IM injection. The enhanced CD8+ T cell immune response detected in EP-vaccinated mice translated into superior antitumor effects in E7-expressing tumors in tumor-bearing mice suggesting that EP-mediated delivery may provide an advantage compared to conventional IM delivery of the vaccine. Based on this promising preclinical data, a contract manufacturer has generated a GMP Master Cell Bank and manufactured clinical grade pNGVL4a-hCRT/E6E7L2 DNA. A toxicology study to assess the safety of pNGVL4a-hCRT/E6E7L2 DNA vaccine in mice when administered using the TriGrid Delivery System (TDS)-IM EP device (Ichor Medical Systems, Inc.) is required to support a planned clinical trial evaluating the safety and feasibility of DNA vaccination of patients with HPV16-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3, as part of the Cervical Cancer SPORE program."

Studies share data analysis centerThe National Children's Study (NCS) is prospective longitudinal cohort study of the individual and combined effects of environmental exposures and gene environmental interactions on child health and development in a representative sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the United States. The children will be followed from before birth until age 21. The importance and timeliness of this study are based on many factors, including past experiences demonstrating profound effects of environmental exposures, such as exposures to alcohol during pregnancy and to lead in early childhood on child health and development; the special vulnerabilities of children to environmental exposures compared to adults; known ongoing exposures, such as prevalent levels of non-persistent pesticides or hours of media exposure per day in young children; and evidence for environmental contributions or causes to such high-impact conditions as autism, developmental delay and developmental disability, asthma, and obesity. The primary aim of the NCS is to investigate the separate and combined effects of environmental exposures (chemical, biological, physical, psychosocial) as well as gene-environment interactions on pregnancy outcomes, child health and development, and precursors of adult disease. Unique features of the study include its focus on environmental exposures at the earliest stages of pregnancy (as well as thereafter) and the breadth of planned exposure and outcome measurements.  NICHD and a consortium of federal agencies plan and conduct a longitudinal study of the impacts of environmental exposures on children.   Because the focus of the study includes assessment of the impact of exposures that occur early in pregnancy, both pregnant women and their partners, and women of childbearing age, comprise the initial target population for enrollment. Data will be collected in combinations of face-to-face contacts and remote collection methods, e.g., telephone, computer, or mail-in questionnaires. The expected frequency of contact (face-to-face or remote) is approximately every three months through age one, every six months through age five years and annually thereafter.

"9251564","Project Abstract The microvasculature plays a critical role in the development and consequences of a broad range of cardiovascular diseases. The main assessment of microvascular function is via endothelium-dependent NO- mediated dilation which is reduced as a precursor to coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiomyopathy. In human arterioles from subjects with CAD loss of NO-mediated flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is compensated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from endothelial mitochondria. Although both are dilators, NO and H2O2 have opposing effects on vascular health, with NO promoting quiescence and H2O2 promoting vascular and parenchymal inflammation leading to atherosclerosis. Understanding mechanisms responsible for this switch in mediator may be key to minimizing tissue stress or injury from vascular paracrine redox toxicity.  The goal of this study is to determine fundamental cellular pathways regulating this switch from NO to H2O2. We propose that two systems, recently shown to be shear sensitive and fundamental to cell function are linked as critical for FMD in human arterioles (HA). The first is autophagy which we propose is the controlling switch that regulates shear-induced production of NO or H2O2. Blocking autophagic flux reduces NO and enhances reactive oxygen species (ROS). The second pathway involves lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3), which responds to shear by inhibiting lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lowering ROS and promoting NO. A single nucleotide polymorphism of this gene, seen in 80% of the population is associated with heightened risk for CAD. We propose that shear-induced activation of LPP3 is needed to maintain NO-mediated FMD in HA.  Neither LPP3 nor autophagy has been linked to the mediator of FMD. We will study fresh human coronary and adipose arterioles in human microvascular endothelial cells in vitro using stimulators and inhibitors of autophagy and LPA to determine their role in FMD. The local tissue impact can be profound given the different effect of NO vs. H2O2 on cardiovascular function. We will test the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1. Autophagy is critical in maintaining NO as the mediator of FMD in the human coronary microcirculation. Reduced autophagy leads to a switch to H2O2 as the mediator of FMD. Hypothesis 2. LPP3 is upregulated by microvascular endothelial shear resulting in LPA hydrolysis, attenuation of endothelial ROS, with maintenance of NOS-dependent FMD. If LPP3 is mechanistically linked to microvascular dysfunction, this could be an important target, either directly or through LPA, for reducing the vascular inflammation in a large number of genetically CAD-susceptible individuals."

"9259282","Project Summary/Abstract  Obesity affects more than one out of every three U.S. adults and even higher proportions of African Americans and Latinos. While behavioral weight management interventions tend to have limited scope and are associated with only temporary small weight loss, environmental interventions, such as the provision of infrastructure to support physical activity, have the potential to reach large portions of the population and foster lasting weight control. Active transportation infrastructure (ATI) consists of physical structures that support safe walking and bicycling and include sidewalks, bicycle lanes and paths, and intersections with painted pedestrian crosswalks or pedestrian signals. To date, little is known about the relationship between neighborhood ATI and individual body mass index (BMI). Using secondary data from multiple sources, the proposed observational study will determine whether (a) adults who live in a neighborhood with greater ATI have healthier BMI and (b) adults who live in a neighborhood with greater ATI lose more weight in a weight management program than those living in a neighborhood with less ATI. It will also examine whether these relationships differ by race/ethnicity. The sample will consist of an urban subsample (n=232,000 adults) of the Weight And Veterans Environments Study (WAVES) I, which is a nationwide, retrospective longitudinal study of over 3.2 million veterans receiving healthcare from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs between 2009 and 2015 (R01CA172726). Using OpenStreetMap data, innovative neighborhood ATI measures will be constructed, including availability and density of sidewalks and bicycle lanes or paths and pedestrian intersection safety. Multivariable regression will estimate associations between ATI and BMI. This study will provide important evidence about whether enhancing ATI through policies and environmental modifications is likely to help people achieve or maintain a healthier body weight. In addition to supporting the completion of the proposed study, this fellowship will support additional research training for the principal investigator including in statistical analysis (e.g., secondary, longitudinal, and spatial data analysis). These experiences and skills will provide a strong foundation for an independent research career focused on enhancing urban environments to improve population and individual health outcomes."
"9262720","Myocardial infarction (MI) is a common injury that causes permanent loss of hundreds of millions of cardiac muscle cells, increasing susceptibility to heart failure and sudden death. Major goals of regenerative medicine are methodologies to enhance cardiomyocyte recovery after MI and to restore cardiac function to heart failure patients. Heart regeneration is limited in adult mammals, but occurs naturally in adult zebrafish and neonatal mice through the activation of cardiomyocyte division. Whereas the research community has identified several factors important for heart regeneration over the past decade, we still know little of the regulatory mechanisms needed to activate regeneration programs in injured cardiac tissue. In particular, questions of whether regulatory enhancer elements are employed, and how specific they are to regeneration, are virtually unexplored. This is a critical deficiency, as the identification and manipulation of such elements could both expand our understanding of regeneration and have applications in regenerative medicine. In a recent collaboration between our groups, we found evidence for tissue regeneration enhancer elements (TREEs) that trigger gene expression in injury sites and can be engineered to modulate the regenerative potential of vertebrate organs including the heart. Here, we propose a multi-PI project exploiting the strengths of the zebrafish and mouse model systems to delineate regulatory sequences that control regeneration programs, and to create TREE-based factor delivery constructs to optimize heart regeneration in higher and lower vertebrates. 1) We will define the cis-regulatory motifs and binding factors necessary for activity of a TREE that is linked to the zebrafish leptin b gene. 2) We will use this TREE to define effects of enhancer-delivered pro-regenerative factors after cardiac injury in zebrafish and mice, focusing initially on provision of mitogenic and angiogenic molecules. 3) We will use open chromatin profiling approaches to identify new TREEs that activate expression in endothelial and/or endocardial cell types during zebrafish heart regeneration. We will perform sequence comparisons in mice, and we will initiate a program to generate transgenic reporter and TREE deletion animals to test the sufficiency and requirements for these sequences in directing regeneration programs. With these approaches, we will test the hypothesis that cardiac injury activates regeneration enhancer elements to facilitate heart regeneration."
"9260596","ABSTRACT Heart failure is on the rise in epidemic global proportions affecting more than 23 million people worldwide including 5.8 million individuals in the US alone. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) leading to ischemic cardiomyopathy is the most common etiology for decreased ejection fraction heart failure. Cardiomyocytes derived from the human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) are promising as a novel autologous cell- based therapy in heart disease. The current obstacles for cardiac regeneration using stem-cell based therapies include cell survival and maturity, anisotropic structure and alignment of elongated cardiomyocytes, electro-mechanical integration of the cardiac patch with the native myocardium, and rapid angiogenesis to support cardiomyocytes in the regenerating myocardium. The main objective of this proposal is to develop a thick mature and functional cardiac tissue that not only has the anisotropy of the native tissue but also stimulates rapid angiogenesis (1-week). We hypothesize that a combination of a functional multi-layered hiPSC-CMs cardiac patch paired with a bFGF scaffold significantly improves the early and late cardiomyocyte survival and promotes rapid angiogenesis. This hypothesis will be tested in the following three specific aims; Aim 1) This aim will determine the maturity, contractile function, and cell survivability of a hiPSC-CMs multi- layered aligned nanofiber cardiac patch in vitro, Aim 2) This aim will establish the efficacy of bFGF releasing scaffolds to enhance hiPSC-CMs survival and promote rapid angiogenesis in simulated ischemic conditions in vitro, Aim 3) This aim will determine efficacy of the transplanted multi-layered hiPSC-CMs cardiac patch paired with bFGF scaffold following myocardial infarction on cardiac function, cell engraftment, angiogenesis, tissue oxygenation and electro-mechanical integration, in an in vivo rat model of MI. Overall, this proposal will establish an innovative myocardial cell-based therapeutic strategy based on, (i) the combination of human iPSC-derived terminal differentiated cardiomyocytes with a biodegradable aligned nanofiber scaffold, (ii) bFGF- releasing scaffold to enhance early cell survival and rapid angiogenesis, and (iii) the non-invasive monitoring of myocardial tissue oxygenation and cell engraftment in vivo. The outcome of this project will enable us to develop a novel cardiac patch for translation into a large animal clinical model of MI for repairing the damaged heart."
"9261808","Project Summary The major purpose of this proposed research is to develop mechanistically based, effective, and safer agents for colorectal cancer (CRC) chemoprevention. Every year, about 150,000 Americans are diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the US. About 1.35 million new CRC cases are diagnosed worldwide, highlighting that CRC is a major health problem. Evidence from our group and others suggests that NSAIDs and select COX-2 inhibitors show significant inhibitory effects in preclinical models and patients with CRC, but these inhibitors are also associated with gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and cardiovascular (CV) risk. Reasons for these risks include increased 5-LOX metabolites and reduced PGI2 synthesis. Thus, selectively targeting microsomal PG Synthase-1 (mPGES-1) and 5-LOX would block the protumorigenic PGE2/prothrombotic LTs, but spare the PGI2. This approach is ideal for developing efficient and safer CRC chemopreventive agents. Toward this end, through high-throughput and enzyme kinetics assays and short- term in vivo efficacy studies, we have discovered a novel dual mPGES-1 /5-LOX inhibitor, CDPDPA. In this proposal, we seek to further develop CDPDPA for CRC chemoprevention. We have designed the research strategies to assess the pharmaco-dynamic dose-response efficacy, understand the role of mPGES-1/5- LOX, improve efficacy and safety through combinatorial approaches, and evaluate CV risk, if any, of CDPDPA compared with COX-2 inhibitor. We have assembled a team with expertise in CRC chemoprevention and cardivascular research to undertake following aims. 1). Determine whether targeting both mPGES-1 and 5-LOX with CDPDPA is efficacious in AOM-induced rat colon adenocarcinoma treatment; 2) Determine the source and relative contribution of mPGES-1 and 5-LOX to colon tumor developmen;t 3). Determine whether combinational targeting of mPGES-1/5-LOX with statin would improve the colon tumor inhibition efficacy and reduce cardiovascular side effects compared with celecoxib, and; 4). Determine the potential CV risk, if any, of long-term administration of CDPDPA compared with Celecoxib in LDLr-/-ApoB100/100 mice. The completion of this project will significantly improve the safety and efficacy of this novel drug for the prevention and treatment of CRC."

"9271793","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) currently affects approximately 6 million American adults and is associated with a high risk for premature death, hospitalizations and poorer quality of life. Unlike other cardiovascular diseases such as acute myocardial infarction that has declined over time, the burden of HF is projected to increase by almost 50% by 2030. HIV-infected patients may be particularly vulnerable to developing HF, given the known higher risk of myocardial infarction and higher prevalence of vascular risk factors, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-related adverse effects, and direct effects of HIV infection, including immunodeficiency and inflammation. However, to date, HF has received very limited attention in this population. Yet, with increased survival for HIV-infected patients in the ART era, resulting in near-normal life spans, HIV-infected persons are now subject to greater risk for common age-related comorbidities, with particular concern for serious conditions such as HF. To address these key knowledge gaps, this application responds to PAR-15-280 (Multidisciplinary Studies of HIV/AIDS and Aging [R01]). This study aims to identify optimal strategies for both primary prevention of HF and improving outcomes in HIV-infected patients who develop HF. We will conduct this research within the three largest Kaiser Permanente (KP) health systems in the Cardiovascular Research Network's (CVRN) Heart Failure consortium, which has a long history of studying HF epidemiology, management and outcomes. The CVRN and KP are uniquely suited for the proposed study given the long-standing HIV registries, standardized Virtual Data Warehouse, comprehensive electronic medical record, and ability to identify carefully-matched HIV-uninfected controls from the same source population. We anticipate identifying 39,000 HIV-infected and 390,000 high-dimensional propensity-matched HIV-uninfected adults, an unprecedented sample size for a study on this topic. We propose to achieve three complementary specific aims. The first aim is to characterize the association of HIV status with the incidence of HF and HF type (reduced versus preserved ejection fraction). The second aim will investigate clinically meaningful treatment strategies for the prevention of HF and HF types in HIV-infected adults, focusing on the effect of composition and adherence to ART and long-term immunosuppression and viral replication using state-of-the-art causal modeling approaches to emulate the results of randomized trials. Finally, among new HF cases that develop among HIV-infected and HIV- uninfected adults, the third aim will examine the association of HIV status on HF-related hospitalizations and death. Given the negative impact of HF on individuals, families and health systems, we expect these results to help inform key gaps in knowledge regarding HF in HIV-infected patients, including improving primary and secondary prevention strategies in this aging population."

C. albicans biofilms are highly resistant to antifungals, serve as important reservoirs for infection and, if not treated effectively, can result in more serious systemic infections. In order to develop more effective anti-biofilm therapies to treat HIV/AIDS patients with OPC, it is important to first gain a comprehensive understanding of regulators and target genes that control C. albicans biofilm development and maintenance. While a significant amount of research has focused on transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms that regulate C. albicans biofilm development, considerably little is known about post-transcriptional, and particularly translational, mechanisms. Importantly, studying translational control of C. albicans biofilm development and maintenance is also more likely to identify novel potential anti-biofilm targets that have not been discovered using previous approaches. We have recently discovered that UME6, which encodes a key transcriptional regulator of C. albicans biofilm formation, morphology and virulence, possesses one of the longest 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) identified in fungi to date. The UME6 5' UTR inhibits C. albicans filamentation, which is important for biofilm development, by specifically reducing translational efficiency. Interestingly, the level of translational inhibition appears to be modulated by host environmental signals. A recent RNA sequencing analysis has also demonstrated that in addition to UME6, a significant number of C. albicans genes involved in biofilm development and other virulence-related processes also possess long 5' UTRs. Based on this evidence, our hypothesis is that translational efficiency mechanisms play an important role in controlling C. albicans biofilm development, maintenance and pathogenicity. To address this hypothesis we plan to: 1) use a powerful new global approach, ribosome profiling, to identify the complete set of C. albicans genes showing changes in translational efficiency that are specifically associated with biofilm development and/or maintenance, 2) characterize selected translationally regulated C. albicans genes that play novel roles in biofilm development and/or maintenance both in vitro and in a mouse model of oral candidiasis. Ultimately, the proposed studies will provide a better understanding of global regulatory circuits and pathways that control C. albicans biofilm development and maintenance at the translational level and identify several key proteins that could potentially serve as targets for the development of new and more effective therapies to treat immunocompromised HIV/AIDS patients with oral candidiasis."
"9271800","HIV-infected individuals experience up to 4-fold higher annual rates of fragility fractures than the general population. As HIV-infected individuals live longer through effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), fracture rates are expected to further increase in the future. While several studies have emphasized an increased fracture incidence in HIV-infected patients, this increased fracture incidence is not explained by differences in bone mineral density (BMD) between HIV-infected individuals and healthy controls. An emerging explanation for this paradox is that HIV infection and treatment are associated with bone quality changes ? including changes in bone geometry and microstructure ? that do not impact BMD but do increase fracture risk. To date, only a few studies have investigated bone quality and only at the distal extremities. However, the proximal femur is an important site for fragility fracture. Hence, a critical gap in knowledge is whether bone quality at central skeletal sites, including the spine and hip, is similarly affected by HIV infection and therapy. Thus, a critical barrier to progress in the field is a lack of understanding of bone quality changes in HIV infected subjects. A potential mechanism influencing low bone quality in HIV could be an imbalance in bone and fat cell differentiation. Thus, bone marrow fat (BMF) could potentially be another important biomarker for bone health. A better understanding of these relationships could translate into new approaches for fracture risk assessment, drug development, and therapy monitoring in HIV-infected patients. We have identified three working hypotheses: (1) Significant micro-structural deterioration and reduction in biomechanical competence will be detected in HIV-infected patients at both peripheral and central sites and will reveal larger differences between HIV-infected and control groups than BMD data from DXA alone; (2) Increased BMF will be detected in HIV-infected patients compared to healthy controls and will be associated with increased visceral adiposity and decreased HIV-associated subcutaneous adiposity; and (3) Increased BMF will partially explain the association of HIV with poor bone quality. These hypotheses will be tested by pursuing the following Specific Aims: (1) Quantify differences in bone density, structure, and mechanical properties between HIV-infected patients and uninfected controls; (2) Determine differences in BMF between HIV-infected patients and uninfected controls; and (3) Determine the relationship between BMF and bone quality in HIV-infected patients. The approach is innovative because it combines novel in-vivo MRI and HR-pQCT imaging techniques to determine relationships between bone features and BMF with voxel based morphormetry. The proposed research is significant because the associations between bone quality and BMF have not yet been assessed in HIV-infected subjects. These relationships may reveal pathobiological mechanisms at play in HIV, and identify potential therapeutic targets for improving skeletal health in the HIV-infected population."

"9308791","This contract will ensure that all of the laboratory components of the NIAID-funded clinical trials networks are performing virologic assays in a valid and reproducible manner. This mission is made even more important by the expansion of NIAID clinical networks and grants into international resource-limited settings, where basic standards of clinical virology laboratory testing vary widely from country to country, and by the increasing number and complexity of the assays being used throughout the world. There is also a need to standardize and evaluate new virologic methods to ensure their comparability to the older versions that have been in use by NIAID clinical trial network laboratories. Since modifications of the FDA-approved versions of these assays are often being sold outside the US and are being used in many non-US laboratories, these modifications must also be evaluated. Lower cost alternative assays and point-of-care assays will become necessary in order to sustainably monitor the large numbers of people who are/will be on anti-HIV therapy. There is a need for evaluation of these new technologies. NIAID-supported clinical trial networks depend on the VQA for the proficiency programs and for the assay evaluation studies. The VQA communicates with all laboratories on matters relating to proficiency testing (see numbers in the next section) and collaborates with a subset of the laboratories to perform multi-site evaluations of virologic assays and methods. The VQA also supports NICHD-funded laboratories as well as WHO HIV drug resistance laboratories."
"9298492","HIV-1 replication can be effectively suppressed in HIV infected patients using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, despite effective suppressive therapy, HIV has been known to exist in a state of latency, with the best characterized latent reservoir being the resting memory CD4+ T cells. These resting cells produce HIV when their resting state is reversed following cellular activation. To achieve a cure for HIV disease, the latent reservoir of HIV needs to be identified and eliminated.  In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies at clearing the latent reservoir, a reproducible assay capable of quantifying latent HIV is crucial. The best characterized assay today is the QVOA (Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay), also known as IUPM assay (Infectious Units Per Million) performed on highly purified resting CD4+ T cells under conditions that reverse latency and induce replication of HIV. However, QVOA measurements require large volumes of blood, are expensive, tedious, and labor intensive and therefore not the assay of choice for many laboratories conducting HIV eradication research.  NIAID has a requirement to provide the QVOA as a service to the HIV research community. This service will allow standardized QVOA measurements so that unbiased comparisons between different eradication strategies can be achieved. Widespread use of the assay will raise the standards for latent HIV detection and reduce the need for surrogate, less accurate assays, presently used by some laboratories."

"9322106","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In premature infants, O2 toxicity and antioxidant deficiencies contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Affecting up to 10,000 infants annually, BPD represents the impact of injury, including O2 toxicity, to the immature developing lung resulting in arrested lung development. Though clinicians have limited O2 exposure, BPD remains a significant cause of neonatal morbidity. Attempts to prevent BPD by therapeutic antioxidant administration have also failed. Thus, there exists a need for novel approaches to lessen the impact of O2 toxicity and promote normal lung development in premature infants. Recent studies suggest a potential for nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) agonists to enhance endogenous antioxidant expression, preserve GSH levels, and prevent O2-mediated lung injury. Nrf2 significantly influences alveolarization and hyperoxic susceptibility in newborn mice. Thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) is best known for regenerating the active site of oxidized thioredoxin-1 (Trx1). A growing body of evidence suggests that TrxR1 inhibition may be a common feature of Nrf2 agonists. Aurothioglucose (ATG) and auranofin (AFN) potently inhibit TrxR1 and are used clinically to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Our previous studies in vivo demonstrated that ATG treatment increases Nrf2 activation, preserves lung GSH levels, and prevents hyperoxic lung injury in adult mice. We recently demonstrated in vitro that AFN treatment increases Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses and increases GSH levels. The protective effects of ATG and AFN are lost upon GSH system disruption. Our novel preliminary data indicate that ATG lessens O2-mediated lung developmental deficits in newborn mice. Collectively, our data support a working model in which protection by TrxR1 inhibitors are mediated via Nrf2 and GSH-dependent mechanisms. The utility of TrxR1 inhibition to induce Nrf2 activation, enhance GSH levels, and prevent O2-mediated neonatal lung injury has not been tested. The objective of this application, therefore, is to utilize newborn transgenic animal, primary and immortalized lung epithelial culture systems to: 1) determine the impact of altered lung TrxR1 expression on Nrf2 activation, GSH levels and O2-mediated injury; 2) evaluate the safety and efficacy of TrxR1 inhibition to attenuate experimental O2-mediated neonatal lung injury; and 3) distinguish the contributions of Nrf2 and GSH toward these effects. Our central hypothesis is that TrxR1 inhibition will attenuate O2-mediated neonatal lung injury via Nrf2 and GSH-dependent mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that TrxR1 gene dosage alters Nrf2 activation, GSH levels, and O2-mediated neonatal lung injury. In this aim, TrxR1 expression will be genetically altered in vivo and in vitro. We will determine the effect of altered TrxR1 expression on Nrf2 activation, GSH levels, and O2-mediated injury in a BPD mouse model. TrxR1 expression will be altered in vivo using heterozygous and homozygous Club (Clara) cell-specific and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell-specific conditional TrxR1 knockout mice. TrxR1 expression will be altered in vitro using primary cultured Club and AT2 cells from heterozygous and homozygous TrxR1 knockout mice. TrxR1 will be altered in murine transformed Club cells (mtCC) and AT2 cells (MLE-12) using TrxR1-specific siRNA. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that pharmacologic TrxR1 inhibition attenuates O2-mediated neonatal lung injury via Nrf2 and GSH-dependent mechanisms. This aim will use a BPD mouse model to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ATG to prevent O2-mediated lung injury. The contributions of Nrf2 and GSH will be determined using genetic and pharmacologic approaches. TrxR1 will be inhibited in newborn Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- pups by ATG administration to either 1 d newborn pups or E19 dams. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) will be used to deplete GSH in the pups prior to hyperoxic exposure. In vitro, AFN-treated Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- primary Club and AT2 cells and AFN-treated Nrf2-deficient mtCC and MLE-12 cells will be exposed to hyperoxia in the presence and absence of BSO. The studies outlined in this project, which will be straightforward given the expertise of the assembled research team, will determine the safety and efficacy of TrxR1 inhibition as a novel approach to attenuate O2-mediated neonatal lung injury and arrested lung development. Our findings will establish the rationale for future investigations of TrxR1 inhibitors to prevent BPD, a significant and costly cause of morbidity in preterm infants."

"9335532","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signals via its cell-surface G protein-coupled receptors to regulate vascular permeability, inflammation, angiogenesis and vascular maturation. In the past funding period, we found that apolipoprotein M (ApoM) is required for S1P to be associated with HDL and that ApoM+HDL activates the endothelial S1P1 receptor to induce vascular homeostasis and inhibit inflammatory responses. Recent findings also revealed a novel function of ApoM+HDL in the suppression of lymphopoiesis. In addition, we uncovered that the S1P1 receptor is a critical proximal component of shear stress sensing in the vascular endothelium and regulates vascular development and homeostasis. This renewal application aims to further elucidate this fundamental signaling system vascular and immune systems. Since S1P receptor modulators are now used in the clinic to treat autoimmune conditions, it is important to fully define this signaling system and to understand the cardiovascular implications. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that an HDL-bound ApoM/ S1P complex in plasma activates S1P receptors to regulate physiologic vascular development and homeostasis as well as immune homeostasis. The balanced activation of multiple S1P receptors by HDL/S1P plays a critical role in normal health of the vascular system and if dysregulated, leads to vascular disease.  We propose to elucidate the mechanisms by which ApoM+HDL delivers S1P to its receptors on endothelial cells and regulates biological effects. Second, the physiological importance of ApoM+HDL to regulate vascular inflammation via S1P receptors will be examined in mouse and fish models. Biochemical analysis in cultured endothelial cells, genetic loss-of-function studies in zebrafish and genetic mouse models of receptor function will be conducted to further define the key S1P pathway components. Third, we will explore the novel finding that ApoM+HDL signaling via S1P receptors restrain lymphopoiesis. The concept that ApoM+HDL/S1P regulates immune ontogeny while albumin/S1P mediates immune cell trafficking will be tested rigorously. Therapeutic opportunities with reconstituted ApoM+HDL will be explored.  Since S1P receptor modulators have entered the therapeutic era, the findings from this project are likely to have rapid translational potential."

There is, however, strong evidence that a tumor initiating or cancer stem cell populations exist in SCLC, both in primary tumors and in circulating tumor cells obtained from patient whole blood[1]. The ability to isolate and expand the rare CSC population from limited biopsy samples from patients and or the CTC population from ?liquid biopsies? of patients would greatly aid the academic research community as well as biopharmaceutical companies who are increasingly focusing on rare tumor types with high unmet clinical need. By the end of phase I performance, KIYATEC will have identified the processes required to isolate and expand to greater than 10^7 functional and undifferentiated SCLC CSC from existing SCLC patient derived xenograft cell lines. By the end of phase II, KIYATEC will have confirmed the ?stemness? of the expanded CSC derived from primary SCLC patient tissues, while developing and molecularly and functionally characterizing a SCLC PDX ?bank? from at least 10 different SCLC patients. Importantly, this project is perfectly aligned with KIYATEC?s mission to provide direct and positive impact on patients with cancer, through accelerating the drug development of targeted therapeutics which will have the potential to eliminate the CSC population, the ultimate driver of metastasis, resistance, relapse and death due to cancer."
"9344507","The National Cancer Institute?s (NCI) Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program (EGRP) supports large-scale collaborations across numerous cancer epidemiology cohorts. The collaborative approach would be enhanced by more easily accessible, centralized, and searchable information.  To address the need for better collaborative research and increased transparency, a publicly accessible Cancer Epidemiology Descriptive Cohort Database (CEDCD) (Phase I) has been created. The CEDCD contains descriptive information about existing cohorts (e.g., study design, eligibility criteria, enrollment numbers, scope of content domains collected, numbers of biospecimens, number of cancer and other health outcomes), with the intention of increasing transparency and scientific quality and collaboration through public access to the cancer cohorts? descriptive information.  Under Phase II, the Contractor is developing a controlled access database of harmonized data (Cohort Metadata Repository (CMR)), which will include sufficient flexibility to ensure the database can accommodate data generated through additional cohort studies. The Contractor is using existing open-source software DataSHaPER., for the CMR. The software meets the stated requirements to organize and search metadata and associated documentation and questionnaires.  It includes a taxonomy to allow variables to be tagged and filtered by content domain to easily find like variables for harmonization across cohorts. Currently, the Contractor is focusing efforts on populating the CMR with the meta-data from the 32 participating CECs."

"9348200","Acute cardiac allograft rejection and infection remain significant sources of morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation, accounting for nearly 50% of reported deaths. It is often difficult to clinically distinguish between rejection and infection because they are both inflammatory processes with similar, nonspecific symptoms. However, this differential is essential for determining therapy. Identifying laboratory methods that will permit safe and concise early differentiation between rejection and infection in the transplant patient will improve outcome substantially. We established an ACUC protocol that allowed us to study whether gene microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) would reliably differentiate acute heart rejection from infection in the transplanted rat. The ACUC protocol also allowed us to do pilot studies necessary to support the main protocol.  To date, we have established the surgical techniques necessary to successfully perform and maintain the rat transplant model.  We have established a dose of cyclosporin (CSA) in this model that reliably suppresses rejection during its administration, but will permit the emergence of Grade 3 rejection upon its discontinuation.  We have also determined the appropriate inocula of intra-bronchial E. coli bacteria that is sufficient to cause a pneumonia and a systemic inflammatory response without being immediately lethal in transplanted rats receiving CSA.  In addition, we have used gene microarry technology to study the impact of animal strain on gene expression during rejection and the time course of post surgical inflammatory changes in order to determine the most opportune time to harvest the transplanted hearts (i.e. when gene microarry signatures due to surgical inflammatory changes are dissipating).  We have also completed the main study protocol.  Our main protocol combines two well-established rat models, the first is a heterotopic heart transplantation model and the second is an E. coli pulmonary infection model.  All rats underwent heart transplantation on day 0 in conjunction with daily CSA (10 mg/kg subcutaneous) to suppress rejection. After transplant, animals were randomized at day 6 to have CSA discontinued, in order to initiate rejection, or continued, in order to further suppress rejection. After discontinuing CSA the animals were again randomized on day 13 to receive intrabronchial E. coli inoculation or saline inoculation. Consequently, four groups were studied: No rejection (i.e. receiving CSA) without infection, no rejection (i.e. receiving CSA) with infection, rejection (i.e. not receiving CSA) without infection, and rejection (i.e. not receiving CSA) with infection. On day 14, all animals were sacrificed and the blood and heart removed for gene microarray analysis. Other analytic tools that may be employed include: RT-PCR, western blot, in-situ hybridization, proteomics, immunohistochemistry, and histopathology. In addition, the animals' lungs, spleen, liver, and thymus were procured in the primary study and preserved for potential future analysis.  There have been 124 animals used on this protocol to date.  This protocol was closed in 2012; however we are continuing to process and analyze data related to the metabolic effects of rejection on cellular energy metabolism; the effects of surgical inflammation over time on gene expression; and the effects of acute cellular rejection and/or infection on gene expression."
"9348207","HIV-infected individuals experience accelerated vascular aging and an increased risk of vascular disorders. Vascular dysfunction, similar to that underlying vascular dementia and depression seen in aging HIV-negative populations, may contribute to the continued high rates of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders seen in the effective antiretroviral therapy era. One diagnostic marker of vasculopathy is thickening of the vessel wall. Studies have established a correlation between vessel wall thickening and vascular disease manifestations. This prospective, observational study aims to examine the relationships between neurocognitive outcomes and vessel wall thickness as a marker of vascular disease in HIV-infected adults. Study procedures include neuropsychological testing, brain imaging, blood biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging of the carotid vessel walls and computed tomography of the heart. HIV-infected patients (n=40) and age-, sex-, and race-matched HIV-negative controls (n=40) will be recruited. Participants will be followed for two years, with clinical evaluations every 6 months and repeat imaging studies at 12 and 24 months. Cross-sectional analysis will compare markers of vascular and neurocognitive disorders between HIV-infected and HIV-negative participants. The longitudinal data analysis will assess and compare the temporal progression of vascular disease (imaging and blood biomarker findings) in relation to changes in neurocognitive and depression scores in both groups.   57 participants have enrolled to date, 37 HIV-infected adults and 20 HIV-negative controls. In the first 30 HIV-infected participants with a fully-evaluable data set, 6 (22%) have neurocognitive impairment. Carotid atherosclerosis was identified in 12 (40%). Calcified coronary artery plaque was noted in 15 (50%), with a median coronary artery calcium score of 26 (range 1-2283). Six participants (20%) have both carotid and coronary disease. Research assays and cross-sectional analysis will be completed after the planned target of 40 HIV-negative and 40 HIV-positive participants have completed baseline assessments."

"9351160","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): West Nile virus (WNV) is a model flavivirus and an NIAID Category B infectious/emerging agent. It is currently the leading cause of viral encephalitis in the United States and an ongoing public health threat globally. WNV can cause severe and fatal neurological diseases. There are no vaccines or antiviral therapeutics to prevent or treat WNV infection. Therefore, there is an imminent need to understand the immunological processes by which the virus is controlled in order to facilitate therapeutic strategies against infection. IRF5 is a key transcription factor for the induction of immune-modulating cytokines. Our recent studies indicate that virus signaling of IRF5 activation and the induction and function of IRF5-target genes in dendritic cells (DCs) are essential components of antiviral immunity. However, a major void exists in the understanding of IRF5 activation and function, as signaling pathways and mechanisms of IRF5 activation, IRF5 transcriptional targets, and overall function of IRF5 in programming DC effector actions are not known. Studies in this proposal focus on defining the regulation and functions of IRF5 in DCs for the control of WNV infection. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that IRF5 is essential for type I interferon and cytokine production in DCs for the effective control of WNV infection. Specifically, we will (1) define the signaling pathways and mechanisms of activation of IRF5, and (2) characterize the IRF5 target genes for antiviral actions. Together, these studies will advance our knowledge in IRF5 activation upon virus sensing in the host, and the effector function of IRF5 target genes in programming effective immune response against virus infection. Insights can lead to development of therapeutic and preventative action against flavivirus disease."

"9356697","The availability of liquid biopsies, such as sampling of blood to measure key disease biomarkers, could aid in the detection of blood-circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) known to confer resistance to cancer therapy. For example, the T790M mutation in the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) accounts for 50% of acquired resistance to FDA-approved EGFR targeted therapies. Detection of this mutation is important to evaluate disease relapse and guide the selection of alternative therapies for better treatment outcome. Therefore, identification of ctDNAs that harbor EGFR-specific drug resistant mutations needs to be noninvasive. However, detection of ctDNAs is challenging because they constitute a small fraction of the total number of normal circulating DNA in blood. Current detection methods rely on digital PCR-based techniques, which are limited because of high cost, need for highly trained operators, requirement for time-consuming sample purification steps, slow sample-to-answer time, and limited ability for parallel analysis of a large number of biomarkers. To address this need, Giner, Inc. proposes to develop an electrochemical biosensor for multiplexed detection of ctDNA biomarkers associated with acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies. This sensor will be designed to achieve both selective and sensitive detection of ctDNA in human serum at physiological relevant concentrations."

"9200963","The Laboratory of Synthetic Chemistry (LSC) has been established with a primary preclinical objective to provide chemistry support to the cancer drug discovery and development efforts of the Developmental Therapeutics Program and the projects approved by the Joint Development Committee of DCTD-CCR (JDC). Towards this end LSC will focus its activities on lead optimization, an essential and integral part of new drug discovery and development. Novel synthetic methodologies will be developed to create new analogs based on the effective lead compounds to improve pharmaceutical profiles by addressing the following drug properties: activity, tumor selectivity, solubility, bioavailability, stability and ADME/PK in an iterative fashion. The laboratory is engaged in developing new relevant synthesis methodologies for applications by the wider extramural community, especially those funded by DCTD.  Most recently, DCTD in conjunction with the Center for Cancer Research and the Office of the Director, NCI established a new program called the Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC) to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat cancer. The CBC is expected to be an integrated research consortium at the cutting edge of chemical biology and molecular oncology that will work with various programs within NCI and outside scientific community, establish an iterative cancer drug discovery group on the scale of a small biotechnology concern, and advance new cancer therapy into the clinic. The goal of the CBC is to focus on unmet therapeutic needs in oncology that are not currently addressed by the private sector, including the pharmaceutical industry. To address this challenge and to re-establish NCI as a major player in the national cancer therapeutic arena, successful interaction of CBC Screening and Chemistry centers and other scientific groups is necessary. To achieve this goal, the LSC has become the CBC Chemistry support center that will interact with various DCTD centers and programs within NCI and outside contractor laboratories to facilitate the identification of new drug discoveries through medicinal chemistry with the ultimate goal of developing new clinical candidates."
"9200969","The Chemical Biology Consortium is being developed by NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), in conjunction with the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the NCI Office of the Director (OD) to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat cancer. It is envisioned that initiation of this consortium will provide cutting-edge chemical tools for probing complex signaling pathways and will serve as the starting point for the elaboration of first-in-class targeted therapies. The CBC will be an integrated research consortium at the interface of chemical biology and molecular oncology that will, working with various programs within DCTD and CCR, establish an iterative cancer drug discovery group on the scale of a small biotechnology concern. The goal of the CBC will be to focus on unmet therapeutic needs in oncology that are not currently addressed by the private sector. The long-term vision of the CBC is to bridge the gap between basic scientific investigation and clinical research supported by the NCI as the first step in re-establishing the NCI as a world leader in the area of innovative cancer therapeutics discovery.  To address this challenge and to ensure that NCI re-emerges as a strong and flexible player in the national cancer therapeutics discovery arena, we propose to develop a national effort in coordinated cancer drug discovery that unites academic and small biotechnology chemical biology and molecular oncology groups with the later-stage drug development resources of the NCI's Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP). This unique effort will:    1. Focus on the identification of novel targets, and the development of new molecules to interrogate those targets and serve as lead structures around which potential drugs can be designed and tested by a restructured NCI therapeutics pipeline. This will be accomplished, in part, by establishing a consortium of chemists, chemical biologists, and molecular oncologists, formed in recognition of the increasing need for a highly interdisciplinary and creative team research effort in drug discovery, that will propel the NCI into the era of personalized therapeutic cancer medicine. These teams will be formed with funding through the use of NCI contracts, NCI-SAIC subcontracts, or NCI grants mechanisms, whichever is most expedient and appropriate to the scientific expertise required.  2. Establish an iterative drug discovery effort that will coalesce all segments of the current NCI therapeutics research activity, so that the development of promising chemical leads into bone fide clinical candidates can be accelerated  3. Build an enhanced, and robust drug pipeline with the goal of producing a new clinical agent for first-in-human clinical testing in the fourth quarter of 2009  The integrated process outlined here will allow NCI to maximize the return on its investment in molecular oncology over the past decade by consolidating and coordinating the essential chemical and biological technologies that are available and necessary for therapeutics development. This initiative will also streamline the therapeutics development workflow for chemists and biologists in academia and small business by enhancing the scientific infrastructure available to move their molecules along the entire drug development pipeline into first-in-human clinical trials. We believe that the NCI Chemical Biology Consortium will provide the new strategic approach that is required for NCI to re-establish itself as a world leader in anticancer drug discovery and development."

"9201177","The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort consists of approximately 52,000 private pesticide applicators (primarily farmers) and 32,000 spouses of private applicators from Iowa and North Carolina, as well as approximately 5,000 commercial pesticide applicators from Iowa. The pesticide applicators were recruited between 1993-1997 (during Phase I of the AHS) when they obtained or renewed their license to apply restricted use pesticides; spouses were recruited largely by questionnaires brought home by the  pesticide applicator (81%). In addition to the extensive information on lifetime use of pesticides, demographic and other lifestyle factors were collected from all participants at enrollment using self-administered questionnaires (during Phase I of the AHS). Two follow-up telephone interviews have been conducted since enrollment. The first follow-up interview was conducted from 1999 to 2003 (during Phase II of AHS), and the second follow-up interview was conducted from 2005-2009 (during Phase III of the AHS). Cancer incidence has been ascertained by annual linkage to the cancer registries in each state and mortality through linkage to the National Death Index since the inception of the study field work in 1993.    The AHS began field work for Phase I of the study with three contracts in 1993. One contract was for a coordinating center (SRA Technology) which was primarily responsible for overall coordination of the study, developing questionnaires, and providing a secure computer system to store the vast amount of questionnaire and other research data coming from the field stations in Iowa and North Carolina. The other two contracts were for a field station in Iowa (University of Iowa) and a second field station in North Carolina (Battelle Memorial Institute). Field Stations were primarily responsible for managing the distribution and retrieval of self-administered questionnaires to eligible study subjects. The coordinating center contract was awarded, via a full and open competition, to SRA Technologies for Phase II of the study and to Westat Inc. for Phase III of the study; Westat assumed the coordinating center contract during Phase II when SRA Technologies went out of business. The field station contracts were awarded  again, via a full and open competition, to the University of Iowa in Iowa and Battelle Memorial Institute in North Carolina for Phases II and III of the study.    In the Phase IV contract, the contractor will be responsible for overall coordination and day-to-day management of the study, maintaining and updating a secure data base containing all study research and administrative records, provide liaison with appropriate state and federal offices necessary to conduct this research, appropriately communicate research findings to the cohort through a website and annual newsletter, and to collect specified biospecimens from selected study subjects. In Phase IV of the AHS, one contractor will perform all study related activities as there will be no cohort-wide interview conducted as part of this contract. The coordinating center will continue to be responsible for day-to-day study operations, managing and maintaining study data files, and coordinating National Advisory Panel meetings. In addition, the coordinating center will now assume responsibility for maintaining and securing the personal identifying information for cohort members; conducting annual linkages to the state cancer registries, state and federal mortality files, IRS address data bases; and facilitating add-on studies. New responsibilities under this contract will be the conduct of the Biomarker Study (BEEA: protocol attached in appendix) which will involve the collection of blood and urine samples from a subset of the cohort."
"9208678","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this new program project, we will utilize comprehensive global genomic approaches (RNA sequencing [RNA- seq], global run-on sequencing [GRO-seq], and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) to understand the biological mechanisms for term and preterm birth. This application is timely, because of the huge advances in genomic technologies combined with cutting-edge computational tools, which have dramati- cally advanced our understanding of signal-regulated gene transcription in a wide variety of biological systems. The global views generated by these assays provide a uniquely informative biological perspective that cannot be achieved by analyzing one or even a few genes at a time. We propose to utilize these state-of-the-art techniques to develop an in-depth understanding of the genomic and epigenomic mechanisms that underlie the regulation of myometrial quiescence-contractility, cervical competency-dilation, and that maintain barrier function of the cervix to protect the pregnancy against invading microorganisms and prevent prematurity. The P01 includes four interrelated projects: Project 1: Epigenetic Regulation of Myometrial Contractility in Pregnancy and Labor (Carole R. Mendelson); Project 2: Functional Roles of Estrogen Receptor a Acetylation in the Uterus (W. Lee Kraus); Project 3: Genomic Consequences of Estrogen Receptor Activation in the Cervix (R. Ann Word); Project 4: Mechanisms of Cervical Epithelial Barrier Protection Against Ascending Infection and Preterm Birth (Mala S. Mahendroo), supported by three cores: Administrative Core (Mendelson); Genomics and Computational Core (Kraus); Human Tissue and Biological Fluid Acquisition Laboratory Core (Word). The goals of these projects are: Project 1 - to define the genes and mechanisms that underlie the actions of progesterone (P4), via progesterone receptor isoforms, PR-A and PR-B, on inflammatory and `contractile' gene expression, and to characterize the chromatin modifications that mediate myometrial quiescence and accompany enhanced contractile gene expression leading to term and preterm labor; Project 2 - to achieve a better understanding of the biology of estrogen signaling through estrogen receptor a (ERa) in the female reproductive tract during pregnancy and parturition by elucidating the role of ERa acetylation in the function of the uterus and cervix of pregnant females and the molecular mechanisms by which ERa acetylation controls ERa-dependent gene regulation in these tissues; Project 3 - to understand the mechanisms by which PRs and ERs interact to alter gene expression, gestational length, and structural integrity of the cervix during pregnancy, cervical ripening and parturition, and; Project 4 ? to utilize genomic, cell biological and biochemical approaches to advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which hyaluronan (HA) provides immune- protection and epithelial barrier function in the pregnant cervix, as well as the molecular mechanisms whereby HA synthase 2 is regulated. We propose that these interrelated projects, carried out by a highly interactive research team, will achieve our long-range goal of reducing the incidence of preterm birth."

"9188561","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a sight threatening disease with few therapeutic options. Low-grade chronic inflammation in the retina [1-8] and inadequate vascular repair due to compromised function of the bone marrow (BM)-derived circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) [9-12] contribute to progression of retinal vascular pathology. A number of hyperglycemia- and dyslipidemia- activated pathways promoting the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines, pro-inflammatory lipids and pro-angiogenic factors leading to retinal endothelial cell and CAC dysfunction have been identified [2-4, 6, 9, 10, 13-25]. Dysregulation of these pathways is hypothesized to involve microRNAs (miRNAs). These small non-coding RNAs anneal imperfectly to target genes and simultaneously control translation and transcription [26]. Several miRNA classes have been shown to contribute to diabetes and diabetic complications [27, 28], including diabetic retinopathy [29]. Studies during the previous funding period identified miR-15a as a key regulator of both pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic pathways. miR-15a accomplishes these tasks through direct binding and inhibition of the central enzyme in the sphingolipid pathway, acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), and inhibition of VEGF-A. Based on these data, we hypothesize that miRNAs represent therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of DR by simultaneously regulating pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic pathways in the retina and CACs. We will address the role of miR-15a in DR with the following Specific Aims. Specific aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the decrease in miR-15a observed in diabetes contributes to increased ASM activity and VEGF-A production leading to pro- inflammatory changes, increased permeability and endothelial dysfunction in the retina. Specific aim 2: To test the hypothesis that decrease in miR-15a in diabetes leads to ASM activation and ceramide production resulting in decreased membrane fluidity of bone marrow-derived CACs. Decreased membrane fluidity results in entrapment of progenitor cell in the bone marrow and reduced repair function due to impaired migration and extravasation capacity. Manipulation of miR-15a to simultaneously control sphingolipid metabolism and pro-angiogenic pathways through direct regulation of ASM and VEGF-A production in the diabetic retina and BM should provide a unique and effective combination therapy approach that will add to the pharmacological armamentarium of drug therapies for diabetic retinopathy."

"9208684","The single most effective predictor of preterm birth is the state of cervix upon presentation with symptoms of preterm labor. The mechanisms underlying physiological cervical ripening at term are largely unknown, and the causes of preterm cervical dilation are even more elusive. Our laboratory, together with complementary expertise from other projects in this application, has expanded its long-term strength in the biology and physiology of human parturition to include a more integrated approach to delve deeply into the molecular transcriptional and genomic mechanisms that underpin the physiology of normal labor at term and the pathophysiology of preterm birth. Here, we propose (i) to determine if ER antagonists block preterm cervical ripening and labor, (ii) to explore the global effects of PR- and ER-mediated signaling pathways in human cervical cells and the cellular mechanisms by which PRs inhibit ER-mediated signaling, and (iii) to determine the role of ER-mediated signaling pathways in cervical ripening and dilation in vivo."

"9358817","Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the United States, however, the mortality rate is often greatly reduced by early detection.  One promising approach in the early detection of cancer is to identify tumor biomarkers.  Identification of biomarkers in tissues can have more value than circulating biomarkers as they are accompanied by spatial information, and the possibility to assess the interaction of cell types and markers.  Currently, measuring biomarkers in-situ in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections by immonohistochemistry is the most common method in clinic.  However, the resolution of biomarker localization is limited which restricts quantitative analysis.  Immunofluorescence has been widely used in autoflurenscence of specimen and the low limit.   luna proposes to develop a plasmonic metal nanoparticle enhanced fluorescense immunoassay kit for tumor biomarker identification and quantificcation.  The NIR dye fluorescence is enhanced by metal noanoparticles to more than 5000 fold and thus highly increase the slide assay sensitivity and LOD to the attomolar range.  Luna's kit is highly stable to keep and very simple to use and does not alter the current assay format and procedures."

"9156213","Cerebral cortical development is a highly orchestrated process, with production of neurons destined for the cortical layers produced in order, deep to superficial, followed by glial generation. The timing of this process is very different between species. For example, mouse corticogenesis occurs over approximately a week of gestation, while in humans the process takes several months, resulting in a much larger and more complex cortex. Lineage studies have functionally defined the major types of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) contributing to corticogenesis, including stem cell-like radial glial cells (RGCs) and intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). However, much remains to be discovered regarding how RGCs and IPCs are specified over time. We have discovered that during asymmetric RGC-IPC cell divisions, the RNA binding protein Stau2 segregates a complex cargo of coding and non-coding RNA specifically into the IPC daughter. Analysis of this cargo at different embryonic stages by RNA-sequencing has revealed networks of genes that are candidates for controlling proliferation and temporal specification of the IPC fate. Here we propose to test these candidates in functional studies, using high-throughput automated time-lapse image analysis for in vitro studies, as well as a novel lentiviral in vivo screening method, to define their roles in specifying IPCs and timing corticogenesis. In contrast to the progress made in understanding the characteristics of mouse cortical progenitor cells, less is understood regarding human cortical progenitors. Fundamental knowledge about how human RGCs and IPCs produce diverse progeny over time, their division mode, cell cycle times and lineages, remains unknown. Here we will address these gaps in knowledge using long-term time-lapse lineage analysis in vitro. In addition, by identifying genes expressed in human cortical progenitor cells, including at the single cell level and via analysis of the Stau2 cargo, we will reveal human cortical progenitor subtypes and heterogeneity. Further, a comparison of human and mouse cortical progenitor cell data will help illuminate key differences to address a major mystery: the difference in timing of mouse and human cortical development. Our lab continues to explore the interaction of environmental factors on cortical progenitor cells, aided by the ability to rapidly quantify changes in proliferation, division mode and differentiation using time-lapse analysis. Soluble factors released by structures in the germinal niche such as vascular endothelial cells and the choroid plexus, act on cortical progenitors to regulate the numbers and types of progeny they produce. Our recent work has identified a panel of candidate niche molecules secreted by the choroid plexus that could interact with receptors expressed on neural progenitors, which we propose to examine in vitro and in vivo, in mouse and human. Defining niche factors and their specific actions paves the way to address diseases that involve degeneration of stem cell zones which are normally active throughout life. Furthermore, defining environmental factors that act on human NPCs is important for translation towards regenerative therapy development."
"9188462","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Illness behaviors, or affective, cognitive and behavioral responses to physical symptoms, account for a large proportion of U.S. healthcare costs, and are associated with clinically relevant outcomes, including symptom exacerbation or relief and functional recovery. Illness behaviors, in turn, are influenced by social circumstances above and beyond objective health indices; self-initiated contact with the medical system, one aspect of illness behavior, is partly determined by access to health-promoting resources or the help and advice received from social network members. Relationships are associated with health outcomes through multiple direct (e.g., behavioral norms, resources, physiology) and indirect (e.g., buffered stress, increased self- efficacy) pathways. Illness behavior deserves increased empirical attention as a key behavioral pathway linking interpersonal contexts to health, as it incorporates individual differences in medical care-seeking, as well as the cascade of responses that occur prior to care-seeking decisions. Evidence from observational and experimental research suggests illness behaviors are both genetically influenced and socialized within families. Studies of behavioral development, however, acknowledge the interdependence of genes and environment (i.e., people play a role in choosing or creating interpersonal contexts, or are differentially influenced by them, based on their genetic make-ups); thus, the joint mechanisms of genes and environment on illness behavior are not yet understood. The aims of the current proposal are to examine: 1) associations between childhood family environments and illness behavior development in early and late adulthood, 2) genetic and environmental contributions to illness behavior, and 3) proximal, interpersonal networks' associations with illness behavior and subsequent functional status in late adulthood. In addition to addressing genetic and social mechanisms of illness behavior development across the lifespan, this proposal will support the applicant's training aims of learning and applying new skills in longitudinal data analysis, biometrical analyses with twin and family-adoption designs, and theory on healthy aging and medical services in late-life. As chronic illness is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, psychosocial issues in medical care, and the continuity of this care, are increasingly relevant to health promotion efforts. Developmental frameworks for health promotion acknowledge the importance of early life factors in pathways to late-life health. In particular, research suggests that social factors (e.g., modeling, social integration, support) across the lifespan are associated with a variety of illness behaviors and health outcomes (e.g., care-seeking, adherence, disability), above and beyond biological risks. The proposed research applies a genetically informative, longitudinal design to examine the social development of illness behaviors, both in early- and late-adulthood."

"9201086","This proposal proposes to continue operations and maintenance of the OCG (ocg.cancer.gov) Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to accept, QC, and display data and data types generated by the TARGET,  CGCI, CTD2 and other cancer genomics and translation projects.  The primary focus of the TARGET and CGCI Initiatives remain identifying genomic alterations that offer pathways to novel therapeutic interventions that may lead to more effective treatments for cancers.  NCI-CBIIT provides informatics support for the OCG programs. The Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) Initiative focuses to rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets in childhood cancers so that new, more effective treatments can be developed in shorter time and ultimately bring new hope to children and their families who face the devastating burden of these diseases. The TARGET Initiative (is focused on identifying therapeutic targets as well as prognostic and diagnostic markers in multiple childhood cancers.  The initiative includes the study of high-risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), neuroblastoma (NBL), high-risk and treatment refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), osteosarcoma (OS), and kidney tumors (including high risk Wilms tumor).  These cancers were the chosen for study because of their prevalence among children, the inadequacy of current treatment options, the ongoing NCI-supported efforts to molecularly characterize these cancers, and the availability of clinically annotated, high-quality human tissue collections that met TARGET's strict scientific, technical, and ethical requirements.  In the coming year, TARGET will include validation cohorts and other studies.   The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (CGCI) supports cutting-edge genomics research on rare cancers. Researchers develop and apply advanced sequencing and other genome-based methods to identify novel genetic abnormalities in tumors. The extensive genetic profiles generated by CGCI may inform better cancer diagnosis and treatment. CGCI is another OCG program. CGCI focuses Burkitt Lymphoma and HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization Project (HTMCP).  Previous projects included early stage Lung Cancers, Medulloblastoma, and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The goal of the Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP) is to explore potential genetic changes in patients with Burkitt lymphoma that could lead to better prevention, detection, and treatment of this rare and aggressive cancer. The OCG, along with the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancies (OHAM), initiated the HTMCP to gain insight into the genetic events driving HIV-associated cancers and to determine why certain cancers, but not others, have higher incidences in HIV-positive patients. The data generated by these projects are stored at the DCC. Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD) initiative bridges the gap between the enormous volumes of data generated by genomic characterization studies and the ability to use these data for the development of human cancer therapeutics. It specializes in computational and functional genomics approaches critical for translating next-generation sequencing data. The Cancer Target Discovery and Development (CTD2) initiative is a collaborative network of OCG-supported Centers. The program strives to functionally validate discoveries from large-scale genomic initiatives and advance them toward precision medicine through the efforts of the Centers and open access data sharing.  Through cross-Network collaborations, CTD2 uses innovative bioinformatics and functional biology to: (1) mine data to find alterations that potentially influence tumor biology, (2) characterize the functional roles of candidate alterations in cancers, and (3) identify novel approaches that target causative alterations either directly or indirectly.  Because CTD2 is a ?community resource project all information in the Data Portal is openly available to the scientific community and can be accessed without restrictions.  Project descriptions, datasets, and methodologies generated by the Centers are shared through the CTD2 Data Portal (i.e. the OCG Data Coordinating Center).  OCG oversees other genomics and translation projects which may generate molecular data that will be stored in the DCC.  The formats, file types etc. is ever changing and the DCC evolves as needed.  It is expected that the infrastructure already developed and being developed will be useable for the OCG data generated. The research conducted by OCG programs is divided into three distinct yet tightly integrated components that together form a system for selecting new molecular targets for the development of novel therapies for these childhood cancers:  ? Genomic Characterization: Using high-resolution array-based methods a)determine differences in the patterns of gene expression in cancer samples and non-cancerous samples and b) genome changes to characterize genome structural changes that correlate with each cancer, such as chromosome region gains and losses, methylation changes etc. are integrated to provide a complete genomic overview of each cancer.  ? Sequencing: Up-to-date genetic sequencing techniques are used to read genes that have been identified to have altered expression and/or structural alterations to identify the specific cancer-related mutations in the DNA sequence.  Additionally, new technologies to sequence the whole-genome, whole-exome, RNA-seq, and miRNA-seq have and will be employed. ? Identification of Therapeutic Targets?For example, RNA interference (RNAi), small molecule high-throughput screens are used to identify and initially validate potential targets identified from the genomic characterization and re-sequencing efforts.  In the future, other approaches may be added."

"9207021","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroinflammation has been implicated as a major pathophysiological process of Parkinson's disease (PD) in recent years. Among various neuroinflammatory triggers, protein aggregates have been shown to be a predominant pathological trigger for microglial activation and subsequent proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in the brain, which in turn con tributes to the accelerated progression of neurodegenerative processes. Also, emerging evidence indicates that aggregated pathogenic proteins, including ?-synuclein (?Syn), are packaged into exosomes, which propagate protein aggregates from affected neurons to other brain cells, including microglial cells, through a non-cellular autonomous process, leading to a heightened neuroinflammatory response. Despite these advances, the cellular mechanisms underlying microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory events following stimulation with ?Syn aggregates and ?Syn-containing exosomes are yet to be defined. While studying kinase signaling in PD models, we unexpectedly discovered that the major non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn is rapidly activated in primary microglia within a few minutes of stimulation with the known inflammogen LPS. Interestingly, Fyn activation triggers proinflammatory responses, including cytokine/chemokine release from microglia. In addition, our preliminary findings revealed that aggregated ?Syn also induced a rapid activation of Fyn kinase and the NLRP3 inflammasome. To further expand our novel preliminary results, we will systematically pursue the following specific aims: (i) to characterize the mechanism of Fyn kinase activation and its role in the regulation of NLRRP2/3 inflammasomes in microglia and astrocytes during inflammatory stress induced by ?Syn aggregates and exosomes containing ?Syn aggregates and to determine the proinflammatory role of Fyn in dopaminergic neuronal cell death, (ii) to define the molecular mechanisms underlying Fyn upregulation in microglia and astroglia during sustained inflammatory responses induced by ?Syn aggregates and ?Syn exosomes in animal models of PD, and (iii) to determine the role of Fyn in mediating the proinflammatory response in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system during ?Syn protein aggregation in animal models of PD as well as in postmortem PD brain tissues. Biochemical, cellular and neurochemical approaches will be used to achieve these specific aims. Taken together, delineating the role of Fyn kinase in ?Syn protein aggregation-induced microglial activation will not only provide novel mechanistic insights into the progression of neurodegenerative processes in PD, but may also be useful for translating mechanistic outcomes into effective therapies for PD."
"9222224","Project Summary Eukaryotic pathogens such as Leishmania are particularly challenging subjects of drug discovery efforts because their molecular machinery is structurally and mechanistically similar to our own, contributing to the risk of human drug toxicity. Our comparative genomic analyses indicate that the Leishmania protein synthesis machinery contains many unique and essential targets that differ substantially from their human counterparts. We will use a systems biological approach to build on preliminary findings and search for aminoacyl-tRNA- synthetase inhibitors with anti-leishmanial activity in a unique marine natural products library with proven efficacy against parasites. A high throughput screen will be implemented to generate preliminary leads, which will be validated in vitro and in vivo and used for testing in an established animal model for leishmaniasis. Such drugs could be used in a multidrug combination therapy, possibly with current anti-leishmanial agents, to exponentially reduce the probability of adaptive resistance. Because of our comparative systems biology approach, the proposed work will also be effective in identifying potential targets against other pathogenic kinetoplastids such as trypanosomes."

"9362922","One of the most significant hurdles to overcome in evaluating strategies to cure HIV infection is the lack of a simple method for quantifying changes in the size of the latent reservoir of replication-competent HIV in resting CD4+ memory T cells in individuals on highly effective antiretroviral therapy. Most of the HIV DNA in these cells represents defective virus; less than 0.01% of highly purified resting CD4 cells harbor replication-competent provirus. As a result, PCR-based methods tend to over-estimate the size of the reservoir and do not correlate with the number of cells producing functional virus in a viral outgrowth assay. However, viral outgrowth assays are labor-intensive and require large volumes of blood. The goal of this project is to design a high-throughput assay platform that can be used to reproducibly quantify changes in the size of the replication-competent latent HIV reservoir in resting CD4+ memory T cells isolated from individuals on highly effective antiretroviral therapy."

"9362889","Tuberculosis (TB) continues to cause significant mortality and morbidity throughout the world, especially in HIV-infected individuals. Increases in drug resistant TB cases have been occurring in many high endemic countries that have limited resources to identify and diagnose patients. Standard diagnostic techniques for TB include sputum smear microscopy to detect acid fast bacilli and microbiological culture confirmation. As a result, diagnosis of TB is both difficult and time consuming, especially in smear-negative, HIV-infected and pediatric patients. Molecular technologies are under development for TB case detection and identification of drug resistance mutations in lower levels of the health care system. The goal of this solicitation is to develop an inexpensive (less than $10), easy to use device for processing sputum samples to obtain purified DNA for TB testing to be used in a rural clinic setting with minimal infrastructure."
"9362977","The Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is committed to the development of efficacious preventive vaccines against HIV-1 for worldwide use to end the AIDS epidemic.  A wide assortment of candidate HIV-1 vaccines have reached Phase I clinical trials but only three vaccine regimens have advanced to efficacy testing.  One of these 3 trials, designated RV144, has shown modest efficacy in humans and this result coupled with promising results from nonhuman primate (NHP) studies has now stimulated the field to continue to test more advanced vaccine candidates in humans.  Thus, the discovery and development, of preventive HIV/AIDS vaccines may be within reach.  To augment the development portion of the process for identifying and ultimately testing an improved HIV vaccine, NIAID will be using a staged development approach to allow the rapid advancement of promising HIV vaccine platforms to CGMP manufacturing for subsequent clinical testing.  This project is for the development and manufacture of HIV vaccine candidates that have demonstrated success in NHP challenge studies, equivalent preclinical animal models or early human clinical trials, and have demonstrated manufacturing feasibility."

"9365914","Cardiotoxicity is increasingly recognized as a significant challenge to many existing therapies and as a potential barrier to the development of new therapies.  For example, despite improved survival from cancer, chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity has emerged as a significant problem.  Cardiovascular complication, particularly heart failure, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors.  In small studies, cardioprotective strategies against cancer therapy-induced cardiac dysfunction are effective if implemented early at the subclinical phase.  However, detection of the frequency of subclinical disease and subsequent ability to protect against further functional decline are limited by inadequacy of current technologies to accurately assess and monitor changes in cardiac structure and function.  Novel non-invasive strategies that detect early subclinical changes in cardiac structure, function, and/or tissue are needed to improve detection and monitoring of cardiac injury in order to improve cardioprotection and effectiveness of cancer therapeutics or other toxic exposure.  Studies that demonstrate increased sensitivity and precision of existing or enhanced imaging technologies with respect to normal and altered cardiac structure, function, energetics, and metabolism are sought.  Pre-clinical or patient studies using molecular changes or biomarkers to enhance early detection of cardiac derangements are also responsive."

"9369077","The linkage of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) nationwide cancer registry system and the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) created the SEER-MHOS dataset. This resource includes patient-reported outcomes and cancer registry information from a nationwide sample of individuals 65 and older enrolled in Medicare Advantage Organizations (managed care health plans): http://outcomes.cancer.gov/surveys/seer-mhos/). The MHOS is an ongoing study that has been recruiting multiple cohorts since 1998. Individuals ages 65 and over who are enrolled in participating Medicare Advantage Organizations are randomly sampled, administered the survey by mail or telephone, and then re-surveyed two-years later. Currently, the linked dataset contains ten cohorts, incepted beginning in 1998 and ending in 2009, representing over 95,000 individual participants of MHOS and diagnosed with cancer in SEER. During the years 1998-2005, the primary health-related quality of life measure of physical and emotional functioning was the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36). Beginning in 2006, with the implementation by CMS of the MHOS 2.0, the Veterans RAND 12-item Health Survey (VR-12) replaced the SF-36 for measuring the physical and mental health status of beneficiaries. Both the SF-36 and VR-12 instruments contain the following subscales: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. To date, investigators who have conducted analyses on the SEER-MHOS dataset that have examined HRQOL subscales have been limited to choosing between the earlier cohorts (1998-2006) or later cohorts (2007-8) as the subscales are not equivalent. This has limited the potential to ask important health outcome questions in older cancer survivors that do not currently have sufficient statistical power.  The usual methods of calculating scale scores from the VR-12 do not precisely numerically align with the corresponding scores from the SF-36. Thus, investigators who have conducted analyses on the SEER-MHOS dataset in the past that have examined HRQOL subscales have been limited to choosing between the earlier cohorts (1998-2006) or later cohorts (2007 and on) as the 8 scales are not equivalent. This limited the potential to ask important health outcome questions in older cancer survivors that do not currently have sufficient statistical power. The goal of the previous project by the Boston University Team in 2015-2016 was to develop algorithms that allow for score matching and comparability of the scales of the VR-12 to those of the SF-36 using the MHOS data and, in particular, the SEER-MHOS datasets across multiple cohorts from 1998 to 2012, cohorts 1- 12. The algorithms are complete, statistical software programs have been created and disseminated, a technical report summarizing this work has been created, and a manuscript has been submitted for peer-review publication.  In developing these algorithms, two main issues were identified:  1) Differential item functioning (DIF) among survey questions that are part of the same scale, and 2) Contextual issues that may affect responses to identically-worded questions on the SF-36 and VR-12 surveys.  The purpose of this contract is to conduct further psychometric work to address these two issues."

"9369368","Both exosomes and oncosomes are extracellular vesicles produced by normal and cancerous cells respectively, and are found in most bodily fluids. Oncosomes are of increasing clinical and scientific importance because they are involved in cancer metastasis. A device is presented to meet the challenge of high throughput and high-volume processing of clinical fluids, by continuously separating oncosomes/exosomes from the clinical fluid, and then separating the oncosomes from the exosomes. The device separates based upon physicochemical differences (such as size, density, and charge) of the exosomes/oncosomes rather than upon affinity techniques. Field flow fractionation will show feasibility and discover the physical property differences that exist between oncosome and exosome from cultured cells of melanoma and melanocytes respectively. Serum will be used with several split-flow lateral-transport thin separation (SPLITT) instruments. SPLITT will be used to separate exosome from oncosome and compared against standard techniques for exosome refinement. Upon successful completion of these technical objectives, a detailed cost/time analysis will be used to justify the evaluation of development of beta prototype, additional clinical samples, and cancer types in Phase II funding."
"9369362","Recent advances in HER2-targeted therapy have made a dramatic impact on patient survival rates diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer. Selecting the appropriate treatment, however, requires simplified tests for HER2 overexpression, which is currently the bottleneck. Liquid biopsy offers a non-invasive and more sensitive method for diagnosing HER2-positive breast cancer. In this contract, we will explore the possibility that a novel capture technology, CAP-TECH, designed for the differential capture of exosomes (E-CAP) and oncosomes (O-CAP) enables rapid, reproducible isolation, and enrichment of exosomes and oncosomes from samples. We propose to: 1) optimize prototypes and develop rapid high-throughput-compatible isolation protocols capable of producing pure exosome and oncosome populations from human plasma, 2) confirm the integrity, purity, percent recovery of purified exosomes and oncosomes using physicochemical methods, and 3) perform a side-by-side comparison against current gold standards for exosome isolation and an initial clinical evaluation of HER2-positive oncosome isolation on confirmed HER2-positive patient samples. This work will lay the foundation for future product development and field-testing evaluations in Phase II. Success of this contract will provide a novel, high-throughput compatible, and cost-effective tool for the rapid differential isolation of exosomes and oncosomes from patient samples, which could greatly improve treatment selection, and patient outcomes."

"9191216","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness, ultimately leading to death in affected teenagers and young adults. At present, there are no specific therapies for DMD and treatment options are limited to supportive care. DMD is caused by mutations in dystrophin, a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Along with the utrophin-glycoprotein complex (UGC) and the ?7?1 integrin complex, the DGC is one of 3 major muscle adhesion complexes that link the extracellular matrix to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. In DMD, the absence of dystrophin and subsequent loss of the DGC leaves the sarcolemma highly vulnerable to contraction-induced damage, ultimately leading to muscle fiber degeneration and death. Previous work from our lab has shown that a small transmembrane protein called sarcospan can enhance the recruitment of adhesion complex proteins to the cell surface. This increase in adhesion complex abundance improves muscle membrane stability in dystrophin-null animals, preventing many of the dystrophic changes associated with DMD. These findings lead us to hypothesize that sarcospan acts as a chaperone-like molecule during the trafficking of adhesion complexes to the cell surface. In this proposal, I will examine the role of sarcospan in the maturation and assembly of adhesion complexes within muscle endomembrane compartments. I will additionally test whether sarcospan can be used to boost the efficacy of exon-skipping therapy, a class of therapeutics currently in clinical trials. The results from these studies will illuminate a largely unexplored aspect of muscle biology, and provide important insight into the translational potential of sarcospan as a therapeutic target in DMD."
"9387966","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This purpose of this application, building on 25 years of research training success, is to provide a variety of complementary training opportunities in dental and craniofacial health research at the U. of Iowa to develop a cohort of dental scholars whose research skills will meet the challenges of oral health research for the 21st century. The aims are to: 1) provide outstanding interdisciplinary didactic training; 2) provide rigorous research mentoring experiences involving ongoing review and critique; and 3) prepare post-doctoral trainees for academic careers in oral health research. The proposed program has a major focus on dental graduates, but recognizes that basic scientists also play important roles in oral health research; thus, it will also offer training opportunities for non-dentists. An R90 component reflects the increasingly important role that non-citizen dentists have, and will continue to have, in our oral health research programs. The research areas in which training is offered reflect the strengths of the College of Dentistry, the health science colleges, and other colleges at the University of Iowa, and range across the full translational spectrum from biomaterials and tissue engineering to oral mucosal disease and from caries and fluoride research to craniofacial genetics and Health Services Research. Specifically, we propose to offer training for dentists and non-dentists to pursue a PhD in Oral Sciences (or in the interdisciplinary Genetics Program, or in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, as appropriate), or to pursue post-doctoral training. In addition, there will be an opportunity to obtain a Certificate in Translational and Clinical Investigation under the auspices of the University's Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (CTSA). A group of 35 experienced and talented program faculty from a variety of disciplines is available to mentor trainees. Training will be supervised by an experienced Director and Associate Director, assisted by a Faculty Leadership team. There will be internal and external advisory committees and a Committee on Recruitment and Diversity to assist with recruitment and support of under- represented minorities. In summary, the program brings together productive, well-funded mentors, with pre- and post- doctoral trainees in an environment with strong institutional commitment to developing outstanding interdisciplinary research training, a fine institutional record of training in relevant disciplines, and excellent educational and research facilities. The outcome will be the development of a cadre of oral health researchers equipped to function at the cutting edge of their disciplines."

"9085122","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Project Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is estimated to have occurred in 10 to 23% of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) combatants, resulting in cognitive, neurobehavioral, and emotional sequelae and disability. Diagnosis in the chronic phase is difficult because conventional brain imaging is insensitive, acute injury records may be unavailable, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often overlap with those of TBI. Advanced brain imaging of TBI could potentially identify disruption of white matter (WM) tracts on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), alterations in brain activation while performing cognitive tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and changes in functional connectivity (FC) measured from resting state fMRI. Rationale: We reported that TBI indexed by DTI was related to increases in brain activation in Veterans while they performed a spatial conflict resolution (SPCR) task, a finding that we and others have attributed to increased demand upon neural resources due to WM injury. PTSD symptom severity had the opposite effect of reducing task-related brain activation. Limitations of this study included restriction to blast TBI, lack of a definitive diagnostic instrument for PTSD, and the possibility that our findings were specific to the SPCR task. We also did not evaluate resting state FC. Objectives: Study blast and non-blast mechanisms of mild TBI (mTBI), add an fMRI task of complex attention that is likely to be more sensitive to diffuse WM injury, measure FC of the default mode network (DMN), explore the effects of blast exposure in Veterans without a history of mTBI, and perform a comprehensive analysis to examine multi-modality brain imaging in relation to outcome measures. This project will determine relationships between WM tract injury (DTI), fMRI brain activation during SPCR and attention tasks, connectivity during resting state fMRI, and functional, emotional, and cognitive status in mTBI and non-TBI groups. Methods: Study SPCR and complex attention-related brain activation in 60 mTBI (e 3 months post-injury) and 60 non-TBI without blast exposure, as well as 20 Veterans and Service Members with a history of blast exposure but not TBI. DTI will measure WM integrity and resting state fMRI will provide a measure of FC. We will assess cognitive, emotional, and functional outcome to address the Aims and the Clinician Assisted PTSD Scale will be used to identify subjects with PTSD. Statistical analyses will integrate the multimodality brain imaging to evaluate the contributions of mTBI and PTSD to brain activation on the SPCR and attention tasks, as well as FC. The array of brain imaging variables will be analyzed in relation to cognitive, emotional, and functional outcome. Relevance to Veterans' Healthcare: Improved diagnosis of chronic mTBI, including effects of blast exposure without a history of TBI, would facilitate treatment planning and lead to earlier referral. Information about mechanisms may also suggest intervention approaches for TBI and PTSD and provide methods for assessing treatment response."
"9188777","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      RELEVANCE: Annually, more than 700,000 primary hip and knee replacements and another 1.2 million spine surgeries are performed on VA and non-VA patients in the United States (US). Perioperative device-related infections compromise approximately 2-3% of these primary procedures and when considering revision surgeries, this number grows as high as 17.5%. Infections following these procedures are difficult to treat, especially in cases where antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been identified as the pathogenic species. These resistant bacteria may be present in the form of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), or similar resistant bacterial strains. Estimates of veteran and nonveteran hospital acquired S. aureus and MRSA infections are reported at nearly 500,000 cases in the US each year. This increase in the number of MRSA cases has been attributed to the bacteria's evolving resistance toward conventional antibiotic therapy. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to combat resistant bacterial strain infections associated with common orthopedic device procedures using a unique silicone (Si) polymer released cationic steroidal antimicrobial-13 (CSA-13) in a sheep animal model. The long-term goals of this work are to reduce the incidence of device-related infection, minimize the time required for hospitalization, decrease the expense incurred by the VA Health Care System and patient, and eliminate multiple-stage revision procedures. HYPOTHESES: 1) The 18% weight-to-weight ratio (w/w) CSA-13 in Si polymer combination coating will prevent infection caused by planktonic MRSA in vivo when eluted from the Si polymer coating on a porous coated titanium plug implant. 2) The rate and amount of periprosthetic skeletal attachment within the porous coated region of the plug implant will not be adversely affected by the release of the CSA-13 antimicrobial. PROCEDURES: To test Hypothesis 1 two study groups will be challenged with 200 L of 5x108 colony forming units of planktonic MRSA in phosphate buffered saline. A porous coated titanium (Ti) plug will be implanted into the articulating surface of the right femoral condyle and run for 4 weeks. The infection control (Group 1) will receive a porous coated Ti plug and MRSA suspension to ensure that an infection signal has been generated. The infection challenge (Group 2) will receive a Ti plug coated with a thin film of Si containing the CSA-13 antimicrobial (18% w/w) and MRSA suspension to test the bactericidal efficacy of CSA-13. To test Hypothesis 2 three groups will be utilized to assess the biocompatibility of the CSA-13 combination coating- no MRSA will be used to test Hypothesis 2. The biocompatibility challenge (Group 3) will receive the 18% (w/w) CSA-13/Si coated plug to characterize the effects of CSA-13 on the periprosthetic bone. The polymer control (Group 4) will receive a Si coated plug (without CSA-13) to assess the effects of the polymer, alone, on the adjacent bone to distinguish the effects of  CSA-13 from the Si on skeletal attachment. Finally, the biocompatibility control (Group 5) will receive only the porous coated Ti plug-without CSA-13 or Si to demonstrate skeletal attachment in a material with established biocompatibility. Similar to Hypothesis 1 the plug will be implanted  in the right femoral condyle and two time points will be utilized to assess biocompatibility: 4 and  24 weeks. SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: The success of this antimicrobial combination coating has the potential to significantly improve VA clinical care by reducing costs associated with primary and revision surgeries caused by perioperative device related infections. This research would also greatly improve the veteran's quality of life and reduce the time required for hospitalization and rehabilitation by eliminating, or significantly limiting, the veteran's susceptibility to perioperative device related infections."
"9188810","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates at least 5% of all hospitalizations and up to 30% of cardiac surgeries, increasing mortality and progressing to chronic renal disease in a significant number of patients. Ischemia- reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major pathogenic factor in the development of AKI. Inflammation contributes significantly to the loss of renal function and kidney cell death. CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are renal-protective lymphocytes that raise the threshold of experimental AKI (i.e. mice with reduced Treg numbers are highly susceptible to short ischemic times). In addition, augmenting Treg numbers by IV injection (adoptive transfer) of isolated Tregs to nave mice prior to severe kidney IRI offers marked protection from injury and dysfunction. Our investigation into the mechanism of action for Tregs has revealed that expression of both the cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) and the cell surface protein programmed death 1 (PD-1) by Tregs are required. IL-10 suppresses trafficking and inflammatory mediator production by myeloid immune cells through binding the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R). The consequences of PD-1 on Tregs binding with its ligand PD-L1 expressed on other cells are not currently known. Information from the literature and from our own studies suggest that PD-1 activation would enhance oxidative phosphorylation, CD25 (an important cell surface receptor that promotes Treg function and survival) and IL-10 expression in Tregs. These intracellular consequences of PD-1 activation and their role in protection from kidney IRI will be determined using mouse and human Tregs in Aim 1. Preliminary data demonstrate that antibody-mediated blockade of PD-L1 or the IL-10R in recipient mice, prior to Treg adoptive transfer, negates their protective action in IRI. The cells that must express PD-L1 and the IL-10R to interact with and respond to Tregs and protect the kidney are not known. PD-L1 is expressed on kidney vascular endothelial cells and our preliminary data reveal preferential intraluminal Treg accumulation in the peritubular vasculature during reperfusion. We hypothesize that Treg-mediated protection from AKI requires the expression of PD-L1 on endothelial cells that line the inside of blood vessels, and the IL-10 receptor on myeloid immune cells. We will use mouse models that lack PD-L1 (Aim 2) or the IL-10R (Aim 3) in vascular endothelial cells and myeloid immune cells, respectively, to zero in on the cells interact with Tregs and respond to IL-10 produced by Tregs in a way that is protective to the kidney. These mechanistic studies in mice will provide a platform for future pre-clinical and clinical studies of the therapeutic utility of Tregs and Treg-associated mechanisms in AKI."
"9192229","Project Summary/Abstract: Allergy, asthma, and parasitic infections are characterized by a type 2 immune response, which is initiated and sustained in large part by the type 2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-13. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are in fact the predominant source of IL-5 and IL-13 in early type 2 immune responses, and accordingly, ILC2s have been shown to be important contributors to the immune response in mouse models of atopic dermatitis, allergic lung inflammation, and helminth infection. In addition, recent studies have identified roles for type 2 cytokines and ILC2s in a wider range of biological contexts, including metabolic homeostasis and circadian immunity, but the details of how ILC2s originate and achieve their functions are poorly understood. Tissue-resident ILC2s appear shortly after birth, are long-lived, and can be further expanded by epithelial cytokines. However, whether the adult ILC2 population comprises persistent embryonic cells or whether the cells are being continually replenished is still unclear. Using a combination of lineage tracing (tamoxifen- inducible Cre mice) and labeling methods (doxycycline-regulated reporter mice and EdU labeling), we plan on determining the contribution of prenatal versus postnatal cells to the ILC2 populations in the neonatal and adult lungs (Aim 1). Furthermore, neonatal ILC2s localize to tissues shortly after birth and begin to produce IL-5, but the stimuli for ILC2s at this stage are unknown. Epithelial cytokines, e.g. IL-33, activate ILC2 populations residing at mucosal interfaces such as the lung and intestine, but the individual contributions of these cytokines to homeostatic ILC2 function in these tissues at steady state is still an active area of inquiry. Using two independent approaches (genetic knockout mice and inhibitory antibodies), we will test the requirement of these cytokines for ILC2 function during the neonatal period (Aim 2). In addition, we will assess whether modulation of the ILC2 pool during this neonatal period has long-term effects on host immunity (Aim 3). Investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the tissue ILC2 population arises and how tissue ILC2s are primed for their functions will lead to a better understanding of potential therapeutic targets for allergy and asthma, as well as other diseases influenced by a type 2 immune response."
"9198172","?     DESCRIPTION:          In this revised CDA-2 proposal, Dr. Orff proposes to study a behavioral therapeutic approach, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) for veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and current insomnia.  There are three aims to this project: 1) determine the efficacy of CBT-I relative to Sleep Education in veterans with insomnia following mTBI; 2) evaluate sleep efficiency as a mediator of distal effects of CBT-I on symptoms of comorbid depression and PTSD and global functioning and disability; 3) examine the effects of moderator variables (e.g., depression, PTSD, physical pain) on CBT-I treatment outcomes.  Dr. Orff plans to enroll 70 OEF/OIF/OND veterans who, following baseline assessments, will be randomly assigned to six weeks of either CBT-I or Sleep Education.  The two conditions are matched appropriately for time and attention.  These patients will be followed over the six weeks and assessed for changes in sleep and other outcomes.          Applicant:          Dr. Henry Orff has a 1988 BA in Health and Society and Psychology from University of Rochester, a 2010 PhD in Clinical Psychology from SDSU/UCSD, and post-doctoral appointments.  He has been interested in sleep research since 1996 when he was a research assistant in a sleep lab.  He lists 23 publications, seven of which are first authored.  He was awarded a F31 NRSA pre-doctoral fellowship.  He is at the right point in his career to pursue this CDA-2 award.          Mentor/s:          The mentoring team is excellent and well suited for Dr. Orff's purposes.  All (except Dr. Golshan) are trained as clinical psychologists and all have written strong letters of endorsement.         Elizabeth Twamley, PhD, will be the primary mentor for randomized clinical trials and rehabilitation of veterans with mTBI.  She is Chief of the Neuropsychology Unit, Center of Excellence for Stress and Mental Health, and an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at UCSD.  She has developed and tested two interventions for veterans with TBI.  She is well funded and published and has good mentoring experience.  She will meet weekly with Dr. Orff and devote 5% time.          Philip Gehrman, PhD, will be the mentor for CBT-I and treatment fidelity.  He is the Director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at the Philadelphia VAMC and Assistant Professor of Psychology in Psychiatry at U. Penn.  He focuses on insomnia and is a national trainer for CBT-I.  He is well published and also has good mentoring experience.  He will meet with Dr. Orff by phone or skype and devote 5% time.          Amy Jak, PhD, will serve as the mentor for mTBI and neuropsychology.  She is the Director of TBI Cognitive Rehabilitation at the VA San Diego and an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at UCSD.  She is the co-director of the UCSD/VA psychology internship program.  She is well published and has good mentoring experience.  She will meet with the candidate monthly and devote 5% time.          Sonia Ancoli-Israel, PhD., will serve as a mentor for behavioral sleep medicine and professional development.  She is Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and Medicine at UCSD and Director of the Gillin Sleep and Chronomedicine Research Center.  She is certified in Behavioral Sleep Medicine.  She has had a distinguished career and will meet with Dr. Orff monthly.          Shahrokh Golshan, PhD, will provide biostatistics mentoring at 3% time.          Training Program:          Dr. Orff proposes a training program which will consist of clinical sleep training, TBI training, RCT training, and professional development training.  He will accomplish this through a combination of mentoring, coursework, and attendance at local conferences and national meetings.  These training goals and the approach described are appropriate.          Significance:          To date, there are no studies of CBT-I in this population.  Given the relatively high prevalence of  mTBI in younger veterans and the high co-occurrence of sleep disturbance with both mTBI and psychiatric disorders such as depression and PTSD, this is an important study that could potentially benefit many veterans in VA care.  Furthermore, it is a non-pharmaceutical approach, thereby offering an alternative to potentially harmful and addictive regimens.           Approach:          The approach is a sound one, and considerably improved compared with the previous application.  There are just a few issues that are troublesome.          1) Dr. Orff plans on randomizing subjects in order to keep the research assistant (who will be doing the evaluations) blind.  It is good that the research assistant will not be randomizing; however, ideally a third party (neither assessor nor interventionist) should be doing the randomization to ensure that there is no cherry picking of the subjects.     2) It was unclear who would deliver the control condition.  These individuals should be matched to the CBT-I interventionists as much as possible (e.g., education level, experience).       3) Please describe how the insomnia diagnosis (main study inclusion variable) will be made.          Environment:  The environment is excellent, especially the sleep lab which will be used for baseline and outcome assessments.           Feasibility:  There should be no problem recruiting the 70 veterans who will be enrolled in this study.            Dr. Orff is an excellent candidate for this CDA-2 award.  He has considerably improved this revised application and has assembled an outstanding mentoring team.  Given his extensive experience with sleep research, he is at the right stage of his career to pursue this award.          The aims of this study are straightforward, and the study design follows accordingly.  The four issues of concern are relatively minor and easily fixed.          Ethical/Safety Issues:          The applicant is willing to provide CBT-I to control patients without delay at the completion of their participation in the program.  While this is admirable and may help recruitment, it is not ethical to do so until after the results have been analyzed from all subjects.  It is presumptuous to assume that CBT-I will be superior to Sleep Education (after all, that's why the study is being conducted).           Clinical Relevance:          Insomnia and mTBI are common among younger veterans.  Improving sleep could have salutary effects on conditions that frequently co-occur with mTBI, such as PTSD and depression, as well as functioning and disability.  Additionally, as a non-pharmaceutical approach, it is likely safer than medications with no risk of addiction and fewer side effects.          Budget:  No concerns          Other Issues:  None"
"9204225","PROJECT SUMMARY  The majority of heterosexually transmitted HIV-1 infections are initiated by a single genetically distinct virus selected from a diverse population of viruses, or quasispecies, in the transmitting partner. This genetic bottleneck is an active area of research, as elucidation of shared properties among viruses initiating infection, or transmitted/founder viruses (TFVs), could indicate viral transmission requirements to target in vaccine development. However, the longitudinal impact of TFVs in HIV-1 infection and disease has been largely neglected as a subject of study. Our lab demonstrated that the TFV replicative capacity (RC), as determined by the transmitted gag gene, is significantly associated with HIV-1 proviral burden in central memory CD4+ T cells (TCM) early in infection. High TFV RC is associated with increased proviral burden in TCM cells, a cell subset implicated as a major component of the viral reservoir, or the population of latently infected cells in which integrated HIV-1 DNA can persist for years even during antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment. Additionally, viral RC correlates with set point viral load, and is predictive of CD4+ T cell decline to 300 cells or fewer for five years following infection, indicating a potential lasting role for the TFV in disease progression and infection. We hypothesize, therefore, that TFV fitness determines HIV-1 DNA burden in CD4+ central memory T cells during ART-nave infection and impacts the reservoir via persistence of the TFV or similar variants in latently infected cells. We will test this hypothesis in three ways: first we will determine the relationship of TFV replication and HIV-1 DNA load in CD4+ T cells during early and chronic infection of ART-nave individuals, sampling cells from approximately 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years following infection, as well as shortly prior to ART initiation. Second, we will amplify proviral genes from CD4+ T cells analyzed for HIV-1 DNA burden and viral genes from plasma collected during ART-nave chronic infection, then determine if the TFV or closely related variants are present. Last, we will amplify and sequence proviruses from cells collected during ART treatment to determine if the TFV or closely related variants persist, then measure the replication of the viruses to determine the relationship of TFV replication and reservoir variant replication. Our unique collaboration with the Zambia- Emory HIV Research Program (ZEHRP), in which partners of HIV-1 serodiscordant couples (one HIV+, one HIV- partner) are counseled to prevent transmission, the negative partner is monitored for seroconversion, and followed longitudinally in the event of infection, will facilitate these studies. Technical challenges of sequencing and cloning TFVs can be met with molecular cloning and next-generation sequencing technologies developed in our lab. This project will contribute to an understanding of the effect of the TFV and its fitness on HIV-1 infection, including the potential for a TFV influence on the replication of proviruses in the reservoir. Identifying such an impact of TFV fitness would signify that the early stages of HIV-1 infection are a target for therapeutic strategies to modulate viral fitness for constraining the reservoir, a major barrier to HIV-1 cure."
"9198798","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe and disabling disorder afflicting 7% of individuals in the United States annually and approximately 17% of individuals across their lifetime. Despite multiple investigations demonstrating that both medications and psychotherapeutic interventions are effective in the treatment of MDD, response rates in well-done efficacy trials still reach only 40 to 60%. Response rates in the public sector are even lower. One psychosocial treatment that holds promise for use in the publicly-funded community mental health centers (CMHC) is Behavioral activation (BA). This treatment has been found to be efficacious in the treatment of MDD, particularly severe MDD, and has been used effectively by the types of non-doctoral level clinicians that often deliver treatment in CMHC settings. The purpose of the study proposed here is to examine the feasibility of conducting a study of behavioral activation when implemented in community mental health settings where many patients suffer from severe MDD. In the first phase of the project, consumers, clinicians, and staff at a CMHC will provide input on an existing BA treatment model to tailor it to the CMHC environment. In the second phase of the project, the final treatment manual will be used to train clinicians in BA at the CMHC through workshops, training cases, and a novel online training module designed for training CMHC clinicians in BA. In the third phase of the project, a total of 80 patients with MDD who score 14 or above on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to 9 sessions of BA or treatment-as-usual (TAU) at a community mental health center (CMHC). In addition to feasibility/acceptability of BA and TAU, the study is designed to test whether theoretically important targets of BA (increased activation; increased reward value of activities) change over the course of BA treatment, and whether such changes as associated with changes in depressive symptoms. Patients will also be assessed at baseline and then weekly using the BASIS-24 and at week 6 and week 12 using the HAM-D administered by independent raters. A measure of trait reward processing will be measured at baseline using the Effort- Expenditure for Rewards Task to pilot the use of this measure as a potential moderator of BA treatment effects. The ability of CMHC therapists to adequately implement BA will be assessed by rating taped sessions on BA adherence and competence scales. Successful completion of this project will lead a larger scale effectiveness study of BA in the CMHC setting."

"9213486","Over 47% of American adults aged 30 and over have periodontitis. Further, periodontitis is twice as prevalent in diabetics as in non-diabetics, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) currently afflicts 40 million Americans. T2D-associated periodontitis is severe and, in many cases, refractory to current treatments due to the altered and aberrant functions of bone cells in hyperglycemic conditions. Therefore, developing an effective method to restore and regenerate lost alveolar bone to reserve the natural teeth in diabetics is critically important. Adiponectin, an adipokine, has anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties. We have found that adiponectin inhibits differentiation and activity of osteoclasts and significantly decreases alveolar bone loss. At the same time, it promotes the osteoblast niche and mesenchymal stem cell migration, and enhances bone defect healing. However, adiponectin protein-based therapy has disadvantages that limit its clinical application, including adverse immunoreactions and the need for constant IV injection of high doses for therapeutic effect. An adiponectin receptor agonist, AdipoRon (APR) was recently identified (Nature 503:493-9, 2013), which can be orally administrated to ameliorate insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and prolong the shortened lifespan of diabetic mice. Our preliminary studies indicate that APR upregulates expression and activity of adiponectin receptors exerting favorable effects on bone cell metabolism. Our purpose is to use APR, a small molecule chemical compound, as a novel therapeutic agent to effectively treat diabetic periodontitis. Our central hypothesis is that, in addition to systemically controlling hyperglycemia and inflammation, APR directly triggers molecular signals that correct the imbalance of bone resorption and formation, reversing pathology and promoting regeneration of lost alveolar bone, and allowing the natural teeth to be reserved. In Aim 1 we will first determine the affinity and efficacy of APR binding to adiponectin receptors in bone cells, initiation of downstream signal mediator expression, and enhancement of bone formation. To verify the specificity and affinity of the interaction between this novel exogenous agonist and endogenous receptor, we will use receptor knock out mice. In Aim 2 we will delineate the APR effect in ameliorating and correcting diabetic 'mobilopathy' - in which cell differentiation, recruitment and migration are seriously impaired in diabetes. We will use an adiponectin knock out mouse line to determine if APR can effectively surrogate adiponectin in promoting the necessary microenvironment and deploying sufficient bone forming cells to regenerate alveolar bone damaged in periodontitis. In Aim 3 we will generate experimental periodontitis in a mouse model of diabetes to further determine the overall effects of APR in reducing hyperglycemia and inflammation as well as its anabolic effect for periodontal bone regeneration. This translational research will yield initial characterization of a novel therapeutic agent with strong potential for treating diabetic periodontal disease and provide baseline information for drug development for treating periodontitis and other bone diseases associated with diabetes."
"9205539","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neurotransmitter serotonin is a fundamental modulator of behavior, and serotonin deficiencies lead to numerous debilitating psychiatric conditions, including depression. The number of serotonergic neurons in the nervous system is relatively small, but they modulate the activities of enormous numbers of neurons. To accomplish this, serotonergic neurons send out long-range axonal projections that diffusely arborize in virtually every region of the brain, and elaborate an expansive neural network. However, the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying serotonergic circuitry formation is largely unknown. Recent studies have shown that the protocadherin (Pcdh) ? gene cluster plays an essential role in this process. The three mammalian Pcdh gene clusters (?, ?, ?) encode a large family of homophilic cell surface proteins that are stochastically expressed in random combinations in individual neurons. Genetic studies have shown that Pcdh? proteins mediate dendritic repulsion and self-avoidance in a manner that is similar to that of the fly Dscam1 proteins. We generated Pcdh? cluster deletion mice and found that they display depressive-like behaviors as well as disorganized serotonergic projections, most prominently in limbic structures that mediate emotional processing. The spatial distribution of serotonergic varicosities is randomized in the absence of Pcdh?, possibly due to a loss of repulsion between serotonergic axons. In addition, serotonergic axons in Pcdh? mutants are highly enriched in certain areas of the brain and depleted in others, suggesting that a guidance mechanism is also involved. Remarkably, conditional deletion of Pcdh? genes in serotonergic neurons recapitulates the serotonergic wiring phenotype as well as depressive-like behavior. In contrast, serotonergic wiring and affective function are unchanged when the deletion is restricted in the target areas. A working model for serotonergic axonal arborization is proposed based on these observations, whereby Pcdh? proteins in produced in serotonergic neurons mediate axonal repulsion, and this repulsive force counterbalances target derived guidance cues to define the diffuse distribution pattern of serotonergic axons, which is required for normal affective function The specific aims of this study are designed to rigorously test the validity of this working model and to further understand the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will distinguish the roles of serotonergic neurons and target fields in serotonergic circuit formation, and determine the nature of the serotonergic wiring alterations. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether molecular diversity of Pcdh? proteins plays a role in this process, whether specific isoforms are required, and whether this role is Pcdh?-specific or replaceable by other Pcdh subclasses. In Aim 3, we will carry out single cell RNA-Seq to determine whether Pcdh isoform diversity exist in serotonergic neurons, and identify potential downstream targets mediating serotonergic axonal spacing by using Pcdh? deficient mice and appropriate controls. Knowledge gained from this study is expected to shed new light into circuitry mechanisms of depression and inspire novel therapeutics."
"9213619","Project Summary:  The ability to produce chiral, non-racemic compounds efficiently is central to both the medical chemistry and process chemistry aspects of pharmaceutical synthesis. While a substantial number of useful reactions now exist, many more are needed to more thoroughly access chemical space. The development of new reactions often requires significant empirical screening to achieve a desirable outcome in terms of both reaction yield and stereoisomeric purity. Therefore we are targeting, through a collaborative effort, a comprehensive approach to streamline catalyst optimization. We will address the essential question of how one might ?design? an asymmetric catalyst. Our proposed plan explores how catalyst and substrate structure interact to produce specific outcomes. Careful, classical mechanistic studies that reveal the fundamental mechanistic steps of reactions will be combined with modern physical organic parameterization/modeling techniques developed in the Sigman Group. The combination of these strategies will guide catalyst design and exploration of reaction scope. The field of asymmetric catalysis has come to recognize that the accumulation of weak, noncovalent interactions is critical in a myriad of enantioselective reactions. The unifying feature of the Aims of this project is a framework for understanding these forces as they culminate in efficient and highly selective catalysis. The elucidation of catalyst design strategies that can be adopted by the organometallic, organic and biological communities is our goal. In this context, the three Aims of the proposal evaluate three diverse modes of asymmetric catalysis. The first aim is focused on chiral anion catalysis where the non- covalent interactions responsible for asymmetric catalysis have been historically difficult to define due to the complexity of interrogating the substrate/catalyst contacts. We will exploit new technology developed in the Sigman group aided through previous collaborative studies between the Toste/Sigman and Miller/Sigman labs that allow mathematical relationships to be discovered, relating substrate and catalyst structure to physical organic measurements. This methodology not only allows for effective prediction, and thus the design of better performing catalysts, but also provides a contemporary, data-intensive approach to mechanistic study. In the second aim, we increase the complexity by evaluating organometallic reactions in combination with chiral anion catalysis (sometimes with two chiral elements) to develop a portfolio of new alkene difuntionalization reactions that have been initiated within both the Toste and Sigman labs. In the final aim, we ask questions pertaining to systems with greater dynamic aspects of both substrate and catalyst in the context of small peptide-catalyzed processes studied in the Miller lab. These efforts will test the limits of the modeling techniques as well as potentially impact the broad fields of directed evolution and enzyme catalyst design."
"9216795","Summary Sudden cardiac death kills 180,000 to 450,000 Americans annually. In patients without coronary artery disease, the highest risk of sudden death is in those with cardiomyopathy and intraventricular conduction delay. Furthermore, males experience sudden death almost three times more frequently than females and the reasons for this sex bias are unclear. Identifying the mechanisms underlying cardiomyopathy and conduction disorders may improve screening for patients at risk for sudden death, or outcomes of those revived from cardiac arrest. To date, most known mutations that cause cardiomyopathy are in sarcomere cytoskeletal proteins whereas most familial cardiac conduction diseases (CCD) are caused by mutations in ion channels or channel interacting proteins. However, mutations in cytoskeletal proteins can also cause CCD but the mechanisms linking the cytoskeleton to CCD are not well understood. There is a gene or genes on chromosome 6 (6p22) associated with sudden cardiac death near the cytoskeletal protein CAP2 (Cyclase Associated Protein 2). CAPs are widely conserved cytoskeleton proteins. We first identified CAP in yeast as an adenylyl cyclase binding protein. Additionally, all CAP homologs are actin monomer binding proteins that regulate the balance between actin filaments and actin monomers. Mammals have two CAP isoforms, CAP1 and CAP2. To determine the function of CAP2 in vivo we generated CAP2 knockout (CAP2-KO) mice, both whole body and conditional. Our preliminary data show that whole body CAP2-KO mice are born alive, but many die suddenly shortly after birth, with only ~30% of male CAP2-KO surviving beyond 12 weeks. CAP2-KO mice develop CCD with mild dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The conduction phenotypes are more penetrant in cardiomyocyte-specific CAP2-KO mice, with all mice dying of complete heart block by 25 weeks. Furthermore, genome-wide analysis revealed that several transcriptional networks, including the serum response factor (SRF) network, were upregulated in the hearts of CAP2-KO mice. Based on these findings we hypothesize CAP2 maintains cardiac conduction by modulating SRF signals and fibrotic responses in a sex-specific manner. These studies are relevant to understanding the role of the cytoskeleton and gender specificity in cardiac conduction and sudden cardiac death. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: To test this hypothesis, we propose to (1) Determine the specific role of CAP2 in the cardiac conduction system (2) Determine the role of CAP2 in serum response factor (SRF) signaling, and (3) Determine the role of Secreted Frizzled-related protein 2 in sex-specific sudden cardiac death in CAP2 mice."

"9225979","There is a large and growing population of individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who are of employable age; yet, a disproportionate number of this population is unemployed or under-employed. The discrepancy is present even with individuals who have the skills and training for employment in skilled settings. However, little is known about what facilitates skilled employment for individuals who have potential for success. This project's long-term goal is to develop effective interventions for obtaining and sustaining successful employment for people on the autism spectrum, including those seeking skilled jobs. In order to create such an intervention, we need more information about what makes skilled employment successful or unsuccessful. Therefore the short-term goal of this project is to use a community based participatory research (CBPR) approach to conduct a qualitative study of autistic employees in skilled positions, their employers, and key informants from within the broader employment system to understand their experiences and ideas for change. Our CBPR team, the Academic Autism Spectrum Partnership in Research and Education (AASPIRE) is well-positioned to complete this research with our decade of experience co-conducting research and intervention development with people on the autism spectrum, academic researchers, clinicians, disability professionals, and family members. We will work together to meet the following specific aims: 1) To understand the perspectives of employees on the autism spectrum and their employers, supervisors, or employment support providers who have had a self-identified successful experience in skilled labor, including barriers and facilitators, ways in which autism characteristics help or hinder, and contributing environmental or personal factors. 2) To identify areas of systemic leverage in skilled or professional settings, or in the systems surrounding those settings (e.g., vocational rehabilitation, education or training centers) that could inform an effective intervention. 3) To develop a concrete, specific intervention plan, in collaboration with key stakeholders. 4) To build increased competence in the domain of ASD and employment for our CBPR team. We will achieve these aims in three phases. Phase 1: Co-create consent materials, interview guides, and study protocols with our CBPR team. Phase 2: Conduct 50 semi-structured interviews with individuals on the autism spectrum and their employers, and 10 with key informants from larger employment systems. Phase 3: Collaboratively analyze and interpret interview data and create our theoretical model. Phase 4: Convene an intervention workgroup to identify potential strategies, develop our intervention plan, and obtain feedback from potential intervention targets. We will then use the data, model, and intervention plan from this pilot study to apply for an NIMH R34 grant to implement and test an intervention to improve skilled employment outcomes for individuals on the autism spectrum."
"9228683","Project Summary/Abstract The BrIdGing the Gap to Enhance Clinical Research Program (referred to henceforth as the ?BIGGER? program) will provide a high-quality research experience for students in their gap year, defined as the period after college graduation and prior to enrollment in graduate/professional school. The program will comprise a partnership between Duke University, the University of North Carolina, and North Carolina Central University (the nation?s first liberal arts college founded for African Americans) to enhance the diversity of the clinical research workforce, thereby ensuring that health concerns of underrepresented minorities remain a part of the national research agenda. Students will be exposed to a hands-on research experience that will encourage future research careers, and they will obtain career development tools to foster professional success. The program will expand and complement NIH-sponsored training resources already in place at Duke University under the leadership of the principal investigators, Dr. Kevin Thomas and Dr. Vivian Chu. This leadership structure synergistically combines scientific expertise and connections in cardiovascular disease (Dr. Thomas) with clinical research and career development curriculum expertise (Dr. Chu). In addition, the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) offers formal educational and support programs for junior faculty, fellows, residents, medical students, undergraduates, and high school students, with funding from internal DCRI resources as well as the NIH. The proposed program represents a unique piece in a continuum of NIH-supported training at the DCRI that runs the gamut from the high school-level to mid-career faculty. While the proportion of gap-year students is increasing, there are limited opportunities for these students to engage in a meaningful, career development experience. This program will be ideally positioned to fill this need using an established educational infrastructure with a track record of successful trainees. The program will take place over 6 months. Each participant will be paired with a senior Duke faculty mentor and will be integrated into the work of the mentor?s team for a collaborative research experience. Participants will work on an individual scholarly project, which will be original and hypothesis-driven. For the first 3 weeks of the program, trainees will work with their faculty mentors to develop a solid knowledge base of a specific clinical question based on a thorough review of the literature. During weeks 4-22, the trainees will develop a 6- page thesis consisting of a description of the research question, specific aims, methods, and figures/tables for the study. Throughout the program, didactics will focus on clinical research methods, research ethics, and writing skills and will be taught by Duke faculty and a dedicated medical writer. Trainees will work with their mentors throughout the course of the program to review their progress and the scientific validity of their work. At the conclusion of the program, trainees will present the results of their work to the faculty and staff at the DCRI. Finally, trainees will be followed for 10 years using a web-based database to assess the effectiveness of the training program. The proposed program will result in an improved, more diverse pipeline of future scientists whose practical experience in clinical research will facilitate their entry into research careers."

"9360475","Goals and Objectives: The NIH Center for Interventional Oncology is an interdisciplinary effort with the primary goal of establishing an environment that will bring together multidisciplinary partners who will help define this emerging field of interventional oncology for minimally-invasive image-guided methods for treatment of locally-dominant cancer. A separate report is filed within the NIH Clinical Center (CC), since this multidisciplinary effort is supported by both NCI and CC.  Project Summary: The NIH Center for Interventional Oncology is an interdisciplinary effort with the primary goal of developing and better defining novel local, regional, or combination cancer therapies in patients with localized or organ-confined neoplasms. The goals are achieved via collaborations between imaging scientists, interventional radiologists, oncologists (surgical, medical, radiation, or urological), biologists, chemists, and engineers. The CIO provides a translational environment wherein clinical shortcomings in oncology are identified, then addressed by a collaborative team that develop novel technologies and techniques. Minimally invasive therapies are often less costly, safer, and easy to translate and broadly apply in the setting of the NIH Clinical Center and Intramural Research Program. The Center for Interventional Oncology (CIO) was established in late FY 09 at the NIH Clinical Center (CC) to develop and translate image-guided technologies for localized cancer treatments. The Center is a collaboration involving the CC and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and to lesser extent NIBIB. The Center draws on the strengths of each partner to investigate how imaging technologies and devices can diagnose and treat localized cancers in ways that are precisely targeted and minimally or non-invasive. It will also help bridge the gap between diagnosis and therapy, and between emerging technology and procedural medicine. Advanced imaging methods have ushered in an era of earlier detection of cancers that are frequently localized to a single organ or region. Interventional oncology often provides cancer patients with local or regional treatment options to augment the standard systemic treatment options like: chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. CIO investigators will leverage the interdisciplinary, translational environment at the CC to investigate and optimize how and when to combine drugs, devices, and multimodal imaging navigation. For example, activatable drugs can be injected in a vein or artery, then deployed directly in the tumor with needles or catheters using medical GPS, a technique that enables the physician to navigate through the body with real-time visualization using the latest advanced imaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), cone beam CT (CBCT), or ultrasound. Pre-procedural images are reused to guide devices delivering targeted therapy to the location of the disease, making the procedure more cost-effective because it doesn't require the MRI, CT or PET system used to record the image to be physically present. A prior prostate MRI, for example, can be used to help with guided biopsy or focal ablation by using a medical GPS-enabled needle and ultrasound, without requiring, occupying or tying up an MRI system during the procedure. In another example, a thin needle or sound waves can be used to ablate tumors and enhance targeted drug delivery. Energy sources include high-intensity focused ultrasound, freezing, microwaves, laser, and radiofrequency. Researchers also expand investigations into image-guided drug delivery or image-guided drug painting, where the image can be used to prescribe a particular drug to a specific region, by combining targeted, activate-able drugs with localized energy or heat to deploy the drug within specially engineered nano-particles. The Center provides a forum to encourage collaborations among researchers and patient-care experts in medical, surgical, urologic, and radiation oncology and interventional radiology. The CC provides an exceptional environment for this type of collaborative translational research and patient care. Other major program components include the development of new image-guided methods for personalized drug investigations (or tracking tissue responses to investigational drugs during drug discovery) and first-in-human investigations involving new drugs, devices, image-guided robotic assistance, and nanoparticles. Targeted sequential biopsy is a powerful tool for drug discover or biomarker characterization. Education and cross-training is another important part of the program. Significant gaps exist between the various disciplines, between research efforts and patient care, and between diagnosis and treatment. The gaps may be integrated through advanced image methods for localized therapy. Further, cross-disciplinary training programs in interventional oncology suited to these early disease detect & treat paradigms do not yet exist, but would augment existing programs and underline the unique translational atmosphere at the NIH, where bench-to-bedside is the rule. Specific aims include: 1. Develop training and education in Interventional Oncology 2. Develop novel image-guided methods for smart biopsy and biomarker procurement to support targeted therapeutics 3. Support patient care using novel minimally invasive Interventional Oncology techniques 4. Pursue research in novel techniques and technologies in Interventional Oncology. This program is ideally and uniquely positioned to provide an interdisciplinary environment that combines training, patient care, and translational research to accelerate progress in interventional oncology and molecularly targeted interventions. The focus is upon translational models, translational tools, and actual practical deliverables of translation of multidisciplinary paradigms that meet specific clinical needs."
"9360921","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is immunogenic, with intratumoral Type 1 T-cells forecasting favorable prognosis (1).  Furthermore, aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown in multiple observational studies and clinical trials to be associated with reduction in risk of several cancers (2, 3), particularly malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract.  These cancer preventive properties are especially evident in the colon, where NSAIDs reduce pre-invasive lesions as well as invasive cancer (4).  Evidence suggests that adenomatous polyps are driven by microbe-dependent inflammation (5), reinforcing the notion that the anti-cancer role played by NSAIDs occurs via their anti-inflammatory mechanisms, i.e. suppression of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX1 and 2).  In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that NSAIDs may also oppose carcinogenesis by eliciting anti-cancer Type 1 cellular immune responses (6-9).  As an example, at the interface between anti-inflammatory and immunologic activity, possible mechanisms by which NSAIDs may limit carcinogenesis are by preventing PGE2-mediated inhibition of dendritic cells and inhibiting PGE2-dependent redirection of monocytes from functional TH1-inducing antigen presenting cells into immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (10).  This additional domain of NSAID activity suggests that combining agents such as aspirin with immunologic interventions holds promise in the area of prevention.    Vaccines have a number of advantages in cancer prevention, compared to therapy (11, 12).  They are generally non-toxic and limited intervention can elicit long-lasting immunologic memory, both key features of any intervention in a healthy, though high-risk, individual.  Furthermore, the microenvironment of pre-malignant lesions that define ?high risk? is less likely to have undergone extensive immunoediting and should have a lesser degree of immunosuppressive elements than that of invasive cancerous lesions (11, 13).  In the high-risk colon (including genetic syndromes and colons containing premalignant lesions/adenomas), vaccines designed with appropriate antigenic epitopes are anticipated to reduce progression to invasive cancer, given the immunogenic nature of cancers in this tissue.  Preliminary data support this hypothesis, showing that immunization with antigens derived from genes that are overexpressed and function as ?drivers? in colon carcinogenesis can inhibit tumor development (14).  COX2 and CDC25B, for example, have been shown to prevent development of polyps in 50% of APCMin mice and significantly decrease polyp formation in the other 50%.  The commonality of mechanisms underlying the cancer preventive effects of NSAIDs and vaccines suggests that combining the two approaches may provide synergy, with tumor/adenoma reduction as a primary efficacy endpoint. Investigation of the mechanisms underlying any observed benefits of these interventions in CRC risk reduction will require evaluation of appropriate immunologic endpoints, cellular and possibly humeral."
"9360885","Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States.  Two major phase III PC chemoprevention trials failed to yield results supportive of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the respective agents for prevention.  Selenium and vitamin E, chosen based on promising secondary endpoints in non-PC prevention trials, both failed to show a benefit in PC reduction in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), although an increase in PC was observed with vitamin E.  The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) demonstrated a decrease in PC risk with finasteride, but cancers that did occur tended to be of higher grade, discouraging approval of the agent for a risk-reducing indication. Thus, a need exists for an effective but non-toxic chemopreventive intervention for PC risk reduction.   Aspirin has been shown in multiple observational studies and clinical trials to be associated with reduction in risk of a number of cancers, particularly malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract.  This feature, together with its relative non-toxicity and beneficial cardiovascular effects, suggests aspirin as a promising chemopreventive agent.  Although the benefits are less for PC than for GI cancers, several meta-analyses have shown a 10% reduction in risk of developing or dying from PC in association with aspirin use.  Similarly, randomized trials have demonstrated a decrease in risk of death.  Yet, while prevention of colon and mammary cancers with aspirin has been studied extensively in the preclinical setting, no similar studies have been carried out for PC.  The mechanisms underlying the preventive activity of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are complex. However, their anti-inflammatory activity, including inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases 1 and 2 (COX-1, 2), resulting in reduction of several prostaglandins (PGs) as well as thromboxane A, have held center stage as potential anti-cancer mechanisms.  This may be particularly applicable to PC, which involves inflammation.    Additional mechanisms to explain the anti-cancer activity of aspirin and other NSAIDs have been proposed.  Among these is enhancement of the immune system, suggesting a potential immunological therapeutic effect by these agents.  As one example, evidence suggests that NSAIDs limit carcinogenesis by preventing PGE2-induced maturation of monocytes into immunosuppressive myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).  This additional domain of NSAID activity suggests that combining agents such as aspirin with immunological interventions holds promise in the area of prevention.  Prior to combining aspirin/NSAIDs with immune strategies, however, appropriate preclinical studies of the former alone are required. Prior experience has shown that preclinical efficacy studies are critical predictors of outcomes in follow-up clinical trials in humans.  A stark example is the negative preventive outcomes observed in the SELECT trial which were predicted by animal studies.  A promising example of an animal model of PC is the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion mouse. A recurrent chromosomal rearrangement in PC involves juxtaposition of the 5? untranslated region of the TMPRSS2 gene and ETS family genes, which consist of oncogenic transcription factors such as ERG and ETS. The TMPRSS2 gene is a prostate-specific, androgen-responsive, transmembrane serine protease gene, whereas the ETS and ERG genes encode transcription factors that lead to cell proliferation.  Fusions of the TMPRSS2 untranslated 5? exons to the ERG or ETS ?cancer genes? are observed in about 50% of localized prostate cancers and are generally associated with overexpression of the oncogene (?ERG?) component. When fused, upregulation of TMPRSS2 in response to androgen stimulation leads to activation of the ?ERG? gene component and hence to cell proliferation.  In the genetically engineered TMPRSS2-ERG fusion mouse model, the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion construct is under the control of the ARR2-Probasin promoter, which has been used in previous models of prostate cancer and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia. However, the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion alone does not induce prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a precursor to invasive PC.  Rather, it requires concomitant activation of the PI3 kinase pathway, as for example, via inactivation of PTEN.  Support for the testing of aspirin in a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion mouse model comes from a small population-based case-control study of PC in which a significant reduction in relative risk with aspirin use was observed for fusion-positive cases, but not fusion-negative cases."

"9339111","During this past year DC PFAP has made substantial progress in the following areas  1.  The DC Cohort database has over 9000 patients enrolled.  The program is enrolling at all sites.  Data analysts are looking at merged data. This database is providing unique, real time granularity for the city HIV population.  The data is meshed with the DC Department of Health database to enhance its utility for analyzing the city epidemic. Abstracts and manuscripts are in progress.  2.  The prevention protocols have exceeded expectations in terms of enrolling African American men and women in studies to assess their risk behavior.  Based on superior enrollment and retention of subjects, the DC investigators have been invited to participate In PREP studies have been completed with DC sites being among the leaders in enrollment and retention in follow up.  3. All studies performed are investigator-initiated studies, which recruited almost exclusively among the citys underserved populations. Studies completed in the past three years have included unique studies of various combination regimens in HIV infected and uninfected patients. The program has focused on science-based studies looking at mechanisms of action and correlates of response in tissue and in blood.  This past year has witnessed the publication of studies assessing the efficacy of 4 week regimens. For most patients, such short regiemens have inadequate efficacy, but efforts are underway to identify immunologic and virologic correlates of success for short regimens.  A major study on retreatment of initial treatment failures was also completed and published. This was the first study assessing the feasibility of retreatemth of HCV.   Also completed was an ambitious study to determine whether primary care providers could deliver DAA therapy safely and effectively. This sudy has been presented at major meetings and has engendered a high level of interest since it suggests that the pool of providers capable of treating HCV could be much larger than subspecialists alone. This study will be submitted for publication in the fourth quarter of 2016  4. The program has established new relationships with clinics that serve clients who are sex workers, who have illegal substance use issues and who have sexually transmitted diseases. New studies entitled GRAVITY, CEASE and ANCHOR will explore methods to identify incident cases and newly recognized prevalent cases. The goal is to design a Getting to Zero strategy for the District of Columbia.   This project is fulfilling all of its missions ahead of schedule. The program is working effectively with the DC Center for AIDS Research and with community and academic partners to build a strong AIDS research network in DC."
"9348202","The study is a population based analysis of genetic variation of blood group antigens in three defined, ancient and still conserved Ethiopian sub-populations. Blood samples will be collected in distinct remote areas of Ethiopia and be analyzed at DTM/CC/NIH using standard serologic methods and modern molecular genotyping systems. Samples of red blood cells, plasma, DNA and cDNA will also be stored for future additional study, like high throughput sequencing. The study will allow a systematic analysis of the distribution of blood group antigens in three Ethiopian sub-populations. The populations are known to differ in malaria and sickle cell disease prevalence and environmental factors like other tropical infectious diseases and oxygen pressure. The ethnic group living in the Ethiopian highland is possibly exposed to low oxygen pressure for the longest period of any human population. We expect to describe differences associated with environmental influences (high altitude, low land tropical, and low land desert). We also expect to detect new alleles that may allow novel insight into the correlation of genotypes and phenotypes. The study was examined by the IRB of NHLBI and approved through PCSC on 1/11/2011 as NIH protocol 11-CC-N086."

"9197596","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  In our previous work, we found evidence of large and persistent efficiency differences among healthcare providers - variations in both inputs (utilization) and outputs (risk-adjusted mortality). These studies were largely limited to cross-sectional analysis of the U.S. Medicare population, but we know much less about the dynamic process by which more or less efficient treatments diffuse across providers or regions over time. Nor do we understand the link between provider efficiency - whether costs or outcomes - and the degree of competition and pricing in the under-65 private-pay or Medicaid markets. Finally, how does provider efficiency in the U.S. compare to other countries - does the U.S. over-treat or do other countries ration care? On the question of dynamics, we first ask: given that health care costs have risen over time, was the money spent on efficient (cost-effective) or inefficient treatments? To address this question, we propose to examine specific conditions such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and cardiovascular disease in the Medicare population during 1998-2012, but extend the analysis to other disease. To quantify the idea of changes in efficiency, we develop an efficiency index for hospitals and physician-hospital networks and examine changes over time across regions in response to physician and market characteristics. Second, we focus on the interaction among Medicare, Medicaid, and (in Texas) Blue-Cross/Blue-Shield insurance claims, and how differences in prices, market power, and Medicaid payment policies could affect efficiency in their treatment of Medicare patients, whether through effects on quantities (substitution into Medicare when Medicaid pays little) or quality. Third, we compare efficiency between the U.S. and Canada, a country with fee-for-service reimbursement for physicians but global payments to hospitals. We first normalize prices for treatments to abstract from price differences across countries, and compare the distribution of our efficiency index across providers in both countries. Fourth, returning to U.S. data, we develop a new approach to estimating the relative importance of productive inefficiency (differences in hospital expertise holding costs constant) versus allocative inefficiency (treatments with marginal health benefits and poor cost-effectiveness). We use two data sources; (a) detailed chart review data for AMI patients, and (b) surgical quality in Michigan from Subproject 3."

"9200961","This project is a major part of the Developmental Therapeutics Program drug discovery and development program within the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. The emphasis is on preclinical drug discovery and preclinical drug development.  In Vitro Cancer Cell Line Screen (IVCCLS) ? During FY2007, the cell-line screen added a 60thth tumor cell line, MDA-MB-468, for evaluation of the antitumor activity of both natural and synthetic agents. The screen includes cell lines that represent a variety of cancers, including leukemia, melanoma, and cancers of the lung, colon, brain, ovary, breast, prostate, and kidney. The aim is to prioritize, for further evaluation, synthetic compounds or natural product samples showing selective growth inhibition or cell killing of particular tumor cell lines. The primary screening paradigm was changed to incorporate an initial single drug-dose screen against all 60 cell lines in the screen. Drugs that show activity in the one-dose assay are retested in the standard assay that consists of a 5-concentration test using the 60 human tumor cell lines. The criteria used to identify active agents was developed based on historical data from the 5-dose screen and developed to establish a targeted pass rate of 20?25% and to capture the majority of drugs that have previously been shown to be active in the standard screen. The concept of the one-dose screen is to more rapidly identify active drugs and eliminate inactive compounds so resources can be focused on the active compounds. The 60-cell line screen is unique in that the complexity of a 60-cell line dose response produced by a given compound results in a biological response pattern that can be utilized in pattern recognition algorithms. Using these programs, it is possible to assign a putative mechanism of action to a test compound, or to determine that the response pattern is unique and not similar to that of any of the standard prototype compounds included in the NCI database. In addition, following characterization of various cellular molecular targets in the cell lines, it is possible to select compounds most likely to interact with a specific target.  In Vitro Molecular Targets Screening Program (MTSP) - The In Vitro Molecular Target Screening Program (MTSP) is a dedicated service providing direct support to the DCTD/DTP anticancer drug discovery program. This laboratory has developed the infrastructure and expertise for the operation of cell-free and cell-based high-throughput (HTS) molecular target-based assays. MTSP has developed the staff experience, instrumentation, and information technology infrastructure to carry out screening campaigns with large chemical libraries (>140,000 compounds). Several HTS screening campaigns have been completed and others are ongoing at the present time. In addition, MTSP has gained enhanced molecular biology experience by developing new methods for the transfection of human tumor cells with molecular target genes of interest and by optimizing expression systems for recombinant proteins to be utilized as reagents for our HTS molecular target screens. To complement these primary screens, the laboratory has developed assays for secondary testing of compounds showing activity in various HTS screens."

"9344510","THE SISTER STUDY We will study environmental and genetic risk factors for breast cancer in a cohort of 50,000 sisters of women who have had breast cancer. In the United States, there were approximately 192,000 new cases of breast cancer in 2001, with more than 200,000 cases expected in 2002. Breast cancer accounts for over 30% of all new cancer cases among women and 15% of cancer deaths. The etiology of breast cancer is complex, with both genetic and environmental factors playing a role. By focusing on a genetically susceptible group, more precise estimates of the contribution of environmental and other non-genetic factors to disease risk may be possible. The cohort will be followed actively for the development of breast cancer and other diseases. We expect, on average, 300 new cases of breast cancer to be diagnosed each year in a cohort of 50,000 sisters aged 35-74 years. Thus, after five years of follow-up, we will have sufficient power, with about 1,500 new breast cancer cases, to address many key hypotheses regarding gene-environment interactions. Baseline questionnaires, banked blood, urine, and toenail samples, as well as banked environmental samples will provide a rich resource for testing current and future hypotheses regarding breast cancer risk. Follow-up questionnaires will update exposure and medical histories as well as provide an opportunity to collect new data and environmental samples to evaluate emerging hypotheses. Nested case-control or case-cohort analyses will be carried out among sisters who develop cancer and a sample of those who do not, to assess specific gene-environment interactions. Once assembled, the cohort also will provide the structure for assessing gene-environment interactions in risk for other diseases and will provide opportunities for add-on studies. THE TWO-SISTER STUDY We also will enroll 1,600 sisters recently diagnosed with breast cancer, who were under 50 when diagnosed, and whose sister is a Sister Study participant. We will collect DNA from the affected sister and from their parents, creating a nuclear family foursome or ?tetrad.?

"9354088","The management of children with pediatric mastocytosis poses a challenge. There is a limited information as to the application of clinical and laboratory findings and bone marrow evaluation as they relate to medical intervention and prognosis. The diagnostic criteria for pediatric mastocytosis are largely based on adult studies. There is very little data about bone marrow pathology in children with mastocytosis. We evaluated the use of the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for the diagnosis of systemic disease in pediatric patients. Bone marrow biopsies were analyzed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and KIT mutational analysis. Complete bone marrow evaluations were performed in 50 cases. Seven children had repeat procedures. We identified unique clinico-histopathological features within the biopsies. Bone marrow biopsies displayed mildly atypical hematopoietic maturation, increased hematogones and hypocellularity in a sub-set of patients with urticaria pigmentosa, diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis and indolent systemic mastocytosis. Hypocellularity was most pronounced in those with urticaria pigmentosa. Hematogone increases were highest, on average, in patients with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis or mastocytomas. There was no evidence of peripheral blood cytopenias, myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasm or leukaemia within this cohort. Long-term follow-up of patients within this study (median 6.9 years; range 1-25 years) showed that all patients remained clinically stable without progression to a more aggressive variant. We conclude that the WHO criteria are applicable for the diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis in pediatrics."

"9355440","Characterization of Platelet Function in Patients with Bleeding Disorders: In FY2015 (the fourth year of this project) we have studied several patients with suspected or documented disorders of platelet function and have identified patients with deficiency of dense granules (storage pool disease), and characterized platelet function in people with congenital or acquired platelet dysfunction.  The ability to make a reliable, detailed characterization of platelet function may help investigators who are studying genetics of inherited platelet disorders. One family with abnormal platelet function and other abnormalities has been described and submitted to the journal Blood for consideration to be published (York Platelet Syndrome, T. Markello et al, authors and collaborators). Another patient has been identified who has a novel platelet disorder that may be a variant of Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. He has been referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Program (NIH/NHGRI) for further analysis and possible genome sequencing to identify the basis of this disorder.  Characterization of D-Dimer and Related Coagulation Proteins in HIV-Infected Research Subjects Undergoing IL-2 Therapy: During the fourth year of this project, in support of intramural NIH research protocols, we have measured D-dimer levels and numerous coagulation parameters in research subjects who are infected with HIV or who are normal volunteers. We seek to correlate the D-dimer levels with these various parameters to gain insights into the mechanism for the observed elevations in D-dimer levels in HIV infected patients that correlate with increased morbidity and mortality.  Markers of Endothelial Cell Injury and Thrombosis in Patients Undergoing Cancer Chemotherapy. During this year of the project, in support of intramural NIH research protocols, we measured various markers of hemostasis (von Willebrand factor, thrombomodulin, E-selectin, etc.) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that were treated with the recently-approved Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Some of these patients had mild bleeding while on the study. We then analyzed platelet aggregation in these patients and controls, as well as agammaglobulinemic patients with deficiency of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Our  findings (manuscript by Lipsky et al, co-authors and collaborators, now published in the journal Haematologica) suggest that ibrutinib induces mild defects in platelet function not seen in patients with Bruton's tyrosine kinase deficiency, which may account for the excess bleeding seen in such patients.

We have identified a set of  800 DNA samples from patients with severe hemophilia A in an NHLBI repository and have IRB approval to determine their factor VIII protein-coding polymorphisms to determine the effect of factor VIII haplotype on inhibitor development. We expect to complete the DNA sequence determinations in the coming fiscal year, and will see if the effect of protein coding polymorphisms on inhibitor development that was seen in a minority population (African-Americans) can be seen in the population as a whole.

"9354072","Analytics (Objective 1)  The SSA adjudication process is dynamic, involving a complex sequence of decisions by several offices within SSA as well as the decisions and resources of the claimants themselves.  NIH undertook an overarching project, the Adjudication 1 project, to comprehensively model this process.  Project goals are to:  1. Develop analytical tools to analyze various aspects of the adjudication process in terms of accuracy, consistency, and timeliness; 2. Develop tools to predict how the system responds to external shocks; 3. Develop methods to analyze data taking into account the multi-stage application process in which data are collected; 4. Develop tools to assist with the disability determination process; 5. Quantify the extent to which SSA can adjust the system to respond to changes; 6. Derive useful statistics to monitor and adjust program performance, based on important outcomes measures (accuracy, timeliness, consistency).  Case Status Change Model and Queuing Theory:  This project aims to develop methods to analyze system timeliness, measure processing times, and derive optimal flow characteristics. Our work in the area of system timeliness took on two complementary directions. To study system delays, we built a queuing model for the adjudication system that allows the user to obtain system performance statistics. Addressing the separation between wait times and processing time is our second direction of inquiry.  For this purpose, we developed a batch processing model. To date, we have scripted code to obtain the needed transition probabilities, determined the rate at which jobs enter the system, completed the queue code, and estimated the distributions of processing/waiting times by using three techniques.    Assessing the Predictive Quality of Evidence: The ROC estimation method for clustered data has been applied to simulated data and two real examples in diagnostic medicine. Our method shows more accurate results than existing methods. This method was mainly developed for evaluating a single classification criterion. For multiple classification criteria from the same set of observations, it is important to account for the correlation among these criteria.   Case review nominator:  The SSA evaluates adjudicated claims for benefits administered by SSA. As a result of the wide varieties of language that might be used, reviews focused on particular issues are typically limited to samples that included entire populations without any ability to screen out unlikely cases.  With assistance from SSA's staff, NIH developed an automated document classification tool to identify cases with specific issues. The tool used a set of labeled legal documents to build predictive models for identifying new cases of interest. We implemented the automated document classification tool in Python, using Python NLTK and Scikit-learn for text processing, normalization, and feature extraction, as well as Python Scikit-Learn or Weka for feature selection and classification. We have expanded the classification algorithms available in the tool, and we implemented parameter selection methodology to optimize the document classification model parameters. We optimized the parameters of the document classification models for the SSA Case Review Nominator by running over 10,000 combinations per model to find the best parameters. We also expanded the performance metrics available for reporting and optimizations to include F-measure, precision, recall, and overall accuracy. Because SSA was interested in optimizing the model precision, we delivered to them a model that had 80% accuracy and 94% precision, and 73% recall. SSA started testing the model in production this year, and we are exploring potential uses in another SSA component- the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR).   Data Mining Feasibility Study: We are pursuing three areas of inquiry: methods of information retrieval (IR) for measuring relevance of documents, methods in natural language processing (NLP) for extracting medical records, and partial NLP methods for analyzing decision files. We performed optical character recognition (OCR) on over 500,000 decision files and developed an optical mark recognition tool to extract check box information from SSA RFC forms and applied it to the 500,000 downloaded forms with an estimated accuracy of 91%. We are in the process of refining methodology to extract text box fields from the RFC forms. We also investigated the different types of medical evidence available in SSAs electronic claimant folders.   Listings nominator:  Under current SSA rules, the presence of a condition that meets criteria in the Listings of Impairments (or that is of equal severity) is considered sufficient to establish medical considerations for allowances. We are currently building a tool for SSA to quickly find relevant listings from the Listings of Impairments. We are using natural language processing to extract information from the medical records and to create a more formal representation of the listings. To date, we parsed through most information in the Listings downloaded from SSAs website and are devising information retrieval methods to automatically identify ICD and CPT codes relevant to the listings inside the medical documents.  We hired a medical annotator to assist in identification of functional terms.   Medical Continuing Disability Reviews: The objective of this project is to find ways to improve the CDR process and reduce the backlog of cases for review. This year, we began learning about the current CDR process and how we may improve its different components. We identified the lack of structured medical and functional evidence as the main limitation of this process. We identified key areas of improvement using data analytics provided the right data could be acquired or extracted and have prepared a final paper of our findings, which will be published and disseminated by the SSDI Solutions Initiative.  CAT development (Objective 2)  The NIH/RMD previously awarded a contract to the Boston University Health and Disability Research Institute (BU-HDRI) to develop a comprehensive set of tools to characterize the full continuum of individual capabilities (i.e. human function) relevant to work.  This method uses Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) coupled with Item Response Theory (IRT).    The development of CAT tools (also known as the Functional Assessment Battery or FAB) is a sequential process; one step must be completed before advancing to the next step. A calibration study was conducted to refine the item pools for the Daily Activities and Learning and Applying Knowledge. Additionally, Westat, a research survey firm, conducted replenishment testing of items for the first two domains, physical function and behavioral health, as well as legacy validation on all item pools. Boston University has embarked on a number of additional post development studies to enhance the functionality, utility, and comprehensiveness of the instruments.  NIH plans to monitor claimant outcomes for a period of two years, assessing the predictive capacity of the instruments developed under this protocol. Upon expiration of the period of performance for this contract, BU-HDRI submitted a final report detailing efforts during the collaboration.  NIH intends to execute a new contract with BU this FY to continue refinement of the instruments and explore implementation opportunities within the SSA process.

"9354074","This study was closed last year to recruitment and in now in data analysis.  Our work has contributed significantly to evidence-based guidelines as adjunct therapy for the treatment of PAH patients in an updated treatment algorithm published by the American College of Cardiology (ACC).  Findings from our RCT contributed to the ACC suggesting an upgrade to the recommendation for rehabilitation and exercise training for patients with PAH to Class 1 with a Level of Evidence: A. (Galie et al, 2013).  While the benefits of aerobic training are proven for patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure, its utility for patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been unclear.   In our study, we are seeking to understand the cardiorespiratory mechanisms that limit peak oxygen consumption (VO2) in patients with PH and to determine whether these mechanisms are reversible by aerobic exercise training. We also focus on relationships between indices of these mechanisms and indices of performance such as 6-minute walk distance, peak treadmill work rate, and peak exercise time. We are using a battery of self-report scales to investigate the effect of aerobic training on mood, physical activity, fatigue, and exercise readiness. Thus, our clinical trial is aimed at determining, in patients with PH, the gross mechanism by which cardiorespiratory function is limited, whether aerobic exercise training reverses this mechanism, the extent to which reversal of the limiting mechanism actually improves physical performance; and the effect of aerobic training on health related quality of life and physical activity.  This project has two main clinical research arms. The first is a phase II clinical trial that evaluates the safety and effectiveness of aerobic exercise training on cardiorespiratory fitness and health related quality of life in patients with PH. After screening and physician exam, patients with PH qualifying for study first complete a 6-minute walk test. After a 45-minute rest period, the subjects then complete self-report questionnaires on general fatigue, mood, physical activity, and overall quality of life. Patients then undergo symptom-limited peak treadmill exercise tests to volitional exhaustion. During the symptom-limited treadmill tests, cardiorespiratory measurements are made including pulmonary gas analyses, cardiac output, and near infrared spectroscopic measures of muscle oxygen extraction. After the test battery is complete the subject is randomized to either a protocol of patient education plus aerobic exercise training or patient education only. Those in the education plus exercise group attend classes on topic of importance regarding living with PH as well as three weekly sessions of treadmill walking exercise at an intensity of 70 to 80 percent of their heart rate reserve. Patients exercise for 30 to 45 minutes per session. The education only group receives identical education classes but does not exercise. Both the education plus exercise training and the education only regimens last for a duration of 10 weeks. Patients in both groups repeat all of the 6-minute walk test, questionnaires, and the treadmill tests. Pre- and post-training changes are compared between the groups. Main outcome variables are peak oxygen consumption and 6-minute walk distance.  In the second arm of the project, baseline symptom-limited peak treadmill test results in the patients with PH will be compared to results of sedentary but otherwise healthy control subjects. We will determine if muscle oxygen extraction, and cardiac output is diminished in the patients with PH at baseline. Moreover, this study arm will help us to determine whether, in patients with PH, exercise training-induced changes in the physiological response pattern trend toward normal.  There are also two sub-studies in this project. In the first sub-study, subjects in the control group crossover to an exercise only group. The group originally receiving education only will complete the 6-minute walk, questionnaires, and peak treadmill test. Following an exercise training regimen that is identical to the education plus exercise group, the group originally receiving education only will again undergo these tests. Data will be compared before and after training. This sub-study will discern the cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise between the education plus exercise group and the group originally receiving only education. In the second sub-study, we are examining the training adaptation in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) who do not have PH. Patients with ILD will undergo an exercise training regimen identical to the one used for training patients with PH. Responses and adaptations will be compared. This sub-study is important for data interpretation since many of our patients with PH also have ILD.  Total Number of Subjects Enrolled = 97 Total Number of Subjects Enrolled in the current year = 0 Total Number of Subjects Enrolled that dropped = 9 Total Number of Subjects Enrolled that dropped this year = 0  Pulmonary Hypertension = 30 Interstitial Lung Disease = 15 Healthy = 52  Though the sample size was small, our RCT has shown that trained PAH patients reached higher levels of physical activity, decreased fatigue severity, improved 6-min walk distance (6MWD), cardiorespiratory function, and patient-reported quality of life as compared with untrained controls. Our research was also referenced in a panel discussion on Exercise and Pulmonary Rehabilitation at the 2014 International PH Association Conference in Indianapolis, IN, where the consensus of medical opinion stated exercise in a supervised setting is critical for PH patients (Bull et al, 2014).  Interpreting our findings to date has provided our team with opportunities to identify additional important research questions within our means to answer.  We will also utilize healthy volunteer data collected in this study to compare to data collected in our randomized controlled exercise trial for patients with interstitial lung disease without pulmonary hypertension.  The basis for the randomized trial for ILD and exercise was established by our work with PAH and exercise where we observed more efficient cardiorespiratory function, increased physical work capacity, and improved health related quality of life (HRQoL), following AET in an uncontrolled arm of patients with ILD without pulmonary hypertension.

"9354090","Our work in this area has two broad areas of focus: (1) application of nanopore sequencing technologies to MDR plasmids from clinical isolates, and (2) application of RNA-seq to understand gene expression from these plasmids.  In this research, we seek both to evaluate sequencing methods that can be used practically in a clinical microbiology lab and to study the biology of plasmid gene expression.  A longstanding problem in the sequencing of bacterial isolates is the difficulty (or impossibility) of assembling plasmids to closure using short read sequencing technologies.  Given that the virulence factors and resistance genes constituting the most clinically important parts of pathogen genomes are carried on plasmids, a practical, bench-top solution to plasmid sequencing would be valuable for infectious disease diagnostics and epidemiology in the clinical microbiology lab.  Benchtop nanopore sequencing technologies offer a potential practical solution to this problem given their very long-read sequencing capabilities.  Work done during the current fiscal year involved developing and optimizing SOPs for the nanopore sequencing device and benchmarking performance against known reference sequences.  Global gene expression analysis using NGS technology (RNA-seq) offers a powerful approach to study the large-scale structure of transcription and transcriptional regulation.  In these experiments, we are employing strand-specific methods to distinguish antisense from overlapping sense expression, and regulatory antisense RNA expression will be studied with this technique.  Work done during the past fiscal year involved developing and optimizing RNA-seq SOPs.  Work during the current fiscal year has produced rich RNA-seq data sets from plasmids from a number of clinical isolates, currently under analysis."

"9188542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There were approximately 00,000 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving dialysis in the United States at the end of 2013. ESRD has a substantial impact on mortality, morbidity, health care cost and quality of life. The preferred therapy, kidney transplantation, is in relatively short supply; e.g., less than 15,000 kidney transplants occurred in the U.S. in 2013, with about 99,000 patients remaining on the wait list at year end. Problem: Given that mortality and hospitalization rates are quite high among ESRD patients, flexible, broadly applicable and easily implementable methods of analysis are required for modeling hospitalization, death, and the two processes simultaneously. Existing methods either fail to target quantities of interest in Aims 1-3 (below), or do so using strong assumptions which limit their applicability. Overall Objective: The overarching goal of this project is to deveop survival analysis methodology to support analyses that will produce a deeper understanding of morbidity and mortality patterns among ESRD patients. Such increased understanding should lead to improvements in renal replacement therapy and, in turn, improved survival and quality of life among ESRD patients. Target Audience: With respect to methodology, the target audience includes biostatisticians, particularly practitioners studying ESRD and other chronic illnesses. Results based on the proposed analyses would be of interest to nephrologists, transplant surgeons and ESRD patients. Products: Novel and innovative methods for the analysis of survival and recurrent event data. Specific Aim 1: Recurrent/terminal events with covariate-dependent association Methods for jointly analyzing recurrent (e.g., hospitalization) and terminating (e.g., death) event data will be developed, then applied to the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS). Specific Aim 2: Process regression for hospital-free survival Methods for modeling the probability of survival and being out-of-hospital will be developed and applied to DOPPS data. Dependent censoring is accommodated, and probability patterns over follow-up time need not be estimated. Specific Aim 3: Direct modeling of restricted mean survival time Methods will be developed for directly modeling mean survival time (capped at a pre-specified value). Application will be to pre-transplant mortality among patients wait-listed for kidney transplant, using Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) data. For each Aim, the methods will be easily implementable since pertinent software will be developed."
"9197585","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the past 10 years, this PPG has focused on documenting persistent inefficiency in U.S. healthcare. Yet we still have an incomplete understanding of the sources of Inefficiency. Nor are our methods and measures adequate to study how policy changes arising in the public or private sector will affects costs and quality. Finally, we are concerned about potential unintended consequences of policy changes adversely affecting vulnerable patients. This PPG application addresses these gaps with 5 distinct subprojects: Healthcare Efficiency among High Need, High Cost Patients. We use Medicare, Medicaid, and nursing home data to study the cost and quality of care for high-need and often high-cost patients within physician-hospital networks. We will study how these high-need patients are affected as healthcare systems evolve - will systems improve the continuity of care for high-need costly patients, or instead seek to shed them?  Efficiency of Prescription Drug Use in the Medicare Population. Physician-hospital networks are used to measure differences across patients in their use of efficient and inefficient pharmaceutical use, and the implications for outcomes and downstream costs. We focus on patient cohorts with hip fractures and AMI, as well as under-age-65 disabled Medicare enrollees, African-Americans, and the oldest-old.  Understanding and Improving Episode-based Hospital Care. Using a unique dataset on surgery in Michigan hospitals, we seek to understand variations in surgical safety/quality and in healthcare expenditures during the Initial admission and post-discharge. A key question is how Medicare bundled payment reform will affect quality for the over-65, and whether there are spillover effects to the under-65.  Measurement and Determinants of Healthcare Efficiency. We estimate models of provider efficiency in static models (with Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance data when available), between the U.S. and Canada, and with dynamic measures (looking at changes overtime in AMI treatments).  Advancing Measures for Risk Adjustment and Performance Assessment. To improve risk adjustment, we develop new health measures from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Medicare. We also pilot patient-reported and biomarker-based measures of health in three sites across the U.S. (Dartmouth, Pennsylvania, and Kaiser Colorado), and further study how feedback to clinicians affects care quality. All 5 subprojects are supported by an Administrative Core, a Data Core, and a Measurement Core."

"9373638","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder that affects approximately 100,000 people in the USA, primarily of African descent. Single E6V mutation in b-globin gene leads to the production of hemoglobin S (HbS) and development of chronic hemolytic anemia. Our recent analysis of a national hospital discharge survey showed an association of SCD with lower frequency of HIV-1 diagnosis (odds ratio 0.33) suggesting that SCD might offer a protection from HIV-1. We hypothesize that hemolytic anemia in SCD leads to inhibition of HIV-1 transcription through the activation of heme-, iron and oxygen-dependent pathways. Heme induces transcription of iron regulatory genes in macrophages, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), ferritin and iron export protein, ferroportin leading to the increased iron export and reduction of cellular iron. In SCD, expression of HO-1 is increased whereas expression of hepcidin that regulates internalization and degradation of ferroportin is decreased (and also our preliminary data). Induction of HO-1 by heme inhibits HIV-1 infection in macrophages and T-cells in vitro and in HIV-1 infected humanized mice. We have previously shown that HIV-1 transcription is inhibited by iron chelators or ferroportin. Iron chelators inhibi cellular activities of CDK2 and CDK9, both critical for HIV-1 transcription. Our recent findings demonstrate that CDK2 directly phosphorylates CDK9's Ser90 resulting in the activation of HIV-1 transcription. We, therefore, hypothesize that increased blood heme concentration, ischemia and decreased hepcidin will elevate levels and activity of HO-1 and ferroportin, reduce cellular iron and upregulate HIF-1 pathway leading to the induction of Egr-1, p21 and inhibition of CDK2 and CDK9. Upregulation of this protein network will lead to the inhibition HIV-1 transcription and viral replication in SCD condition. In Specific Aim 1, we will analyze HIV-1 inhibition in SCD and SCD trait. In Specific Aim 2, we will analyze molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 inhibition in SCD and SCD trait. In Specific Aim 3, we will analyze novel inhibitors HO-1, ferroportin and hepcidin pathways in vivo. Collectively, our proposed research is designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 inhibition in the settings of SCD and SCD trait. Our studies will uncover novel mechanisms of HIV-1 regulation by heme, ferroportin, hepcidin, and iron. Our proposed studies are significant because they may lead to novel therapeutics, such as the use of hemin and iron chelators."

The Repository of Mouse Models for Cytogenetic Disorders (Mouse Repository) began in the 1970s to generate and distribute mouse models for cytogenetic disorders, with special emphasis on Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21).  The creation of mouse models relevant to DS began in the 1970s and continued with the demonstration  of genetic synteny between a segment of mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16) and human chromosome  21 (Hsa21 ), which led to the use of the trisomy 16 mouse (Ts16) as a model for studies relevant to DS.  Genes present on Hsa21 were localized to mouse chromosomes 17 and I 0 (Mmu17 and Mmu l 0) as well.  Pattial trisomies for a number of syntenic chromosomal segments were generated in the 1980s, under contract to NICHD.  One of these partial trisomies, designated Ts65Dn, proved to include approximately 150 genes located in what is considered the Down syndrome critical region of Hsa21. Subsequently, these mice were produced and distributed, under an NICHD contract, to investigators approved for receipt of them by NICHD.  During the last 22 years, various investigators have generated other models relevant to DS.  These include, but are not limited to, TslCje, Ts2Cje, TslRhr, MslRhr, Tel, and others.  When these strains and stocks have been made available to the research community, the creation of a central repository has ensured their maintenance on appropriate genetic backgrounds and their distribution to investigators upon request in a timely manner and subsequent to approval by NICHD. Many of these mouse strains are maintained under cryopreservation. In 2010, the NICHD reissued the contract A Repository of Mouse Models of Cytogenetic  Disorders with a substantial increase in investment to ensure timely access to and increased availability of mouse models for cytogenetic disorders, particularly Ts65Dn, to the research community, and to ensure increased experimental efforts to modify the existing genetic backgrounds for the various strains to increase availability and ease of use by investigators. A substantial number of responses identified the need for increased availability of the mouse models to the research community as a priority issue."

"9351806","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the identification of the main components of the mammalian apoptotic pathway, the differences in the regulation of apoptosis in various primary cells remain surprisingly unexplored. Our unique ongoing contribution to the apoptosis field has been to define how different cell types set the apoptosis threshold to optimally matche their physiological functions and adapt to changing environments. Indeed, we believe that new paradigms of apoptosis regulation remain to be discovered in physiologically distinct cell types. Our lab has discovered that the apoptotic pathway is highly restricted in postmitotic cells such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, and myotubes, as compared to mitotic cells such as fibroblasts. While a strict regulation of apoptosis is critical for the long-term survival of postmitotic cells,  mitotic cells need to maintain their ability to activate apoptosis rapidly as they can be at continual risk of becoming cancerous. Therefore, cells must efficiently balance the need for having a primed apoptotic pathway versus the risks associated with cell death. In fact, we have seen this best exemplified in embryonic stem (ES) cells which engage mechanisms that both prime the apoptotic pathway for rapid death in response to DNA damage, while also engaging cell survival mechanisms in response to mitochondrial damage. Thus, ES cells appear to have an exquisite capability to respond to the specific damage stimuli with mechanisms that ensure both genomic integrity and optimal survival.  In this MIRA proposal, we wish to use both targeted and broad integrative approaches to examine the distinct mechanisms of apoptosis regulation and define their physiological importance in health and disease. Our focus is on the two extremes of the apoptosis control we identified: 1) Mechanisms that resistant apoptosis and promote survival after mitochondrial damage (e.g. our findings that the E3 ligase PARC mediates the degradation of cytosolic cytochrome c), and 2) Mechanisms that prime cells for rapid apoptosis (e.g. our discovery that Bax is maintained in an active state in stem cells). We will use primary neurons and human embryonic stem (hES) cells, conduct innovative screens and examine disease implications in models of cancer and neurodegeneration. In particular, we are excited that the MIRA opportunity would enable our ambitious plans to use the powerful capability of hES cells to define how the apoptotic machinery undergoes dynamic changes with cellular differentiation."
"9352009","By developing a large database of BAL fluid linked to specific microbiologic diagnoses, we plan to define protein expression signature response profiles that distinguish specific etiologies of lung infection and inflammation.  These signature profiles will be based on mass spectrometry, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and suspension array technologies.  Because of the variability associated with individual host responses to infection due to differences in host immunity, sampling time effects, and external factors such as antibiotic or anti-inflammatory therapies, a large database will be required.  The profiles of culture-negative BAL fluid will be of similar interest to assist in defining non-infectious etiologies of lung inflammation.  A secondary objective is to perform proteomic analysis on serum collected from patients at the time of bronchoscopy. The goal is to link serum proteomic profiles to BAL proteomic profiles to determine whether a less invasive technique can predict infiltrate etiology with comparable sensitivity and specificity to BAL profiles.  To complement the patient studies we have investigated protein biomarkers in blood and lavage from animal models of pneumonia. We have studied a rabbit model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (Proteomics 2010;10: 4270-4280) and a canine model of staphylococcal pneumonia (Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 2007;293;H2487-500). Exploring these model systems will facilitate our identification of candidate biomarkers across species.  We have recently developed new mass spectrometry-based protocols to detect bacterial peptides in bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with pneumonia. Identifying peptide biomarkers that are specific and unique for a pathogen offers the possibility of a method with higher sensitivity to detect bacteria in BAL. We have developed two methods (top down and bottom up approaches) that can be applied to clinical samples in order to rapidly identify Gram-negative pathogens. The former approach requires the removal of leukocytes, use of high performance liquid chromatography  mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and deconvolution of the resultant ions to a database (Biotyper) that can be interrogated for the identification of the microorganism. The bottom up approach is based upon the creation of a theoretical tryptic core peptidome from genomic data and comparison with peptides generated from tryptic digests of bacteria that are analyzed by LC/MS-MS. The specificity of the peptides for a particular strain or species of bacteria is done by proteomic database analysis (Unipept, pBLAST) and then validated experimentally with lysed bacteria with labeled targeted peptides. We have recently used this approach to rapidly identify strain-specific peptide markers of Acinteobacter baumannii based on LC-MS/MS profiling of digested peptides (Clin Chem. 2016 Jun;62(6):866-75.). Clinical application of these methods is ongoing.   We have a total of 588 clinical samples from 437 different subjects.  Of the 437 subjects, 1 subject specified that their samples could not be shared with outside investigators.  All subjects underwent the clinically indicated bronchoscopies and no samples were collected purely for research.  The total number of pediatric subjects enrolled to date is 30.  Approximately one half of the participants have a specific microbiologic diagnosis as a cause of their pulmonary infiltrates.  Enrollment thus far in the cases of interest includes:  Aspergillus species 58, P. jiroveci 63, Cytomegalovirus 61, Mycobacterial species 41, and Bacteria (gram negative or gram positive) 117.  Approximately 50-60% of these infections occur with more than one microbial pathogen (i.e. Aspergillus species and cytomegalovirus).  Infections with only a single pulmonary pathogen are somewhat less common than co-infection states.  New samples of the bronchoalveolar lavage and blood are currently being analyzed."
"9352010","At present, there are no clear guidelines as to when antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should be stopped in the setting of elevated liver enzymes.  In large part, this is due to a limited understanding of the natural history of ARV-related hepatotoxicity.  We have undertaken a pilot study (Caryn Morse is PI) to estimate the prevalence of hepatic fibrosis in a cohort of HIV-infected patients who have chronically elevated transaminases while on ARV therapy in the absence of Hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) coinfection.  Liver biopsy specimens are being evaluated for fibrosis by microscopic examination, the current gold standard for assessing the nature and severity of liver disease.  Fibrosis, as well as other histopathology, is being measured using a validated scoring system.  Sixty-two patients have enrolled in the study and undergone liver biopsy.  Significant liver abnormalities, primarily steatohepatitis, but also fibrosis, have been seen in the 40 patients.  A paper describing the histopathologic abnormalities and clinical correlates of these patients was recently published.  We plan to continue to follow these patients long-term to better understand the natural history of these liver abnormalities.  We have also examined the predictive value of Fibroscans, which were performed in parallel with other evaluations, for identifying fibrosis in patients with elevated transaminases but without HBV or HCV co-infection. This study will provide clinically relevant information on the significance of elevated transaminases in HIV-infected patients without co-infection with HCV or HBV, and facilitate management of such patients.  Progressive liver disease has become an important non-opportunistic complication of HIV infection in the HAART era.  Liver fibrosis is a significant problem in HIV-infected patients, including those with HCV co-infection, as well as, based on the study summarized above, in patients without HCV infection.  Agents that can prevent progression of fibrosis, and potentially even reverse fibrosis, may thus provide clinical benefit, but to date no effective drug has been identified that can consistently prevent progression of fibrosis.  Recently a monoclonal antibody that targets LOXL2, an enzyme involved in collagen synthesis, has been found in animal models to be effective in preventing as well as reversing fibrosis.  A humanized form of this antibody has been developed and has entered phase 1 clinical trials.  We have completed a phase 1 clinical trial with this antibody (Caryn Morse is PI) in 3 groups of patients with biopsy-documented liver fibrosis: HIV mono-infected patients, HCV mono-infected patients, and HIV-HCV co-infected patients.  The primary endpoint of this study was safety, and secondary endpoints included effect on liver fibrosis based on pre- and post-treatment liver biopsies, as well as other non-invasive markers of fibrosis.  A total of 18 patients completed this study, the results of which were recently published.  The drug was overall well-tolerated; however, no anti-fibrosis activity was identified in this 6-month study.  This study provided important preliminary information about the safety and potential efficacy of this monoclonal antibody in patients with liver fibrosis.  Biomarkers including D-dimer and IL-6 have been shown to predict mortality in HIV-infected patients independent of CD4 and viral load.  To better understand the mechanism leading to D-dimer elevation, we have undertaken a cross-sectional study to examine markers of coagulation, platelet function, endothelial activation and inflammation, and to identify correlates of elevated D-dimer levels.  Our hope is that this analysis will provide insights into which of these pathways is leading to D-dimer elevation.  To date we have enrolled approximately 230 HIV+ patients and HIV-volunteers.  Preliminary analysis suggests that TNF-alpha, sVCAM, and von Willebrand Factor correlate with levels of D-Dimer.  These data suggest that ongoing monocyte activation plays a role in D-dimer elevation.  We plan to enroll an additional 60 patients to study the correlates of immunologic non-response in patients receiving HAART, to include 30 subjects and 30 controls. We plan to examine immunophenotypic characteristics of the patients, as well as look for evidence of infection with a variety of viral pathogens, including unknown viruses.  We also plan to look at T-cell receptor repertoire diversity.  To date, 42 patients have enrolled in this phase of the study.  The goal is to better understand the mechanisms leading to poor immunologic response in HIV-infected patients."

"9307887","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The design of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is to investigate the efficacy of treatment and management strategies to care for critically ill children and understand the basic pathophysiological mechanisms of critical illness. CN has been part of the CPCCRN since its inception as an active and successful enrollment site, a constructive and creative presence in the development of CPCCRN research directions and protocols, and has lead in protocol development. The first goal of this proposal is to renew the participation of Children's National in the CPCCRN and participate in a manner that brings innovative, diverse, and unique skills to the CPCCRN. To achieve this goal, CN has restructured its leadership team to include leading researchers in outcomes research, cardiac critical care, and trauma and critical care. This team is also exceptionally experienced at both collaborating in, and leading multi-site studies. To better utilize the full scope of expertise in the Children's Research Institute, the leadership plan is explicit in its intent to collaboratively and constructively involve this expertise, internally thrugh the CN organizational structure and to the CPCCRN when it is appropriate to offer the expertise. Second, Children's National intends to improve the outcomes of critically ill children by both leading as well as participating in studies of the development of morbidity and mortality. As a demonstration of this commitment and expertise, we have presented the concept proposal The Association of PICU Care-Team Performance with Morbidity and Mortality. This proposal conceptually outlines the framework for answering the question: Can improving ICU care-team performance improve patient outcomes such as morbidity and mortality? The proposal outlines the process for measuring and testing the important components of team performance. It would develop generalizable methodology and reach conclusions that would be applicable to areas of medicine where team- based care is important. The concept proposal also demonstrates the intent to utilize interdisciplinary and network expertise."

The Director of the NIH delegated to the Director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) the authority and responsibility for establishment and conduct of a pediatric drug development programThe BPCA legislation authorizes the NICHD, in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and with experts in pediatric research, to identify therapeutic gaps in pediatric diseases, disorders or conditions in which more complete knowledge of treatment strategies, including drugs and biologics, may be beneficial to the pediatric population. The NICHD, specifically the Obstetric and Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics Branch (OTTPB), administers the research program (hence forth termed the ?BPCA Program?) and works cooperatively with other NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) with significant pediatric research portfolios in order to fulfill the mandate to improve pediatric therapeutics. The NICHD develops a priority list of drugs needing further study in pediatric practice and sponsors the clinical trials of those prioritized therapeutics. Since the inception of the BPCA in 2002, the NICHD has awarded approximately 35 individual projects for the purpose of gathering information to improve labeling of drugs that are used in children.  The NICHD currently maintains an infrastructure of contracts to provide support for various BPCA activities. This infrastructure requires a high level of interaction with the NICHD and the other responsible parties hence forth termed Contractors.

"9337270","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite recent advances in pharmacological therapy and acute patient care. Hypertension is the major risk factor for CVD and contributes to 95% of CVD deaths. Salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH) is a major form of human primary hypertension. Central mechanisms involving the lamina terminalis and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus play an important role in the development of SSH. In particular, the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the PVN mediates increases in sympathetic tone and blood pressure (BP) in response to high salt. The (pro)renin receptor (PRR) is a newly discovered component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Binding of renin or prorenin to the PRR promotes Ang II formation and also activates Ang II- independent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Our preliminary data show that PRR expression levels are elevated in the PVN of hypertensive human subjects; however, the significance of this elevation during hypertension is not known. Our central hypothesis is that hypertensive stimuli increase PRR expression epigenetically in the PVN, which promotes local Ang II formation through activation of prorenin, leading to sympathoexcitation and hypertension. To test this hypothesis, we will apply PVN microinjection and telemetry recording techniques to a mouse model of experimentally SSH. Central to these studies is a PRR conditional knockout mouse strain (Nefh-PRRKO) that we generated by breeding mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of a neuron-specific neurofilament-H (Nefh) promoter, produced in our laboratory, with PRR-floxed mice. Our objectives are to delineate the functional importance of PRR signaling pathways in the PVN in hypertension and elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms leading to PRR elevation. The following specific aims will be addressed: 1) Test the hypothesis that PRR activation in the PVN mediates the development of hypertension. 2) Test the hypothesis that mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling downstream of the PRR is mandatory for the development of hypertension. 3) Identify the epigenetic mechanisms responsible for elevated PRR expression in the PVN in hypertension. The proposed research will uncover the role of the PVN PRR in hypertension and elucidate the underlying signaling mechanisms. By establishing the importance of the PRR in hypertension and describing novel therapeutic targets, these studies will have a direct impact on cardiovascular biology and may open the door to the development of a new category of antihypertensive drugs."

"9340942","The immune responses to Pneumocystis are poorly understood, but cytokines may play a role in both clearing Pneumocystis infection and in the hypoxia associated with Pneumocystis pneumonia that may be exacerbated following initiation of therapy.  We are using the scid mouse model, as well as other immunodeficient mice, to further evaluate the role of individual cytokines and other immunoregulatory molecules in modulating Pneumocystis infection.  We have developed a real time PCR assay to quantitate Pneumocystis over a wide dynamic range, and are currently examining Pneumocystis infection in healthy animals to better understand immune responses in the normal host.  Using microarrays, we have been able to identify genes that are differentially expressed during Pneumocystis infection in healthy compared to immunodeficient mice; the majority of differentially expressed genes are related to the immune system.  Immunohistochemical studies of the lungs done in parallel have demonstrated that there is an influx of CD4 cells and macrophages at 5 weeks, and, surprisingly, an influx of B cells at 6 weeks in immunocompetent mice but not CD40L KO mice.  Microarray studies suggest that the B cells persist through at least 10 weeks, well after the infection has been cleared.  We have extended these studies to examine immune responses in other immunodeficient mice, including those with defective innate immune responses, such as Myd88 knockout mice which are deficient in TLR signals, and CDld KO mice, which lack NKT cells.  Our studies have shown that these mice are not susceptible to uncontrolled Pneumocystis infection, suggesting that neither TLR signaling, nor NKT cells are critical to controlling Pneumocystis infection.  In collaboration with Philip Murphy, Michail Lionakis, and their groups, we have examined changes in expression of a variety of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes, using Taqman real-time PCR assays, and have been able to identify CCR2 and its ligands as potentially important in the response to Pneumocystis infection.  However, in examining the susceptibility of CCR2 knock-out mice to Pneumocystis infection, we found that they are able to clear infection similar to wild-type animals.  We also examined CX3CR1 knock-out mice for susceptibility to Pneumocystis infection, since CX3CR1 and its ligand identify alternately activated macrophages and are critical to clearance of another fungus, Candida, in mouse models.  These mice were again able to clear Pneumocystis infection with kinetics similar to wild-type mice.  Using microarray analysis of purified CD4 cells isolated from lungs of Pneumocystis-infected mice, we were able to show that CXCR6 is preferentially upregulated compared to cells from uninfected animals, and by Q-PCR that both CXCR6 and its ligand, CXCL16, are unregulated in lung tissue from immunocompetent Pneumocystis-infected mice. We are currently examining the role of CXCR6 in controlling Pneumocystis infection through use of CXCR6 knock-out mice.   To allow us to evaluate immune responses more easily, we have developed a multiplex assay that allows the evaluation of expression levels of 30 genes simultaneously, using branched DNA amplification combined with Luminex bead technology.  We are using this assay to examine the lungs of various strains of knock-out mice at different stages of Pneumocystis infection, to determine if their immune responses are similar to those seen in healthy, immunocompetent mice.  We are examining the kinetics of immune responses in the lung of healthy animals exposed to Pneumocystis, using flow cytometry.  We have found that interferon-gamma, and less predictably, IL-17, expression are increased in lymphocytes of the lung, primarily CD4 cells, during Pneumocystis infection and clearance, suggesting that Th1 and Th17 CD4+ T cells may play a role in clearing infection. In follow-up, we found that IL-17A knockout mice are able to clear Pneumocystis infection, thus demonstrating that IL-17 is not critical to control of Pneumocystis infection. We are extending these studies to look at Th2 and Treg cells in the lung  during Pneumocystis infection in  healthy mice, and also plan to utilize an anti-interferon-gamma to see how it impacts control of infection and to see how other T cells respond in the setting of impaired Th1 cell function.  We have recently examined the contribution of beta-glucans in cysts to the inflammatory response to Pneumocystis.  We have demonstrated that, similar to other pathogenic fungi, glucans are to a large extent masked by surface proteins in 3 Pneumocystis species (P. murina, P. carinii, and P. jirovecii). Moreover, we have shown, by comparing infected mice treated with caspofungin, an inhibitor of beta 1,3 glucan synthase, to untreated mice, that beta-glucans are major contributors to the inflammatory response to Pneumocystis.  We are also examining the response of dendritic cells to the most abundant Pneumocystis antigens, the major surface glycoprotein (MSG).  Finally, we are performing reconstitution studies in CD40KO mice, to try to identify which cells are critical to the mounting an effective immune response against Pneumocystis.  For these studies we use CD45 allelic variants as donors to allow us to track transferred cells.  We have been able to show that unfractionated spleen cells from immunocompetent mice are able to clear Pneumocystis infection, and are currently examining which subpopulations of cells can confer this protection. Preliminary studies suggest that B cells play an important role in conferring long-lasting protection.  We are further examining the role of B cells by performing immune reconstitution studies using B cells that are quasimonoclonal, to help determine if antibody production or, alternatively, other properties of B cells, such as antigen presentation, are critical to controlling Pneumocystis infection.  It is hoped that these studies will provide insights into the mechanisms critical for control of Pneumocystis infection in the healthy host, and may provide mechanisms for increasing clearance of Pneumocystis or decreasing the inflammation that may be causing hypoxia."
"9340943","Nitric oxide (NO):  NO production by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; NOS-3) is cytoprotective and regulates smooth muscle tone, leukocyte adhesion, and platelet aggregation. Inducible NOS (iNOS; NOS-2) during sepsis produces large amounts of NO resulting in shock, myocardial depression, tissue injury and apoptosis. This dual nature of NO underlies the paradox that both under and over production are associated with vascular dysfunction. Our work has focused on cGMP-independent, non-canonical NO signaling and inflammatory gene regulation.  NO was shown to up-regulate TNFa production (J Immunol 1994; Blood 1997) through a cGMP-independent signaling pathway (J Biol Chem 1997) that utilized NO-responsive Sp1 promoter binding sites (J Biol Chem 1999; J Biol Chem 2003).  Dysfunctional eNOS was found to upregulate TNFa (J Biol Chem 2000) through the release of reactive oxygen species that activated ERK1/2 (Am J Physiol 2001).  NO activation of p38 MAPK stabilized IL-8 mRNA (J Infect Dis 1998) through AU-rich elements in the IL-8 3 UTR (J Leuk Biol 2004).  Additional mechanisms involving ERK1/2 and CU-rich elements in other target transcripts demonstrated the diversity of NO effects on transcript stability and translation (Nucleic Acids Research 2006; J Leuk Biol 2008).  Sickle cell disease was shown to cause oxidant and inflammatory stress in the vasculature (Blood, 2004). Circulatory stress in sickle cell disease was associated with gene expression changes and arginine metabolism abnormalities (Circulation, 2007).  Anti-proliferative effects of NO were linked to p38 MAPK activation and p21 mRNA stabilization with subsequent down-regulation of polo-like kinase 1 through a CDE/CHR proximal promoter site (BMC Genomics 2005; J Biol Chem 2006).  Both NO and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) protect the endothelium and regulate its function. PPARg was activated by NO through a p38 MAPK dependent signal transduction pathway (FASEB J 2007).  In contrast to the pro-inflammatory effects of high output NO, CO was found to block proximal events in NF-kB signal transduction, thereby broadly suppressing inflammation (PLoS One 2009).  Nuclear receptors: Nuclear receptors (NRs) regulate cardiovascular homeostasis, metabolism and the immune system. Of 48 human NRs, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has been the most extensively studied as a suppressor of inflammation. Glucocorticoid (GC) activation of GR is used to treat inflammation. In addition to inducing anti-inflammatory mediators, GR suppresses inflammatory responses by tethering to DNA-bound NF-kB and AP-1 complexes, transcription factor families that broadly control the expression of cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. This trans-repression mechanism has now been described for a growing number of other NRs. PPARg, MR, AR, and COUP-TF are prominently expressed in human endothelium.  In human endothelial cells, MR agonists were found to repress NF-kB mediated gene transcription (Keystone Symposia on Nuclear Receptors abstract 2010; American Thoracic Society abstract 2010). In contrast, MR either repressed or further activated AP1 signaling depending on the DNA sequence of specific AP1 binding sites, MR ligand structure, and AP1 family member expression. This investigation demonstrated a novel mechanism for the pro-inflammatory effects of MR (submitted 2016).  Rosiglitazone (RGZ), a PPARg ligand/agonist, also activates G-protein coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) and p38 MAPK. GPR40/p38 MAPK/ PGC1a/EP300 activation by RGZ was shown in human endothelial cells to markedly augment downstream RGZ/PPARg genomic signaling (J Biol Chem 2015). Therefore, PPARg ligand effects on human endothelium might be best understood as a cognate two-receptor system, integrated by p38 MAPK, PGC1a, and EP300.  The MR-independent anti-inflammatory effects of spironolactone have been a source of speculation for decades, but the mechanism has been elusive. Spironolactone, but not eplerenone was found to suppress both NF-kB and AP-1 inflammatory signaling independent of MR. Spironolactone-induced proteasomal degradation of XPB was identified as the mechanism of this potent anti-inflammatory effect (in preparation 2016).  Pulmonary arterial hypertension pathogenesis and therapeutic targets: Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in bone morphogenetic protein type II receptor (BMPR2) are the most common genetic cause of PAH accounting for 70% of familial cases and 10-40% of sporadic idiopathic PAH. Furthermore, BMPR2 expression is markedly reduced in end-stage PAH, even in patients not harboring these mutations. While some BMPR2 mutations associated with PAH do not disrupt canonical BMPR2/Smad signaling, ligand-independent, non-canonical signaling and functional abnormalities are universal across mutant BMPR2 genotypes, but less well understood.  Genome-wide gene expression differences in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with PAH compared to healthy gender, age and ethnicity matched volunteers categorically identified alterations in inflammation, cell adhesion, cell motility, the cytoskeleton and apoptosis (American Thoracic Society abstract 2011). Specific genes and pathways overlapped with several previously proposed mechanisms of PAH such as Ras, RhoA, integrin, focal adhesion kinase-1 (FAK), and p21-activated kinase (PAK).  Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been proposed as a biomarker of vascular injury. CECs were identified by flow cytometry and their endothelial phenotype was validated using ultramicro analytical immunochemistry (Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2014).  BMPR2 knockdown (KD) in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) activated the Ras/Raf/ERK signaling, an important oncogenic pathway, leading to proliferation, invasiveness and cytoskeletal abnormalities. Therapeutics targeting this non-canonical may be useful in preventing or reversing vascular remodeling in patients with PAH (Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 2016).  Two clinical protocols on PAH continue to enroll patients with PAH and provide a source of clinical specimens for ongoing laboratory studies:   1) A Pilot Study of the Effect of Spironolactone Therapy on Exercise Capacity and Endothelial Dysfunction in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. This is a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study in patients with PAH of early treatment with spironolactone (Trials 2013).   2) A Natural History Study of Novel Biomarkers in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. This study investigates the ability of circulating markers of vascular inflammation as well as high-resolution cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to accurately stage severity of disease and/or predict clinically relevant outcomes.  Another genetic defect associated with PAH, caveolin-1 (CAV1) loss-of-function was found, similar to BMPR2, to produce a proliferative, hyper-migratory and inflammatory cellular phenotype, but in this case with abnormalities in interferon signaling (in preparation 2016). Notably, interferon administration and CANDLE syndrome, an interferon-driven auto-inflammatory disease, have both been associated with the development of PAH.  The in vitro profiling of endothelial cells with heterogeneous PAH-associated molecular defects, such as those involving BMPR2 and CAV1 can help create a more comprehensive picture of pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets. The comparative biology of seemingly unrelated molecular defects may lead to both individualized and possibly universal approaches for arresting or even reversing pathologic vascular remodeling."

"9352006","In the present study, we first developed an isolated perfused rat kidney model to examine the direct effects of ET and LT on renal function. This model allows investigation of the toxins' renal effects independent of their potential influence on systemic hemodynamic function. The model will permit measures of the effects of ET and LT on glomerular filtration rate; tubular function including sodium and glucose excretion as well as reabsorption, concentration and acidification; and interstitial changes.   In studies completed we have shown that ET, rather than stimulating renal tubular sodium losses as we originally hypothesized, actually promotes free water uptake and to a lesser degree sodium uptake. Immunohistochemistry studies and urine analysis show ET mediates these renal effects via up regulation of aquaporin 2 in the tubular membrane. This increase in free water uptake with ET provides one basis for the reduced sodium levels noted in patients with severe anthrax infection and may also contribute to the marked extravascular fluid collections patients develop.  Work from this study was presented at the 2015 International Conference of the American Thoracic Society and a manuscript has been submitted and is presently under review."

"9352021","Anthrax infection remains a bioterrorist health threat today capable of affecting a large number of individuals in a relatively brief period. Defining effective but inexpensive therapies that can be stock-piled for prolonged periods and quickly administered on a large scale would be of great value for the US public in the event of an anthrax outbreak.   Production of anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) is central to the pathogenesis of anthrax. This is a binary type toxin consisting of an A (lethal factor, LF) and B component (protective antigen, PA). PA is necessary for cellular uptake of the toxic moiety LF. Lethal factor is a zinc dependent protease, which inactivates all but one mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MPKK 1 to 4 and 6). These MPKKs participate in signaling pathways necessary for cell survival. We and other labs have shown that LeTx can produce shock and lethality similar to that observed during live bacterial infection. Importantly, inhibition of the cellular uptake of LeTx with selective antibodies to PA is protective in bacteria challenged anthrax models, emphasizing the important contribution this toxin makes to the lethality of anthrax. Despite their demonstrated effectiveness however, antibody preparations are expensive and may be difficult to administer on a large scale. Furthermore, bioengineered strains of anthrax capable of producing toxin insensitive to the effects of such antibody preparations can be manufactured with relatively few resources. Developing alternative agents capable of inhibiting anthrax toxin is warranted.  In prior in vivo work we found that LeTx was a potent inhibitor of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) production in lethal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and E. coli challenged rats. While such inhibition during anthrax infection itself may promote bacterial growth by suppressing host innate immune responses, it may aid the microbe in other ways as well. Consistent with this, in in vivo experiments in the rat lab, we observed that nonlethal doses of LPS capable of rapidly increasing NO levels were actually protective with lethal LeTx challenge. These in vivo findings suggest that administration of NO donor agents may be of therapeutic benefit during anthrax infection. Depending on type, NO donor agents can be produced inexpensively, stored in large quantities, and can be orally bioavailable. Such agents could be administered relatively efficiently on a large scale during an anthrax outbreak.   The present protocol is designed to investigate the potential of NO donor agents for the treatment of LeTx associated shock. As a proof of principle investigation, it has focused on agents that can be administered intravenously to ensure delivery. The study has consisted of two parts thus far. In the first part (Study 1), the ability of three different NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP), S-nitroso-L-glutathione (GSNO) and 3-morpholinosdnonime (SIN-1) to produce increases in circulating NO levels that are measurable (>15% of control) and sustainable over 24 hours with <15% decreases in mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) will be tested in a catheterized rat model. This data was employed to develop a regimen of SIN-1 treatment directed against LeTx.   The second part of the protocol (Study 2), has tested the ability of SIN-1 treatment to inhibit the lethal effects of LT.  In initial experiments we showed that pretreatment of LT with SIN-1 did inhibit LTs in vivo lethal effects.  Subsequent experiments showed that coinfusion of SIN-1 with LT (i.e. simultaneously via the same venous catheter) was significantly protective, presumably inactivating LT during the process of infusion.  Two final sets of experiments have now been completed in which: 1) SIN-1 and LT have been infused via separate catheters in LT challenged animal and 2) animals were treated with a NOS inhibitor and then challenged with LT. Data from these experiments is under analysis and a manuscript is in preparation.  Data from the study was presented at the International Conference of theAmerican Thoracic Society 2012 and 2014."

However, whereas only 8 of 30 patients (26.7%) with a low risk of death admission sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) of 0 to 5 received AIG-IV (p=0.01compared to a proportion of 50%), 7 of the 13 patients (53.9%) with a high risk of death (SOFA of 6 to 11) received treatment (p=0.78). Overall, AIG-IV recipients had surgery more often and, among survivors, longer hospital stays (all p0.05). Overall, AIG-IV recipients were sicker than non-recipients in this outbreak. This difference and the small number of higher risk patients, confound assessment of AIG-IVs effectiveness in the outbreak."
"9353635","HCV is a major public health problem, infecting more than 170 million people worldwide. Most cases of HCV infection become persistent and may eventually lead to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although hepatocytes are the major site of viral replication, a broad clinical spectrum of extrahepatic complications and diseases are associated with chronic HCV infection, including mixed cryoglobulinemia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, cutaneous vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, neuropathy, and lymphoproliferative disorders. The existence of extrahepatic reservoirs of HCV replication, particularly in PBMCs, remains highly controversial. It is unclear how B cells become dysregulated during the course of chronic HCV infection. In our previous study, we demonstrated that in 7 out of 7 chronic HCV patients, HCV is preferentially associated with CD19+ B cells in PBMC subpopulations. Using in vitro reconstitution experiments by mixing cell-free HCV particles from chronic HCV carriers with PBMCs from healthy blood donors, we found that HCV particles preferentially bind to CD19+ B cells. HCV particles produced from in vitro cell cultures have minimal binding capacity to CD19+ B cells. However, when HCV particles produced in cell culture were pre-incubated with serum samples from HCV recovered patients and then mixed with PBMCs from healthy blood donors, the viral particles become preferentially bound to CD19+ B cells. Initially we thought the serum components which promote the binding of HCV to B cells were induced by HCV infection, such as HCV antigen-specific antibodies. Later, we demonstrated that the same activity can also be found in serum from healthy blood donors without any evidence of previous exposure to HCV.  Recently, we have further demonstrated that the association of HCV with CD19+ B cells is mediated by the complement system (Hepatology 2016, in press). In this study, we used in vitro cultured virus and uninfected PBMCs from healthy blood donors to investigate the necessary serum components that activate the binding of HCV to B cells.   First, we found that in the absence of exogenous serum factors, there was negligible binding of culture-produced HCV particles to B cells.  However, upon pre-incubation of culture- produced HCV particles with serum, HCV binding to B cells was increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared to virus in the absence of serum. The essential serum factors were found to be heat- labile and present in both healthy blood donors and HCV recovered patients, suggesting that complement might be integral to the binding process. Second, the preferential binding activity of HCV to B cells could be blocked by anti-complement C3 antibodies. In experiments with complement-depleted serum and purified complement proteins, we demonstrated that complement proteins C1, C2, C3, and C4 were required to activate such binding activity.  Third, using antibodies against cell surface markers, we showed that the binding complex mainly involved CD21 (complement receptor 2), CD19, CD20, and CD81.   The complement system plays a central role in innate immune defense and consists of both soluble factors and cell surface receptors that interact to sense and respond to a wide range of invading microorganisms. Activation of complement system has been demonstrated during infection by several enveloped viruses including HIV-1, herpesvirus, Ebola virus, and influenza virus.. However, these viruses have also evolved escape mechanisms to evade the complement system by incorporating host regulators of complement activation into their viral envelopes and, as a result, escape antibody-dependent complement-mediated virus lysis. Complement activation upon HCV infection has been implicated in several studies. In addition, CD55 and CD59, regulators of complement activation, have been shown to be incorporated into HCV virions, which led to resistance to complement-mediated antibody-dependent virolysis, In chronic HCV patients, the level of immune-complexes in blood is often elevated. Since complement receptor 1/CD35 on erythrocytes has been shown to play a key role in transporting complement-opsonized immune-complexes to liver and spleen, the potential roles of this receptor on HCV infection need to be further elucidated.  In human B cells, CD21 is known to form a costimulatory complex with CD19 and CD81. Co-ligation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) with this costimulatory complex can lower the threshold required for BCR-mediated B cell activation and proliferation. One of our major goals in this program is to elucidate the pathways through which complement mediated HCV attachment to B cells affects intracellular pathways that foster oncogenesis. For our next phase of study, we will focus on the following projects: 1) To identify signaling pathways associated with HCV binding to CD21; 2) To elucidate the possible biological responses and consequences of HCV binding to B cells; 3) To investigate the mechanisms of HCV association with other subsets of cells in whole blood, such as erythrocytes, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages; and 4) To initiate the investigation of molecular mechanisms of HCV associated lymphoid-neoplasms."
"9353639","Overview: This translational research program addresses molecular and pathophysiological processes of nociceptive transmission and new ways to investigate the potential confluence of chronic pain, autoimmune conditions, infectious diseases and their intersections in human patients. Chronic neuropathic pain can affect any part of the body and can occur due to a variety of insults, infections, and autoimmune or metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetic peripheral neuropathy). We are testing the hypothesis that, in some patients, chronic pain is initiated and/or maintained by immunopathological processes related to autoantibodies generated against proteins in peripheral nerve or Schwann cells or possibly components of the central nervous system. Autoantibodies are known culprits in certain large fiber peripheral neuropathies such as in paraneoplastic disorders. Where pain is a component, we hypothesize the presence of autoantibodies to proteins found in nerve endings arising from small diameter pain-sensing (nociceptive) C- or A-delta nerve fibers. To test the hypothesis that painful neuropathic conditions have an autoimmune component we established a sensitive, quantitative, liquid phase luminescence assay that uses recombinant protein antigen-luciferase fusions as tracers, which are expressed in mammalian cells. This assay is called luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) and we have multiple published papers showing that LIPS can robustly and sensitively measure antibodies in serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid or saliva. The goals of this research are to understand (a) the molecular and cell biological mechanisms underlying human chronic pain disorders, and (b) to use this knowledge to devise new treatments and diagnostics for pain and other disorders to which it can be adapted.   In this project an autoimmune hypothesis is explored. The assay methodology we established has great versatility due to its sensitivity, modularity, and use of recombinant DNA methodology to generate protein-antigen tracers. Our early investigations evaluated a range of diseases and disorders that antibodies play a role in, including infectious diseases with and without nervous system involvement, autoimmune disorders, which may have nervous system symptomology in subsets of patients, and other types of screening and methodological variants. In many neural autoimmune disorders, the major autoantigens are frequently plasma membrane receptors or ion channels. We have generated several such probes for neuropathic pain disorders, notably the beta-adrenergic receptor and a potassium channel based on published reports, and are currently testing to determine if the LIPS assay can detect antibodies to these proteins in appropriate patients. We completed a study on shingles or herpes zoster that can evolve into a painful neurological disorder called post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). We detected some neutralizing anti-cytokine autoantibodies in a subpopulation and, interestingly, all of these had PHN. This is important because it suggests that some patients with PHN may require additional intervention to control the disorder other than just analgesic medications.   One of the most compelling aspects of this project is the progressive layering and evolution of the datasets and their uses. As we increase the number of test antigens, and assay across conditions and diseases, we assemble comprehensive evaluations of immune and autoimmune responses. This is accomplished by determination of (a) the extent and specificity of immune response to orthologous proteins and protein fragments, (b) overlap in antigen profiles indicative of common denominators or general mechanisms, and (c) antigenicity within an entire signaling pathway involved in inter- or intracellular communication. Examples are the TRIM family of proteins in Sjogren's Syndrome and our autoantigen-based classification of patients with Lupus Erythematosis. An example of a new use for public health monitoring is our earlier demonstration of autoantibody measurements in saliva, which highlights the feasibility of establishing non-invasive, saliva-based assays for many types of human diseases or assessment of vaccine immune status for large or vulnerable populations of people or the pediatric population. Eventually, full multiple antigen profiling can be implemented to obtain a deeper level of understanding of many complex human disease states."

"9387639","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cerebral cortex is the seat of higher brain function, responsible for sensory perception, cognitive processes, voluntary movement, and consciousness. Abnormalities of the human cerebral cortex cause neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism. A key feature of the functional anatomy of the human cerebral cortex is its organization into functionally distinct regions along its tangential dimension. During brain development, highly heterogeneous cell types must precisely assemble into unique neural circuits both within and between these areas to control complex behaviors and cognitive processes. The molecular mechanisms that encode cortical projection neuron subtype identity and synaptic specificity remain poorly understood. This proposal details a 3 year plan for postdoctoral research and professional development under the mentorship of Dr. Nenad Sestan, Professor of Neurobiology at Yale University. The fellow will investigate the mechanisms that form the molecular basis for intra-cortical projection neuron heterogeneity and projection identity. The fellow will build on his existing expertise in neurodevelopmental biology, microscopy, histology, and cell biology. He will further develop new expertise in  the structure and function of the developing cerebral cortex, neural circuit tracing, transcriptional profiling,  single-cell sorting, and advanced mouse genetic technologies by pursuing the following specific aims: 1.)  Characterization of intra-cortical projections in association areas of auditory cortex (A2), 2.) Transcriptional profiling and characterization of intra-cortical projection neuron subtypes in A2, and 3.) Deciphering the molecular mechanisms that establish intra-cortical projection neuron heterogeneity in A2. The expertise of Dr. Sestan in cortical development and genomics, mouse genetics, and studies of long-range projection circuitry will provide the scientific guidance and technical capabilities necessary to ensure successful completion of these aims. The fellow and the sponsor have also developed a detailed plan for professional skills development. The research and training plan proposed here, along with the fellow's choice of mentor, will provide excellent training towards the fellow's goal of an academic career studying the developmental neurobiology of the cerebral cortex and its dysfunction in disease."

"9232392","PROJECT SUMMARY Craniofacial anomalies are among the most common and debilitating human birth defects, affecting 1/500 to 1/2000 births depending on the population. Diagnosis and treatment of craniofacial anomalies is further complicated by variation in the severity (phenotypic penetrance) of defects. It is widely recognized that similar genetic mutations often express a spectrum of disease phenotypes, but it is still unknown what mechanisms contribute to this variation. For example, human patients with mutations in Satb2 exhibit a range of craniofacial phenotypes, including small lower jaws (micrognathia) and variable penetrance in cleft palate. Similarly, in mice, Satb2 has a dosage-effect on jaw size. Notably, Satb2 heterozygotes exhibit the full range of jaw size variation between WT (normal) to mutant (severe micrognathia and cleft palate). That such variation in size occurs on an inbred, genetically identical background, suggests that developmental (non-genomic) variation in molecular determinants (e.g., mRNA, protein) contributes to variation in jaw size. Yet, it is unknown what mechanisms cause such variation. Our central hypothesis is that cellular variation in proliferation and apoptosis of mesenchymal progenitors of the jaw results from differences in the levels and variance of Satb2 molecular determinants. Subtle random variation in the production of molecular determinants may affect cell fate when RNA or protein concentrations are near a threshold level (as predicted for Satb2 heterozygotes). Such a threshold model would produce a non-linear relationship between genotype and phenotype, which has previously been predicted to explain high levels of morphological variation in disease models. Using both an in vivo (Aim 1) and in vitro (Aim 2) approach, we will evaluate how levels and variance of Satb2 molecular determinants contribute to variation in the size of the jaw by regulating survival of jaw progenitors. Data generated from work in this proposal will provide essential knowledge about the role of development in generating phenotypic variation. This approach will significantly advance developmental biology by improving methods for relating tissue-level morphology to single-cell molecular biology. Importantly, this work will also substantially enhance the research environment and provide exciting opportunities for undergraduates to conduct high-impact research, preparing them to enter the biomedical workforce."
"9245148","7. Project Summary/Abstract Astrocytes are vital to brain metabolism and help to optimize synaptic function and promote neuronal health. Direct coupling of astrocytes to the extracellular milieu via unapposed hemichannels (uHCs)?made up of connexin 43 (Cx43) proteins?appears to be increased under a variety of pathological conditions. Elevated levels of amyloid-? (A?) peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines, characteristic of Alzheimer?s disease (AD), lead to greater uHC permeability?which, in turn, impairs neuronal function and viability. In this project, we will test the novel hypothesis that A?-dependent changes in uHCs are mediated, in part, by aberrant activation of the protein phosphatase calcineurin (CN), shown by our lab and others to drive several critical components of the activated astrocyte phenotype. Aim 1 will use a combination of adenoviral vectors and pharmacological agents, in addition to Western blot, ethidium bromide uptake, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and a variety of biochemical assays, to determine whether CN and Cx43 are necessary and sufficient for the effects of A? on the functional status of HCs in primary astrocytes. In addition, this aim will determine the feasibility of using a novel peptide-based reagent, 43Gap52, to selectively disrupt CN/Cx43 interactions without inhibiting CN activity per se. This aim will establish whether aberrant CN/Cx43 interactions in astrocytes are a direct outcome of A? pathology. Aim 2 will use adeno-associated virus (AAV) bearing astrocyte-specific promoters and CN activators (active CN fragment) or CN inhibitors (CN-autoinhibitory peptide or 43Gap52) to selectively modulate astrocytic CN/Cx43 interactions in an intact mouse model of AD. The functional status of astrocytic uHCs will be investigated in acutely prepared brain slices using an EtBr uptake assay, as described for Aim 1. In addition, slice electrophysiology will be used to assess the impact of CN/Cx43 interactions on hippocampal synaptic strength and plasticity. This Aim will validate Aim 1 results in a commonly used animal model of AD, en route to determining the extent to which CN/Cx43 interactions in astrocytes disrupt synaptic function during the progression of A? pathology. These studies will shed light on the role of astrocytic HCs in AD pathophysiology and determine whether disruption of the CN/Cx43 interaction is a feasible strategy for ameliorating neurologic dysfunction due to AD and other types of neurodegenerative disease."

Although ultrasound or CT are used to identify tumor location and thus to guide biopsy needle insertion, these technologies do not provide the necessary resolution to determine tumor cellularity. It is known that many tumors are heterogeneous (mixture of viable tumor, necrosis, fibrosis and inflammation), and therefore interventional radiologists encounter serious challenges when performing biopsies due to the inability of collecting sufficient or adequate material for histological analysis.

"9360473","Summary:      Research in the Interventional Radiology (IR) lab is motivated by the fact that image guidance and minimally invasive approaches have revolutionized the management of many common diseases.  However, diagnosis and therapy remain distinctly separated from each other in both time and space.  We believe that this gap between diagnosis and therapy can be narrowed by minimally invasive image guided therapies and with the application of novel guidance technologies and engineered vectors.  All research efforts in the IR lab are developed with a clear translational route to the clinic and address areas of urgent clinical need. The IR labs research program is separated into three main areas: electromagnetic (EM) and optical tracking and robotics, drug + device combinations, novel methods of augmentation of ablative energies (RFA, MWA, Laser, IRE, or HIFU).  The diversity of these projects requires an interdisciplinary team of researchers and takes full advantage of the interdisciplinary resources found within the Clinical Center and the Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health.  We believe that combining the imaging tools inherent to interventional radiology with pharmaceuticals and medical devices can make a significant contribution to the future treatment of both localized and systemic diseases, with an emphasis upon cancer therapeutics. Principal projects are: 1) Smart biopsy, 2) OR of the future and, 3) Drugs + devices. Smart biopsy relies upon precise electromagnetic tracking to target tissue to correlate sample with imaging parameters. OR of the future is a broad translational project that integrates a variety of technologies for navigation, automation, and visualization of medical procedures. Sub-projects within the Drug + Device model include: 1) Temperature sensitive liposomes combined with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), 2) Radiofrequency ablation combined with immunotherapy / checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and 3) Development of image-able drug eluting beads (DEB) for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The clinical treatment of solid tumors could be improved by controlling the pharmacologic properties of anticancer therapeutics to deliver a greater dose to the tumor; with conventional drugs, this dose is typically limited by toxic side effects in normal tissues.  Therefore, the efficacy of current anticancer treatments may be improved with advances in drug delivery technologies that have received increased attention in recent years.  The goal of drug delivery in the treatment of cancer is to increase the concentration of a therapeutic agent in the tumor while limiting systemic exposure and subsequent normal tissue toxicity.  The combination of drug delivery technologies with image guided interventions represents a rich field with great translational potential and the ability to bridge the gap between diagnosis and therapy. Diagnosis and therapy remain distinctly separated from each other in time and space. The gap between diagnosis and therapy can be closed by minimally invasive image guided therapies. Real-time, intra-procedural tools will blend diagnosis and therapy into a dynamic, iterative process with improved outcomes. The redefining of surgical-like procedures will be fueled by multi-modality imaging, navigation, visualization, robotics, and automated precision tools. These enabling technologies have not yet been optimally applied to existing clinical problems, especially in minimally-invasive image guided therapies. This presents an opportunity to integrate these technologies into the clinical setting in a validated and cost-effective manner, and to study the impact prior to broad implementation. Image guidance and multimodality navigation will fuel a small revolution in procedural medicine, which presents unprecedented opportunity and challenge. Image guidance and minimally invasive approaches have revolutioniiized themanagement of many common diseases. The miniaturization of surgical interventions has seen the broad adoption of needle or catheter-based procedures such as tumor embolization, brain aneurysm coiling, aortic stent grafting, uterine fibroid embolization, atherosclerosis stenting and angioplasty, and tumor thermal ablation with radiofrequency.  As procedures are becoming less and less invasive, they are more and more targeted and guided by imaging and spatial information. The ability to navigate a medical device to a target based upon multiple windows or multiple modalities should have tremendous advantages in certain settings. The combination of functional and morphologic (metabolic and anatomic) information on the same coordinate system is empowering.  With multiple public and private partners, we have developed a multimodality interventional radiology suite that uses a CT coordinate frame to co-register and co-localize different devices including pre-procedural images, intra-procedural ultrasound, CT, rotational fluoroscopy, robotics, electromagnetic tracking and therapeutic ultrasound, microwave, radiofrequency, etc. to allow the best combinations of techniques and guidance methods tailored to the particular patients needs. Combining imaging modalities can take advantage of each modality's strength. Real-time feedback and temporal resolution of ultrasound can be combined with the functional and metabolic data from PET and the spatial resolution of MR or CT, all on one seamless platform for treatment planning, targeting, procedural navigation, monitoring, and verification of treatment.The lab has continued the electromagnetic tracking clinical trial with over 2000 patients. The lab also further studied Medical GPS for tumor ablation and treatment planning and for prostate biopsies using MRI information without requiring an MRI to be physically present. We have also started work in preparation for using other vendor's ultrasound source images for fusing real time ultrasound with pre-op images (CT, MRI, PET, etc). This study yielded numerous discoveries, papers, and commercialized products. Also as a result of this work, numerous vendors in the field have adopted similar multi-modality approaches. Phase I of laser ablation of prostate cancer under MRI guidance was completed and Phase II submission is in process for using ultrasound alone to guide the prostate cancer ablation. Low tech, low cost methods for navigation continued, including laser guidance for needle based biopsy and ablation, and bronchoscopy navigation and laser ablation development. Preclinical work is in process for focal prostate therapies (laser ablation with real-time MRI fluoroscopy) and clinical studies to plan and deliver a composite ablation treatment. A clinical trial is underway to study angle selection techniques and assess accuracy of CT integrated robot-like devices. Drug eluting beads as a tool for regional therapies was refined in preclinical models and will be combined with image-able beads that show where the drug is being delivered in liver chemoembolization with drug dluting beads. Image-able drug eluting beads are being studied and refined in preclinical models and clinic, in order to develop drug dose planning software. Conductive catheters and endovascular devices and embolization devices were studied and prototyped, and NIH patents were issued on devices. Optical needle endoscopy was prototyped and will be tested in CC patients next FY."
"9360474","HIFU projects: The studies being carried out using high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) involve a unique variety of novel applications for drug delivery, cancer therapy, ablation, (and in the past, fibroid therapies and thrombolysis). Building a foundation for these clinical applications necessitates directed pre-clinical safety and bridging studies that are requisite to bring drug-plus-device paradigms to clinical practice. The optimization of techniques and technologies for uterine fibroid image guided ablation was the first clinical trial for this technology at NIH CC, and was the first USA install of one of the new MRI-guided HIFU technologies that uses MRI temperature maps to localize where the energy is deposited, with a real-time closed loop feedback algorithms that help the physician prescribe and control the energy delivery. This novel technology is also delivered volumetrically and does not require linear sequential rastering, as did the predicate technology. Cavitation detection further improves the safety of this approach. The new clinical HIFU system can apply HIFU very rapidly, which mitigates the excessive time requirements for prior HIFU technologies, which was a major barrier to clinical translation. New tools developed here include programming to enable volumetric hyperthermia and volumetric drug delivery.  1. Enhanced local drug deposition using low temperature sensitive liposomes (LTSLs): In preclinical models, we have shown that local doxorubicin delivery is enhanced in both tumors and muscle by combining systemic injections of LTSLs containing the drug and HIFU exposures. In the tumor studies, enhanced delivery was compared to non-thermo sensitive liposomes and shown to produce improved anti-tumor effects. Low energy HIFU exposures are tailored to generate temperature elevations that are just a few degrees Celsius above body temperature, which are non-destructive, and which cause a phase transition in the liposomes making them more permeable and able to release their payload. The image guided hyperthermia enhances permeability and perfusion as well. A multi-disciplinary approach optimizes these treatments for improving spatial and temporal heating using computer simulations, in vitro experimentation, and in vivo studies. Collaborations with Dieter Haemmerich are developing a multi-parametric mathematical model that combines finite element analysis tools with perfusion modeling, tissue bioheat effects and known drug profiles to try to optimize the drug-plus-device approach prior to translation. Enhanced local drug deposition occurs through non-destructive and destructive mechanisms. Thermal ablation also deposits heat that adds to enhanced permeability and retention as well as mechanical deployment of heat-sensitive nanoparticles. Phase I clinical trials for bone and soft tissue painful tumors are at the IRB review stage. Preclinical work has focused on development of image-able nanoparticle agents that could theoretically define volumetric drug dosimetry, thus defining tumor at risk for undertreatment. This preclinical drug paintbrush tool will facilitate and expedite the intricate integration of this drug + device combination.  2. Induced effects for enhancing immunotherapy of tumors: Various studies have shown that HIFU ablation can enhance adaptive immunity against tumors. It is hypothesized that in addition to destroying tumor tissue, tumor associated antigens are being released that can stimulate the immune system to create these effects. With NCI MOB collaborators, we published on the immunogenic effects of radiofrequency thermal ablation, and aim to study further translational opportunities to enhance immunotherapies for cancer.  3. Enhanced pharmacologic thrombolysis: HIFU and non focused ultrasound itself can enhance thrombolysis as has been shown in our in vitro, small animal, and large animal models. Work is submitted on heat sensitive encapsulated liposomal thrombolytics, that could be deployed with HIFU.    4. Safety: Studies on the safety and predictability of clinical HIFU exposures with radiology - pathology correlation where possible or correlation with pain control and duration of response. HIFU exposures can produce a variety of effects for both adjunct and stand alone treatments.  5. Fibroid Ablation: Radiology to pathology correlation for Phase I clinical trial was completed for the use of MRI-guided Spiral volumetric closed loop feedback HIFU for the treatment of uterine fibroids as a pilot trial.  6.  Cancer applications:  Protocols to study  HIFU for painful bone metastases  as well as MRI-guided HIFU + heat deployed chemotherapy in a nanoparticle liposomal vector delivered IV, and plans are ongoing for clinical translation of laparoscopically and robotically delivered HIFU. Devising a methodology for combining HIFU with other accepted interventional oncology regional and local therapies is a future goal. Image-able liposomes that deploy chemotherapy have been shown in vivo to be able to deposit drug focally with image guidance, like a drug paintbrush. 7. HIFU as a local therapy for prostate cancer has been investigated in animal models here at NIH, and has been translated to clinic by collaborators in Dallas, TX."

"9362911","Antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces mortality and morbidity in HIV-infected individuals. With successful therapy HIV RNA becomes undetectable, but drug resistance may occur. Specific HIV mutations are associated with resistance and these mutations can be detected through standard genotypic resistance tests, which have the ability to detect mutations only when they are present in approximately 20% of the virus population within an individual. Importantly, it is now known that the presence of certain resistance mutations, even at very low concentrations within a patient?s virus population (1% or more), can contribute to virological failure. These drug resistant minor variants can reflect the early emergence of acquired resistance during therapy, and can also be transmitted to newly infected individuals. These minor variants are not detected by standard drug resistance assays and methods to detect minor variants that contribute to HIV virological failure are needed. These assays would need to detect mutations causing resistance to each of the antiretroviral drug classes (NRTI, NNRTI, PI and INI) in all HIV subtypes, and must be inexpensive, since large numbers of patients would need to be screened. The goal of this project is to develop an assay to detect minor populations of resistant variants in blood specimens from HIV-infected individuals with HIV RNA viral loads above 1000 copies/ml."

"9364087","It is becoming clear that cancer and subsequent treatment impact cognitive function. These deficits may result either from pathological changes due to cancer itself, the treatment program, or both. Despite the prevalence of cognitive symptoms, it is currently difficult to accurately assess the symptoms for a number of reasons. Specifically, existing ?gold standard? assessments often lack sensitivity to many cancer related deficits, cannot be repeated and thus cannot be  used for monitoring of cognitive change, and are generally disconnected from the cognitive psychology and neuroscience tasks that inform our current mechanistic understanding of cognitive function. We have developed a mobile platform for collecting cognitive and behavioral data that overcomes the issues noted  above. In the current proposal, our objective are to 1) develop a cancer-?specific cognitive assessment tool that can be  used with minimal supervision inside or outside of a clinic, 2) develop a clinician dashboard that provides access to data collected through the platform, and 3) perform comprehensive usability testing of the prototype product with a group of clinicians and patients with cancer.

For example, despite improved survival from cancer, chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity has emerged as a significant problem.  Cardiovascular complication, particularly heart failure, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors.  In small studies, cardioprotective strategies against cancer therapy-induced cardiac dysfunction are effective if implemented early at the subclinical phase.  However, detection of the frequency of subclinical disease and subsequent ability to protect against further functional decline are limited by inadequacy of current technologies to accurately assess and monitor changes in cardiac structure and function.  Novel non-invasive strategies that detect early subclinical changes in cardiac structure, function, and/or tissue are needed to improve detection and monitoring of cardiac injury in order to improve cardioprotection and effectiveness of cancer therapeutics or other toxic exposure.

"9236085","Project Summary Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) affects a large number of people over age 65. Currently, aortic valve replacement surgery is the only available therapy for this disease. Pharmacological intervention of CAVD progression relies on better understanding of the underlying mechanism. Progressive valvular calcification is the main cause of CAVD progression. Elevated levels of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and transforming growth factor-?1 (TGF-?1) in valvular tissue contribute to the mechanism of progressive aortic valve calcification, and the aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) play a critical role in valvular calcification via pro-osteogenic reprogramming. While BMP-2 and TGF-?1 induce AVIC pro- osteogenic reprogramming and myofibroblastic transition, the molecular mechanism underlying the actions of BMP-2 and TGF- ?1 on AVIC is not well understood, and the role of AVIC myofibroblastic transition in valvular calcification is unknown. We found that both BMP-2 and TGF-?1 up-regulate miR- 486 expression and down-regulate miR-204 expression in human AVICs. Further, co-expression of miR- 486 antagomir and 204 mimic suppresses the pro-osteogenic activity in AVICs of diseased human aortic valves, and miR-486 mimic and miR-204 antagomir elevate the levels of osteogenic transcription factors Runx2 and Osx. Further, miR-204 mimic and miR-486 antagomir synergizes in up-regulation of AVIC pro- osteogenic activity. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that miR-486 up-regulation and miR- 204 down-regulation promote aortic valve calcification. The major goals of this project are to elucidate the molecular mechanism of aortic valve calcification and to identify potential therapeutic targets for prevention of CAVD progression. To achieve these goals, we will address the following interrelated Specific Aims: 1) to determine the interaction of miR-486 and miR-204 in elevating the pro-osteogenic activity in human aortic valves and AVICs, 2) to test the hypothesis that miR-486 up-regulates human AVIC pro-osteogenic activity through promoting myofibroblastic transition, and 3) to elucidate the mechanism by which TGF-?1 and BMP-2 modulate miR-486 and miR-204 expression in human AVICs. The results of this project will help improve the understanding of the mechanism responsible for CAVD progression and may identify potential targets for pharmacological intervention."

"9244597","Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus and transmitted by sand flies, is considered by the WHO to be a neglected tropical disease, affecting about 1.5 million people per year. Approximately 70% of CL cases are reported from six countries, including Iran, where CL is endemic in 17 out of 30 provinces, with over 20,000 cases reported annually; the actual incidence has been estimated to be five times higher. There is no vaccine to prevent this disease. Efforts to control zoonotic CL (ZCL), including application of indoor residual insecticides, poisoning of rodent reservoirs, and use of insecticide-treated curtains and bednets (ITNs) have had limited success. In this 2-year project, we propose a novel field-based strategy aimed at prevention of Leishmania major transmission by the sand fly, P. papatasi, with a focus on the hyper-endemic region of Isfahan Province, Iran. Using the sand fly gut-associated bacterium, E. cloacae dissolvens, which has been isolated from biotic loci of ZCL in Isfahan, we propose to develop a paratransgenic model that may eventually be applied to field control. Initially, E. cloacae will be transformed to express the anti-leishmanial peptides, melittin and histone H2B, which act synergistically in vitro to kill L. major at concentrations as low as 1-3 M. Engineered E. cloacae will then be delivered to laboratory lines of P. papatasi using a soil-based strategy that targets larval stages; production of the recombinant peptides will be verified in adult flies. Challenge of the adult female flies with L. major is expected to result in parasite-refractory insects. Additional studies, to be conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), will simulate microbial conditions of rodent burrows where P. papatasi breed to establish the infectivity and persistence of the engineered bacteria in flies under conditions that mimic field settings. Final project deliverables will include engineered lines of E. cloacae dissolvens and a laboratory model of paratransgenic P. papatasi that can be further developed for field deployment in Iran and neighboring regions of the Middle East."

"9259335","Abstract  Engineered nanomaterials (ENM) have great therapeutic potential but their biological interactions are still largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that ENM are capable of inducing microvascular dysfunction but its currently unknown if this dysfunction is due to direct ENM contact or alterations in circulating factors (i.e. chemokines and cytokines) in the plasma. Finally, with the increasing use of ENM in commercial and therapeutic products, there is an immediate need to create high-throughput screening methods to identify endothelial toxicity associated with ENMs. This proposal aims to use a novel approach, which applies ?omic? approaches to better understand the microvascular dysfunction and toxicity associated with ENM. Therefore, we hypothesize that the physicochemical properties of engineered nanomaterials contribute to unique proteomic and transcriptomic profiles in the vascular system, which direct the observed microvascular dysfunction. This hypothesis will be tested using two specific aims, consisting of in vitro and in vivo techniques. The goal of Aim 1 is to analyze the influences of the physicochemical properties of ENM on microvascular dysfunction. Furthermore, this aim will analyze the ability of secondary circulating factors (i.e. chemokines and cytokines) to induce microvascular dysfunction in an ex vivo setting. The ENM used in this aim will be modified to induce electronic defects, which will alter their ability to transfer and accept electrons when in a biological environment and ultimately affect their toxicity. These ENM will be screened using in vitro techniques to analyze endothelial toxicity and identify the ENMs with the lowest and highest toxicity. After these ENM are identified, mice will be intravenously injected to analyze the microvascular dysfunction associated with these ENM. Plasma will be collected from the mice following exposure and used to treat nave arterioles. We predict that this treatment will induce microvascular dysfunction due to the changes in circulating chemokines and cytokines. These assessments will help to determine if direct ENM contact or secondary circulating factors are the leading cause of microvascular dysfunction following ENM exposure. The second aim will utilize a transciptome-proteome approach to quantitatively identify changes in circulating proteins and their subsequent downstream effects on transcriptomic responses in the microvasculature. The use of bioinformatics to integrate exposure changes at both the transcript and protein level will provide a unique analysis of microvascular dysfunction, which will aid in the identification of biomarkers for high-throughput screening methods and the mechanism of action for ENM induced microvascular dysfunction."
"9261871","Atherosclerosis and its complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Therefore, novel therapies are urgently needed to inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis. CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) suppress vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis in both humans and mice. However, the mechanisms underlying Treg suppression of atherosclerosis remain poorly defined. Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a newly characterized anti-inflammatory cytokine, mainly secreted from Treg, which inhibits inflammation resulting from various conditions, including autoimmune diabetes and arthritis, etc. Compared with the other well-characterized anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-?, IL-35 is more powerful, and IL-35 significantly converts effector T cells and B cells to inducible Treg and regulatory B cells.  IL-35 is a heterodimer composed of p35 and Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 3 (EBI3) subunits. Both IL-35 subunits are strongly expressed in endothelial cells (EC) and macrophages (M?) in patients' atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting that IL-35, but not IL-27, is upregulated in atherosclerotic lesions. Compared with healthy controls, IL-35 is decreased in the plasma of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) while related cytokines IL-12 and IL-27 are increased in patients with CAD. However, the roles of IL- 35 in suppressing EC activation and atherogenesis have not been studied.  The goal o is to determine the roles and mechanisms underlying IL-35 suppression of EC activation and atherosclerosis. We have a long publication record of studying EC activation, EC dysfunction, monocyte (MC) recruitment, atherosclerosis, and decreased Treg in acceleration of vascular inflammation. We have obtained strong preliminary data and published two papers (J.B.C.; PLOS ONE) showing that 1) IL-35 is a responsive cytokine, which is not constitutively expressed in most cell types and is significantly induced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and in atherogenic apolipoprotein E (ApoE-/-) mice; 2) IL-35 shares EBI3 subunit with its relative cytokine, IL-27. In contrast to IL-27, IL-35 inhibits EC activation induced by proatherogenic Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand, LPS, by suppressing the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)- AP-1 dependent pathway in human aortic EC; 3) IL-35 inhibits lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC, an oxLDL- derived proatherogenic lipid stimulus)-induced EC activation; 4) Mechanistically, IL-35 inhibits lysoPC- induced generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in human aortic EC; 5) We established an IL-35 therapy model in ApoE-/- mice and found that IL-35 therapy inhibits atherosclerosis; and finally, 6) we have generated EBI3-/-/ApoE-/- double knock-out (KO) mice and are also in the process of generating two additional double KO mice, including IL-12R?2 (an IL-35 receptor (IL35R) subunit)-/- /ApoE-/- double KO mice and p35 (IL-35 subunit)-/-/ApoE-/- double KO mice. These strong preliminary data and publications suggest that IL-35 may suppress EC activation and atherosclerosis. f h t is project The central hypothesis to be examined is that IL-35 inhibits EC activation and proinflammatory ly6Chigh MC recruitment, thereby contributing to suppression of atherosclerosis. We will test this hypothesis using three linked, specific aims briefly described below. Aim 1 will determine the expressions and suppressive function of IL-35/IL-35R subunits in human aortic EC activated by proatherogenic stimuli and aortas of ApoE-/- mice (relevant studies). Aim 2 will examine the mechanisms underlying IL-35 suppression of EC activation and monocyte/M? recruitment during atherosclerosis (mechanistic studies). Aim 3 will determine the mediating roles of IL-35 subunits p35, EBI3 and IL-35R subunit IL12R?2 in atherogenesis in ApoE-/- mice (therapeutic studies). Success of this proposal will lead to the identification of the role and mechanisms underlying IL-35 suppression of EC activation and MC//M? recruitment and atherogenesis. The results will hold great promise for the future development of IL-35-based therapeutics for suppression of vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis."
"9261900","There is a critical unmet need for in vivo detection of dysplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE), a neoplastic tissue state resulting from chronic acid reflux. BE is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, a disease with a high morbidity rate. Patients with BE undergo periodic endoscopic surveillance with systematic biopsy to search for pre-cancerous, dysplastic tissues, at which point therapeutic treatment by thermal ablation or surgery is indicated. These procedures are guided by white-light endoscopy but since there is no visual evidence of at the tissue surface, efficacy for detecting dysplasia is limited. Consequently, dysplasia goes undetected even though BE patients undergo regular endoscopic surveillance. Optical diagnostic techniques have shown the ability to assess tissue health in vivo but none has been widely adopted. Physicians have not taken up these techniques because they typically do not cover enough tissue area to be effective or lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for real-time dysplasia detection. For example, angle-resolved low coherence interferometry (a/LCI) uses nuclear morphology measurements as a biomarker of dysplastic change, with proven sensitivity and specificity for in vivo detection of dysplastic BE tissues. However, a/LCI is a point probe modality, only examining tissues in one spot at a time. Here we seek to incorporate a/LCI into a multimodal optical imaging platform that enables practical detection of dysplasia in BE. The goal of this research project is to design, implement and test advanced multimodal optical imaging systems to enable diagnosis of dysplasia in BE tissues. The following specific aims are proposed. 1) Update a/LCI system with image guidance. The a/LCI system will be redesigned, capitalizing on advances in key spectrometer components to improve utility. The optical fiber probe will be updated to incorporate image guidance using optical coherence tomography (OCT), which will improve usability. 2) Implement real time feedback. Software will be updated to include real time guidance of tissue orientation and health status. 3) Test new designs in clinical study. Clinical study will confirm accuracy of a/LCI for detecting dysplasia while demonstrating improvements in efficiency of new hardware and software. A sub-aim of this study will be to evaluate OCT for guiding a/LCI measurements while also detecting residual sub-squamous BE glands which may persist after therapy that remain a cancer risk. 4) Develop multipoint a/LCI probe. Demonstrate principle of wide area scans using a/LCI, enabling multiple measurements without repositioning. Further advances will integrate this probe into the form factor of a therapeutic probe, specifically the Barrx Halo 90, a 2 cm2 ?paddle? that is mounted on the outside of a standard endoscope. 5) Conduct clinical trial of multipoint probe. This final clinical study will test the new form factor by comparing with the first trial in this project. Endpoints will be to determine the yield of dysplastic positive biopsies while also assessing the amount of time needed to cover the tissue. Completion of these aims will yield a clinically incisive diagnostic tool suitable for widespread adoption."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress towards understanding mechanisms of hearing, and the treatment of hearing deficits, requires an integrated effort from multiple disciplines within the field of hearing research. The Center for Hearing Research (CHR) at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) maintains an interdisciplinary training program that takes advantage of the breadth and depth of hearing research at UCI to train new scientists broadly across multiple disciplines as well as deeply in one. The 17 training faculty in CHR span six departments in four Schools (Biological Sciences, Engineering, Medicine and Social Sciences) with research interests that cover a broad range of levels (genes, molecules, cells, systems and behavior) and experimental approaches (cell and molecular biology, neurophysiology, psychoacoustics, computation, human imaging, medical devices). Thus, CHR is well-positioned to offer interdisciplinary training. We request support for three predoctoral students and two postdoctoral researchers including medical residents from Otolaryngology. The didactic core of the training program is a course in Auditory Neuroscience, which covers the auditory system from cells to psychoacoustics, the cochlear to the cortex, and basic and clinical aspects. Mandatory features of the training program that encourage interdisciplinary interactions are participation in all CHR activities (e.g., seminar series, journal club and two annual conferences) required oral and poster presentations to scientifically diverse audiences on three occasions per year, and regular meetings with basic and clinical scientists. The normal period of support is two years for pre- and post-doctoral trainees (1-2 years for residents). Predoctoral trainees normally enter the program in their second year of graduate study and are required to take a course on grant writing and submit an NRSA proposal. The program is managed by the Program Director and an Executive Committee, and will foster development of trainees' intellectual, technical and professional skills needed to pursue successful careers in hearing research."
"9048850","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cephalotaxus alkaloids have been extensively studied as synthetic targets, due to the antileukemic activity of certain ester derivatives and the  synthetically challenging core structure. Homoharringtonine, also known as omacetaxin mepesuccinate, has recently been approved as a treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia. However, despite these studies, only minimal modifications of the active natural product have been studied for activity, and synthetic variation has only been performed on the ester side chain.       This proposal describes a detailed strategy for the synthesis of the core cephalotaxine scaffold in 7-9 steps, a sizable reduction over known syntheses. Through the modification of one step in the synthesis, the route can be made enantioselective to synthesize the natural product. The use of flow chemistry allows for the rapid synthesis of the core scaffold, and enables the safe use of reactive and toxic reagents. In-line preparation of reactive intermediates allows for the rapid introduction of complexity that would be infeasible on large scale. The strategy is designed to enable a modular approach to the synthesis of structural analogs for the purposes of structure-activity relationship studies and the development of improved therapeutics."

Compare stool GI microbiota composition, GI permeability, and pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines (GI biomarkers) in adults (18-45 yr of age) with IBS (n=100) versus (vs) Healthy Controls (HC) (n=50) without IBS. Aim 2. Among individuals with IBS, compare abdominal pain, other IBS symptoms and psychological distress symptoms in those with abnormal vs. normal GI biomarkers. The HC group results will be used to determine normal ranges for permeability, cytokines, and cluster analyses will be used to identify IBS subtypes based on type of microbiota community. Aim 3. Explore patterns of associations among GI biomarkers (permeability, cytokines, microbiota); and associations of GI biomarkers with abdominal pain, other IBS symptoms, stress, psychological distress, genetic polymorphisms (SERT, IL-10, IL-10R). The goal is to identify IBS subgroups based on combinations of biomarkers and clinical phenotypes, which could potentially correspond to different etiologies. Cluster analyses will be applied to microbiota data to identify subtypes with different microbiota profiles. Revised Aim 4: Explore fecal TRP metabolites and BAs, preliminarily compare IBS and HCs and examine patterns of association similar to that described in Aim 3 for microbiome. Aims 3 & 4 are exploratory and any proposed subtypes will need validation in an independent sample. Our proposal addresses NINR goals including developing new diagnostic tools and predictive biomarkers, encouraging risk taking, innovation, and creativity, to address a healthcare cost (costs are 57% greater for IBS). The proposed revision is important because providers are challenged given the pathobiology of IBS is poorly defined and treatments are not universally effective. Future studies could target management with abnormal biomarkers differently from those with no biomarker abnormalities but greater psychological distress."

"9219877","Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2 derived from NADPH oxidase (NOX) act as signaling molecules to promote VEGF-induced angiogenesis in ECs and post-ischemic neovascularization. Fundamental question remains ?how diffusible H2O2 signal can be efficiently transmitted to promote therapeutic angiogenesis.? Signaling function of ROS is through oxidation of reactive Cys residues to generate ?Cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys- OH)? which is involved in disulfide bond formation and redox signaling. Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) functions as oxidase, reductase and isomerase depending on redox environment. ?PDIA1? is a major PDI isoform with four reactive Cys residues in redox active domains. Given redox properties of PDI, PDI may function as redox sensor in ROS-dependent VEGF signaling to enhance therapeutic angiogenesis and maintain endothelial metabolic states. Preliminary Data found that PDIA1+/- mice or diabetes mice with reduced PDIA1 expression show impaired reparative angiogenesis, indicating in vivo significance of PDIA1. In primary ECs, VEGF stimulation increases Cys-OH formation of various proteins, which was markedly decreased by PDIA1 siRNA. Experiments using 2D gel assay and searching for binding partner of PDIA1 discovered that PDIA1 functions as a redox sensor in ROS-dependent VEGF signaling to promote Cys oxidation/activation of AMPK, a key regulator of cell metabolism and angiogenesis, via disulfide bond formation. Moreover, in quiescent basal ECs, PDIA1 knockdown unexpectedly induced mitochondrial fragmentation and EC senescence without inducing ER stress via increasing Cys oxidation of Drp1, a key fission GTPase. We thus hypothesize that PDIA1 functions as key redox adaptor/reductase for Drp1 to maintain mitochondrial dynamics in quiescent ECs as well as redox sensor when it is Cys oxidized to transduce VEGF-induced H2O2 signal to promote oxidative activation of AMPK via disulfide bond formation, thereby enhancing endothelial metabolism and angiogenesis in ECs. This is required for full neovascularization in ischemic vascular disease. Aim 1 will determine the molecular mechanisms by which PDIA1 senses VEGF-induced H2O2 signal to promote EC metabolism and angiogenesis via oxidative activation of AMPK, which is impaired in diabetic ECs. Aim2 will examine whether PDIA1 maintains mitochondrial dynamics via binding to Drp1 to keep it in reduced/inactive state in quiescent ECs, thereby preventing mitochondrial fragmentation and ECs dysfunction in diabetes. Aim 3 will determine the in vivo role of endothelial PDIA1 in ROS-dependent reparative neovascularization, which is impaired in diabetes. We will use biotin-labelled Cys-OH trapping probe; BiFC-based molecular protein interaction imaging; mitochondrial dynamics imaging; EC-specific PDIA1-/- or diabetic mice; and gene transfer of EC-targeted Cys oxidation defective mutants of PDIA1, AMPK and Drp1. Our proposal will provide novel insights into Cys reduced/oxidized proteins and Cys oxidation-mediated molecular interaction as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of ischemic cardiovascular metabolic diseases."
"9238399","PROJECT SUMMARY Human type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. CD8 T cells are the most common [immune] cell found in insulitic lesions and are the principal T cell type implicated in beta cell destruction. Studies performed within this project have already revealed significant [and novel] findings including: 1) the first identification of auto-reactive CD8 T cells in the islets of patients with T1D using a specially [designed method of] tetramer staining and 2) [the first description of high] numbers of CD8 T cells infiltrating the exocrine pancreas in T1D patients compared with non-diabetic individuals. Based on these findings, we anticipate that only a proportion of the cells that infiltrate the pancreas are indeed auto-reactive. Thus, the pool of `bystander' CD8 T cells that recognize other, for example viral, antigens might significantly contribute to the inflammatory environment of the organ. At present, the overall specificities and frequencies of CD8 T cells in the pancreas and the cause for their entry and activation are not fully understood. Possible targets are known autoantigens derived from beta cells such as insulin, IGRP, IA-2 and GAD (see Table 2 for abbreviations) and cellular matrix proteins, which could become presented [and modified] when beta cells are destroyed, but viral proteins, for example enteroviral determinants are also possible candidates. The overall objective of this renewal application is therefore to compare the specificity, phenotype and function of CD8 T lymphocytes from human islets with those found in exocrine tissue, and to assess whether their presence correlates with islet-specific pathology (e.g. viral infections and their detectable footprints). We will study patients with recent-onset and longstanding T1D in order to build a road map of specificities and to further understand how the relationship between the CD8 T cell infiltrate and the disease course might evolve [both quantitatively and qualitatively over time. A unique strength is not only the access to very unique organ repositories but also the newly established collaboration with Dr. Alessandro Sette and Dr. Bjoern Peters' laboratories, which maintain the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) at La Jolla institute and are part of an epitope discovery initiative led by Novo Nordisk. Using the information contained in the IEDB and in vitro assays, neo-epitopes to modified autoantigens and new viral CD8 T cell epitopes restricted to HLA-A2 will be mapped and the information shared with our laboratory. Overall, our findings should give us a better understanding of how and why T1D develops and thus help ultimately with the development of new therapeutic options.] Our first goal is to systematically and quantitatively detect autoreactive CD8 T cells within human islets and exocrine pancreas and to correlate the number and activation status of these cells with the local histopathology of the organ. In situ tetramer staining of freshly frozen human pancreata available from the Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes (nPOD), the Diabetes Biobank Brussels (DBB) and the Biobank at Oslo University Hospital will be performed. [The discovery of new post-translationally-modified epitopes using the information contained in the IEDB and the expertise at La Jolla Institute in conjunction with our experiments in situ will provide, for the first time,] information on the precise tissue distribution of antigen- specific CD8 T cells in the pancreas. In addition, we will further characterize their phenotype and function. This will allow for the identification of key antigens with significant polarization towards the islets, which are more likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of disease. It will also help us to understand why exocrine pancreas inflammation is often present in T1D. Our second goal is to search for virus-specific T cells within islets and exocrine tissue. [This will help to ascertain whether one virus might trigger the disease (hit-and-run event) or whether numerous viral attacks are required (multiple hits) or several viral strains of the same genus or even different viruses that trigger common pathways might play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease (multiple viruses)]. Pancreas tissue sections from donors with recent-onset and long duration of T1D will therefore be probed with virus-specific tetramers, and we will detect any viral proteins and nucleic acids in these samples in collaboration with the nPOD-Virology group in order to investigate the manner of viral infection (hit-and-run; multiple hits or multiple viruses). We will initially focus our attention on enteroviruses (EV), as only the association with group B coxsackieviruses has thus far been sufficiently documented. [For this purpose, we will aim to identify new EV epitopes through our collaboration with Dr. Sette and Dr. Peters' laboratories and the use of the IEDB as well as their expertise on the discovery and validation of cytotoxic and T cell epitopes presented by HLA Class I molecules]. The frequency of EV-specific cells will be compared to that of other common viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We will also investigate the possible presence of herpesvirus-6 (HHV6) and HHV6-specific CD8 T cells, because recent evidence suggests that this virus might be present in the pancreas of T1D donors. In addition, we will correlate our findings with the local histopathology of the organ (MHC-I expression, interferon signature, CD8 T cell phenotype, cytokine production and presence/absence of viral protein or genome)."
"9239364","Project Summary Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a key enzyme involved in the regulation of vascular tone and altered eNOS activity leads to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Post-transcriptional modulation of eNOS mRNA stability is a major determinant of eNOS expression in vascular endothelium. The molecular mechanisms regulating eNOS mRNA stability remain poorly understood and represent an important gap in knowledge. This competitive renewal application proposes to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which eNOS mRNA stability is regulated. Preliminary studies suggest that the binding of Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1 (PTB1) to the eNOS mRNA 3?-UTR leads to decreased eNOS mRNA stability and expression. Moreover, we found that PTB1 specifically interacts with the mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1 (Mst1), an upstream serine/threonine-specific protein kinase of the Hippo pathway, which leads to PTB1 phosphorylation and decreased eNOS mRNA stability and protein expression in vascular endothelial cells. Our preliminary data further demonstrate that Mst1 kinase is activated in the atherosclerotic lesions and blocking Mst1 activation by overexpression of dominant negative protein (DN-Mst1) (K59R) in vascular endothelial cells markedly increased eNOS mRNA stability and expression, implicating a functional significance of Mst1 kinase in regulating endothelial functions. We therefore hypothesize that hyperlipidemia-induced activation of Mst1 promotes the binding of PTB1 to eNOS 3?-UTR, which in turn downregulates eNOS expression and causes endothelial dysfunction in the atherogenesis. Accordingly, we propose three comprehensive specific aims to delineate how the regulation of PTB1 by Mst1 kinase affects eNOS mRNA stability and expression, and the extent to which this contributes to the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction and vascular disease. Specific aim 1 will examine the functional significance of Mst1 in regulating eNOS mRNA stability by PTB1. We will identify the Mst1 specific phosphorylation site(s) on PTB1 and then determine whether phosphorylation of PTB1 by Mst1 alters the binding affinity of PTB1 to the eNOS 3?-UTR, leading to decreased eNOS mRNA stability and protein expression in vascular endothelial cells. Specific aim 2 will determine whether PTB1 induces eNOS mRNA instability by inhibiting 3?-polyadenylation of eNOS mRNA and/or by increasing the binding of microRNAs to the eNOS 3?-UTR. Specific aim 3 will determine whether the Mst1/PTB1 pathway regulates endothelial dysfunction in vivo. By using our newly generated endothelial specific DN-Mst1 transgenic and Mst1 knockout mice, we will investigate whether eNOS expression, endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation, and atherosclerosis are altered by specifically blocking Mst1 activation in vascular endothelial cells. We envision these will establish the importance of Mst1 as a therapeutic target for improving endothelial function and decreasing cardiovascular disease."
"9245192","At the dawn of an age when RNA molecules are being used as therapeutics, we identified a novel RNA-based mechanism in the regulation of endothelin-1 (ET-1). The ET-1 hormone signaling pathway is an emerging target for the treatment of age-related pathologies such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Excessive renal ET-1 expression occurs at all stages of CKD. Moreover, ET-1 plays a central role in CKD-related cell proliferation, inflammation and fibrosis. Existing pharmacological strategies targeting the ET-1 signaling pathway are fraught with serious and unacceptable side effects. An RNA-based therapeutic represents a fundamentally different approach for controlling ET-1 action. We discovered a novel long noncoding antisense RNA (EDN1-AS) originating from within the human ET-1 locus. EDN1-AS is expressed in male and female mouse kidney, in human breast, lung, and renal cell lines and in human adult kidney tissue. We propose to define the regulation and function of EDN1-AS in a model of CKD. Typically, antisense RNAs down-regulate expression of a gene in a highly specific manner. Our preliminary data demonstrate that EDN1-AS is expressed in a circadian manner and that the circadian clock protein Per1 interacts with the EDN1-AS promoter. Together these findings demonstrate the existence of a novel long noncoding RNA with the potential to provide an entirely new approach for targeting ET-1 in CKD and other age-related disease states. The strength of our investigative team is the ability to link physiological observations to the underlying molecular mechanisms. Together we have made numerous contributions to the understanding of ET-1 regulation, expression, and function. The scope of our combined approach ranges from analysis of chromatin structure, to discovery of mineralocorticoid receptor induction of EDN1 gene activity, to characterization of circadian clock regulation of EDN1, to detection of miRNA action on ET-1 synthesis. Thus, we are well-suited to perform the proposed studies to characterize a novel mechanism of endothelin regulation. Our long term goal is to demonstrate that manipulation of ET-1 levels using an EDN1-AS approach will result in therapeutic benefits for CKD patients by decreasing cell proliferation and fibrosis in the renal proximal tubule. Since EDN1-AS is a newly discovered antisense RNA, the goals of this proposal are to characterize EDN1-AS, determine its mode of action, and define its regulation by the circadian clock in a model of CKD. Our central hypothesis is that EDN1-AS represents a novel regulatory mechanism governing endothelin signaling with implications for treating age-related disease states focusing on CKD. These studies are absolutely necessary to lay the groundwork for development of therapeutic strategies."

Longitudinal studies investigate environmental exposure, including physical, chemical, biological, social, behavioral, natural and built environments, on childhood health and development. The focus is on outcomes in upper and lower airway, obesity, pre, peri and postnatal outcome, neurodevelopmental. Studies share data analysis center, The National Children's Study (NCS) is prospective longitudinal cohort study of the individual and combined effects of environmental exposures and gene environmental interactions on child health and development in a representative sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the United States. The children will be followed from before birth until age 21. The importance and timeliness of this study are based on many factors, including past experiences demonstrating profound effects of environmental exposures, such as exposures to alcohol during pregnancy and to lead in early childhood on child health and development; the special vulnerabilities of children to environmental exposures compared to adults; known ongoing exposures, such as prevalent levels of non-persistent pesticides or hours of media exposure per day in young children; and evidence for environmental contributions or causes to such high-impact conditions as autism, developmental delay and developmental disability, asthma, and obesity. The primary aim of the NCS is to investigate the separate and combined effects of environmental exposures (chemical, biological, physical, psychosocial) as well as gene-environment interactions on pregnancy outcomes, child health and development, and precursors of adult disease. Unique features of the study include its focus on environmental exposures at the earliest stages of pregnancy (as well as thereafter) and the breadth of planned exposure and outcome measurements. NICHD and a consortium of federal agencies plan and conduct a longitudinal study of the impacts of environmental exposures on children.   Because the focus of the study includes assessment of the impact of exposures that occur early in pregnancy, both pregnant women and their partners, and women of childbearing age, comprise the initial target population for enrollment. Data will be collected in combinations of face-to-face contacts and remote collection methods, e.g., telephone, computer, or mail-in questionnaires. The expected frequency of contact (face-to-face or remote) is approximately every three months through age one, every six months through age five years and annually thereafter. For a sample of children enrolled in the study, visits will also be made to child care and school settings for collection of environmental samples and observational data. Anticipated biologic specimens include blood, urine, hair, and nail clippings from mothers and children; blood, urine, and hair from fathers; cord blood, umbilical cord and placental tissues, and meconium collected at/around the time of delivery; vaginal swabs, and breast milk from mothers. Anticipated environmental samples include air, dust, soil, food, and water.  ."
"9365601","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a congenital vascular abnormality in the brain with direct connections between arteries and veins such that blood bypasses brain tissue. The primary presentation of AVM is intracranial hemorrhage which occurs in as many as 40-70% of patients and may lead to permanent injury or death. As the gold standard for the detection and evaluation of vascular malformations, conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is an invasive procedure bearing risks of neurological complications, as well as risks of ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast. While superior for th delineation of vascular anatomy, DSA is not capable of providing quantitative assessments of blood flow or degree of shunt in an AVM. Existing MR techniques are suboptimal for quantifying the hemodynamics of vascular malformation, and the complexity of the vascular architecture is often inadequately demonstrated. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a noninvasive MRI technique that utilizes magnetically labeled blood water as an endogenous tracer for perfusion measurements. Due to the direct shunt between arteries and veins in AVMs, the labeled blood spins behave as an intravascular contrast agent, and can be utilized for visualizing the dynamic blood flow through feeding arteries, nidus and draining veins of an AVM. Furthermore, hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow, blood volume and mean transit time can be quantified by adapting the standard tracer kinetic model. We have recently developed such an entirely noninvasive and quantitative 4-D time-resolved dMRA technique by combining ASL with a segmented cine multiphase TrueFISP sequence. The goal of the present proposal is to further develop, validate and evaluate the clinical utility of 4-D non-contrast dMRA in assessing both the vascular architecture and hemodynamics of AVMs. In Aim 1, further technical development and optimization of 4-D non-contrast dMRA will be performed, including implementation of multi-bolus pulsed and pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) with vessel selective labeling; Cartesian sampling with view sharing; dynamic golden angle radial acquisition with k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC); in conjunction with parallel imaging and potentially compressed sensing. In Aim 2, validation of methods for quantifying blood flow and degree of shunt through AVMs using 4- D dMRA will be carried out by comparison with phase-contrast (PC) MRI and pCASL perfusion MRI. Finally in Aim 3, the clinical utility of the proposed 4-D dMRA technique will be evaluated in AVM patients by comparison with the reference standard of DSA, time-of-flight (TOF) MRA and T2 weighted MRI. Furthermore, repeated scans will be performed to test whether 4-D dMRA is able to detect changes of blood flow and degree of shunt through AVMs pre and post treatments. The proposed 4-D dMRA is expected to provide alternative and complementary approaches for conventional DSA and MRA/MRI techniques in quantitative assessments of hemodynamics in AVMs. It will be useful not only for evaluation of AVMs, but also for other cerebrovascular disorders such as steno-occlusive diseases and cerebral aneurysms."

Diamond, Goldberg, Randolph, and Stappenbeck has extensive scientific expertise relevant to this proposal and highly successful track records as mentors. Second, the educational resources including the Office of Postdoctoral Affairs and the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences will enable Dr. Wilen to acquire and develop additional scientific and professional skills. Third, the research infrastructure within the Virgin lab and Washington University core facilities will enable Dr. Wilen to efficiently and skillfully address the scientific aims described herein. In summary, Washington University provides the ideal environment and resources for Dr. Wilen to develop and establish his independent career studying how viruses interact with the immune system to cause disease.  The long-term goal of this study is to understand the role of virus-receptor interactions in governing murine norovirus tropism and pathogenesis in vivo. Murine norovirus is an important model for human norovirus, which is the primary cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide. In addition, murine norovirus has been demonstrated to trigger inflammatory bowel disease in mice with certain genetic predispositions. However, the determinants of murine norovirus tropism and pathogenesis, and the mechanism of virus- induced enteric inflammation remain unknown.

"9206644","PROJECT SUMMARY This research project will develop statistical methods for the analysis of time-to-event, or failure time, data. Major areas of application include randomized controlled trials and epidemiologic cohort studies for the prevention or treatment of cancer or other diseases. The project aims to develop regression methods for the simultaneous analysis of multiple outcome variables in relation to treatments or exposures that may be evolving over the study follow-up period. The methods to be developed will be based on semiparametric regression models that include Cox models for marginal hazard functions and additive semiparametric regression models for pairwise and higher dimensional dependency functions. Using these models the failure time data will be characterized using a multivariate version of Dabrowska?s survivor function representation. A maximum likelihood approach, based on the probability distribution of the evolving failure time histories, will be used for parameter estimation. The work has potential to strengthen analyses of treatment effects, or regression effects more generally, for specific clinical outcomes by using data on other failure time outcomes to provide information censoring information. For example in a clinical trial with death as primary outcome, these methods will allow the occurrence of serious, but non-fatal, events during the study subject follow-up period to strengthen primary outcome treatment evaluations. The novel methods also will provide an efficient means of assessing the magnitude of dependencies among the risks for various outcome types, and their relationship to treatments or covariates. Many clinical trials or cohort study applications involve some form of cohort subsampling, with expensive biomarker values determined from raw materials (e.g., genomic measures from blood specimens) only for ?cases? that develop study diseases during cohort follow-up and corresponding ?controls? that do not. A second aim of this research project is to develop efficient analyses of treatment or covariate effects in the presence of cohort subsampling, for both univariate and multivariate failure time data. The methods development here will also rely on semiparametric maximum likelihood methods, with the novel aspect of including a nonparametric likelihood component for covariate history increments as they evolve over cohort follow-up. With univariate failure time data this work will lead to estimating functions for Cox model regression parameters and for observed covariate history parameters for iterative maximization, under nested case-control, case-cohort, or more general sampling schemes. Multivariate failure time extensions will combine semiparametric models for marginal hazard functions and for pairwise and higher dimensional dependency functions with completely nonparametric models for observed covariate histories. Asymptotic distributions for the novel estimation procedures will be developed using empirical process theory, and moderate sample properties will be evaluated using computer simulations, and using applications to Women?s Health Initiative and other datasets."

"9213858","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is a common lung disorder whose activity is strongly influenced by time. Asthma symptoms vary with the season (reflecting rates of respiratory viral infection), and they also vary by the time of day, such that many patients experience their worst symptoms in the middle of the night. The latter suggests that the circadian clock, a collection of genes that produce circadian rhythms, is connected to asthma. While viruses and circadian rhythms are both known to affect asthma symptoms, these two aspects of disease have never been mechanistically linked. Here, we discovered that a circadian clock gene called bmal1 may impact asthma by regulating the lung?s response to common respiratory viruses. We show that disruption of the clock gene bmal1 in mice produces an aberrant antiviral response to parainfluenza and influenza A viruses, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infection. The antiviral actions of bmal1 appear localized to airway epithelial cells, where this gene orchestrates interferon responses during acute viral illness. After the acute infection resolves, we show in mice that bmal1 deficiency exacerbates post-viral chronic airway disease, including features that are characteristic of asthmatic lungs. Finally, we found that bmal1 expression is down-regulated in airway samples from asthma patients. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the circadian clock regulates the antiviral responses of airway epithelial cells through bmal1, and thereby controls the severity of acute and chronic viral lung pathology. We further hypothesize that circadian clock function is defective in the airway epithelial cells of asthmatics, leading to reduced bmal1 expression, and potentially explaining the heightened susceptibility that these patients have to respiratory viruses. To determine the mechanism by which bmal1 mediates antiviral defenses in the respiratory system we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine how bmal1 in airway epithelial cells controls interferon gene expression and the severity of acute respiratory viral illness in mice; 2) Determine how bmal1 deficiency promotes post-viral chronic airway disease in mice; and, 3) Determine the nature of the circadian clock dysfunction in the airway epithelium of asthmatic patients. We will address Aim1 by using airway-conditional bmal1 knockout mice and in vitro culture of bmal1- null mouse tracheal epithelial cells to delineate how this gene regulates the interferon response to respiratory viruses (Sendai and Influenza A viruses). We will address Aim 2 by using tamoxifen-inducible bmal1 knockout mice to define when in the course of infection bmal1 is needed for the regulation of post-viral lung disease. We will address Aim 3 by using a luciferase reporter system to analyze circadian clock function and bmal1 expression in cultured human airway cells, derived from normal and asthmatic subjects."
"9228135","Project summary/abstract Sarcoidosis, a multisystem granulomatous disorder of yet unknown etiology, is characterized by formation of noncaseating granulomas. The granulomas almost always occur in lungs, but other organs, including skin, eye and heart, can be affected as well. The granulomatous inflammation causes organ dysfunction and ultimately fibrosis which are associated with morbidity and mortality. In the United States, the sarcoidosis annual adjusted incidence rate in Caucasians is about 11 in 100,000 and 34 in 100,000 in African Americans. Hypergammaglobulinemia, autoantibody production and circulating immune complexes are frequently associated with sarcoidosis, indicating that humoral immunity, and B cells in particular, may be involved in pathogenesis of this disease. Supporting this hypothesis several recent studies suggest abnormal B cells responses in sarcoidosis patients. We recently described a population of T-bet+/CD11c+ B cells (previously named ABCs), which appear in autoimmune prone mice and humans. A combination of TLR7, IFN?R and BCR signaling leads to a high level of T-bet expression in B cells. This in turn leads to B cell differentiation into CD11c+ B cells and IgG2a/c isotype class-switch (in mice). Interestingly, the same factors (IFN? and TLR7) have been reported to play a role in sarcoidosis. These data led us to the hypothesis that T-bet+/CD11c+ B cells might be present in sarcoidosis patients and might be involved in the pathology of this disease. The data obtained from murine T- bet expressing B cell indicate that this B cell subset is enriched in autoreactive B cells, can produce high titers of autoantibodies, and is more efficient in antigen processing and presentation than other B cells. Thus we suggest that high levels of IFN? and involvement of TLR7 can lead to the appearance of T-bet+/CD11c+ B cells in sarcoidosis patients. This B cell subset might affect the development of the disease by production of autoantibodies and/or by antigen presentation to T cells. We will pursue the following Aims: Aim 1. To assess the frequency of T-bet+/CD11c+ B cells in sarcoidosis patients, their presence in granulomas and its correlation with clinical data. Aim 2. To explore the properties of T-bet+/CD11c+ B cells in sarcoidosis patients Aim 3. To determine the function of T-bet+/CD11c+ B cells in sarcoidosis patients The unique accessibility to the sarcoidosis and IPF disease controls samples at National Jewish Health (NJH serves as a local and national referral center for sarcoidosis) creates a great opportunity for studying this disease (especially, since there is no animal model). The sarcoidosis biorepository has recruited over 800 patients to date and continues to recruit sarcoidosis patients. In addition the combination of Dr. Hamzeh?s expertise in sarcoidosis and Dr. Rubtsova?s expertise in B cells biology creates a uniquely strong foundation for a successful accomplishment of this proposal."
"9235438","The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development  (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for obese woman that does not increase the risk of VTE.  Products containing the synthetic estrogen, ethinyl estradiol, have been associated with a dosedependent increase in VTE. Products containing the natural hormone, estradiol, or progestinonly products have the potential for a much lower risk of VTE. One example of such potentially afer products is a new contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) that can deliver a continuous dose of  Nestorone (Nes) and estradiol (E2). The Nes/E2 ring has the potential to provide effective long term contraception without the need for daily intervention. Examples of safer progestin-only methods are levonorgestrel formulations (patch or injection) or desogestrel (pill). In order to valuate if new products could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The proposed study will be conducted in women of reproductive age in order to evaluate contraceptive efficacy, pharmacokinetics, bleeding patterns, and the safety and side effects of this new contraceptive product. In the event of substantial product delay or failure, reprioritization may result in testing of a different product in the CDDB development pipeline. In such cases, the scope and objectives remain the same and the specifics of the technical requirements will be modified according to the latest approved protocol.The proposed study will be conducted in women of reproductive age in order to evaluate contraceptive efficacy, pharmacokinetics, bleeding patterns, and the safety and side effects of this new contraceptive product.

"9226282","Induction of cell death of virus-infected cells limits the viral factory and facilitates cross priming of virus- specific T cells. As such, cell death is an important host response against viral pathogens. In response, viruses often encode inhibitors that counteract host cell death. For example, many herpesviruses and poxviruses encode inhibitors of caspases, the key enzymes that execute apoptosis. In many cases, these viral inhibitors can dramatically alter the host response against the virus. Necroptosis or programmed necrosis is a non-apoptotic form of cell death marked by rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity that often precedes exposure of the ?eat-me? signal phosphatidyl serine (PS) on the cell surface. Receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is the critical kinase that mediates necroptosis. RIPK3 phosphorylates its downstream effector mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Phospho-MLKL undergoes oligomerization, translocates to the plasma membrane and induces membrane rupture. The release of cellular damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from necroptotic cells stimulates innate immune effectors such as dendritic cells and macrophages to enhance anti-viral immune responses. Because RIPK3 and its upstream activator RIPK1 are both cleavage substrates of caspase 8, optimal induction of necroptosis requires inhibition of caspases. Previously, we found that cells infected with vaccinia virus (VV), the poxvirus strain that was used as vaccine against smallpox, were highly sensitive to TNF-induced necroptosis. Ripk3-deficient mice failed to control VV replication and succumbed to the infection. These observations led to the current dogma that poxviruses sensitize infected cells to necroptosis. In contrast to VV, several recent reports showed that herpesviruses often encode viral inhibitors of necroptosis. These results led us to ask whether VV-induced sensitization to necroptosis is a universal phenomenon for poxviruses.  In preliminary studies, we found that unlike VV-infected cells, cowpox virus (CPXV) infected cells were resistant to TNF-induced necroptosis. CPXV induces resistance to necroptosis by proteasome-mediated degradation of the essential signal adaptor RIPK3. Moreover, we found that the viral caspase 8 inhibitor MC159 from the human poxvirus Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) is a dual function inhibitor that inhibits apoptosis and necroptosis. Based on these preliminary results, we propose two aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which CPXV and MC159 inhibit TNF-induced necroptosis. In Aim 1, we will screen and identify the CPXV gene product that mediates proteasome-mediated RIPK3 degradation. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that the E3 ligase CPXV-p28 is the key viral enzyme that mediates this effect. We will use RNA interference and generate recombinant VV expressing either wild type or mutant p28 to determine the functional role of RIPK3 degradation on viral replication. In Aim 2, we will interrogate the molecular mechanism by which MC159 inhibits necroptosis. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that MC159 binds to the cellular E3 ligases cIAP1 and cIAP2 to inhibit their recruitment to the TNFR1 signaling complex. Together, these studies will yield important knowledge on the viral mechanisms of cell death inhibition and the role of necroptosis in virus evolution."
"9236822","Project Summary Traditionally viewed as the bandaids of the blood, the contribution of platelets to the progression of malignancy is emerging as a compelling focus for therapeutic intervention. Complex interactions between tumor cells, and circulating platelets play an important role in tumor growth and dissemination, and a growing body of data supports a role for platelet activation and release of chemokines in metastases and neovascularization. Supporting this concept is the evidence that elevated platelet counts (thrombocytosis) at time of diagnosis with malignancy is a harbinger of an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. One very interesting and provocative connection between cancer and platelets is the increasing evidence that tumor cells hijack platelets to promote a more pro-malignant phenotype to drive disease progression. Our laboratories have been instrumental in establishing the pro-malignant role of platelets in metastasis and neovascularization. We have recently discovered that tumor cells can instruct platelets to release CCL5, a known driver of tumor cell invasion and metastasis, and have expanded the role of CCL5 not only as a regulator of metastasis but also as a central controller of platelet production. Despite this progress, how tumor cells instruct megakaryocytes to increase platelet production, and how malignancy reprograms megakaryocytes and manipulates platelet phenotype to support tumor growth and metastasis remains an enigma. Since platelets play a central role in driving cancer, this proposal will address three interrelated while independent Specific Aims focused on the cell biological and molecular pathways by which tumor cells hijack megakaryocytes and platelets to promote cancer growth. Specific Aim 1 will determine the role of the chemokine CCL5 as a major driver of thrombocytosis in malignancy via upregulation of megakaryocyte maturation and proplatelet production. Specific Aim 2 will determine how malignancy reprograms megakaryocytes to produce a more pro-malignant platelet phenotype, with upregulation of factors essential to neovascularization and metastasis. Specific Aim 3 will determine the clinical significance of CCL5 driven platelet production and megakaryocyte reprogramming by elucidating the impact of each in breast cancer patients. This work is innovative because it enters unchartered territory and takes a multifaceted experimental approach to understanding how tumor cells hijack platelets by uniting work on platelet production with cancer biology. Taken together, we expect that this investigation will demonstrate the molecular mechanisms by which malignancy can subvert normal platelet biology by manipulating the megakaryocyte to promote cancer growth and metastasis, and lay the foundation for the development of novel therapeutic modalities.

"9239197","ABSTRACT More than half of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) develop hypertension (HTN), which doubles their risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Even though it is well known that insulin resistance and chronic inflammation lead to HTN and accelerate vascular disease in patients with T2DM, very little is known about the mechanisms by which these risk factors promote HTN and CVD. Vitamin D deficiency in patients with T2DM is almost twice that of non-diabetics, and most of the randomized clinical trials evaluating vitamin D supplementation in uncomplicated T2DM have demonstrated BP reductions, suggesting a possible effect in this population. Thus, the goal of this application is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency promotes HTN in the setting of T2DM. Our preliminary data indicates that mice with macrophage- specific deletion of the VDR (KODMAC) were hypertensive with increased systemic renin, activation of the macrophage renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the aorta, and renal macrophage infiltration into the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, the main source of renin production. Peritoneal macrophages from KODMAC or their media activated JG cell renin production via macrophage secretion of miR106b. This effect was blunted by lack of macrophage ER stress-regulated (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP). Similar effects were found with macrophages from vitamin D-deficient mice or from vitamin D-deficient patients with T2DM. Thus, we hypothesize that vitamin D-deficient macrophages increase systemic renin and hypertension in T2DM via increased secretion of miR-106b, stimulating renin secretion by JG cells, and/or via macrophage RAS-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will determine whether bone marrow (BM) transplant from miR-106b-/- or CHOP-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether BM transplant from Renin 1c-/- into vitamin D-deficient mice improves HTN and decreases systemic renin. In Aim 3, we will also assess the role of these inflammatory mechanisms of HTN in patients with T2DM and vitamin D deficiency by correlating changes in plasma miR-106b levels with changes in blood pressure after vitamin D supplementation (Aim 3a) and by testing whether monocytes or serum from vitamin D-deficient diabetics with HTN induce JG cell renin secretion via miR-106b (Aim 3b). This proposal will identify the mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency regulates the innate immune system to induce systemic renin production and HTN in type 2 diabetes and thus, provide new therapeutic targets for these pervasive diseases.

"9239437","Both the two FDA-approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) (Adcetris and Kadcyla) and nearly all ADCs in clinical trials are prepared by randomly conjugating drugs to lysine or cysteine residues in the antibody, affording a heterogeneous ADC mixture. Site-specific conjugation is a major recent improvement to ADC development, yielding homogeneous ADCs with greatly improved therapeutic index. Among the 60+ ADCs currently in clinical development, nearly 50 of them use auristatin and maytansine, the two payloads used in Adcetris or Kadcyla, respectively, with the rest using one of only five other drugs. The ADC field is in critical need of new, highly potent, and rapidly acting cytotoxic payloads that are active in many tumor types. We propose in this application to develop new enediyne-based site-specific ADCs for cancer therapy. Specifically, we will focus on tiancimycins (TNMs), which we recently discovered as novel members of the enediyne family of natural products. Our hypotheses are: (i) TNMs are outstanding ADC payload candidates owing to their exquisite potency and validated mode of action, (ii) genetic manipulation of TNM biosynthesis provides outstanding opportunities to produce the most promising TNM analogues to develop the linker chemistry and facilitate site-specific conjugation, (iii) site-specific conjugation of TNMs to engineered thiomabs and selenomabs will generate homogeneous ADCs with defined drug-to-antibody ratios (DARs), and (iv) complementary targeting of HER2 and ROR1 will help evaluate the novel enediyne-based ADCs against current benchmarks and improve therapeutic outcomes for breast cancer patients. The specific aims for this grant are: (i) manipulation of TNM biosynthesis in Streptomyces sp. CB03234 to produce the most promising TNMs for site-specific conjugation, (ii) production and purification of anti-HER2 and anti-ROR1 thiomabs and selenomabs with 2 engineered cysteine (Cys) and 2 or 1 engineered selenocysteine (Sec) residues, respectively, (iii) development of linker chemistry for site-specific conjugation and delivery of a panel of anti- HER2 and anti-ROR1 thiomab-TNM and selenomab-TNM conjugates, and (iv) evaluation of selectivity and potency of the anti-HER2 and anti-ROR1 thiomab-TNM and selenomab-TNM conjugates against HER2+ and HER2?/ROR1+ breast cancers in both in vitro and in vivo models. The outcomes of this application include (i) fundamental contributions to ADCs and (ii) a panel of anti-HER2 and anti-ROR1 thiomab-TNM and selenomab- TNM conjugates as next-generation ADC therapeutics for cancers. The long-term goal of our research is to discover novel microbial natural products and harness their exquisite cytotoxicity as ADC payloads for anticancer drug discovery."
"9239818","Most patients with lung cancer have a poor prognosis due to genetic alterations and resistance to conventional therapy. The development of novel and more effective drugs is critical to improve the prognosis of patients with both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small lung cancer (SCLC).  BAK is a key multidomain proapoptotic molecule in the Bcl2 family, which is required for apoptotic cell death.  Because BAK is normally an integral outer mitochondrial membrane protein, whereas BAX requires translocation from the cytosol after an apoptotic stimulus, BAK activation may be more tractable.  The formation of BAK homo- or heterodimers is an important mechanism in the induction of apoptosis. Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 can bind to BAK, which is presumably in a ?primed? conformation with its BH3 domain exposed, while in apoptosis-induced cells, a BH3-only protein displaces BAK from the anti-apoptotic heterodimer. The free BAK then forms an oligomer that elicits the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and the release of cytochrome c leading to apoptosis. The BH3 binding pocket is located between BAK ?2 and ?3, which is an ideal site for the design or screening of BAK activators for the development of potential new anti-cancer agents. We chose the BH3 domain binding pocket (aa75-90) of BAK as a docking site for the screening of small molecules using the UCSF DOCK 6.1 program suite and the NCI chemical library database. We discovered two novel BAK activators (BKA-073 and BKA-758) that exhibit selective apoptotic effect in lung cancer cells as compared to normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Fluorescence polarization assay reveals that BKA-073 and BKA-758 preferentially bind to BAK protein with inhibitory constant (Ki) values at nanomolar levels in vitro but do not bind to other Bcl2 family members (i.e. BAX or Bcl2). The lead compound BKA-758 has potent antitumor activity against lung cancer in xenografts derived from lung cancer cell lines or patient-derived xenograft models. We hypothesize that BKA(s) may specifically activate the proapoptotic function of BAK in tumor cells by specifically targeting its BH3 binding pocket, which leads to suppression of lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we have identified two specific aims: (1) To determine the mechanism(s) by which BAK agonists (BKAs) activate the proapoptotic function of BAK and induce apoptosis in human lung cancer cells; (2) To determine whether BKA compounds suppress the growth of small lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in vivo. Studies will test the potency of BKAs in patient-derived xenografts, radioresistant lung cancer and genetically engineered lung cancer animal models. Determine whether the ?dynamic BH3 profiling? predicts the antitumor efficacy of BKA compounds in vivo. Based on our proposed studies, it is expected that novel first-in-class BAK agonists as an entirely new class of anti-lung cancer drugs will be developed for lung cancer therapy."

"9339116","Research:  My research has focused on three primary areas: 1) Pediatric research; 2) Risk/benefit evaluation in research; and 3) Decision making for incapacitated patients.  1. Pediatric research: I have systematically evaluated the existing guidelines for pediatric research, and attempted to describe alternatives where existing requirements do not provide sufficient protection, or have the potential to block appropriate research.    The U.S. regulations evaluate the risks of pediatric research in comparison to the risks of daily life. However, data we collected reveal that this standard has the potential to expose children to excessive risks in some cases. To address this concern, I have developed and defended the charitable participation standard, according to which the risks of pediatric research should be compared to the risks in daily life that are considered appropriate for children in the context of activities designed to benefit others. This standard offers a way to protect children from being exposed to excessive risks.   I conducted the first survey of the views of parents and children regarding non-beneficial pediatric research. This study provides support non-beneficial research, finding that respondents were as willing to have the children participate in research as charitable activities.   The minimal risk standard typically is understood as establishing one risk threshold. However, based on empirical data that teenagers are able to make their own decisions, I argued for two risk thresholds, one for younger children and a somewhat higher one for older children.   With a fellow, I evaluated the regulations for research with wards of the state. This analysis identified several safeguards to better protect these especially vulnerable individuals.   With a colleague, I conducted the first systematic evaluation of the subjects condition requirement which has caused a good deal of confusion. This analysis reveals that the requirement allows the enrollment of groups that to date have been excluded.   A number of commentators argue that it is unethical to expose children to research risks for the benefit of others. This view, which has been supported by U.S. courts, could halt vital attempts to improve pediatric clinical care. In response, I published the first comprehensive justification for non-beneficial pediatric research.  2. Risk/Benefit Evaluation in Clinical Research:  Currently, IRBs evaluate the risks of research using only their intuition. Yet, extensive data reveal that intuitive evaluation is subject to systematic biases. To better protect research subjects, I have been developing a systematic method for evaluating research risks.   Recognizing that the risks of research and daily life are of different types, I developed a method (SERR) for comparing risks of different types. This method led to the first empirical data that IRBs are miscategorizing the risks of pediatric studies.   With a fellow, I further developed SERR to allow IRBs to compare the likelihood and magnitude of the risks of research to the risks of daily life. Since it was published, I have been contacted by two of the largest clinical research groups, Western IRB and Quintiles, who are interested in using the approach.   Most regulations allow vulnerable individuals to be enrolled in riskier research only when the risks are justified by the potential for direct benefit. We conducted an analysis which reveals that existing interpretations of direct benefits are overly narrow and supports an interpretation which has less risk of blocking appropriate research.  3. Decision making for incapacitated individuals: While current emphasis on respecting individual autonomy respects competent adults, it poses a significant dilemma for treating incapacitated adults. My work in this area has focused on evaluating how well reliance on surrogates promotes the goals of decision making and developing improved methods.   In a prior systematic review, we showed that surrogates are not able to promote the goal of providing treatment consistent with patient preferences. In response, I described and defended a new approach, the Patient Preference Predictor, which predicts which treatments a given patient would want based on the preferences of similar individuals,    We just completed one of the largest surveys ever conducted on surrogate decision making. This survey of almost 1200 patients was the first ever to gather systematic data on patients own priorities regarding the goals for surrogate decision making. It also will provide empirical data on patients attitudes regarding the Patient Preference Predictor.   Many argue that reliance on surrogates promotes the goal of helping the family. To evaluate this claim, a fellow and I completed the first systematic review of the impact of making treatment decisions for incapacitated patients. This review found that making these decisions poses a significant burden on many surrogates. These data underscore the need to consider new methods to make these decisions."

Establishment of the NIH Bioinformatics Cooperative (http://affylims.cit.nih.gov/); development and dissemination of the MSCL toolbox; construction of a database containing over 4000 microarrays.  Co-founded the NIH sponsored Symposium on the Functional Genomics of Critical Illness and Injury. The seven meetings in this series (last: December 2009) focused on knowledge emerging from functional genomic databases relevant to critical care medicine. This meeting led to the formation of the US Critical Illness and Injury Trials Group (USCIITG: http://www.usciitg.org/), as a forum to further investigator initiated Intensive Care Medicine research on a national scale.  Interactions between IFN-alpha and dexamethasone were investigated in primary bronchial epithelial cells (Physiologic Genomics 2005). Dexamethasone was found to broadly suppress late IFN-alpha-induced responses.  Global transcriptional analysis of circulating leukocytes demonstrated oxidant and inflammatory vascular injury in sickle cell disease (Blood 2004). The human reticulocyte transcriptome was characterized extending our understanding of circulating cell-types (Physiol Genomics 2007). Expression profiling of platelets in sickle cell disease associated circulatory stress in this disorder with abnormalities of arginine metabolism (Circulation 2007).  Single dose intravenous endotoxin administration to humans produced a rich profile of gene expression changes in blood (Physiol Genomics 2006). T lymphocyte-associated genes were repressed. Notably, these alterations in gene expression were rapidly extinguished within 24 h.  Gene expression profiling was used to globally identify numerous genes regulated by NO. This work led to the discovery of new signal transduction pathways and regulatory mechanisms by which NO influences inflammation and cell proliferation (BMC Genomics 2005; Nuc Acid Res 2006; J Biol Chem 2006).  A germline activating mutation in NRAS was discovered to cause autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (PNAS 2007). This finding suggested that RAS-inactivating drugs might be therapeutically useful in human autoimmune disorders.  The innate and adaptive immune response to Pneumocystis was characterized in wild type and CD40-ligand knockout mice (J Leukoc Biol 2008).  A focused mitochondria/metabolism/inflammation microarray was used to study HIV-associated myopathy/fatigue (Biol Res Nurs 2008; J Infect Dis 2012; Biol Res Nurs 2013). Genome-wide microarrays uncovered the importance of leptin and the thermogenic glycerolipid/fatty acid cycling pathway in protecting the heart from diet-induced steatosis (Physiological Genomics 2011).  Microarrays were also used to globally examine the ability of carbon monoxide, an endogenous messenger produced by heme oxygenase, to suppress LPS-mediated gene induction in human monocytes (PLoS One 2009).   Other studies examined endothelial progenitor cells (Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology 2009), animal strain effects on PBMC gene expression in a rat model of acute cardiac rejection (BMC Genomics 2009), and differences between CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells in antitumor immunity (PNAS 2009).  Targeted studies of specific inflammatory responses investigated gene regulation mediated by leukotriene D(4) activation of the type I cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2008) and the redundancy of leukotriene B(4) and D(4) signaling (Allergy 2011) in human monocytes.  In air-liquid interface differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells challenged with IFN, O2 (70%) and NO (40 ppm), two gases used in the management of ARDS, produced highly similar signatures of oxidant stress, possibly explaining the lack of benefit from NO despite its ability to lower O2 requirements (American Thoracic Society abstract 2011). Specific miRNAs in human airway epithelial cells were found to control gene and protein expression important for differentiation (Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol 2013).  Dendritic cells (DCs) comprise distinct populations with specialized immune-regulatory functions.  Retinoic acid (RA), a vitamin A derivative, was found to control the homeostasis of dendritic cell (DC) precursors. Total body radiation in patients and mice led to a selective loss of RA-dependent DC subsets and impaired class II restricted auto and antitumor immunity that could be rescued by supplemental RA (J Exp Med 2013).  Global gene-expression changes across multiple organs implicated a host-wide IFN-response in staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced death. Therapies aimed at IFN-associated innate immunity may improve outcome in toxic shock syndromes (PLoS One 2014).  After cord blood/haploidentical transplantation, engraftment of donor cells with germ-line integration of HHV6 mimics HHV6 reactivation (Blood 2014).  Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been proposed as a biomarker of vascular injury. CECs were identified by flow cytometry and their endothelial phenotype was validated using ultramicro analytical immunochemistry. Most CECs in healthy individuals are senescent without an identifiable nucleus and lack sufficient RNA for transcriptomal analysis (Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2014).  Loss-of-function mutations in BMPR2 are the most common cause of heritable PAH. BMPR2-silenced human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) linked oncogenic Ras/Raf/ERK signaling to phenotypic changes including proliferation, invasiveness and cytoskeletal abnormalities. Therapeutics targeting non-canonical Ras/Raf/ERK signaling may be useful in preventing or reversing vascular remodeling in patients with PAH (Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol. 2016).  In human endothelial cells, MR agonists were found to repress NF-kB mediated gene transcription (Keystone Symposia on Nuclear Receptors abstract 2010; American Thoracic Society abstract 2010). In contrast, MR either repressed or further activated AP1 signaling depending on the DNA sequence of specific AP1 binding sites, MR ligand structure, and AP1 family member expression. Global expression profiling identified target genes that were trans-activated by this MR/AP1-dependent pro-inflammatory mechanism (submitted 2016)."
"9342644","The National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) requires the continuation of technical information support resources for cancer preventive agent identification, development, and qualification for clinical trials. The projects required to satisfy the RFP workscope shall provide the diverse technical support services needed for DCP?s preclinical and clinical development of the most promising cancer chemopreventive agents. Technical support includes agent background, rationale, chemistry, and testing documents for use in decision making and in planning clinical development strategies by the DCP Agent Development Committee; by the Chemopreventive Agent Development Research Group and other DCP Research Groups; by the PREVENT Cancer Program; by regulatory support, clinical trial monitoring, and repository acquisition, formulation, and distribution personnel under contract to the DCP.

Sophisticated, comprehensive and multidisciplinary technical resources are required because currently the DCP senior scientists scrutinize and prioritize many candidate agents yearly for initial preclinical evaluation, continually evaluate dozens of agents in clinical development tracks at milestone decision points for further development with the objective of qualifying agents for INDs and early clinical trials, and oversee a portfolio of advanced clinical trials of potential cancer preventive agents. Additionally, advances in ?-omic? technologies, molecular modeling, and bio-informatics related to agent identification, optimization, development, and qualification for clinical testing are increasing information management requirements in order to make informed decisions and strategic planning. This contract supports DCP?s clearly defined and integrated plan for developing chemopreventive agents from discovery to the clinic."
"9348204","Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH), a subgroup of WHO grp 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is a rare disorder associated with severe morbidity and high mortality rates. There are no routine screening tests or validated markers of disease activity in IPAH, or the broader group of disease associated PAH (DaPAH). Therefore, patients usually present at advanced stages of disease. The pathogenesis of IPAH and DaPAH remain unclear. Current thinking focuses on a two-hit hypothesis: 1) genetic susceptibility, and 2) a triggering stimulus that initiates pulmonary vascular injury, resulting in endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction.  Endothelial cells are normally shed into the circulation and are a valuable source of clinical material for studying diseases characterized by EC dysfunction. However, no clear methodology exists for isolating clinically relevant numbers of circulating ECs (CECs). In the bench phase of the project we were using flow cytometry to develop a methodology for isolating clinically relevant numbers of viable CECs from healthy volunteers and PAH patients.  We hypothesized that CECs and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) can be used to define a subset of differentially regulated biomarkers in IPAH and DaPAH that may lead to earlier diagnosis and better methods for measuring responses to therapy. We also hope to identify novel targets for future therapeutic interventions.  In the clinical phase of the project, we recruited healthy volunteers and patients with IPAH and DaPAH. Peripheral blood specimens were obtained for CECs and PBMCs for microarrays; the remaining plasma was saved for future application to cultured microvascular cells.  A subset of subjects underwent right heart catheterization to assess pulmonary pressures and to obtain pulmonary blood specimens.   The protocol started actively enrolling in June 2006 and enrolled 31 subjects prior to closing to enrollment in 2009. Preliminary data suggested that there was no trend towards CEC enrichment in pulmonary vein blood compared to peripheral blood for both the healthy volunteers (4.4 CEC/ml vs. 4.8 CEC/ml) and the PAH patients (2.4 CEC/ml vs. 3.0 CEC/ml). There was a trend towards CEC enrichment in pulmonary artery blood compared to peripheral blood for both the healthy volunteers (13.8 CEC/ml vs. 4.8 CEC/ml) and the PAH patients (3.3 CEC/ml vs. 3.0 CEC/ml).  In 2010 and 2011, total RNA was processed from PBMCs for genome-wide expression analysis. An abstract based on the PBMC differential gene expression patterns in PAH was presented at the 2011 Annual American Thoracic Society (ATS) Meeting. These patterns reflected both treatment related signatures and underlying disease pathophysiology. In addition to completing expression profiling of PBMCs, plasma samples from healthy volunteers and PAH patients were processed for application to cultured microvascular ECs.  In 2011 to 2013, using PBMC expression profiles from 10 PAH subjects with 10 age, gender and race matched healthy control subjects we identified over 230 differentially regulated genes at a 20% false discovery rate (FDR). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified gene signatures for inflammation, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cytoskeletal rearrangement, cellular movement, hemostasis and cell death. In vitro data from our collaborating laboratory demonstrates that spironolactone suppresses phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced (PMA; an AP-1 activator) inflammatory gene transcription in primary human PAECs. In order to explore the effect of spironolactone on PAH-associated vascular inflammation we conducted a promoter level analysis of the up-regulated genes we identified in PAH subjects. Biobase ExPlain and Transfac bioinformatics software identified activator protein-1 (AP-1) as a key transcriptional regulator. Experiments using PBMCs isolated from healthy subjects and stimulated with PMA demonstrate that spironolactone suppresses these AP-1 inducible, PAH-associated genes in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly in PBMCs from healthy and PAH subjects, spironolactone strongly suppressed the basal expression of genes that had been up regulated in the PBMCs of PAH patients.  In addition in 2011-12 we continued to develop a bioassay assessing global transcriptomic changes induced by plasma from PAH subjects compared to healthy controls using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays. Exposure of human PAECs to plasma from 5 PAH subjects compared to 5 age, gender and race matched controls, identified over 300 differentially expressed transcripts at a 10% FDR. In additional work done in 2012-13, we explored the gene expression changes in cultured human PAECs induced by plasma from PAH subjects and found that 20% of this signature overlapped with the gene expression changes induced following bone morphogeneic protein receptor-2 (BMPR2) gene silencing in PAECs. Importantly, more than 90% of this overlap was directionally discordant, suggesting circulating factors may work to counter-regulate genotypic and phenotypic abnormalities that drive PAH. Future experiments will utilize stored plasma currently available from PAH patients and healthy controls to examine the effects of circulating mediators on gene expression in BMPR2-deficient PAECs.  In 2013-14, we continued to actively investigate the mechanisms that mediate the anti-inflammatory effects of spironolactone using molecular techniques such as overexpression vectors and AP-1 promoter based reporter assays. Furthermore, in order to expand upon our expression findings in circulating mononuclear cells, we started to collect data from all of the other published human PAH PBMC genome-wide expression profiling studies for subsequent meta-analysis.  In 2014-15 we completed the necessary steps of data collection, annotation and aggregation of all the published human PAH PBMC expression profiling studies, Meta-analysis of all studies comparing gene expression profiles from IPAH and DaPAH patients to healthy subjects identified 579 and 1186 differentially expressed transcripts, respectively, at a 1% FDR. Interestingly, comparing gene expression profiles from IPAH and DaPAH patients yielded zero differentially expressed transcripts at a 1% or 5% FDR. Sensitivity analyses are planned to determine the effects of any one study on the overall stringency of the gene list and on the bioinformatic pathway analyses. Defining a robust genomic signature across multiple studies of PBMCs may highlight previously unrecognized patterns of gene expression. Specifically we plan to focus on differentially expressed transcripts that overlap between the IPAH versus healthy and the DaPAH versus healthy comparisons. Hypotheses generated from this work will be tested in downstream in vitro experiments.  In 2015-16, we added additional data from a recently published blood transcriptomic study conducted in patients with chronic respiratory disease (n=8 PAH patients) compared to healthy controls (n=28). With this updated data set, we completed further downstream analyses. Differentially expressed genes in PAH previously identified in the literature demonstrated only modest reproducibility, defined as a FDR  10% by meta-analysis. Different bioinformatic approaches consistently identified inflammatory signaling (MAPK, Toll-like receptors, and interferon responses) and regulators of cell proliferation (Myc) as overrepresented pathways among the shared genomic signature in IPAH and DaPAH.   An abstract of this work was presented at the 2016 ATS International Conference (Meta-analysis of PBMC Genome-wide Expression Profiling in PAH. AJRCCM 193: A4619, 2016.). This protocol remains open to continue bioinformatic analyses of the gene expression data, completing downstream in vitro work as well as finishing a meta-analysis of the published PAH PBMC expression profilin"
"9348208","Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare disorder associated with poor survival.  Endothelial dysfunction resulting from 1) genetic susceptibility, and 2) a triggering stimulus that initiates pulmonary vascular injury, the two-hit hypothesis, appears to play a central role both in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH.  Inflammation appears to drive this dysfunctional endothelial phenotype, propagating cycles of injury and repair in genetically susceptible patients with IPAH and DaPAH.  Therapy targeting pulmonary vascular inflammation to interrupt cycles of injury and repair and thereby delay or prevent right ventricular (RV) failure and death has not been tested.  Spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and androgen receptor antagonist, has been shown to improve endothelial function and reduce inflammation.  Current management of patients with severe PAH and NYHA class IV symptoms includes use of MR antagonists for their diuretic and natriuretic effects, late in the course, once clinical right heart failure has developed. Currently, no well described data exists from randomized clinical trials examining the safety and efficacy of MR antagonist therapy in early stages of PAH.  Subjects with IPAH and DaPAH in this randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study of early treatment with spironolactone undergo 1) standard clinical examinations including 6-minute walk distance and echocardiography; 2) cardiopulmonary exercise testing; 3) plasma profiling of inflammatory markers; 4) gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); and 5) high-resolution MRI-based determination of pulmonary vascular and RV structure and function.  Safety and tolerability of spironolactone in PAH is assessed with periodic monitoring for hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency as well as the incidence of drug discontinuation for untoward effects. We hypothesize that initiating therapy with spironolactone at an earlier stage of disease in subjects with PAH could provide additional benefits through anti-inflammatory effects and improvements in pulmonary artery endothelial function.  The concept for the protocol received an NIH Bench-to-Bedside Award in 2011 and a formal protocol was initially approved by the NHLBI IRB in September 2012. Subsequently IRB approval was sought and obtained at collaborating sites and various amendments were brought into alignment at all institutions by summer 2013. In 2013 -15 we established at the NIH a clinical research PAH program consisting of a multidisciplinary medical staff with expertise in cardiology, pulmonary, and critical care as well as a regulatory and research nursing support staff with extensive experience in assuring compliance with clinical protocols while maintaining the highest standards of clinical care. Referrals are currently being received from multiple sites. To date of the 30 pulmonary hypertension subjects enrolled in our Natural History protocol (13-CC-0012) thirteen have been enrolled in this study (Spironolactone Randomized Interventional Trial).     This randomized controlled trial is double blinded and open for recruitment. Plans for bolstering recruitment and increasing enrollment include:  1) Received NHLBI IRB approval for an information card (Icard) we developed highlighting essential details of our study.  We plan on providing the Icard to potential communities of interest.    2) Received approval from the Office of Communications and Media Relations and the NHLBI IRB to develop a web page on the NIH web site highlighting our NIH PAH program.    3) Presented our trial in the Research Room at the Pulmonary Hypertension Association (PHA) 2016 International PH Conference and Scientific Sessions. We handed out the Icards to patients, health care providers and other parties of interest.   4) Continue to present our study to local pulmonary hypertension support groups.    5) Research nurses continue to conduct periodic visits to local referral sites in order to facilitate communication with clinic staff and PAH patients.  6) Continue to reach out to regional academic centers and clinical practices.  7)  In collaboration with the Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) we plan on developing a smart phone application that will allow a health care provider or a patient to easily discern the essentials of our protocol and determine if the patient qualifies for the protocol."

"9354073","Our key findings indicate:   1. As determined by our expert measurement panel, Adults with Chronic Health Care Needs can be usefully defined at the population level as Adults with 1) ongoing physical, cognitive, or mental health conditions or difficulties functioning who 2) need health or related support services of a type or amount beyond that needed by adults of the same sex and similar age.     2. As determined by our secondary data analyses, ACHCN are not a special population, but may instead comprise over half of working age persons.  Thus, the  screener we have developed to identify this population includes elements that can be used for stratification into meaningful subgroups for the purpose of informing policies, programs, and services intended to support the population.   3. As also determined by our analyses, multiple chronic conditions are the norm among ACHCN, and the number of chronic conditions experienced rises with the extent of disability.  4. Most working age individuals with one or more chronic condition(s) do not have high service need or use, but among those that do, functional and activity limitations are quite common. Adults with functional limitations (in such areas as seeing, hearing, mobility and cognition) have elevated rates of need and utilization of healthcare services, while individuals with ADL and IADL limitations have the highest rates.  5. Access problems, such as delay or non-receipt of needed medical care, are significantly greater among ACHCN compared to individuals without chronic health care needs.  While ACHCN are somewhat more likely to be insured than their counterparts, substantial numbers report being uninsured part or all of the average year.  6. Healthcare disparities based on race/ethnicity demonstrably affect people with disabilities, with African American and Hispanic individuals fairing worse than whites in several measures of service use and/or health insurance coverage.  7. Over 40 percent of all annual visits to Emergency Rooms are made by people with disabilities. Three key factors affect their ED use: access to regular medical care (including prescription medications), extent of disability, and the complexity of their health profiles.     From October 01, 2015 to September 30, 2016, the activities conducted for this project have focused on field test design, external funding support and dissemination.  The field test was designed with our colleagues at the Ohio State University Medical System.  It will include approximately 900 patients and will allow us to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of the ACHCN instrument, as well as to test our subgrouping methodology.   The development of the full protocol included: drafting the survey instrument (and versions intended for in-person, phone and web administration), assembling a stakeholder advisory panel, designing staffing and survey administration procedures, writing NIST and HIPPA compliant data security / confidentiality plans, and preparing necessary documents for Institutional Review Board submission.  Additionally, we submitted an application for project funding to the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, as well as a letter of intent to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Evidence for Action Program.  Finally, we made presentations on the ACHCN project at the American Public Health Association Annual conference, at the Ohio State University College of Public Health, and at Brandeis University."
"9354076","Major Findings:  Recruitment for this protocol started April 2010.  We have no closed enrollment and are preparing manuscripts. The major findings were a significant and marked change in the speed with which children were able to perform the reciprocal leg exercise with approximately a third of those also having a clinically significant improvement in gait speed. (the change in gait speed for the group was not significant). Another important funding is that this group of patients showed greater than normal functional connectivity across the two sensorimotor hemispheres. After the exercise we found a correlation between the change in voluntary speed and the change in connectivity, such that those who had a greater change in speed, had a greater reduction of connectivity suggesting that the brain pathways improved and became more reciprocal instead of synchronized as a result of training.   Project Impact Statement:  This will be the first reported efficacy trial of both motor-assisted cycling and elliptical training in CP. Since reciprocal coordination improved as a result of training,these findings warrant further comparison with existing treatments such as BWSTT through clinical trials. This is also one of the few studies with pre-post brain imaging results in children with bilateral cerebral palsy."

"9242890","ABSTRACT Mycoplasmas are significant pathogens with unique features such as the lack of a cell wall and are dependent on a host to provide essential nutrients such as cholesterol. The genomes of most species such as the human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae and the murine pathogen Mycoplasma pulmonis code for about 600-700 proteins. Despite the limited proteome, mycoplasmas synthesize rhamnose and produce glycolipids, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides. Mycoplasmas have many traditional lipoproteins with the lipid attached to a cysteine residue at the amino terminus. We have shown that these lipoproteins are heavily glycosylated with glucose. Rhamnose is not attached to the lipoproteins but instead is attached to other proteins that can be associated with the membrane. An example is the glycolytic enzyme enolase, which is usually cytoplasmic but can moonlight on the surface of many organisms. We have shown that soluble enolase lacks a post-translational modification (PTM) but membrane-enolase is attached to lipid via a rhamnose linker. We find that enolase and several other proteins that are known to moonlight in bacterial membranes are released from the mycoplasmal cell surface by digestion with phospholipase. We propose to examine in aim 1 the site of rhamnosylation in proteins that are released from cells by phospholipase to identify an amino acid consensus sequence for rhamnosylation. In aim 2 the enolase gene of M. pulmonis will be engineered such that the amino acid to which rhamnose is attached will have been changed to an alternative amino acid that cannot be glycosylated. The mutated enolase gene will be inserted into the mycoplasma genome, and the effect of the mutation on protein trafficking will be examined. Other amino acids in the consensus sequence will also be mutated to identify which amino acids are important. Aim 3 is a short aim in which enolase in the walled bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae will be examined to determine whether it possesses a PTM as found for mycoplasma. The results will yield new and valuable insight into mechanism of trafficking of moonlighting proteins."

A major threat to achieving this objective is loss to follow-up of the most sick and frail, a phenomenon known as ?informative censoring?.  In short, participants who become ill, cognitively impaired or disabled or are admitted to a long-term care facility are less likely to return for their next scheduled visit. Unfortunately, those who cannot participate in the follow-up are also potentially the most informative in terms of health-related outcomes.  When information on the most debilitated participants is unavailable, the true downward trajectories of the aging phenotypes may be severely underestimated.

"9339125","First, canines (n=24) with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) pneumonia were randomized in a blinded fashion for exchange-transfusion with either 7- or 42-day-old canine commercially available universal donor blood (80 mL/kg in 4 divided doses).  These experiments were designed to test the extremes of storage age and transfusion volume. Older blood transfusion increased mortality, the arterial-alveolar oxygen gradient and histological lung damage. Older blood resulted in increased in vivo hemolysis, releasing free iron (in the form of non-transferrin bound iron) and CFH and decreasing haptoglobin plasma levels. Consistent with the vasoconstrictive effect of CFH, older blood increased both systemic and pulmonary pressures. This was the first randomized blinded animal trial showing blood transfused at end of storage period can increase mortality during infection.     Next, we investigated the effect of increasing bacterial doses and severity of infection on the risks associated with age of blood transfused in this canine model.  A range of S. aureus bacterial doses were administered and then exchange-transfused with either 7- or 42-day-old canine universal donor blood (80 mL/kg in four divided doses).  Without bacterial challenge, levels of CFH and NTBI were significantly higher with older versus fresher blood transfusion but there were no significant differences in measurable injury.  With higher-dose bacterial challenge, the elevated NTBI levels declined more rapidly and to a greater extent after transfusion with older versus fresher blood, and older blood was associated with significantly worse shock, lung injury, and mortality. The CFH levels were markedly elevated over days regardless of severity of infection. The augmented in vivo hemolysis of transfused older RBCs, resulting in excess plasma CFH and iron release, appears to require the presence of established infection to worsen outcomes.  These data suggest that transfused older RBCs increases the risks specifically from infection in septic subjects and define an infection dose-response.  During canine bacterial pneumonia with septic shock, but not in controls, older stored RBCs were associated with significantly increased lung injury and mortality.  We wondered whether transfusion of older RBCs would cause similar adverse effects during shock and inflammatory injury without infection. Therefore, animals (n=12) were transfused similar quantities of either older (42-day) or fresher (7-day) stored universal donor canine RBCs 2.5 hours after undergoing controlled hemorrhage producing shock.  With older transfused RBCs, CFH and NTBI levels increased, but lung injury declined and there was a trend toward lower mortality (18% vs. 50%).  Interestingly, the increased levels of CFH with older blood transfusion were associated with an improved hemodynamic response to hemorrhage-reperfusion, with lowered exogenous norepinephrine requirements and cardiac outputs. This hemodynamic effect is consistent with the ability of CFH to scavenge NO causing vasoconstriction.  Thus, in hemorrhagic shock, older RBCs altered resuscitation physiology but did not worsen clinical outcomes.  Elevated CFH lowers norepinephrine requirements and cardiac output, ameliorating reperfusion injury.  In our infection model, we had previously shown that older blood increases NTBI levels transiently during transfusion and the rapid clearance of iron is associated with increased lung injury and mortality. In contrast, during hemorrhagic shock, NTBI levels persist longer after transfusion, and these persistently increased levels of iron are not associated with worsened outcomes. These preclinical data suggest that, whereas iron derived from older RBCs promotes bacterial growth worsening septic shock mortality during infection, release of CFH and NTBI during hemorrhagic shock is not necessarily harmful.  We next conducted a blinded randomized controlled study of RBC washing in this canine model of transfusion injury.  We hypothesized that washing older units of blood before transfusion would improve clinical outcomes by removing older fragile RBCs and prevent increases of CFH and iron, whereas washing fresher units would have no effect on outcome.  Twenty-four animals with S. aureus pneumonia, were exchange-transfused with either 7- or 42-day-old washed (commercially available Haemonetics blood cell processor with standard washing procedure) or unwashed canine universal donor blood (80 mL/kg in 4 divided doses). Washing older units of blood improved survival rates, shock score, lung injury, cardiac performance and liver function, and reduced levels of NTBI, possibly by lysing and washing away older cells and supernatant.  In contrast, washing fresh blood worsened all these same clinical parameters and increased CFH levels.  Our data suggest that fresh blood should not be washed routinely because washing induces sub-lethal membrane damage to the RBC and, in a setting of established infection, washed RBCs are prone to lyse, release CFH, and result in worsened clinical outcomes. These findings, along with our previous studies, indicate that transfusion of fresh blood in infected subjects results in less hemolysis, CFH, and iron release, and is less toxic than transfusion of older blood in critically ill infected subjects.  However, if older blood must be used during established infection, washing prevents elevations in plasma circulating iron and improves survival and lessens multiple organ injury.  We next examined the results of altering volume, washing, and age of RBCs. Animals were transfused with increasing volumes (5-10, 20-40, or 60-80 mL/kg) of either 42- or 7-day-old RBCs (n=36) or 80 mL/kg of either unwashed or washed RBCs with increasing storage age (14, 21, 28, or 35 days) (n=40). All volumes transfused (5-80 mL/kg) of 42-day-old RBCs resulted in like (i.e., not significantly different) increases in iron, CFH, lung injury, and mortality rates after transfusion.  Transfusion of 80 mL/kg of RBCs stored for 14, 21, 28 and 35 days resulted in increased CFH and NTBI in between levels found at 7 and 42 days of storage.  However, washing RBCs of intermediate ages (14-35 days) does not alter NTBI and CFH levels or mortality rates.  Thus, our preclinical data suggest that any volume of 42-day-old blood potentially increases risks during established infection.  In contrast, even massive volumes of 7-day-old blood result in minimal CFH and NTBI levels and risks.  In contrast to the extremes of storage, washing blood stored for intermediate ages does not alter risks of transfusion or NTBI and CFH clearance.8   At present, we are investigating whether haptoglobin therapy improves outcome after blood transfusion with different RBC storage ages as well as during sepsis without transfusion.  Transfusion and bacterial sepsis are both independent potential sources of elevated plasma CFH.  Increased CFH levels after transfusion and during sepsis have both been associated with worse outcomes in animal models and humans. Haptoglobin binds CFH and promotes its clearance."
"9352024","Anthrax produces two binary type toxins, lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET), which are closely associated with the bacterias lethal effects. Both LT and ET reduce blood pressure in animal models. Using the isolated perfused rat heart, we showed previously that while ET has positive chronotropic and inotropic effects (increased heart rate and ventricular contraction), it also increased coronary flow suggesting a vasodilator effect. LT in that model had some negative inotropic effects but only at very high levels. Each toxin includes a common component called protective antigen (PA) necessary for cellular uptake of the toxins toxic moieties; lethal factor (LF) for LT and edema factor (EF) for ET. LT is zinc metalloprotease that inactivayes mitogen activated protein kinase kinase pathways and has the potential to alter cellular Ca2+ metabolism. ET has calmodulin dependent adenylate cyclase activity that increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level and decreases intracellular Ca2+. However, to what degree hypotension with these toxins reflects their direct effect on arterial dilation (relaxation) as opposed to indirect effects (e.g. increased endothelial permeability with extravasation of fluid, myocardial depression, inappropriate urinary losses) is unclear. However, we hypothesize that both toxins can cause vasodilation and the present study will employ an isolated rat aortic ring assay to investigate this.  In the aortic ring assay, standardized lengths of isolated rat aorta (4 mm) are connected to pressure transducers while immersed in a bath of physiologic solution. These aortic ring sections are then challenged with agents with known constrictor or relaxant properties or with experimental agents, and the level of resulting contractile or relaxant forces are measured. Normal arterial constriction and relaxation entails several pathways, but by using agents that are known to selectively influence these pathways, it is possible to decipher how an unknown agent might be altering arterial tone. The aortic ring assay was developed in the late 1970s and has been used extensively since then to investigate the pathophysiology and treatment of abnormal states of arterial tone (i.e. relaxation-dilation or constriction).   The present protocol originally included three parts. In the initial part (Part 1), the stability of the aortic ring preparation in our lab and its ability to contract with increasing concentrations of phenylephrine (PE) or relax with increasing concentrations of acetylcholine was confirmed. In the second (Part 2) and third parts (Part 3), we investigated the influence of exogenous ET (Part 2) and LT (Part 3) on contraction and relaxation of the aortic ring. These studies were subsequently published (Li Y, et al. B. anthracis edema toxin increases cAMP levels and inhibits phenylephrine-stimulated contraction in a rat aortic ring model. Am J Physiol. 2013. 305: H238-H250).  Additional studies are now underway further examining the mechanisms underlying the vaso-relaxant effects of anthrax edema toxin as well as the potential for agents to interfere with the toxins vascular effects ex vivo and in vivo.   Work from this protocol were presented at the 2015 International Conference of the American Thoracic Society."

"9354045","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative 'superbugs' are rapidly spreading around the world, and polymyxin B and colistin (polymyxin E) are often the only effective antibiotics. Since polymyxin B was released in the 1950s, its pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicodynamics (PK/PD/TD) have never been defined. Recent pharmacological research on polymyxins has predominantly focused on colistin methanesulfonate (CMS, an inactive prodrug of colistin) and demonstrates that CMS has significant limitations. Thus, polymyxin B is increasingly being viewed as the preferred polymyxin. Unfortunately, recently developed scientifically-based dosing recommendations for CMS cannot and should not be applied to polymyxin B, as the latter is administered as its active entity. Therefore, it is essential to determine the PK/PD/TD of polymyxin B in critically-ill patients, refine optimal dosage regimens, and develop the user-friendly adaptive feedback control (AFC) clinical tool. The Specific Aims are: 1) To develop a population PK model for polymyxin B; 2) To investigate relationships between the PK of polymyxin B, duration of therapy and patient characteristics, with the development and timing of nephrotoxicity; and to use next-generation proteomics to identify the most predictive biomarker(s) of polymyxin B associated nephrotoxicity; and to develop the population PK/TD model; 3) To establish the relationships between polymyxin B PK, bacterial susceptibility and patient characteristics, with the probability of attaining and time to achieving clinical and bacteriological outcomes; and 4) To employ the models from Aims 1-3 and Monte Carlo simulation to develop scientifically-based dosage regimens of polymyxin B and to develop an AFC algorithm for future individual patients. Research Design: Patients being treated with intravenous polymyxin B will be identified at three clinical sites in the USA and one in Singapore. Patients (n = 250) will have blood collected at various times surrounding a dose of polymyxin B between days 1 and 5 of therapy. Development of nephrotoxicity, clinical response, and bacteriological response will be examined. Total and free plasma concentrations of polymyxin B will be determined. Bacterial isolates will be examined for the emergence of polymyxin resistance. The relationships between polymyxin B PK, PD and TD end-points (e.g. clinical and bacteriological responses, development of toxicity and resistance) will be assessed using pharmacometric analyses. Finally, the obtained information will be used to apply Monte Carlo simulation to examine the impact of various patient characteristics and other factors on polymyxin B PK, PD and TD, in order to establish optimal dosage regimens and AFC algorithms for individual critically-ill patients. Significance: No new antibiotics will be available for Gram-negative 'superbugs' for many years. This landmark multicenter study will provide essential information for optimizing polymyxin B use in critically-ill patients, while minimizing resistance and toxicity. This proposal aligns perfectly with the NIAID priority To teach old drugs new tricks and the recent Executive Order of the White House to combat antibiotic resistance."
"9354067","Background: In the past year, we have extended our research to reaffirm the results described above by repeating the experiments with MORAb-009 labeled with Zr-89 (a positron emitter; decay half-life of 3.3 days) which better matches with the biological half-life of mAbs than Cu-64 (decay half-life, 12.7 h) labeled mAb, thus making the Zr-89 labeled mAb more relevant for the diagnosis and the assessment of the therapeutic responses of cancer.  As a part of our mechanistic studies on the tumor uptake and microdistribution of MORAb-009 (anti-mesothelin mAb amatuzimab), we compared the results of Zr-89-MORAb-009 studies with those of Zr-89-labeled B3, a monoclonal antibody directed against Lewis-Y antigen which is not shed from tumor surface. Objectives: To develop a method to radiolabel two mAbs (MORAb-009 and anti-Lewis-Y mAb B3) and investigate the effect of the injection dose and the tumor size on the tumor uptake and microdistribution of these two Zr-89-labeled mAbs in nude mice bearing A431/H9 which expresses both mesothelin and Lewis-Y antigen.  Methods: The mAbs were radiolabeled with Zr-89 using desferrioxamine with an isothiocyanate linker as a chelating agent. The Zr-89 labeled mAbs were then purified with a PD-10 column eluted with 0.25 M ammonium acetate at pH 5.5. The radiolabeled mAbs with the radiochemical purity >95% and the immunoreactivity >70% were used for in vivo studies. The biodistribution (BD) was performed in groups of nude mice (n=4-5) with A431/H9 tumors (range, 191  265 cubic mm for MORAb-009 and 260  405 cubic mm for B3 study) one day after iv injection of Zr-89-MORAb-009 (3 microCi/2, 10 or 60 microg) or Zr-89-B3 (3 microCi/2, 15 or 60 microg). For the BD studies, the animals were euthanized at 24h post-injection (p.i.) by CO2 inhalation and exsanguinated by cardiac puncture before dissection. Blood and various organs were removed and weighed, and their decay corrected radioactivity counts were measured with a gamma-counter (Wallac, Inc., Perkin-Elmer, Inc., Boston, MA). For PET imaging studies, the  longitudinal 15 min static PET scans were performed on athymic mice (n=5)  using a Siemens Inveon micro PET scanner (Siemens Preclinical Solutions, Knoxville, TN) at 3, 24, and 48 h post-injection (p.i.). The mice with A431/H9 tumor (range, 195  429 cubic mm for MORAb-009 and 239  700 cubic mm for B3) were injected iv with Zr-89-MORAb-009 (100 microCi/10 or 60 microg) or Zr-89-B3 (80 microCi/15 or 60 microg). All imaging procedures were performed under anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane in oxygen at 2 L/min. The mice were then euthanized immediately after the 48 h imaging sessions for autoradiography. The PET images were reconstructed with a 3-dimensional ordered-subset expectation maximization/maximum a posteriori (OSEM3D/MAP) algorithm, with no attenuation or scatter correction. The reconstructed pixel size was 0.77  0.77  0.79 mm on a 128  128  159 imaging matrix. The image analysis was performed using ASIPro software (provided by Siemens, v6.8.0.0) on decay-corrected whole-body images. To characterize the accumulation of the probe in tumors, the region-of-interest (ROI) were drawn manually on individual tumor area, liver, spleen, muscle, and heart. The %ID/g was calculated for mice at 3, 24, and 48 h p.i.. For ex vivo autoradiography, the tumors were excised, embedded and frozen in Tissue-Tek CRYO-OCT compound (Sakura Finetek USA Inc., Torrance, CA, USA) at -80C for 3 h. Serial 16 micro-m thick short axis sections were cut in 400 micro-m intervals covering the entire tumor. Two or 3 tumor sections at 16 micro-m thickness were selected in 3 different tumor regions as representative sections throughout of the tumor and exposed in the phosphor screen for 16 h. Signals were obtained by the Typhoon FLA 7000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) with 25 micro-m pixel resolution and analyzed with Image Quant TL8.1 software. Values were grouped together from the 3 tumor regions to represent a tumor. Each tumor was treated as an independent sample (n=3). To analyze the microdistribution of the radioactivity in the tumor sections, a line was first drawn along a longest axis, and at the center of the longest line a second perpendicular line was drawn along a short axis. The center was selected as the point where two lines meet. Additional lines were drawn evenly and continuously between the two original lines passing through the same center point. Radioactivity profile of each line was analyzed with ImageJ and exported into Excel files to refine values with MATLABs interpolation function interp1. Results: The results of BD studies of Zr-89 MORAb-009 showed that the tumor uptake (2.72+/-0.63 for 2 microg vs. 6.13+/-2.27 %ID/g for  10 microg,  p=0.03 and 12.33+/-2.55 %ID/g for 60 microg, p=0.02) and blood retention (1.94+/-0.42 for 2 microg vs. 3.71+/-3.43 %ID/g for  10 microg, p=0.32  and 9.48+/-1.95 %ID/g for 60 microg, p<0.001) increased as the injection dose was increased, whereas the liver uptake (31.68+/-7.47 for 2 microg vs. 25.34+/-4.56 %ID/g for 10 microg, p=0.15 and 19.59+/-3.83 %ID/g for 60 microg, p=0.02) gradually decreased as the injection dose was increased. In contrast, for Zr-89 B3, there was no appreciable dose effects shown on the tumor uptake (14.35+/-4.75 for 2 microg vs. 12.51+/-1.31 %ID/g for 15 microg,  p=0.50 and 12.01+/-1.78 %ID/g for 60 microg, p=0.41), blood retention (16.78+/-1.03 for 2 microg vs. 15.80+/-1.49 %ID/g for 15 microg, p=0.27  and 16.29+/-0.96 %ID/g for 60 microg, p=0.46) and liver uptake (13.92+/-0.92 for 2 microg vs. 14.51+/-3.29 %ID/g for  15  microg, p=0.72 and 13.34+/-0.80 %ID/g for 60 microg, p=0.32) among the three different injection doses of Zr-89-B3. The findings from the BD studies were supported by the PET imaging studies as follows: The PET images visualized tumors as early as 3 h p.i. for both 10 and 60 microg MORAb-009 dose. At 24 and 48 h p.i., the radioactivity signal in the tumor remained relatively unchanged compared to that at 3 h p.i. for 10 microg whereas the tumor signal increased over time for 60 microg that is advantageous for the tumor visualization by PET. Compared to Zr-89 MORAb-009, the PET images from Zr-89 B3 did not show any significant dose effects on its uptake and the clearance pharmacokinetics from tumor, blood and liver. The PET images visualized tumors as early as 3 h p.i. for both 15 and 60 microg B3 dose. In addition, unlike Zr-89 MORAb-009, the radioactivity signal steadily increased over time for both B3 doses because Lewis-Y antigen is not shed from the tumor surface. The both BD and PET studies, thus, suggest that the shed antigen in the blood circulation negatively affects the antigen-specific tumor uptake of the mAb. To answer a second question if the shed antigen in the extracellular space of tumor could improve the penetration of mAb, we performed the autoradiography of tumor segments 2 days after the injection of Zr-89 MORAb-009 and Zr-89-B3. Our preliminary results indicate that for Zr-89-B3, higher radioactivity signals were consistently shown in the tumor periphery (>2 times), near the tumor surface than tumor core and diminished rapidly as moving toward the tumor core.  In contrast, for Zr-89 MORAb-009, the distribution of the radioactivity was more uniform than that of Zr-64-B3. The high signal intensity in the periphery initially decreased and then increased again near the tumor core with the signal intensity in the tumor core comparable to that in the tumor periphery. Conclusion: The results of our studies provide a message that shed-antigen in the circulation negatively affects the antigen-specific tumor uptake of the antigen-specific antibody, whereas shed-antigen in the extracellular space positively affects the tumor uptake by improving the microdistribution of the antibody, which is important for antibody-based therapy."
"9354078","A major limiting factor in previous studies of both the asymptomatic and pathological knee is the inability to non-invasively measure three-dimensional skeletal and muscular motion simultaneously. Cine phase contrast (PC) MRI (dynamic MRI) is the only technique currently available that can do just this. Cine-PC MRI, which is a combination of cine and phase contrast MRI provides a temporal series of anatomic images of all cyclically moving and static structures in the imaging plane.  Therefore, the overall goal of this work is to determine the specific sources of maltracking patterns in patellofemoral (PF) pain. As part of this overall goal, the purpose of this study is to determine how the loss of function in the vasti medialis muscle alters the dynamic control of patellar kinematics in healthy individuals, using cine-PC as the primary measurement tool.  Twenty-three asymptomatic volunteers with no prior history of knee pain, trauma, leg surgery, or contraindications to having an MRI have been enrolled. During the first visit, the PF and tibiofemoral (TF) kinematics were derived from dynamic cine phase contrast velocity data. If the first visit data revealed the presence of a valid exclusion criteria, the subject was removed from the study (n=5, based on the presence of abnormal PF kinemtics); if not, the subject was asked to return within a week for the second segment of the study. For the second visit, the same kinematics were acquired immediately after administering a motor branch block to the VM using 3-5cc of 1% lidocaine. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the null hypothesis that the post- and pre-injection kinematics were no different across the knee angles of extension. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality was run. If the data were normally distributed a repeated measures ANOVA was run using Hotellings T2 test statistic; if not, the non-parametric Friedman's test statistic was used. Upon rejection of the null hypothesis a post-hoc analysis (Wilcoxon signed rank test) was completed to determine at which knee angles the null hypothesis could be rejected. Pearsons correlations between the change in kinematics post-injection and the pre-injection kinematics were quantified at these same knee angles. This was followed by a step-wise linear regression. Significance was set at p0.05.  Post-injection, the maximum lateral shift of the patellar and tibial origins (1.8mm, SD=1.7mm, p=0.003 KA=20 and 2.1mm, SD=2.9mm, p=0.02, KA = 15) and the maximum external tibial rotation (3.7, SD=4.4, p=0.006, KA=20) occurred at similar points in the extension arc. These changes were 3.2 to 4.8 times greater than the subject repeatability. The value of PF tilt trended laterally post-I (max=1.6, KA =15), but significant differences pre- to post-I were not found. No individual reported pain, based on a Visual Analog Scale, following the kinematic trials during visit 1 and visit 2. The lateral shift of the PF origin post-I was significantly correlated with the initial value of PF origins superior displacement in terminal extension (Pearson correlation coefficients (r-values) ranged from 0.47 to 0.48 for knee angles ranging from 10-20, p<0.05).   To relate the kinematic changes seen following a VM block to those seen in PFPS, it is important to understand that there are likely subgroups within the PFPS population, each with unique kinematic alterations of varying etiologies. In a previous study the PFPS cohort was divided into two groups, lateral and non-lateral maltrackers. The lateral maltrackers demonstrated increased PF lateral and superior shift, lateral tilt, flexion, and valgus rotation. The change in kinematics following the nerve block could account for a portion of the lateral shift and tilt seen in the lateral maltrackers. Increased ligament laxity likely would have increased this shift and tilt, as well as increased the patellar ligament length, resulting in the observed PF superior shift (patella alta) in the lateral maltrackers. Patella alta reduces the influence of the femoral groove on PF kinematics in terminal extension, resulting in increased PF lateral shift (as supported by the correlations within this study), lateral tilt, and valgus rotation. Therefore, a combination of VM weakness and generalized ligament laxity could account for the kinematic variations in the lateral maltracking group. These changes would result in higher contact stresses when the patella is forced to re-engage with the femoral sulcus in early flexion and would reduce the overall contact area, both of which would likely leading to PF pain.   The non-lateral maltrackers demonstrated increases in PF flexion and TF internal rotation only, with a trend towards PF medial translation and medial tilt. A larger LTI combined with a normative PF superior location in the non-lateral maltrackers limited lateral PF shift and influenced patellar tilt in this subgroup. Thus, in this sub-group a loss of VM strength likely would have resulted in increased contact force between the lateral femoral sulcus and the patella, resulting in PF pain, without excessive lateral shift and tilt being present. The high LTI and the trend towards medial tilt in the non-lateral maltracking group may help explain the variability in the post-I change in PF lateral tilt. In the presence of a high LTI, a loss of strength in the VMO strength could result in the lateral patellar edge riding up the lateral femoral sulcus, resulting in the observed trend towards medial tilt in the non-lateral maltrackers and the post-I medial tilt observed in some subjects.  The current study provides crucial data for validation of musculoskeletal modeling. Specifically, the estimation of the quadriceps ability to produce a torque on the tibia is complicated by the fact that the patella serves as an intermediary (a dynamic fulcrum) between the quadriceps and tibia. Therefore, the term effective quadriceps moment arm was coined to define the ability of the quadriceps to generate a torque on the tibia. Yet, this property has only been calculated two-dimensionally in the sagittal plane. The post-I external tibial rotation clearly demonstrates that acting through the patella, the VM effective moment arm has a component that results in internal tibial rotation.   This study has advanced the clinical understanding of PFPS by providing a direct in vivo link between VMO weakness in isolation and knee joint kinematic alterations. In doing so it has demonstrated that VMO weakness is most likely a major factor in, but not the sole source of, PF maltracking. Thus, isolated VM strengthening will likely not fully correct PF maltracking in most individuals. In addition, it demonstrated that even with kinematic alterations in the PF and TF joint, pain was not experienced during the post-I trial, indicating that pain may be a factor that develops over time. Combining these findings with past results pertaining to the kinematics and bone shape alterations in individuals with PFPS supports two paths to PFPS in two kinematically unique subgroups. Such knowledge will likely help foster the next generation of treatments for PFPS that focus on first elucidating subject-specific factors leading to PF pain and then devising an intervention plan that specifically targets these factors in order to optimize treatment. Future work is required to provide further evidence on the validity of these paths and extend the current methodology to create a clinical diagnostic tool that will help guide therapeutic or surgical treatments for patients with PF pain.  This work won the prestigious 2011 International Society of Biomechanics Clinical Award and the 2011 American Society of Biomechanics Clinical Award.  Currently, the data from this study is being used as part of a cartilage contact analysis."
"9354081","Background  Megakaryocytes (MK) comprise a rare cell population in the bone marrow, making up an estimated 0.1-0.5% of the total nucleated cells. Numerical and morphologic abnormalities of MK are described in a variety of primary and secondary marrow disorders but the scarcity of these cells makes analysis difficult and enrichment techniques for subsequent cell analysis are complex and labor intensive.  Currently, MK changes are assessed exclusively on microscopic preparations (marrow aspirates and biopsies), and are used as important criteria for disease diagnosis, classification and therapy monitoring despite the inherent subjectivity of microscopic evaluations. In contrast to other hemopoietic or lymphoid cells, adequate quantitative studies of freshly isolated MK have proven difficult because of the relative rarity of these cells. Even flow cytometry (FCM), which is ideal for rapid detection of infrequent cell populations, faces serious difficulties in the assessment of marrow MK and the analysis of these cells is not part of the routine diagnostic work up of marrow cells in clinical laboratories.  MK can be isolated using separation techniques such as density gradients, magnetic beads, centrifugal elutriation or fluorescence activated cell sorting, but these are labor-intensive, time-consuming or costly methods. Mature marrow MK are large, polyploid cells and it has been shown that their size distribution overlaps minimally with that of all other marrow cells. This distinct size threshold implies that size alone is a discriminatory parameter for MK isolation. Thus, we developed a simple and inexpensive manual mesh filtration method for separation of MK that allows a rapid and easy size-based concentration and purification of these cells.    Materials and Methods  We examined 15 discarded anonymized BM aspirate samples suitable for our analysis.  These samples were from patients with a variety of hematologic disorders originally submitted to our laboratory for evaluation.  Sample age ranged from 1-4 days (mean 1.5 days).  Samples were diluted with a buffered saline solution and the cell suspensions were filtered through meshes of appropriate size.  This filtration procedure allowed the preferential retention of MKs and, on average, the procedure only lasted 15 minutes.  The resulting cell suspensions were stained with FITC-anti CD61 or PE-anti CD41a antibodies Becton Dickinson (BD) to label MKs, concurrently with the cell permeable DNA-binding DRAQ5 (Cell Signaling Technology) to identify all nucleated cells.  Final cell viability was assessed by C12Resazurin (Molecular probes).  Cell analysis was performed by flow cytometry (FCM) using a CANTO II flow cytometer (BD).  Absolute MK enumeration was performed using the Flow Cytometry Absolute Count Standard beads (Bangs).  MK enrichment efficiency was expressed as the percentage of MKs of all nucleated cells determined by FCM.   Results and Conclusions  The median (range) volume of the BM samples used in this study was 0.54 (0.24-1.99) mL.  MKs were identified by FCM on the basis of their large size, expression of platelet-associated antigens and DNA ploidy levels. The median (range) MK recovery was 31 (14-100) % of the original number of MKs and the yield was 9,882 (1,519-49,921) MKs per mL of BM aspirate.  The median (range) fraction of MKs among all nucleated cells after filtration was 39 (14-68) %, representing a 904 (439-3029)-fold MK enrichment.  The MK viability after filtration was near 100%. This rapid and inexpensive isolation and concentration method results in a MK recovery and purification that is comparable or better than other more elaborate techniques.  Despite the inherent heterogeneity of the samples used, we obtained a reasonably good recovery of MKs per mL of marrow aspirate and more than 900-fold median MK concentration.  The yield and level of purification of freshly isolated MKs obtained by thiiis simple procedure may be useful in studies of a variety of primary or secondary marrow disorders.  In particular, it should facilitate the application of analytical methods such as flow cytometry or in situ hybridization, and even be useful for biochemical or molecular testing that requires adequate cell representation and purity.  Current Studies   Using flow cytometry, we are presently determining DNA content (ploidy) and expression of a variety of surface antigens in MKs isolated from fresh aspirates as described above in marrows from normal volunteers and patients with a variety of hematologic disorders.  The goal of this study is to establish changes in MK ploidy and/or immunophenotype, if any, in diseases in which MK are expected to be abnormal based on morphologic grounds, such as myelodysplasias or myeloproliferative neoplasms.  Unfortunately, the incidence of these disorders at the NIH is currently low.  Furthermore, hematologic patients with marrow disorders in this institution undergo extensive research studies and diagnostic testing that require a significant amount of marrow sample, frequently leaving a relatively scanty amount of material for our studies. For this reason, last year, we entered a collaborative effort with professionals in the Department of Pathology of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) who have access to marrow samples, in order to obtain adequate and representative material for our studies.  This process took a long time and although we received some samples from that institution, the amount and/or quality of the samples was suboptimal and, in most instances, did not yield a sufficient number of megakaryocytes for appropriate anlaysis.  We have recently decided to terminate the acquisition of samples for this purpose and analyze the results obtained with the samples already received.  We are analyzing the DNA content (ploidy level) of megakaryocytes in these samples in order to determine the quantity and distribution of the various G1 peaks that reflect nuclear lobe partitions in these cells, as well as the expression of platelet-associated glycoproteins that may be altered in hematologic disorders with morphologic MK abnormalities.

"9354083","Plasma cells (PC) are normally responsible for manufacturing large amounts of antibodies.  When PC become cancerous they accumulate in the bone marrow, where they interfere with the production of normal blood cells and destroy bone.  The most aggressive form of PC cancers is called Multiple Myeloma, which constitutes 1% of all cancers.  One of the most valuable procedures used in the diagnosis of these cancers and determination of tumor load is a bone marrow examination.  This procedure consists of obtaining aspirates and bone biopsies where pathologists examine microscopic preparations and estimate the number of PC present. This number is currently a required criterion for diagnosis of PC cancers and also evaluation of response to therapy.  However, current microscopic methods for the enumeration of PC lack precision.  The counts in the aspirates are affected by blood contamination and estimations based on bone tissue preparations are somewhat subjective and at best semi-quantitative.  Also, the total marrow cellularity, which is valuable in assessing numerous hematologic conditions, is evaluated semi-quantitatively.  To facilitate these counts and improve accuracy and precision, we developed digital image-based software to perform a rapid quantitation of PC and marrow cellularity in bone marrow biopsies.  The initial evaluation of this software provided excellent results and we are performing additional testing to further validating it.  A similar approach used for PC could be extended to the analysis of other cell types such as leukemic cells, lymphocytes, or cells of other lineages.    Although the testing and validations of the current software version demonstrated very good results, there are limitations with the program that preclude its universal use.  For example, the software produces acceptable results as long as it is used with images obtained with a single microscope and a single camera.  If either of these is changed, the software coding needs to be changed accordingly, a process that is not practical.  Also, the application process is rather slow.  For these reasons, the software language and algorithm are currently being modified not only to make the program flexible enough to accommodate different resolutions and other imaging conditions (colors, intensities, etc.) but also to make the software application faster and more efficient in order to make it more practical than the existing version.   An updated version of the software has been tested but the advantages of this new version over the original version is only partially incremental. Improving the existing version further will necessitate additional and will be costly.  Therefore, a manuscript with the original data as a proof of principle is being finalized and will be submitted for publication shortly."

"9357192","This protocol is designed to study the natural history and epidemiology of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in an asymptomatic blood donor population, to assess the potential for sexual transmission or other percutaneous transmission of HCV and to assess the clinical impact of acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection superimposed on HCV infection.    To date, the primary study has enrolled 760 patients.  Of those 760 enrolled, 738 subjects have been analyzed, including 469 recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) positives, 52 RIBA indeterminates, and 217 RIBA-negative controls. The 15 year follow-up of the cohort was published in 2012(JID 2012:206:654). Interesting epidemiologic findings include the high proportion (41 percent) of RIBA+ donors who admitted to prior (remote) intravenous drug use and the strong independent association between cocaine snorting and HCV positivity. Shared paraphernalia for snorting accompanied by epistaxis, may serve as a covert vehicle for parenteral viral transmission. Among anti-HCV+/RIBA-positive donors, 82 percent were persistently viremic, but 18 percent appeared to have spontaneously recovered from prior HCV infection. A liver biopsy has been obtained from 185(47%) patients who were chronically infected; 51% had mild chronic hepatitis and 44% had moderate chronic hepatitis over a mean duration of infection of 20 years; only 5% had severe inflammation. No fibrosis was observed in 33% of biopsied patients and 52% had only mild fibrosis; 15 had more severe fibrosis including 12% with bridging fibrosis and 2% with cirrhosis. Overall, HCV infection in this cohort was generally asymptomatic and over the course of 25 years progressed to severe liver disease in approximately 15%. Despite an association of HCV with sexually promiscuous practices, we found no evidence for sexual transmission to the specific partners of 165 HCV-infected individuals. The study continues to follow the natural history of HCV infection and is now focusing on histologic progression as assessed in liver biopsies and fibroscans. New emphasis is being placed on studies of cell-mediated immune responses to HCV, neutralizing antibody responses, predictors of fibrosis progression, including performance of cytokine arrays, micro-RNAs and measurement of IL28 polymorphisms. Emphasis is now also being placed on treatment.New treatments with direct acting antivirals can effect greater than 90% cure rates, but the new drugs are expensive and not readily available. Our goal is to treat as many patients as possible and effectively cure most of the patients in this cohort. Thus far, 55 patients in this study have been treated to cure either with interferon based therapies or with new direct acting anti-virals.     In the current sexual partner arm of this study, we have enrolled 41 partners all of whom tested negative by both the initial screening test (EIA) and the specific HCV RNA PCR test.  Twenty-one (51.2%) of those 41 partners had previously tested negative with an average duration between testing of 12.8 years.  All partners were sexually active with index cases for at least 1 year and 71% never used any form of protective measure during sexual activity.   Since approval of the hepatitis B arm of this study, we have enrolled 3 HBV positive patients.  One patient had acute hepatitis B and was followed through her acute course to full recovery with treatment.  The second patient was hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA positive at enrollment, but soon after became HBV DNA negative without treatment, but continues to be HBsAg positive. The third patient was strongly positive for HBsAg and for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc).  Further testing revealed that he was hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) negative and had very low level HBV DNA viral load and normal liver function (ALT) levels suggesting inactive infection. We continue to follow him on protocol and monitor his HBV DNA level and liver function."

Lacking in NIAAA?s therapeutic drug development pipeline is a human laboratory program which will serve to screen potential medications prior to conducting the more expensive POC clinical trials. The overarching goal is to develop an integrated program wherein a prospective therapeutic compound would be tested across all three components of the program: pre-clinical animal models, human laboratory testing, and POC clinical trial.  Initially, promising compounds would be examined in the preclinical animal model program. Those compounds which demonstrate efficacy in the preclinical assays (assuming safety and tolerability endpoints are met) would be advanced to the human laboratory screening program (HLAB). If the candidate compound demonstrates promising results in one or more of human laboratory assays underlying aspects of the alcohol ependence syndrome, then the prospective compound would be considered for evaluation in the NCIG POC clinical trials.

"9369155","NGS technologies (e.g., RNAseq, WES, etc.) are used to detect somatic mutations in tumors and to study germ line variation. Most NGS studies use nucleic acids isolated from whole blood or fresh frozen tissue specimens. However, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are one of the most widely available clinical specimens, particularly in international settings, where fresh frozen tissue is extremely difficult to obtain. The potential utility of FFPE tissue as a source for NGS would greatly enhance population-based cancer studies, especially in developing and resource-limited regions, where cancer-related mortality rates are much higher and survival rates are poorer compared to the developed regions of the world.  These studies can have great utility for understanding genetic susceptibility factors of cancer for populations in the US, who share similar ancestral backgrounds to other populations, globally. This would also contribute to a more comprehensive and unbiased platform for genomic-based cancer research."

"9280879","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy and durability of benefits of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as a promising non-invasive therapeutic treatment for executive function deficits reported in Veterans with mild to moderate Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients. Although much progress has been made towards understanding the various deficits following TBI, progress has yet to be made towards identifying and assessing therapeutic treatment options that are responsive to TBI symptoms. Many returning OEF/OIF Veterans with concussion histories report cognitive symptoms that may last for months or years, and affect every day function. Symptoms faced by Veterans with mild to moderate TBI include executive function deficits such as impaired attention (including shifting sets), verbal fluency, poor planning, reduced working memory, and mental flexibility. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of rTMS in Veterans with mild to moderate TBI in improving executive functioning. A recent VA study reported improvements in PTSD and related symptoms in Veterans with PTSD who received rTMS (Watts et al., 2012). Repetitive TMS is a method of delivering therapeutic, non-invasive brain stimulation that is currently being used at the VA Palo Alto and Stanford University in a number of clinical trials. For this pilot study we propose to enroll 40 Veterans diagnosed with mild to moderate TBI (age range 20-65). Inclusion Criteria: mild and moderate TBI will be defined as: post-traumatic amnesia (PTA < 1 day for mild; 1 day> x < 7days for moderate). Because of the extensively documented co-occurrence of TBI with PTSD, (Veterans with TBI with and without PTSD will be enrolled). PTSD will be assessed using standard clinical measures. Exclusionary criteria: patients will be screened for TMS and MRI safety. The duration of the study will be two years, with a 1.5 year enrollment period, and a final half-year of follow-up completion. Following a preliminary telephone screen, Veterans will be scheduled for onsite informed consent, screening, and baseline assessments. Using an electronic randomization form, participants will be enrolled into two groups: active rTMS or sham rTMS. As this is a double blind placebo controlled study, only the subject ID number is provided to the nurse administrating the rTMS treatment. After randomization, the rTMS nurse will test the motor threshold (MT) for rTMS. Each participant will be in the trial for a total of approximately (28) weeks: 1-2 weeks screening, (2) weeks acute treatment phase (including MRI pre and post rTMS) and 24 weeks (6 month) follow-up phase (with MRI, neuropsychological testing and self-report measures). Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) will be the stimulation site as it is shown to be affective in treatment of depression and approved by FDA. All participants will receive a minimum of 20 treatments before being evaluated for change in executive function (primary outcome measure). The primary hypothesis is that Veterans receiving active rTMS will show improvement more than sham treated Veterans in (performance between baseline and last assessment of >1 SD on either the Trail Making Test part B, D-KEFS Verbal Fluency and/or D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test). Additional analysis will include: Sustained Improvement on executive function composite score; secondary consequences of TBI scores on Quality of Life (QOL) scale, moderators of response such as age, severity of symptoms at baseline, type of comorbidity (e.g., PTSD); and, functional brain activity changes with rTMS treatment. This pilot study will be one of the first to demonstrate rTMS as a treatment for executive function deficit in Veterans with mild to moderate TBI. Additionally, it would also report on the efficacy of using fMRI as a biomarker to capture this improvement in executive function."

"9357196","Zika virus (ZIKV) is an Aedes species, mosquito-transmitted Flavivirus responsible for an ongoing epidemic in over twenty countries and territories in the Caribbean, and in North, Central and South America.  In addition to mosquito-borne transmission, ZIKV can likely be transmitted via blood transfusion and by sexual contact with a ZIKV-infected man. Other Flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus and dengue virus (DENV) are known to be transfusion-transmitted and have resulted in severe outcomes. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus, has a high theoretical risk of transfusion-related transmission. The ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV infection rates are unknown among U.S. blood donors deferred either for travel to an endemic area or for sexual contact with a partner who travelled to an endemic area.  Further, the natural history of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV among deferred blood donors is not well-defined.   Enrollment for this study began in mid June 2016 at the NIH Blood Bank, in the NIH Clinical Center Department of Transfusion Medicine.  To date, 25 travel-deferred or potential blood donors who traveled to Zika virus endemic areas have been enrolled and tested using highly sensitive and specific RT-PCR-based assays for ZIKV, DENV1-4 and CHIKV (Altona Diagnostics; under FDA emergency use authorization).  Enrollees have mean age of 40, 56% are female, 72% are white or Caucasian and 32% had been blood donors >10 years.  Donors and potential donors traveled to 23 different countries or territories with endemic Zika virus, including: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama and Peru; in the Caribbean: the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands; elsewhere: India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Senegal, Singapore, Tanzania, UAE and Vietnam.    We performed internal validation of the ZIKV RT-PCR kit using clinical samples and determined a limit of detection of approximately 100 copies per mL.  Thus far, twenty-four of twenty-five deferred or potential blood donors were negative for ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV in plasma and urine.  One potential donor was positive for Chikungunya RNA in urine (negative in blood) >2 weeks after mild, CHIKV-related symptoms began during a visit to Ecuador. The patient attributed the mild CHIKV symptoms to strenuous volunteer work she was doing for an aid agency in Ecuador, and would not have been reported as an illness during blood donor screening.  We are in the process of procuring clinical samples for validation of our microarray-based pathogen chip for simultaneous ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV detection.  We anticipate collaboration with a large regional blood collection system who will refer travel-deferred donors, donors who have recently traveled to ZIKV, DENV and/or CHIKV high-risk areas and donors who have tested RNA positive for ZIKV, DENV, and/or CHIKV."
"9357199","Advances in antiretroviral (ARV) pharmacotherapy have translated to increased longevity and improved quality of life in people living with HIV; hence, elderly individuals comprise an increasing proportion of todays HIV population. Moreover, HIV infection itself has become recognized as a condition characterized by a hypercoaguable state and premature immunologic aging. Potential interactions between ARVs and anticoagulant medications are of particular concern considering that many elderly, and even non-elderly HIV patients will require short-term or chronic anticoagulation to prevent and/or treat systemic embolism. Dabigatran, administered as dabigatran etexilate, is an oral irreversible, competitive direct thrombin inhibitor, which has been shown to be superior to warfarin, and non-inferior to enoxaparin, in preventing thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and undergoing orthopedic surgery, respectively.   While dabigatran itself is not a substrate of Permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp), its inactive pro-drug, dabigatran etexilate, is a substrate of P-gp. Co-administration of dabigatran etexilate with P-gp modulators has resulted in significant changes in dabigatran exposure. The pharmacokinetic enhancers, ritonavir and cobicistat, as inhibitors of P-gp, are expected to increase plasma concentrations of dabigatran; however, neither agent has been studied in combination with dabigatran etexilate, to date. Hence, the purpose of this study is to determine whether the separate co-administration of ritonavir or cobicistat with dabigatran etexilate increases the systemic exposure of dabigatran in healthy volunteers, and if so, whether adjusting the administration times of these medications can circumvent this interaction.  In this open-label study, 32 healthy volunteers will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Group A will consist of 16 subjects who will take 22 days of ritonavir; Group B will consist of 16 subjects who will take 22 days of cobicistat. All subjects will receive 3 separated single doses of dabigatran etexilate. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) sampling for dabigatran will occur on Days 0  1, Day 191  20, and Day 261  27. The PD effects of dabigatran will be characterized via ecarin clotting time (ECT) measurements.  Dabigatran PK/PD parameters will be determined using non-compartmental methods with the WinNonlin professional computer program (version 5.2; Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). The following PK/PD parameters will be compared between the groups: area under the curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24), maximum total dabigatran plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve from 0 to infinity hours (AUC0-), time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax), terminal half-life (T), apparent oral clearance (CL/F), area under the effect curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUEC0-24), and the maximum effect ratio over baseline (ERmax).  This study has completed full enrollment of all subjects in both arms of the study.  Parttial data was presented at 15th International Workshop on Clinical Pharmacology in HIV and Hepatitis, Washington DC, May, 2014 and the 2015 Annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Boston, MA in February 2015.

"9339108","The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the NIH Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) program on distress in oncology patients treated for pain.  More than simply a physiologic or sensory response, pain is multidimensional.  Pain management programs are best developed by selecting interventions based on the individuals pain experience. Strategies with several courses of action that complement each other may be selected to work together in a synergistic response to maximize pain relief. The goal of palliative care is to achieve the highest possible quality of life for patients, and indirectly, their families, through symptom control and attention to the whole patient: addressing physical, psychosocial, and emotional dimensions.   Limited research with persons receiving palliative care for cancer indicates that a variety of complementary interventions can mitigate psychological distress and improve quality of life (Ernst, 2001).  A growing body of literature documenting positive effects of pet ownership and animal-assisted therapy (AAT) on patients with chronic illnesses warrants consideration of this type of intervention among the complementary approaches that may benefit terminally ill cancer patients.   The purpose of the proposed preliminary study is to explore the possible benefits of the existing NIH AAT program on psychological and physiological distress in cancer patients referred for pain and palliative care consults at the NIH Clinical Center. The primary outcome variable of interest is distress.  Secondary outcomes of interest are pain intensity, pain unpleasantness, and use of pain medications.  Attitudes towards pets is considered a moderating variable and will also be assessed.  A pre-post, within-subjects design will be used.  Patients will be assigned in randomized block order to a comparison and treatment condition, administered at the same time of day on two consecutive days.  The treatment condition is 20 minutes of AAT and the comparison condition is a 20-minute neutral discussion with a Recreational Therapist.  All participants will be adult oncology patients consulted to the pain and palliative care service, and recreation therapy.    Psychological data will be collected pre and post session by survey instruments; medication use will be collected every 24 hours; physiological stress will be measured by salivary cortisol and, for patients with established indwelling catheters only, serum beta-endorphin levels.   Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to assess the effect of the two conditions (treatment vs. comparison) on each of the dependent variables.

"9357479","Newborn screening programs currently screen more than 4 million U.S. infants per year. The intent of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic. This public health program has saved countless lives through the identification of infants who are at risk for congenital disorders for which early interventions and treatments have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality. In 2006 the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 29 core conditions and that 25 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and the Secretary of HHS. Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening. There has been broad acceptance of these screening guidelines by state screening laboratories, and interest in adding new tests that have been appropriately vetted to the recommended panel. In addition, under the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007, the Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Research Program within NICHD is authorized to carry out, coordinate, and expand research in newborn screening. Currently, policies related to newborn screening are determined through analysis of the severity and incidence of each condition under consideration, the specificity and sensitivity of the screening test, the natural history of the disorder, and the efficacy, safety, and effectiveness of treatments available for the disorder.    Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN) websiteThe Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN) is a resource for investigators engaged in newborn screening related research. As part of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act mandated by Congress, the Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Program was established, with the NBSTRN Coordinating Center as a key component. The NBSTRN Coordinating Center is funded by a contract to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Branch (IDDB).    The primary goals of the NBSTRN are to:    Enable biomedical investigators, with appropriate IRB permission and privacy protections, to access dried bloodspots and other biological specimens in a site-independent manner for research  Support the needs of investigators to:  Evaluate the predictive value of biomarkers through early phase clinical/epidemiological studies  Facilitate the development and assessment of new methods and technologies to improve the capacity for early identification through newborn screening  Identify candidate diseases for inclusion in expanded newborn screening  Determine the effectiveness of treatments and long-term outcomes by means of studies involving screened and treated patients  Encourage collaboration among researchers and rapid dissemination of information to promote progress and avoid fragmentation of effort  Develop policies and procedures that support privacy and confidentiality of patient-related information as well as appropriate rules by which to conduct the research  The NBSTRN works collaboratively with other organizations involved in newborn screening related activities.

A preclinical animal model program (HHSN275201400004C and HHSN275201400005C) at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) was developed to screen promising compounds using various animal models and the NIAAA Clinical Investigators Group (NCIG) program was established to conduct proof-of- concept (POC) clinical trials. Lacking in NIAAA?s therapeutic drug development pipeline is a human laboratory program which will serve to screen potential medications prior to conducting the more expensive POC clinical trials. The overarching goal is to develop an integrated program wherein a prospective therapeutic compound would be tested across all three components of the program: pre-clinical animal models, human laboratory testing, and POC clinical trial.  Initially, promising compounds would be examined in the preclinical animal model program. Those compounds which demonstrate efficacy in the preclinical assays (assuming safety and tolerability endpoints are met) would be advanced to the human laboratory screening program (HLAB). If the candidate compound demonstrates promising results in one or more of human laboratory assays underlying aspects of the alcohol ependence syndrome, then the prospective compound would be considered for evaluation in the NCIG POC clinical trials. Establishment of a human laboratory program for testing medications is a valuable, needed component in achieving an efficient and predictable medication development program and for the advancement of medications to treat Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs)."

"9235529","Memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells are responsible for producing neutralizing antibodies that can effectively eliminate a pathogen. Understanding the function of these cells in response to infection and how they can be induced and maintained by vaccination is therefore critical to eradicating diseases that are global health burdens. Malaria, caused by Plasmodium spp, is a major global health burden that is in urgent need of a vaccine. Over fifty years ago it was shown that transfer of human immune serum can neutralize Plasmodium parasites during the blood stage of infection. Little is known however about the Plasmodium-specific B cells that produce these antibodies due to the difficulties of studying low frequency antigen-specific B cells. Additionally, it is not understood how recently described populations of heterogeneous memory B cell (MBC) subsets induced by protein immunization form or function in response to infection. To clarify functional roles for distinct MBC subsets during malaria infection, tetramers were generated that identify Plasmodium-specific MBCs in both humans and mice. Multiparameter flow cytometry and single-cell B cell receptor sequencing revealed that long- lived murine Plasmodium-specific MBCs consisted of three populations: somatically hypermutated, classically defined IgG+ (IgG+), a previously unrecognized population of somatically hypermutated IgM+ (IgMhighIgDlow) MBCs and an unmutated IgD+ (IgMlowIgDhigh) MBC population. Surprisingly, Plasmodium-specific IgM+ antibody dominated the early response to a secondary infection. Further analyses revealed that upon rechallenge, IgM+ MBCs rapidly form two antibody-secreting populations: T cell-independent plasma cells and T-dependent IgM+ and IgG+ plasmablasts. IgM+ MBCs are therefore rapid, plastic, first responders to Plasmodium rechallenge and should be targeted by vaccine strategies. We are now poised to further characterize these and other Plasmodium-specific B cell populations to determine their unique contributions to protection against malaria in both humans and relevant murine models. The central hypothesis of this application is that the development of functionally heterogeneous yet synergistic populations of memory B cells will be required for vaccine-mediated protection to Plasmodium. The goals of this proposal are to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to the formation of these distinct MBC subsets and to determine how these cells contribute to protection against malaria in mice and humans. This innovative approach could provide the information required to develop the first effective vaccine against malaria."

"9244291","PROJECT SUMMARY The herpesviruses have co-evolved with their hosts for hundreds of millions of years. As our adaptive immune systems evolved, so did the mechanisms of immune evasion encoded by herpesviruses. Because herpesviruses remain latent or persistent within their hosts throughout life, the herpesviruses have evolved a unique set of strategies to help them contend with the lifelong host immune response. This application?s central premise is that the herpesviruses, in their evolution, have performed a 100 million-year-long genetic screen to undermine host defense mechanisms, and in so doing, can illuminate cell biological processes that we may not yet understand; we seek to take advantage of their evolution to discover new concepts in cell biology. The long term goal of this project is to understand the underlying cell biological mechanisms by which human herpesviruses-6 and -7 (HHV-6/7) escape host defense mechanisms. The focus of this proposal is to search for the cellular proteins that assist HHV-7 U21 in rerouting class I MHC molecules to the lysosomal compartment and to explore the function of U21 in the context of virus infection. In Aim I, we will perform a CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA library screen for cellular proteins that influence U21's ability to reroute class I MHC molecules to lysosomes. We will also attempt to identify cellular proteins in the vicinity of the U21/class I MHC complex using a promiscuous biotin ligase. In Aim II, to explore the physiological role of U21 in the context of infection, we will examine HHV-6A U21's role in host evasion, and determine whether HHV-6A U21 functions to downregulate cellular proteins from the cell surface by surveying the effects of HHV-6A U21 expression on the cell surface proteome. We will then widen our scope to examine the how the surface proteome changes in the context of HHV-6A infection. These exploratory experiments should extend our previous work on HHV-7 U21 in new directions; we aim to discover multiple cellular proteins that illuminate either novel lysosomal trafficking pathways or novel host evasion strategies for HHV-6A. In so doing, we work toward a more complete understanding of how these viruses have demonstrated such great success in evading the host immune response. RELEVANCE OF THIS RESEARCH TO PUBLIC HEALTH The high fevers resulting from HHV-6 infection are perhaps the most common cause of febrile seizures in young children, with a peak incidence in the second year of life. Childhood seizures have long been known to be associated with a substantially increased risk of temporal epilepsy (3). A recent study has shown that HHV- 6, and HHV-7 infection accounts for ~40% of all cases of severe seizures in young children (4). HHV6 DNA was found in 70% of brain tissue resections from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (5). Together, these studies suggest a link between childhood infection with HHV-6 and -7, and the development of epilepsy. HHV-6 also reactivates in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, resulting in poor neurocognitive outcome and can result in acute limbic encephalitis (3,4). The function of lysosomes is of critical importance to a cell's ability to break down both extracellular ingested material, as well as intracellular substrates. To maintain a functioning lysosome, proper targeting of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes is critical, a point underscored by the growing number of devastating genetic deficiencies ascribed to lysosomal storage disorders. The U21 protein encoded by HHV-7 uses the cellular lysosomal sorting machinery to reroute class I MHC molecules for destruction in lysosomes. Discovering how U21 does this may illuminate novel cellular lysosomal sorting pathways. A clearer understanding of how lysosomal proteins reach their destination will inform our ability to treat lysosomal storage diseases."
"9246720","Abstract. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel molecular approaches for early detection of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). EAC arises in the setting of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE); a metaplastic change resulting from GERD. This knowledge has driven endoscopic screening and surveillance recommendations for individuals with GERD and BE but compliance is low and the vast majority of new EAC cases are still diagnosed at late stage, when the tumor is inoperable and prognosis is extremely poor. Over the past 6-8 years, we have developed a highly collaborative, multi-institutional and multi- disciplinary team focused on the development of clinically useful biomarkers for EAC. This proposal will build on our previously funded projects and the clinical and technical resources available to us through these studies, in order to evaluate two different approaches to early detection of EAC. The first approach is based on detection of somatic mutation and DNA copy number abnormality signatures in esophageal cytology samples. Published studies and our own ongoing work strongly indicate that accumulation of somatic mutations and major chromosomal rearrangements drive the progression from BE to EAC. We believe that these changes can be leveraged to identify a genomic signature for progression that can be detected in cytology samples using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) test. Identification of the genomic signature is ongoing in our group through large-scale comparative sequencing of EAC and pre-neoplastic tissue samples. To evaluate the effectiveness of this signature in identifying progression, we are currently collecting ~350 esophageal cytology samples using an encapsulated sponge called the EsophaCap?. This device is not yet commercially available, but has been provided to us under arrangement with CapNostics LLC and is currently approved for investigational testing in the USA and Canada. These unique data and tissue resources will be used in Specific Aim 1 to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a targeted NGS analysis of esophageal cytology samples to detect dysplasia and early EAC. The second approach also leverages our large-scale sequencing data and targeted sequencing assays, but in this case we will evaluate the detection of mutations in circulating, cell-free DNA isolated from plasma as a biomarker for EAC. We are currently collecting plasma from all patients who swallow the EsophaCap? device and this provides an excellent tissue resource in which to test detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). To aid in the detection of ctDNA, we have developed an ultra-sensitive NGS- based assay that can detect mutations at multiple loci with sensitivity as low as 0.05% (1/2000) mutant allele fraction. These resources will be used in Specific Aim 2 in order to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA for detection of stage I and II EAC. Finally, studies indicate that ctDNA detection may have prognostic value. In Specific Aim 3 we will evaluate the prognostic value of ctDNA in stage I and II EAC patients with the hope that this may prove useful for directing neoadjuvant therapy in these patients."
"9246893","Lack of physical activity is central to numerous health problems. Despite this, we have limited understanding of the molecular components which confer the benefit of physical activity and their diverse impacts across tissues with respect to age, sex, genetics, environment and other objective physiologic, morphometric, and metabolic measures. Identifying these molecular signatures offers to provide new opportunities for treatment and therapeutics. The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity in Humans Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to assemble a comprehensive map of the molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity and, when possible, relate these changes to the benefits of physical activity. This map will be greatly facilitated by the application of ?omics technologies to identify exercise-responsive genes and to relate their benefits across multiple tissues and contexts. We propose to aid in the construction of this map as the Stanford/Salk MoTrPAC Genome, Epigenome and Transcriptome (GET) Chemical Analysis Center. We will leverage our production and analysis experience to engage in MoTrPAC study design, enable the production of high quality and low cost genomes, epigenomes and transcriptomes and facilitate and engage in bioinformatics analysis with the MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center. Key activities will include coordination and collaboration with all the MoTrPAC sites from tissue management to data delivery. Through these activities we will sequence 3000 genomes and at least 40000 epigenomes and 40000 transcriptomes for samples collected at MoTrPAC animal and human study sites. Our site will engage in multiple levels of quality control from tissue collection to sequence mapping. Generated data in common data formats will be immediately available to MoTrPAC investigators and the Bioinformatics Center through the Google Cloud. In addition, as part of our proposed site, and in coordination with both the MoTrPAC Steering Committee and investigators, we will leverage our expertise in both studies of exosomes and chromatin accessibility sequencing with ATAC-seq to conduct two early pilots that aim to elucidate the systemic and molecular changes in response to physical activity. Additional features of our proposed site are analytical opportunities that include leveraging multiple exercise-related ?omics data sets, such as the DGN study where we have genetic data, transcriptomes and exercise activity recorded for 922 people and have already identified multiple differentially expressed genes and gene-by-environment variants in response to exercise, and diverse and novel -omics methods for gene-by-environment, multi-omics and longitudinal data analysis. Our expectation is that this combination of production experience, exercise-relevant data and novel methods will support diverse and impact research outcomes in the MoTrPAC."
"9251521","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All present day prosthetic heart valves suffer from complications. Mechanical heart valves (HVs) require life-long anti-coagulation therapy, while bioprosthetic heart valves based on fixed tissue are plagued with durability, immunogenic and calcification issues. Polymeric heart valves promise to combine the best of the mechanical valves and the best of the bioprosthetic heart valves. Our lab has developed a novel biomaterial, BioPoly, made of engineering polymers that are, at a molecular level, interlocked with hyaluronan (HA, a naturally occurring polysaccharide) to make highly hydrophilic hemocompatible polymer leaflets with the durability of engineered synthetic polymers. Preliminary work has shown that BioPoly leaflets have remarkably reduced thrombogenic potential relative to plain polymer leaflets. Further, we have already demonstrated the feasibility of manufacturing BioPoly leaflets and assembling them into an implantable trileaflet valve. The present R01 study aims to gauge the efficacy of BioPoly as a potential alternative to current heart valve technology by fine tuning material composition and processing to meet the durability and antithrombogenic requirements for heart valve leaflets. Our central hypothesis is: BioPoly HVs offer a viable solution to the drawbacks of both bioprosthetic and mechanical HVs. This is tested in three aims. Aim 1 quantifies heart valve hemodynamic performance and the durability/fatigue characteristics of BioPoly heart valves. Aim 2 focuses on elucidating the effects of leaflet composition and processing on hemocompatibility. Aim 3 focuses on understanding the in vivo hemocompatibility and calcification properties of BioPoly HV. This proposal is led by Dr. Lakshmi Prasad Dasi, who is a well-trained young investigator with expertise in heart valve engineering and cardiovascular biomechanics. Co-investigators are Dr. James, who is an established polymer materials scientist, and the inventor of BioPoly. She has successfully translated this material in orthopedic applications (currently commercially available in Europe); Dr. Popat whose expertise lies in bio-compatibility and surface nano-engineering; and Dr. Orton an experienced Veterinary cardiothoracic surgeon. If the proposed work demonstrates that BioPoly leaflet HVs are antithrombogenic, elicit excellent hemodynamics, are durable, and demonstrate resistance to in vivo calcification, this R01 grant may lead to breakthrough technology for polymeric HVs that require little or no anticoagulation, can be delivered minimally invasively and are durable enough to last a lifetime."

This objective is accomplished through re-examination of each of the three Framingham cohorts (Original, Offspring, Generation III) for measurement of complex phenotypes; through rapid distribution of DNA for extensive and focused genotyping; for rapid distribution of genetic and phenotypic measurements for use by investigators internal and external to the Framingham Study; and through analyses of the contribution of genes, new and established risk factors, and innovative biomarkers to the development and progression of subclinical and clinical disease. Starting in late 2009, the Framingham Omni cohorts will be integrated into the contract for the Framingham Heart Study. The Omni cohort participants, consisting of minority residents of Framingham, MA, were recruited by Framingham Heart Study investigators in 1994-1995 (Omni Cohort 1) and 2003-2005 (Omni Cohort 2) to complement the study and reflect the growing diversity of that community. The Omni cohorts consisted of Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and a few American Indians. Three examinations and one examination were conducted on the Omni Cohort 1 and Omni Cohort 2, respectively, with funding provided through NIH grants to Boston University. By integrating the Omni cohort into the Framingham Heart Study contract, the Omni cohorts will consistently receive the same surveillance and examination as the rest of the Framingham Heart Study participants. The integration of the Omni cohort will make the study findings more applicable to the community."
"9271532","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advances in HIV treatment have dramatically changed the course of HIV disease. The focus of clinical care has shifted from treating opportunistic infections to managing chronic, non-AIDS-related complications. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as a major challenge to the long-term health of HIV patients, who face a higher risk than patients without HIV disease because of specific, HIV-related factors which accelerate the development of CVD. The management of CVD and other co-morbidities may differ in the setting of HIV, and significant questions regarding CVD risk prediction and prevention remain unanswered. To provide the best care to HIV populations as they age, there is an urgent need to develop rigorous, evidence-based, HIV- specific CVD risk prediction strategies. Through the proposed study, we will evaluate and develop methods to accurately predict CVD risk in HIV patients, addressing a major knowledge gap in HIV clinical care. These analyses are particularly timely given the paradigm shift occurring in the field of CVD prevention, with the recent development and introduction of a new American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) risk prediction algorithm which is a key component of newly released cholesterol guidelines. We propose several novel analyses, including 1) the first evaluation of the new ACC/AHA CVD risk prediction algorithm in the setting of HIV; and 2) the first incorporation of HIV itself into CVD risk prediction models. Our study will address the following aims:  Specific Aim 1: To assess the performance of existing cardiovascular risk prediction algorithms  in an HIV clinical care cohort  Specific Aim 2: To generate and internally and externally validate new cardiovascular risk  prediction algorithms for tailored use in HIV populations To achieve these aims, we will leverage a multidisciplinary team that is comprised of internationally-recognized leaders with the required expertise in relevant fields. Dr. Ralph D?Agostino will serve as Co-Principal Investigator and will apply his decades of experience in risk prediction statistical analysis to lead a team to validate and develop the new risk prediction algorithms. The HIV cohorts which will be used to generate and externally validate the newly-developed HIV-specific risk prediction algorithms are uniquely suited for these analyses and have produced seminal studies in the field of HIV and CVD. Our proposed work aligns with specific research priorities identified in the new 2013 ACC/AHA risk assessment guidelines which include validation of the new CVD risk prediction algorithm in diverse clinical settings. Our findings will have a significant clinical and public health impact, optimizing CVD risk prediction in HIV and informing CVD prevention strategies to improve the long-term health for this population."
"9272762","ARIC is a prospective epidemiologic study conducted in four U.S. communities: Washington County, MD; Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; and Minneapolis, MN. The study is designed to monitor the trends in incidence and mortality of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure in communities, and to investigate the etiology, natural history, and progression of subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease such as CHD, heart failure, and stroke. Accordingly, ARIC includes a Community Surveillance Component and Cohort Study Component.    For the community surveillance, the four communities are investigated to determine the occurrence of hospitalized myocardial infarction and CHD deaths in approximately 800,000 men and women aged 35-84 years. Starting in 2006, surveillance of inpatient (ages 55 years and older) and outpatient heart failure (ages 65 years and older) is included for the events beginning in 2005. Under the new contract, community surveillance will continue to monitor long-term trends in hospitalized MI, CHD deaths, and heart failure (inpatient and outpatient).    For the cohort study, approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 years were recruited by probability sampling from each of the four communities under surveillance. A total of 15,792 participants (11,478 whites, 4,266 African Americans, and 48 other) received an extensive baseline examination in 1987-1989. Three repeat examinations were conducted in 1990-92, 1993-95, and 1996-98. The examinations collected information on demographics, psycho-social and behavioral factors, dietary intakes, physical measurements, and biological and genetic markers. Under the new contract, the surviving cohort members will receive another clinic exam to characterize heart failure stages, identify genetic and environmental factors leading to ventricular dysfunction and vascular stiffness, and assess longitudinal changes in pulmonary function and identify determinants of its decline. Participants are also contacted twice a year by telephone to assess health status.    Under the new contract, the study will also be enhanced with cardiovascular outcomes research to assess quality and outcomes of medical care for heart failure risk factors and heart failure."

This project will continue to provide important information for researchers and clinicians on age changes in brain structure and function, their associations with cognitive change, and factors that modulate these associations, including risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. A number of recent studies indicate that structural and functional longitudinal changes in specific temporal lobe regions predict cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, but there are few studies that provide data on longitudinal changes in regions throughout the brain and for both gray and white matter. Using new imaging methods, we will continue to investigate the neurobiological basis of cognitive impairment and dementia.

"9114889","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Stroke is a major cause of disability in veterans. Despite significant advances in stroke rehabilitation methods there continue to be substantial long-term disability. Additional research is required to develop new methods to facilitate recovery. We propose to delineate and modulate the neurophysiological offline processing and performance gains that appear to occur during the process of recovery (i.e. systems level neural processing and enhancements of performance that occur after the actual training has stopped). Based on our preliminary data, we will focus on the role of offline processing during sleep. More specifically, using multiscale electrophysiological techniques that monitor task-related activity at multiple resolutions, we propose to conduct studies that will both delineate how sleep enhances motor recovery after stroke as well as test how best to structure/modify sleep during rehabilitation. Our underlying hypothesis is that `offline neural processing' during sleep facilitates motor recovery. The main goals of this proposal are to: (1) delineate the stages of sleep that can promote motor recovery after training, (2) elucidate the neural processes that promote motor learning during sleep, and (3) test if optimization of sleep-dependent processing can be used to enhance recovery. Using long-term multi- scale electrophysiological recordings in rats, our preliminary data illustrates tht sleep in general, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in specific, plays an important role in the consolidation of motor skills in both the non-injured and the injured motor system. Further,  we found a close link between `replay' of neural patterns formed during task-specific training and offline gains in performance. The specific underlying hypothesis of this proposal is that offline `replay' of neurons during NREM sleep is important for sleep-dependent long-term improvements in motor recovery after stroke. We propose the following aims: (1) Determine the optimal amount and type of sleep to induce short-term offline gains in motor performance after stroke; (2) Determine the electrophysiological correlates of NREM sleep- dependent offline processing in the stroke perilesional cortex after motor rehabilitation; (3) Determine if sleep-dependent processing can be used to actively enhance long-term motor recovery. Our proposed research has the possibility of discovering important knowledge about the network and the neurophysiological basis of motor recovery and can offer novel approaches for neuromodulation to enhance motor recovery after stroke."

The purpose of this investigation will be to characterize sleep patterns, perceptions, and beliefs throughout the process of alcohol rehabilitation. The misuse of alcohol is a global public health concern that compromises both individual and societal wellbeing, resulting in an estimated 2.5 million deaths annually. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) distinguishes alcoholism by craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance (NIAAA, Alcohol Use Disorders). Outcome expectancies, behavioral capability, and self-efficacy beliefs are central constructs in the Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986) and are measured directly in this study using both quantitative and qualitative methods. A mixed methods approach is being used to study the following aims: a) to assess individuals' perceptions of and experiences with sleep during alcohol rehabilitation, b) to describe sleep patterns, perceptions, and beliefs among alcohol-dependent individuals throughout the transition from a clinical research facility providing rehabilitation treatment back to the community, c) to assess whether sleep-related beliefs and/or behavior of individuals are predictive of sleep quality or relapse to drinking, and d) to assess whether sleep quality predicts relapse.   Sleep quality and duration are quantitatively assessed approximately one week prior to discharge from the inpatient facility and again 4-6 weeks post-discharge. A sub-set of participants are asked to wear actiwatches (accelerometers) to provide objective data on sleep throughout the transition from inpatient to outpatient. In addition to quantitative measures, qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with a subset of participants within a week of the scheduled discharge date and again four to six weeks post-discharge to assess perceptions of sleep during recovery. This proposed study will fill a gap in the literature by characterizing sleep throughout the rehabilitation process and ongoing maintenance of abstinence.

Recruitment for the quantitative portion of the study will continue until the proposed sample size is reached (N=219.)"
"9237608","Repair and regeneration of the injured heart with new, functional cardiomyocytes remains a daunting challenge for cardiovascular medicine. Following cardiac injury, fibroblasts enter injury zone and through various processes actively impair contractile function. Converting cardiac fibroblasts within scar tissue into functional cardiomyocytes is a therapeutic approach that has great potential to restore the function of an injured heart. We were the first to identify a combination of miRNAs, miR combo (miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a, and miR-499- 5p) that directly reprogrammed cardiac fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes, whereas others have used transcription factors to the same effect. Importantly, delivery of miR combo using lentivirus or retrovirus led to a modest, but significant, improvement in cardiac function. This application is focused on improving miR combo as a therapeutic by identifying ways to enhance efficiency, cell specificity, and effectiveness. Preliminary studies have identified an Adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype that specifically targets fibroblasts and, moreover, displays enhanced transduction efficiency in vivo. Furthermore, TLR3 activation, which strongly augments miR combo directed reprogramming in vitro, may be a novel way to increase effectiveness. Finally, several transcriptional inhibitors have been identified as miR combo targets. These transcriptional inhibitors repressed the expression of key cardiac transcription factors, suggesting a mechanism for miR combo directed reprogramming. Three overlapping areas will be investigated in this project. Aim 1 will focus on optimizing the efficiency, effectiveness, and cell specificity of miR combo in vitro. To that end we will test if the self- complementary (sc)AAV 2/1 expressing a polycistronic miR combo results in the fibroblast-specific delivery of miR combo. Pharmacological agents will define the appropriate level and duration of TLR3 activation for optimal enhancement of miR combo mediated reprogramming. Aim 2 will address the same questions in vivo. Speckle tracking echocardiography will determine changes in regional wall motion in vivo. Histology will quantify fibrosis levels and lineage tracing will evaluate reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes. Pharmacological agents will be used to determine if TLR3 activation enhances the functional improvements that follow fibroblast reprogramming by miR combo. Aim 3 will define the mechanism by which miR combo promotes reprogramming. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches will determine the role of the transcriptional repressors in miR combo directed reprogramming. Luciferase assays will be used to delineate the physical interaction between the miRNAs within miR combo and the transcriptional repressors. Decoy inhibitor approaches will define the role of NF?B, the key transcription factor in the TLR3 pathway, in miR combo directed reprogramming. Findings from these studies will provide important new insights into improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and cell specificity of direct reprogramming for cardiac repair and regeneration as a therapy."
"9187485","Project Title: Multiscale Modeling of Cardiac Calcium Dynamics; How Ryanodine Receptors can induce Arrhythmias Project Summary: Cardiac calcium (Ca) dynamics will be investigated to elucidate molecular and ionic mechanisms of delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), early afterdepolarizations (EADs) due to spontaneous Ca releases from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), triggered activities, and thus ventricular fibrillation (VF) at the tissue level to provide theoretical bases for novel therapeutic strategies. We recently showed how EADs due to reactivation of the L-type Ca current can result in large gradients of refractoriness in tissue, creating a substrate for reentry. EADs are also initiated by spontaneous Ca releases. DADs are normally initiated by spontaneous Ca releases. To understand how EADs and DADs are caused at the ryanodine receptor (RyR) level and induce triggered activities at the tissue level, we use computer simulation and mathematical analysis of physiologically detailed models of Ca cycling and the action potential (AP). In this study we consider five scales 1) single RyR 2) Ca release unit (multiple channels) 3) subcell (array of Ca release units) 4) whole cell 5) tissue. The first half of this research is to establish link between single RyR channel properties and subcellular Ca dynamics. Recently, Zima et al showed that Ca release from the SR can be via Ca spark or leak depending on SR Ca load. We will show how RyR channel opening and closing rates, which are regulated by cytosolic and luminal Ca, change the probability to form a Ca spark or leak. We also know Ca waves occur more often when the Ca is overloaded. We will investigate how a single spontaneous Ca spark recruits neighboring Ca release units to initiate a Ca wave, how clusters of Ca sparks propagate or terminate. The second half of this research is to establish the link between subcellular Ca dynamics and tissue AP dynamics. First, we will address how subcellular Ca waves interact with AP to induce DADs and EADs. Then we will address how DADs and EADs interact with tissue properties to induce a triggered activity. Key questions we will address are 1) what is the critical size of a group of cells of DADs or EADs to overcome electrotonic source-sink mismatch to become a triggered activity under different physiological conditions and tissue geometry. 2) how an EAD or DAD from a single cell can cause a group of cells to simultaneously generate EADs or DADs to exceed the critical size required for propagation. 3) how susceptibility of triggered activity in tissue can be estimated from the RyR properties."
"9238211","PROJECT SUMMARY As a major metabolic organ, the liver catalyzes dietary sugar, primarily encompassing glucose and fructose. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) enhances glycolysis regardless of the oxygen supply. However, whether HCC, in contrast with normal liver tissue, has altered fructose metabolism and, if so, whether this altered carbohydrate metabolism contributes to tumorigenesis are unknown. Our preliminary results revealed that normal hepatocytes, which have high fructose metabolism rates, express the high-activity fructokinase (KHK) isoform KHK- C, a rate-limiting enzyme in fructose metabolism. In contrast, HCC cells have a much lower fructose metabolism rate, and this stitch of KHK isoform expression is mediated by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1/2-dependent alternative splicing of the KHK gene, resulting in a switch from high-activity KHK-C to low-activity KHK-A isoform expression. Importantly, we demonstrated that KHK-A expression is required for production of nucleotides and nucleotide acid derived from glycolysis. We hypothesize that aberrant splicing of KHK coordinates the regulation of fructose metabolism and glycolysis-dependent de novo nucleic acid synthesis to promote HCC development. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) determine the role of alternative splicing of KHK in the regulation of HCC metabolism, 2) determine the role of alternative KHK splicing and the significance of KHK-A? mediated PRPS1 phosphorylation in hepatocellular tumor growth, and 3) determine the role of fructose metabolism in hepatocellular tumor growth. The proposed research is significant because it may lead to pharmaceutical approaches to interrupting HCC metabolism by blocking the function of KHK-A. In turn, this would improve the efficacy of HCC treatment."
"9238256","Project Summary/Abstract Visual systems must be matched (via evolution and learning over the lifespan) to the natural tasks organisms perform to survive and reproduce. Thus, it is of fundamental importance to analyze visual systems with respect to natural tasks and with respect to the statistical properties of natural stimuli relevant to performing those tasks. In our lab we call this ?natural systems analysis.? This novel approach to vision science is composed of several steps: (1) identify natural tasks, (2) measure the natural scene statistics relevant for those tasks, (3) determine how to optimally use those statistics to perform the tasks, given appropriate biological constraints, and (4) use the first three steps to formulate principled hypotheses which are tested and refined in behavioral or physiological experiments. Using a unique suite of measurement devices, computational tools, and psychophysical paradigms developed in our laboratory, we propose to tackle (within the framework of natural systems analysis) several fundamental tasks involving estimation of local properties in natural scenes: (Aim 1) detection of occluding and partially-occluded targets in natural images, (Aim 2) detection of depth edges created by occluding surfaces and estimation local 3D surface orientation at the non-depth edge locations within those surfaces, and (Aim 3) estimation of disparity and local 2D motion. Many of the proposed studies will be the first to precisely characterize the statistical constraints in natural images underlying the visual system's ability to perform these tasks accurately. Many of the proposed studies will also be the first to measure performance in these fundamental tasks using natural stimuli. The product of the studies will be not only unique new measurements, but principled new models that can predict human performance under natural conditions and guide future neurophysiological studies of the underlying mechanisms. Strong preliminary results have been obtained in the previous project period for many of the proposed studies. "
"9239572","Project Summary/Abstract  We have smartly formulated a large collection of novel TnCs to enhance or reduce cardiac muscle contractility in vivo. Using gene therapy approaches, we will test whether these engineered proteins can be used as novel therapies against a wide spectrum of acquired and inherited cardiac diseases. Specifically, we have developed a novel approach to enhance cardiac muscle contractility without compromising relaxation or making the heart an arrhythmic substrate. We have also engineered a novel approach to reduce hypercontractility of a diseased heart and enhance its relaxation. Furthermore, these studies will establish the potential of using engineered TnCs as a therapeutic tool to help patients suffering from several different cardiovascular diseases.  We recently demonstrated that our smartly formulated L48Q TnC therapeutically increases in vivo cardiac contractility, function and performance after an MI. Our new exciting preliminary data demonstrates that cardiac contractility, function and performance can also be enhanced by L48Q TnC following a transverse aortic constriction (TAC; pressure overload on the left heart), without compromising relaxation/diastolic function. The purpose of this proposal is multifold and will: 1) demonstrate the broader therapeutic impact and clinical relevance of our smartly formulated TnCs on cardiovascular diseases with vastly different etiologies; 2) determine whether increasing contractility preserves cardiac function and performance of the right heart in pulmonary hypertension and the left heart in TAC; and 3) determine whether our smartly formulated TnCs can be used to combat inherited restrictive, hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. Aim 1. Determine if our smartly formulated TnCs can improve heart function in right and left sided he art failure .  Pressure overload of the right and left heart are common and devastating diseases that compromise cardiac function and performance. Our battery of examinations will thoroughly test if cardiac muscle contractility can be tuned from the myocyte to in vivo by our novel engineered TnCs to combat left and right heart pressure overload. Aim2.DetermineifsmartlyformulatedTnCscanimproveheartfunctionininheritedcardiomyopathies that model the human diseases.  Inherited cardiomyopathies also compromise the contractility of the heart. We will test if smartly formulated TnCs can be used to combat these diverse cardiac diseases and improve the in vivo function and performance of the heart.

"9243740","Project Summary Infection with Campylobacter jejuni is responsible for millions of cases of diarrhea per year and is a common precursor to Guillain-Barr syndrome, the leading cause of flaccid paralysis. Some individuals infected with C. jejuni experience watery diarrhea consisting of more than 10 stools per day whereas others suffer from inflammatory diarrhea with small-volume mucoid stool containing blood. It is currently uncertain whether the infectious C. jejuni strain, an individual's immune response, or both contribute to the variation in symptoms, severity, and duration of C. jejuni-mediated disease. Our central hypothesis is that the variation in clinical presentation associated with C. jejuni strains is, in part, due to differences in C. jejuni gene expression between strains. Invasive strains of C. jejuni cause bloody diarrhea whereas less-invasive strains cause diarrhea without blood (fewer of these bacteria invade and multiply in intestinal cells). We further hypothesize that infection with invasive strains of C. jejuni will result in greater host pro-inflammatory cytokines and Th17 cytokines (influence gut permeability) than infection with less-invasive strains. Finally, we hypothesize that C. jejuni infection (regardless of phenotypes) will result in a shift in the host-gut metabolism that, at least initially, favors its growth in the intestine. The novelty of this proposal is the use of the pig ligated-intestinal loop model to establish discrete replicative niches for four distinct (sequenced) C. jejuni strains in the intestinal lumen. Two of the C. jejuni strains to be tested in our model cause bloody diarrhea in pigs whereas two strains result in diarrhea without blood. Our preliminary studies have revealed that: 1) Significant genetic diversity exists amongst these four C. jejuni strains; and 2) C. jejuni synthesize a number of proteins either exclusively or preferentially when grown under host-like conditions (in the presence of epithelial cells or with a physiologically relevant concentration of the bile acid deoxycholate) as compared to nutrient broth, as judged by microarray (published) and RNA-Seq analysis (unpublished). In vivo studies are needed to determine the relationship between C. jejuni virulence gene expression and clinical disease presentation and to provide information regarding the complexity of the host response to different strains. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1) Identify unique and/or differentially expressed genes using RNA extracted from C. jejuni cultured in the  laboratory versus from C. jejuni collected from pig ligated-intestinal loops by transcriptomics. 2) Characterize the host response to infection with C. jejuni strains that cause bloody versus watery diarrhea. 3) Perform comparative metabolomics of luminal contents from uninfected and C. jejuni-infected loops."
"9241031","Project Summary The ability to produce new myocytes within the heart would revolutionize our ability to treat cardiovascular disease, and new strategies for generating new cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) after injury, such as myocardial infarction (MI), are needed. Adult mammalian cardiomyocytes (CM) are generally considered to be post-mitotic, hence previous nongenetic strategies to stimulate resident CM proliferation have to date been insufficient to overcome CM loss with injury. However, recent reports demonstrate that adult differentiated CMs in humans and mice have the ability to proliferate, albeit at low frequency, suggesting that these rare events could be harnessed at a larger scale if the underlying mechanisms were fully understood. Developmental studies show that the transcription factor Tbx20 promotes CM proliferation in the fetal and neonatal heart. Tbx20 overexpression (Tbx20OE) in adult CMs induces fetal-like characteristics, including proliferation, smaller size, mononucleation, and fetal contractile protein expression. We hypothesize that induction of adult CM proliferation via a Tbx20-dependent pathway requires both partial dedifferentiation, mediated by increased BMP signaling, and repression of cell cycle inhibitors, including Btg2. The Aims are: 1) Determine if transient or exogenous Tbx20 expression is sufficient to promote adult CM proliferation and repair in vivo. 2) Determine if BMP signaling promotes CM dedifferentiation necessary for induction of adult CM proliferation in vivo. 3) Determine if loss of cell cycle inhibitors Btg1/2 promotes CM proliferation and repair after injury. The ability to induce resident adult mammalian CMs to proliferate by physiologic reversion to a fetal-like state would be an important advance in efforts to generate new myocardium after cardiac injury."
"9246950","Abstract Few interventions have been shown to be as beneficial to human health as physical exercise, yet we remain largely ignorant of the mechanisms by which those potent effects are transduced. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium will examine the response to acute and chronic exercise at multiple scales and in multiple tissues across thousands of humans and in animal models. The study will combine state of the art phenotyping with molecular omics approaches. Building on our long history of analytical innovation in high throughput biology and experience in the analysis of perhaps the largest multi- omic study funded to date, the Stanford MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center will provide core compute, storage and analytic expertise to the MoTrPAC investigators. Taking advantage of our close links with the Stanford high performance computing center and the Google cloud engineering team, we will build a platform for the secure sharing of time-series, training-related, multi-omic, physiological and sensor based measurement data. Aim 1 is focused on creating a local test computing environment and a cloud-based data warehouse for raw data. We will achieve this by first establishing standards for data security and privacy, protocols for data sharing, and a common data element dictionary. Aim 2 describes both the extension of existing omics pipelines and the development of new pipelines for raw multi-omic data. In addition, we propose the development of novel analytic approaches for multi-scale, high-throughput data. Building on expertise from Stanford's renowned statistics department as well as the new department of Biomedical Data Science, we will extend graph based approaches developed by our team into the time dimension across multiple data sets to understand the systems biology of the response to physical training at a fundamental level. In addition, we will focus on data integration and novel visualization approaches. Aim 3 is concerned with building an interactive interface for investigators and participants to interrogate, interact with, explore, and securely download the data. Aim 4 will look outside of MoTrPAC to broader integration with relevant datasets such as GTeX, GEO, the Precision Medicine Cohort, the UK Biobank and others. We believe our team's direct experience in the leadership of studies such as the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, ENCODE, ClinGen, BD2K (Mobilize Center), and MyHeart Counts (one of the launch applications for Apple's ResearchKit framework) will be advantageous in maximizing the benefit of MoTrPAC for investigators around the world."

"9260355","Abstract Development of vaccine technologies with therapeutic efficacy against cancer has been an elusive goal. Conventional adjuvants induce weak levels of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL) responses, while accumulating evidence suggests that simultaneous CTL and antibody (Ab) responses are needed for effective therapy. Therefore, there is a critical need for alternative approaches that can achieve strong anti-tumor immune responses. Our long-term research goal is to develop new material-based strategies that can achieve immune stimulation with potent therapeutic efficacy against cancer. Our objective in this R01 application is to delineate the key nanomaterial criteria for designing effective nano-vaccines and to utilize knowledge gained from these studies to develop a powerful vaccine technology for treatment of primary and metastatic melanomas. To that end, we have developed a novel nano-vaccine system that can (a) efficiently transport antigen (Ag) to dendritic cells (DCs); (b) promote Ag cross-presentation and cross-priming of T-cells; (c) generate significantly stronger Ag-specific CD8+ T-cell responses than conventional vaccines based on DCs, other nano-formulations, and experimental adjuvants in clinical trials; (d) enhance accumulation of anti-tumor T-cells in tumor microenvironment; and (e) induce anti-tumor immunity against primary and metastatic melanomas, in a biocompatible and safe manner. In this application, we propose to address the following questions: what are unique characteristics of our nano-vaccines that evoke such strong anti-tumor immunity, compared with other traditional cancer vaccines? Can we in turn modulate these parameters to further optimize our nano-vaccine technology and amplify anti-tumor immunity? We will evaluate outcomes of our strategy in murine models of locally and systemically disseminated melanomas. Our innovative approach employing interdisciplinary principles of materials science, bioengineering, and immunology will lead to a new vaccine nanotechnology that may eliminate primary and metastatic melanomas and improve cancer immunotherapy."

Our laboratory pioneered patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models and has been developing PDOX models of major cancer types for more than 25 years.1-12 PDOX models of colon cancer,1,13 pancreatic cancer,2 lung cancer,3 breast cancer,5 ovarian cancer,4 stomach cancer,6 cervical cancer11 and mesothelioma9 were previously established. In these models, the orthotopic site was determined and metastasis resulted that matched the donor patient.6,11 For the past year, we have focused on establishing a series of mouse models of soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) and have established a series of 25 patient derived STS that represent the most common histologic subtypes, including liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (sarcoma not otherwise specified (NOS).

"9256805","PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in genome sciences have allowed for early applications of precision medicine. While the genes causing over 4,000 Mendelian diseases have been identified, many leading to new diagnostics and therapeutics, most diseases prove more complicated. For over a decade, researchers have looked for genetic variation that is linked to these more complex diseases through genome wide association studies. While this avenue of research has generated over 18,000 unique variants linked to disease, the interpretation of these variants, and therefore their application to clinical medicine, remains unresolved. Recently, several groups have identified that many of these variants overlap enhancer elements, regions of DNA responsible for the spatiotemporal expression of genes. In this proposal, I aim to functionally validate and interpret the roles of thousands of these variants in complex disease. To do so, I am developing novel technologies with broad application to genome sciences and proteomics. I am developing methods to generate complex libraries of DNA to test, in which I can program specific variation. This same technology has been adopted by others to design proteins with novel functions. I am also developing a novel assay to test the effects of thousands of these variants on enhancer function with unprecedented sequence and chromosomal context. Together, these methods permit the simultaneous analysis of thousands of predefined enhancer variants. This study will provide insight into the genetic basis of complex traits and may guide the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics."
"9256831","PROJECT SUMMARY Phosphorylation related perturbations in cellular signaling pathways are at the root of many human diseases. Protein phosphorylation cannot be observed using DNA or RNA sequencing, which means it is extremely important to develop proteomic technologies and methods that reproducibly and accurately quantify phosphorylation events. Tandem mass spectrometry currently provides an excellent platform to deeply catalog the sites of phosphorylation with respect to disease. However, accurate reproducibility and quantitation are hampered by several acquisition tradeoffs made to provide higher identification rates of low-abundant molecules. I propose an approach to improve quantitative reproducibility in phosphorylation experiments, specifically with regard to positional phosphorylation isomers. I intend to build computational tools that separate the tasks of peptide identification and site localization in proteomic workflows. I will perform site localization using several metrics calculated with entire fragment ion profiles made up of multiple scans, instead of current methods that only use a single scan to localize phosphorylation sites. This should significantly improve accuracy and reproducibility. I will apply this technique to monitor phosphorylation events in the IGF-1 signaling pathway of human cell lines with respect to various stimuli to help elucidate specific networking characteristics between members of that pathway. This project will also greatly benefit the signaling community by providing tools and methods to more reliably discover quantitative changes in the phosphoproteome. "
"9260666","Project Summary Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer death in older women and screening mammography has proven to be effective in reducing breast cancer mortality in women aged 50-69 years. However, screening mammography has not been proven beneficial in women aged 70 and older and diminished life expectancy with aging decreases the potential chance of screening benefit and likely increases the risk of harms, which tend to be immediate. Randomized trials of screening mammography cannot provide the answers because the trials excluded women older than age 75 and those with significant comorbidity. To address this clinical and policy conundrum, the proposal makes innovative use of data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC)?the largest collection of breast cancer surveillance data in the nation? and Medicare claims-based data to determine the consequences following screening in older women. The proposal also applies simulation modeling to compare benefits and harms of screening across levels of advancing age, comorbid illness and functional status. We will use data from 351,566 multi-ethnic women aged 66 years and older who underwent screening mammography in the BCSC between 1998 and 2016. This large-scale study enables the evaluation of benefits and harms of screening by including subgroups of women with favorable 10-year life expectancy and women with limited life expectancy. Our specific aims are: 1) Determine cumulative risk of screening outcomes, including benefits and harms, over the course of 10 years of screening mammography among older women across levels of advancing age, comorbidity and functional status. 2) Determine 10-year risk of mortality among older women undergoing screening mammography across levels of advancing age, comorbidity and functional status. 3) Evaluate comparative effectiveness of screening mammography strategies in older women using a simulation model across levels of advancing age, comorbidity and functional status. To optimize the delivery of high quality health care to older women, there is an urgent need to compare the benefits and harms of screening mammography according to age, comorbidity and functional status, which are key predictors of life expectancy. By identifying subgroups of older women most and least likely to benefit from screening mammography, our proposal speaks directly to the National Cancer Institute?s precision cancer screening initiative."
"9261102","Abstract  Obesity has been classically linked to poor diet/excessive calorie intake and insufficient physical activity. However, it has recently been discovered that environmental components may contribute significantly to the widespread obesity epidemic. The rapidly increasing obese populations in industrialized, developed and even undeveloped countries cannot be strictly accounted for by poor diet and physical inactivity. Environmental chemicals, termed ?obesogens? are endocrine disruptors, that can trigger adipogenesis (fat cell formation). However, their mechanism(s) of action remain unknown. Tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) and tributylin (TBT) are known obesogenic chemicals. We hypothesize that TBBPA and TBT promote adipogenesis by decreasing levels of THY1 (CD90), a cell surface protein present on pre-adipocytes, certain fibroblasts, and stem cells, (e.g. human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)). Our lab previously discovered fibroblasts are heterogeneous for THY1 expression, where only THY1-/low fibroblasts differentiate into adipocytes, which identified THY1?s crucial role during adipogenesis and cell fate determination. Using a well-established mouse pre-adipocyte cell line (3T3-L1), I show that TBBPA reduces THY1 mRNA and protein and promotes adipogenesis. However, whether this occurs in human stem cells, such as hMSCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is unknown. Obesity and adipogenesis are also subject to epigenetic and post- translational changes, which include increases in both global DNA methylation and the abundance of specific regulatory microRNAs (miRNA). My supporting data in hMSCs shows obesogens increase certain miRNAs that are predicted to bind THY1 mRNA. Gene expression can also be regulated by DNA methylation. My supporting data shows that TBBPA increases methylation on the THY1 promoter in hMSCs. Therefore, I hypothesize that obesogens, such as TBBPA, alter post-transcriptional regulation of THY1 to decrease its expression, thereby priming precursor cells to become adipocytes. Therefore, I will determine the in vitro effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of obesogens on THY1 expression in human stem cells. (AIM 1). I will also determine the environmental obesogen effects on THY1 expression in vivo (AIM 2). The results from this project will help determine the obesogenic effects on stem cell function and will offer insight on as to how post-translational changes alter stem cell fate and lineage. Studies of environmental obesogens should be made a priority, since they likely overwhelmingly contribute to the growing worldwide obesity epidemic."
"9265342","Project Summary: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that since 2013 has exploded into a pandemic causing severe disease across the South Pacific and the Western Hemisphere. Even from the first large outbreak in 2007 on Yap Island, epidemiological data suggested that the virus may have unusual transmission characteristics and disease bias among age and sex strata of humans. The majority of people affected with disease on Yap were females and age groups over 30, despite homogenous exposure as measured by antibodies. In 2011, the PI published the first evidence suggesting that Zika virus could be transmitted directly through sexual intercourse. The subsequent pandemic has produced confirmatory evidence of this novel observation, including isolations of ZIKV from human urine and semen and at least 2 other cases of sexual transmission. These data highlight the urogenital tropism of ZIKV, which undoubtedly affects its transmission dynamics, and subsequently the epidemiology of ZIKV disease and pathology. We will test the hypothesis that ZIKV has a strong tropism to certain tissues in the mammalian urogenital tract, such as the prostate gland in males, and is excreted in the bodily fluids of infected animals, and that this fosters sexual transmission and differential pathology in between sexes. The first aim is understand the frequency and details of urogenital tropism and shedding of ZIKV from humans displaying symptoms of arboviral disease who are enrolled into a small human cohort study at the center of the pandemic in northeastern Brazil. The second aim is to develop an animal model of Zika virus urogenital infection, pathogenesis and sexual transmission."

"9269922","ABSTRACT The failure to use isoniazid (INH) preventative therapy (IPT) in persons living with HIV (PLHIV) in Sub-Saharan Africa represents one of the single biggest implementation gaps between evidence and practice in today's response to the HIV epidemic. In PLHIV, TB is a lead cause of death, and IPT reduces TB incidence by 40%. Yet in Africa, less than 2% of eligible individuals receive IPT. Given the existence of both country guidelines recommending IPT, as well as simple clinical algorithms to identify IPT eligible persons, a remaining critical requirement for scale-up is strengthening the link - mediated by middle management in most health systems - between health ministry policy and clinics. In Uganda, District Health Officers (DHOs) serve as key middle managers working at the nexus between policy and implementation. We propose to test a countrywide multi- component ?SPIRIT? (Simplified INH Preventive Therapy) intervention targeting DHOs ? whom we view as critical dissemination agents. SPIRIT is based on the PRECEDE model of behavioral change that deploys predisposing (teaching collaborative); enabling (INH/B6/septrin single pill combination and SMS from DHO to provider); and reinforcing (reporting collaborative) components. For this resubmission, we provide data to show feasibility of SPIRT through a pilot study of 5 DHOs and their clinics. The DHOs engaged in the mini- collaborative and implemented key components of SPIRIT including bidirectional text messaging to front line providers. The number of HIV+ adults prescribed IPT increased from zero at baseline to 300 at 8 weeks. Aim 1: Determine if the SPIRIT intervention increases IPT initiation. We will form 20 groups of 5 District Health Officers and randomize 10 to the SPIRIT intervention and 10 to control (country standard) in a cluster- randomized trial. The primary outcome is proportion of IPT-eligible adults initiating IPT. For secondary outcomes, we will measure changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding IPT among DHOs and front line health workers to assess mechanisms through which the intervention achieves outcomes. Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of the SPIRIT intervention on IPT completion and TB incidence. Even if the intervention increases IPT use, quantifying actual use of IPT by patients and effects on population health status (e.g. reduction in TB), provides an important impact measure that can enable policy makers to prioritize this intervention more widely. A two-stage survey sampling approach will be used to identify a probability sample of patients eligible for IPT in which to measure adherence through hair levels of INH (direct measure of pill consumption/adherence) and TB incidence (population health measure) Aim 3: Assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of SPIRIT. Using effectiveness measures obtained in Aims 1 and 2, standard time and motion and costing methods, we will estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of SPIRIT vs standard of care in our sampled population from Aim 2. Outcomes of interest will include program costs per: a) IPT initiation; b) IPT completion; and c) TB case averted."
"9270331","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this K01 application is to optimize clinical care decisions for people living with HIV. Specifically, this project will explore how cause-specific mortality among people with HIV has changed as treatment has become more effective and how the choice of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen can be tailored or personalized based on patient characteristics to improve survival. Since 2012, many patients have initiated regimens containing integrase inhibitors, but overall and cause-specific mortality for patients on these regimens is uncertain. In addition, the comparative effectiveness of the recommended integrase inhibitor containing regimens for patients with disparate characteristics and treatment histories has yet to be explored. Standard epidemiologic methods are insufficient to optimize HIV treatment plans because treatment plans and tailoring strategies are high dimensional, resulting in sparse data and unstable inference in many data sources, particularly when treatment plans can change over time. The goal of this career development project is to train the recipient to perform comparative effective research in settings with many exposure plans and outcomes. Research aims of this project are to 1) Compare the cause-specific mortality risks among patients with HIV in the US across three time periods representing the triple drug therapy era, the single tablet era, and the integrase inhibitor era (i.e., 2000 ? 2005, 2006 ? 2012, 2013 ? 2018); and 2) Estimate all-cause mortality risks under strategies to optimize selection of an integrase inhibitor containing regimen based on treatment history and patient characteristics. To address these aims in cohort data, the training component of this grant focuses on building expertise in semi-Bayesian semiparametric inference in the context of HIV research. Specifically, training aims include 1) Instruction in statistical techniques to improve inference for tailored treatment plans in high dimensional settings; 2) Training in applied HIV epidemiology; and 3) Experience and preliminary results necessary to prepare an R01 application in the fourth year of this award. The training aims will be achieved through rigorous coursework in advanced biostatistics, mentored and collaborative research, and conference participation. Research aims will be conducted using data from the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems, which includes over 30,000 HIV-seropositive adults engaged in clinical care from January 1, 1995 to the present at 8 US sites. The project will use semiparametric methods to account for missing causes of death and will estimate all parameters describing cause-specific mortality accounting for competing causes of death. Aim 2 will use Bayesian penalization techniques to estimate the causal effects of tailored treatment plans using marginal structural models and the parametric g-formula. This project will address an urgent need to optimize treatment plans in the current treatment era with an aging HIV-positive population with increasing comorbidities."
"9270982","Background: People living with HIV/AIDS smoke at nearly three times the rate of the general population. In our view, shared by others in the field, the single greatest health behavior change that could improve cardiovascular morbidity and associated mortality is to assist people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke to quit. Although many interventions are effective in helping general population smokers quit, research examining outcomes of smoking cessation treatments for individuals with HIV is limited. Thus establishing the efficacy of interventions for smoking cessation for individuals with HIV is of critical importance and is directly responsive to the RFA which specifically requests proposals to test strategies to optimize smoking cessation in HIV populations.? Approach: Our proposed study will use a factorial design to evaluate the most promising behavioral and pharmacologic treatments aimed at achieving maximal efficacy for smoking cessation among people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke. Specifically, we propose to randomize 300 participants to one of the following 4 conditions: (1) varenicline + Positively Smoke Free (an 8 session smoking cessation intervention tailored for PLWH); (2) varenicline + Standard of Care (brief advice to quit); (3) Placebo + Positively Smoke Free; and (4) Placebo + Standard of Care. Given the factorial nature of the design, we will be able to assess the main effect of varenicline vs. Placebo, Positively Smoke Free vs. Standard of Care, and the interaction of those two treatments (i.e., does the addition of varenicline significantly increase the effect of Positively Smoke Free?). We chose to use a factorial design as it is a highly efficient method of assessing multiple treatments in a single trial with the possibility of saving both time and resources. All participants will be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks with the main outcome being 7-day abstinence (defined as self-reported no smoking in the past 7 days + CO<10 ppm). We will then follow-up all participants at 6 months post study conclusion to assess continued abstinence as well as changes in cardiovascular risk. The sizeable cohort and prospective design will also permit us to evaluate the effects of tobacco use, treatment, and cessation on a panel of soluble biomarkers of inflammation that are likely contributors to cardiac morbidity and mortality in PLWH. Implications: Results of this study will provide crucial, real world evidence of the best way for healthcare providers to help smokers living with HIV/AIDS quit smoking with the ultimate goal of improving longevity by lowering risk of mortality, especially cardiac-related mortality."

"9373805","NINDS Biotechnology Products and Biologics  CMC Development Consulting Services  STATEMENT OF WORK FINAL REVISED DOCUMENT 04/11/2016      A. BACKGROUND  The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  NINDS intramural labs are headed by federal employees who work for the Institute, primarily located in Bethesda, MD. For more information on the NINDS Intramural program visit the website http://dir1.ninds.nih.gov/ninds/Home.aspx  For extramural research, NINDS awards grants and cooperative agreements to outside academic institutions, small business concerns and other organizations all over the U.S. and world to fund promising basic, translational, and clinical research projects. Specifically, the NINDS Office of Translational Research (OTR) is committed to facilitate the translation of basic discoveries into the development of new therapeutic interventions through early nonclinical development and early clinical investigation. For more information about the Office of Translational Research visit the website http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/translational_research/index.htm  Projects that are funded through a cooperative agreement award mechanism are led by the principal investigators (PI) team with NINDS program staff participation in guiding the project plan. The PI?s team performs all of the experiments while NINDS role is to establish performance milestones for each project to facilitate go/no-go decision making and then monitor research progress and achievement of project milestones.   B. STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE    The NINDS is seeking senior-level, industry-experienced Biologics Chemical Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) Development Consultants with expertise in biotechnology products and biologics to assist NINDS program staff to vet and advance only the most promising therapeutic biologics through the discovery and development pipeline. Both individual subject matter experts and multidisciplinary teams from consulting firms are encouraged to apply. The NIH anticipates awarding multiple consulting awards in reference to this requirement. Approximately two, and a maximum of three, awards are anticipated.  C. SCOPE OF WORK  General Requirements  Each consultant is expected to provide technical guidance and advice on advancing early discovery and development projects through early nonclinical development and submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) package, and in some cases, design of early clinical protocol and launch of a first in human clinical trial.

"9197592","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Budgetary issues have intensified the focus on improving efficiency in publicly funded health programs. Yet Medicare and Medicaid insure some of the most ill or disabled patients, who are also some of the most expensive. Proposals to address costs create incentives to increase care coordination and accountability for the continuum of care. Realizing spending reductions in this population, however, needs to be balanced with assuring quality for a group at high risk for mortality, functional loss, and decline in quality of life. The overarching goal of this project is to study how fragmentation of care, and the reverse, increased integration, vary with cost and quality of care for high need beneficiaries, including patients dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Efficient care for high need patients may require a broad network that includes multiple physician specialties, acute care hospital, and other types of inpatient care (psychiatric, long term acute hospital or nursing home). In previous work, we have developed an actionable unit - the physician-hospital network - which links Medicare beneficiaries to the specific physicians and hospitals that deliver the majority of their care. We seek to broaden this approach with respect to high need patients using observational cohort methods. We will use national Medicare, Medicaid and Minimum Data Set data to address major gaps in the literature. In Aim 1, we will define networks of healthcare providers for high need patients, and how patients, care, and spending are distributed within and across these networks. In Aim 2, we will test how cost and quality of care for high need patients vary with system (i.e. provider network and region) characteristics. And in Aim 3, we will take advantage of changes in the marketplace to study how cost and quality measures change as health systems formally integrate. The long-term impact of this work will be to provide rigorous information about who can reasonably be held accountable for the care of high need patients and identify the points of leverage for improving outcomes."
"9197597","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The health of the American public and the affordability of U.S. healthcare are both threatened by inefficiency in the U.S. healthcare system. A broad array of public and private sector payment and delivery system reforms is underway, the aim of which is to improve care, improve health and slow spending growth. The success of these reforms, however, requires reliable approaches to measuring health quality and costs while accounting for potential differences in patient risk. And while consensus has emerged that current approaches to risk adjustment and performance monitoring have serious limitations, the impending broadscale adoption of electronic health records is expected to enable the routine collection of extensive individual biomarker and patient-reported measures of risk, symptoms and functional status. The current proposal is intended to advance the science of health risk, health outcome and health system performance measurement while helping to address pressing policy needs. The project will draw on important data assembled in Core C: detailed individual risk and health status data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), newly collected patient-level data from three diverse health systems, and comprehensive Medicare claims data. Under the first aim, which focuses on risk adjustment, we will develop two new risk-adjusters: (a) one based on the detailed biometric and patient-reported data collected through the HRS, and (b) a second based on integrating ZIP code and county level measures of health status, mortality and disease incidence. These will be compared to the claims-based measures currently used by Medicare for program payment, with the aim of informing both long-term and interim approaches to improving risk adjustment. Under the second aim, we will use the patient risk and biometric data collected in routine clinical practice to explore potential limitations to using these data for risk adjustment and performance measurement, including assessing the degree to which non-response bias is likely to be problematic, how their routine use in primary care practices is perceived by clinicians, and whether their use contributes to improved care for Medicare patients."

"9201076","The Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) was established in 2011 with a mission to lead the NCI efforts in generating critical datasets required to catalog the alterations seen in human tumors, coordinating data unification and sharing efforts, and supporting development of analytical tools and computational approaches aimed at improving our understanding of the large-scale, multidimensional data. CCG also has the goal of developing and applying cutting-edge genomic science to prevent cancer and better treat cancer patients, for example in the context of NCI-supported clinical trials. Currently, several large-scale cancer genome research projects fall under the CCG umbrella including those managed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program Office and the Office of Cancer Genomics (OCG).  The CCG is initiating a variety of new projects that require the genomic analysis of cancer specimens and cancer models (e.g. human cancer cell lines). Broadly, the goals of these initiatives include the elucidation of pathogenetic mechanisms in cancer and how genomic alterations in cancer influence the response to treatment. One such effort is the recently initiated Cancer Driver Discovery Program (CDDP), which aims to identify genes that acquire ?driver mutations? in 2% or more cases of cancers of a particular histology. The CDDP pilot has been launched with initial focus on three tumor types ? lung adenocarcinoma, colon carcinoma and ovarian carcinomas ? but will consider other tumor types as well. By sequencing biopsies in larger numbers than has occurred in the TCGA program (i.e. >500), the CDDP will have the statistical power to discover new recurrently mutated genes in cancer that may drive the oncogenic process. Another program supported by this Yellow Task would be the Clinical Trial Sequencing Project (CTSP), in which CCG is working with DCTD to conduct comprehensive genomic analysis of cancer biopsy specimens from patients enrolled on NCI-sponsored clinical trials, with the goal of identifying the molecular basis for therapeutic response and resistance. A third CCG initiative, termed the Human Cancer Models Program (HCMP), will include the genomic analysis of newly created human cancer models growing in vitro or in xenografts. This Yellow Task is not limited to support for genomic analyses within CDDP, CTSP and HCMP, but rather will enable CCG to conduct similar analyses in other cohorts of cancer specimens or models that address key questions in cancer pathogenesis and treatment.  This Yellow Task supports a range of activities necessary for the conduct of the genomic analyses outlined above. First, the contractor will support the acquisition of tissue samples and cancer models for CCG-sponsored projects. It is expected that accrual of tumors will mainly come from collections existing at the NCI Cooperative Groups or similar entities that have obtained the specimens in the context of large-scale well-annotated clinical trials. However, other sources of tissues are not precluded and are in scope for this task order. The accrual process for samples and associated clinical data will involve reimbursement of a modest amount to the participating institutions in a single payment structure.  Second, this Yellow Task supports the Biospecimen Core Repository (BCR), which provides CCG with support for the acquisition of cancer biopsy samples, the derivation of molecular analytes (DNA, RNA and protein), and the curation of clinical data associated with CCG-sponsored genomic studies. Additionally, the BCR will produce documents (Material Transfer Agreements, MTA) that codify the legal relationship between the Tissue Source Site(s) (TSS), the Genomic Characterization Center(s) (GCC) and the BCR.  Finally, this Yellow Task supports the establishment of Genomic Characterization Centers (GCCs), which will produce molecular data of various types from the analytes provided by the BCR and deposit said data in a format that is compatible with other large-scale genomics projects sponsored by CCG. Deposition of data will be done at a database to be designated by the Program Office (PO)."

"9201231","The main objectives of this project are to determine the effects of compounds using two well-established paradigms: (1) drug discrimination and (2) self-administration. Two distinct experimental protocols, pretreatment and substitution, may be conducted within each paradigm. In the drug discrimination paradigm, male rhesus monkeys will be trained to discriminate an intramuscular injection of cocaine from saline. Subsequently, coded compounds will be studied by determining whether selected doses, administered pre-session, reduce the discriminative-stimulus effects of cocaine (pretreatment) and/or whether selective doses of the compound itself can produce cocaine-like effects (substitution). In the drug self-administration paradigm, Mm will be prepared with indwelling IV catheters, and trained to self-administer IV cocain in daily sessions that also include food self-administration components. Each coded compound will be tested in Mm in which the dose-response function for IV cocaine self-administration has been determined. In the pretreatment protocol, tests will be conducted, first, to identify a pretreatment dose that reduces self-administration of the peak reinforcing unit dose of IV cocaine without greatly altering food self-administration, and second, to determine how that dose alters the cocaine dose response function for IV self-administration. In the substitution protocol, selected unit doses of the coded compound will be made available of IV self-administration to evaluate their reinforcing effects. Follow-up studies may be conducted with promising compounds."

"9208683","Project Summary/Abstract - Project 2 (Kraus - PI)  Interplay between the estrogen and progestin signaling pathways in the uterine myometrium during late gestation and at term drive the molecular events underlying the physiological processes leading to parturition. Defects in, or disruption of, these events can cause premature delivery or prolonged labor. Rising estrogen levels in late gestation act to prepare the myometrium for the events leading to parturition (e.g., increased myometrial contractility). However, the molecular details of estrogen action in the myometrium near term, including the mechanisms by which it antagonizes the maintenance of myometrial quiescence by progestins, are unclear. Estrogens (e.g., estradiol, E2) and progestins (e.g., progesterone, P4) act through steroid receptor proteins (estrogen receptors, ERs; progestin receptors, PR), which function as ligand-regulated DNA binding transcription factors. The activity of ER? is modulated through site-specific covalent post-translational modifications, including acetylation at lysines 266 and 268 (in human ER?), which increases both the DNA- binding and transcriptional activities of ER?.  The long-term objectives of our proposed studies are to achieve a better understanding of key aspects of estrogen signaling in the myometrium near term and during parturition, namely: (1) the role of E2 signaling through ER?, (2) the molecular mechanisms by which E2-ER? antagonizes the progestational actions of P4- progestin receptor (PR) at the level of the genome, and (3) the molecular mechanisms by which ER? acetylation controls ER?-dependent gene regulation in the myometrium. Our hypotheses are that (1) the physiological actions of estrogens in the myometrium are determined by the repertoire of genomic binding sites (i.e., ?cistrome?) for ER?, as well as the target genes regulated by those ER? binding sites (enhancers), (2) increased estrogen signaling through ER? near term antagonizes P4 actions, in part, by altering the PR cistrome, and (3) acetylation regulates the ER? cistrome (e.g., formation, pattern, specificity, stability), ER? enhancer assembly, and the expression of target genes.  In this proposal, we outline a series of experiments in three aims using an integrated approach with a complementary set of tools from biochemistry, molecular biology, genomics, mouse genetics, and physiology that will test our hypotheses. Collectively, our studies will reveal new aspects of the molecular mechanisms by which liganded ER? controls the biology of the myometrium during pregnancy and at term."
"9219901","PROJECT SUMMARY  Paxilline indole diterpenes (IDTs) are natural products that exhibit a variety of promising biological activities, but lack of efficient access to the derivatives and analogs of IDTs hinders investigation of their biomedical potential. The long-term goal is to develop new chemical methods and approaches that allow short, general and scalable assembly of natural products with promising biological activities. The objective of this proposal is to develop new chemical methods and approaches for efficient synthesis of IDTs and their otherwise inaccessible analogs and to determine the molecular mechanism of action and a pharmacophore model for inhibition of Eg5. The central hypothesis is that a controlled polycyclization will allow an efficient assembly of the common pentacyclic core of IDTs and will provide a general entry to a broad range of congeners. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of the extensive preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory. These data demonstrate that a new radical-polar crossover cascade en route to the terpenoid core provides the shortest entry to date into the IDT family. The rationale for the proposed research is that new chemical methods and approaches are necessary to achieve efficient synthesis of IDTs and to develop new and potent inhibitors of Eg5, which can be used as biochemical tools and potential antimitotic leads.  The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) development of an intermolecular alkenylation of ketones; 2) development of a general approach to IDTs; and 3) synthesis of antimitotic IDTs and development of potent inhibitors of Eg5. Under the first aim, a new process for intermolecular alkenylation of ketones will be developed. This unique transformation is expected to allow efficient assembly of quaternary centers and to provide a direct access to polycyclization precursors en route to IDTs. The preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory demonstrate a proof-of-principle for this approach. Under the second aim, a general and efficient approach to IDTs will be developed. A radical-polar crossover polycyclization is projected to allow short and efficient assembly of the terpenoid core of IDTs. The preliminary findings from the applicant's laboratory indicate that the key vicinal quaternary stereocenters are set in a direct and stereoselective manner using this approach. Under the third aim, a diverse set of antimitotic IDTs and their analogs will be synthesized and used for elucidation of structure activity relationships (SARs). These SAR data will be used to develop chemical probes for determination of the molecular mechanism of action and to establish a pharmacophore model for Eg5 inhibition by IDTs.  The proposed research is significant because it will make IDTs readily available for widespread biological studies and will allow the evaluation of these terpenoids as new leads in the treatment of cancer. The approach is innovative, in our opinion, because it relies on new chemical methods to achieve efficient construction of IDTs and represents a new and substantive departure from the previous work in the field."

"9361466","The goal of this project is to explore the possibility of designing public policies aimed at improving the health of low-income populations. Toward this end, this project has engaged health policy experts and low-income residents in an exploratory exercise aimed at designing an affordable, evidence-based intervention program targeted at addressing socio-economic factors and reducing health disparities among low income urban residents. A three step process is entailed:   1. Identification of candidate interventions that have been shown to ameliorate the socio-economic determinants of health, and estimation of the actuarial costs of offering these services to low income residents of Washington, D.C.;  2. Consideration of a reasonable per capita expenditure for the purpose;  3. Engagement of low-income residents of Washington, D.C.to ascertain their priorities for publicly funding the proposed interventions within the assigned budget.    Several hundred low-income adults recruited from clinical and community settings have participated in this engagement process through 43 small group exercises in which a facilitated discussion takes place using a previously tested group decision tool, REACH (Reaching Economic Alternatives that Contribute to Health). Data pertaining to participants socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes toward health, and preferences for possible interventions have been collected anonymously. Group discussions have been audio-taped. Data have been analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively to determine preferences for various interventions and their association with socio-demographic characteristics. Participants have been financially compensated for their participation in this study which has been approved by IRBs at the NIH, Howard University and the District of Columbia Department of Heatlh.   Study results have yielded information about the interventions that are of utmost priority to low income urban residents in Washington, D.C. This is unique information that may contribute to efforts to find affordable strategies for ameliorating the socio-economic determinants of health for low-income urban population in the US.

The neurocognitive content has been proven sensitive to the subtle cognitive effects of cancer treatment and is appropriate for repeated administration. The mobile battery is cross-platform and uses instruction videos and speech recognition for self-administration and automated scoring. The data from the battery is automatically uploaded to a secure server for scoring. Two web portals (one for clinicians, the other for researchers) offer online ordering of tests, review of results, and even protocol customization. The Creare team is very well qualified to develop and commercialize this system by leveraging software that Creare and its collaborators have previously developed and validated for mobile neurocognitive assessment, mobile hearing assessment, and medication adherence."

"9270651","Project Summary In sub-Saharan Africa, the primary data for estimating HIV epidemic trends is HIV prevalence among pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC). ANC sentinel surveillance has been conducted every one to two years since the early 1990s across the continent. A ?convenience sample? consisting of ten to twenty facilities in each country were selected to be sentinel sites in which a sample of pregnant women were tested for HIV each year. National estimates of HIV incidence and prevalence are created by fitting a mathematical model called ?EPP? to the HIV prevalence trend in these clinics and prevalence estimates from national household surveys. This makes strong assumptions that epidemic trends in a few non-randomly selected sentinel sites are representative of the national epidemic. This project will evaluate and improve these assumptions about how to extrapolate from sentinel sites to national trends, specifically aiming to (1) characterize the spatial representativeness of selected ANC sentinel sites across sub-Saharan Africa, (2) test for differences in HIV epidemic trends across sentinel sites, (3) develop and validate an approach to propagate uncertainty in epidemic estimates resulting from relying on a small number of sentinel site locations, and (4) demonstrate the impact of the these findings for estimates of HIV prevalence and incidence trends in sub-Saharan Africa. The primary data will be geo-located existing ANC sentinel surveillance data from countries across sub-Saharan Africa, and will also rely on remotely sensed population spatial covariates for population density and accessibility. Spatial and longitudinal statistical models will be used to test several hypotheses: H1.1: sentinel sites are disproportionately selected in areas of higher population density and more accessible to major roadways and urban centers; H1.2: population HIV prevalence is higher in areas surrounding selected sentinel sites; H2.1: HIV prevalence declined more in sites with higher prevalence; and H3.1: statistical uncertainty about historical incidence and prevalence is much greater than represented by current estimates that do not account for sentinel site selection. Taken together, the implications of these hypotheses may be that current interpretation of ANC surveillance data has resulted in systematically over-estimating peaks and declines in national HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa and spuriously precise epidemic estimates that do not give adequate weight to more representative data sources, such as national household sero-surveys. Results of the project will be reported to the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling, and Projections (http://www.epidem.org) and will result in improved methods for the UNAIDS EPP/Spectrum software used to generate official national estimates of HIV prevalence, incidence, and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa."

"9393381","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transcription factors regulate distinct networks of genes in specific tissues, yet understanding how these networks are coordinated temporally and spatially to promote animal development and homeostasis is extremely challenging. Here, I propose to study how gene regulatory networks promote a developmental program (molting) using the simplicity of the model nematode C. elegans. I will test the hypothesis that nuclear hormone receptor regulation of core elements of the molting network are conserved between free-living and parasitic nematodes by comparing the C. elegans molt network to that of the human parasite, B. malayi.  Since arriving at UCSF, I have been awarded both Terry Fox Foundation and Canadian Institutes of Health postdoctoral fellowships for work that explored how nuclear hormone receptors promote organ development and innate immunity in C. elegans. Two nuclear hormone receptors (NHR-23 and NHR-25) are key regulators of C. elegans molting, and I will investigate the roles of these transcription factors in the molting network. Hee I propose to: i) define the components of the C. elegans molting network; ii) define functional modules in the C. elegans molt, tissues of action and spatial regulation; and iii) extend my C. elegans findings into the human parasite, B. malayi. These aims will be achieved through a combination of ChIP-seq, proteomics, data mining, quantitative genetic analysis, genome editing, and standard C. elegans techniques. Combining the focused genetic approach with an unbiased systems approach will deliver genes/proteins that change during the molt, identify direct and indirect targets of NHR-23 and NHR-25, and determine the factors involved in temporal and spatial regulation of select groups of molting genes. In the long-term, I will investigate the mechanisms of transcriptional coordination in an intact animal.  To achieve these aims, I will acquire new training from my co-mentors Dr. Keith Yamamoto (ChIP-seq) and Dr. Nevan Krogan (bioinformatics analysis/ programming, mass spectrometry, quantitative genetic analysis), and from my Advisory Group members Dr. Alison Frand (molting physiology) and Dr. Judy Sakanari (B. malayi culture/physiology). My rigorous career plan, and outstanding and comprehensive mentoring team will put me in a strong position to secure an independent position in a U.S. academic institution. The renowned community spirit of UCSF combined with its rich technical, scientific, and professional development resources will provide an ideal incubator for me to develop this project and prepare for independence. A K99/R00 grant will allow me to build on my expertise in C. elegans nuclear hormone receptors and gene expression, using both unbiased systems approaches and focused genetics/cell biology, to study developmental gene regulatory networks in the context of an entire animal. This work will provide insight into the structure and evolution of transcriptional networks, and extension of this knowledge to B. malayi will pave the way for investigations into molting as an intervention point in treating parasitic nematodes, which burden 2.9 billion people globally."
"9177700","DESCRIPTION:      Background: Traumatic brain injury has been referred to as the signature injury of the Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) wars. Over 25,000 soldiers were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in 2012 alone. Not only do soldiers have blast-related mTBI, estimates of comorbid Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), range from 11% to 50%. Since neural mechanisms affected by mTBI and PTSD often are overlapping, it is suggested that mTBI and PTSD may have an additive effect on symptoms. Indeed, an estimated 44-50% of soldiers with mTBI/PTSD remain symptomatic after one-year, compared to an estimated 10% in sports related concussion. Both mTBI and PTSD are associated with deficits in executive functioning. Additional factors that accompany mTBI in combat Veterans are depression and sleep deficits. Consequently, the combination of all these factors, impact executive functions and result in combat Veterans who are struggling to live productive lives. An effective treatment of executive function is needed for  Veterans diagnosed with mTBI. Goal Management Training (GMT) is a metacognitive intervention that has been validated in TBI. However, limitations in GMT studies raise questions regarding effectiveness of GMT in mTBI. Based on preliminary data, GMT improved significantly on a problem solving measure in Veterans with blast-related mTBI, but lacked transfer to everyday activities. Therefore, we developed a Smartphone application to enhance the transfer of GMT skills to everyday tasks. The purpose: of this randomized study is to determine the effect of an innovative treatment for executive functions, enhanced with Smartphone technology, in Veterans with multiple blast related mTBI. In addition to determining the overall benefit of GMT, the study will investigate the influence of comorbid factors, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, sleep disorders and cognitive capacity. Method: Veterans diagnosed with repeat blast-related mTBI and executive function deficit will be recruited from two sites (Tampa and North Florida/South Georgia) by Speech Services. Veterans will be randomized to GMT (38 participants) or to a control treatment called Brain Health Workshop (BHW) (16 participants).The Tower of London, a measure of planning and problem solving will be used to determine response to treatment. Primary analysis will use two sample t-test to compare group A (intervention) and group B (control) on improvements in time to completion on the TOL. In addition, as an exploratory analysis, we will perform a regression analysis that includes treatment group, PTSD severity and their interaction as independent variables, to adjust for PTSD severity measured by Clinician Administered PTSD Scale and to investigate whether there is interaction between treatment group and PTSD severity. Additional, exploratory tertiary analysis using paired t-tests will determine whether treatment effect generalizes to executive function performance in everyday activities (BRIEF-A) or engagement in community participation (CRIS). To test the second specific aim, a general linear regression will be used to determine whether factors such as PTSD, sleep, depression or cognitive capacity is associated with response to treatment. Results: If the results support the hypothesis that GMT will improve executive functions than this cognitive intervention can be adapted to a tele-health method of delivery and tested in a larger clinical trial. Moreover, the influence of the four factors on response to treatment, can guide future studies to determine which patients are likely to benefit from GMT."
"9188909","Cerebral malaria (CM) is defined as an otherwise unexplained coma in a patient with Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia. The condition is common, primarily affects African children less than five years old, and has a large public health impact in endemic areas. Most of the 675,000 malaria deaths each year are from CM; the case fatality rate is 15%, and 30% of survivors have neurological abnormalities at the time of hospital discharge. The mainstay of treatment is intravenous antimalarial drugs and supportive care. No adjunctive therapy has previously been proven effective in decreasing the high rates of mortality and morbidity in this condition. Our long-term goal is to establish feasible therapies that decrease death and disability rates in this vulnerable population. We recently determined that severely increased brain volume in children with CM is strongly associated with death. In survivors, however, brain volumes diminished quickly, without specific treatment. Recognizing that increased brain volume is now a specific therapeutic target, we will perform a randomized, non-blinded controlled clinical trial of two adjunctive therapies: hypertonic saline or early intubation with mechanical ventilation. The first addresses a likely cause of increased brain volume (cytotoxic edema) and the second addresses the likely cause of death (respiratory arrest). We will randomize Malawian children with CM and severely increased brain volumes on screening brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to one of three study arms: usual treatment (elevation of the head of the bed by 30 degrees, antimalarial drugs, and supportive care); usual treatment plus intravenous hypertonic saline; or usual treatment plus early intubation and mechanical ventilation. Our primary outcome will be failure of the first treatment to which the child is assigned or death, whichever comes first. Secondary outcomes include neurological disabilities at hospital discharge and thereafter. We hypothesize that subjects randomized to one or both of our intervention arms will show significantly decreased mortality without a rise in neurological morbidity, compared to those randomized to usual treatment. Simultaneously with our clinical trial, we will evaluate candidate biomarkers of increased brain volume in children with CM. If a biomarker shows internal validity for identifying children with CM with high brain volumes, this will facilitate uptake of our study results into African hospitals where MRI is unavailable. In summary, the proposed research is significant because the therapies used in our intervention arms target an important risk factor for death in children with CM. Should either of the proposed interventions prove to be efficacious, it will be the first time an adjunctive therapy has been shown to decrease death and/or disability rates in these children. With widespread adoption of a favorable intervention into other centers, the public health impact of this devastating neurological infection may finally fall."
"9191375","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to understand the mechanism by which arteriovenous malformation (AVM) forms and progresses. This will inform us about the fundamental process of vascular morphogenesis and, importantly, identify specific genes/pathways for which targeted therapies can be developed to improve the lives of patients affected by AVM and other vascular diseases. AVM (not to be confused with hemangioma) is present at birth and undergoes significant progression over time. The lesion enlarges, bleeds, ulcerates, and causes pain and deformity. Vital structures can be threatened and congestive heart failure may occur. Currently, there is no cure for AVM, and drug treatment does not exist. We hypothesize that AVM results from a somatic mosaic mutation because AVM occurs sporadically in the population, is not passed from an affected parent to his/her children, and re-grows following incomplete excision. Therefore, we aim to identify somatic mosaic mutations that cause AVM. We will do this by employing massively parallel sequencing and analysis strategies using the affected and unaffected tissues we have already obtained from patients with AVM. We will also identify the cell type(s) that drive the AVM process. We will do this by purifying endothelial cells, pericytes, progenitor cells, and stromal cells from freshly obtained human AVM tissue. Cells will undergo massively parallel sequencing to determine which cell type(s) are enriched for somatic mutations. Cells also will be used for downstream studies to compare the function of AVM mutant, AVM wild-type, and normal control cells in isolation as well as with co-culture. These experiments will be high impact when we succeed in identifying the somatic mutation responsible for AVM formation and growth. For the first time we would be able to pursue a targeted approach for treating this disease. For example, pathway specific topical, intralesional, and/or systemic pharmacologic agents could be developed to prevent AVM progression or recurrence. Also, discoveries into the cause of AVM will help us understand the mechanisms that underlie other pediatric vascular lesions and improve our ability to identify new pathways for either preventing vascular growth in other disorders (e.g., cancer) or promoting growth during tissue repair or engineering."
"9200918","MUC1 is overexpressed and hypoglycosylated on premalignant lesions such as adenomatous polyps, and its expression is significantly greater with higher degrees of dysplasia. MUC1 is functionally important in the maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Thus, induction of an immune response against MUC1 in the setting of premalignancy, such as in patients with adenomatous polyps, may protect from polyp recurrence as well as from progression to cancer.    This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled phase II trial designed to elicit immune responses to abnormal MUC1. There are 3 parts to this Phase II trial, but parts 2 and 3 are dependent on achieving the aims of part 1 (demonstration of an immune response to the vaccine). Although each part will provide salient independent data on MUC1 immunoprevention, but if the vaccine is not found to be immunogenic in part 1, then parts 2 and 3 will not be performed. Therefore, this statement of work only outlines the requirements for Part 1. If the aims of part 1 are achieved, a subsequent new statement of work will address parts 2 and 3."

"9317208","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reticular Dysgenesis (RD) is one of the most serious forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) because it affects both innate and adaptive immunity. The disease is characterized by arrested neutrophil maturation, profound lymphopenia, and sensorineural hearing loss. It is invariably fatal early in life unless immune reconstitution is achieved by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The simultaneous occurrence of severe neutropenia and lymphopenia is responsible for a high risk of death in infancy, and the predominance of bacterial and fungal infections supports neutropenia as the prevailing cause of death. RD is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial enzyme Adenylate Kinase 2 (AK2), however, how AK2 defects translate into disease pathology is largely unknown. Overall, transplant outcomes in RD are significantly worse compared to any other form of SCID, suggesting that the nature of the genetic defect may directly impact the poor prognosis. Therefore, elucidating the mechanistic basis of RD is critical in order to target the underlying problem and develop additional therapeutic options. Our prior work in induced pluripotent stem cell and zebrafish models of RD has shown that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell differentiation is compromised but can be rescued by treatment with antioxidant agents (Rissone, Weinacht et al., J Exp Med, 2015, in press). These data led to the hypothesis that AK2 defects impair mitochondrial metabolism and increase oxidative stress, and that antioxidant agents improve mitochondrial function and represent a targeted supportive therapy to treat the neutropenia and overall constitution of patients with RD. To test this hypothesis I will dissect th molecular mechanisms underlying RD and their responsiveness to antioxidants by defining mitochondrial metabolism, oxidative stress and antioxidant reserve in different iPSC-models of RD before and after treatment with antioxidants. To demonstrate that the in vitro findings can be translated to patients, I will develop a xenograft model of RD based on transplantation of AK2-deficient iPSC-derived respecified multipotent hematopoietic progenitors into NSG-mice, and examine how antioxidant treatment affects engraftment, differentiation potential and mitochondrial function. If my preliminary findings that antioxidants improve mitochondrial function are supported by the proposed research, the therapeutic potential of these agents could be exploited in a much wider range of diseases, in which mitochondrial pathology and oxidative stress are at play.

"9317272","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ongoing invasion of the Lyme disease bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), in the United States presents a significant public health risk as well a a unique opportunity to study the process of ongoing pathogen emergence. Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the USA and is rapidly emerging out of two disease foci in the Northeast and Midwest. Despite its epidemiological importance, knowledge of the source and trajectory of the current Bb invasion remains speculative, restricted to anecdotal case reports, and limited entomological surveys. It is critical to determine the origin and pathway of the current invasion to inform predictions about areas of further spread and improve disease control efforts. Phylogeographic approaches enable high-resolution study of epidemiologically important pathogens and include powerful methods for reconstructing the history of pathogen invasion and inferring epidemic origins, routes of invasion, and rates of spatial spread. Further, advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) has made the generation of whole genome sequences (WGS) at the population-level efficient and cost-effective for study of pathogen genomic variation on epidemic timescales. However, the power of NGS and recent advances in Bayesian phylogeography, have not yet been harnessed for population genomic study of Bb, nor to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of Bb emergence. This study seeks to reconstruct the invasion history of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), to better understand the ecological and environmental drivers of Bb emergence and to inform predictions about continued pathogen spread. The proposed research will (1) use novel hybrid capture methods to obtain WGS of Bb directly from field- collected tick samples and allows identification of genome wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that will be used to (2) reconstruct the history of Bb emergence across two spatial scales. The proposed research provides an important training opportunity in field study design, pathogen genomics, and phylogeographic analysis."

"9397644","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    While providing remarkable insights into disease pathogenesis, genetic studies of psoriasis (and other immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs) present several challenges. Thus, ~90% of IMID genetic signals do not appear to affect protein structure, mandating a search for genetic effects on gene regulation requiring study of disease-relevant cell types in physiologic context. Moreover, pathogenic cell types are often hard to access experimentally, and may be rare in diseased tissue. To address these challenges, we have developed several unique resources. We have completed a comparative GWAS of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and purely cutaneous psoriasis (PsC), and a GWAS of psoriasis in India is nearing completion. We have generated RNA-seq based transcriptomes of normal vs. psoriatic skin, revealing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), critical transcriptional networks, and novel lncRNAs. We have developed advanced data-mining tools for elucidating the nature of non-coding genetic variation. Finally, we have extensive capabilities to study psoriasis biology in lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DC), and keratinocytes (KC). We hypothesize that specific alterations in chromatin structure and gene regulation in skin-homing T-cells and myeloid DC (mDC) underlie the effects of psoriasis-associated genetic variants. In pursuit of this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. To increase the power and resolution of psoriasis GWAS. This will be accomplished by (a) meta-analysis of European-origin datasets; (b) completing a GWAS in 2,500 psoriasis cases and 2,500 controls of South Asian origin; and (c) trans-ethnic meta-analysis of European, South Asian, and Chinese samples. 2. To define eQTLs in psoriasis-relevant immunocytes. This will involve (a) mining existing gene variation and expression data from GTEx and ImmVar; (b) performing genotyping and imputation on 75 PsC cases and 75 controls with skin RNA-seq data; (c) performing RNA-seq on blood-derived resting vs. stimulated mDC and skin-homing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from these individuals; and (d) performing eQTL analysis. 3. To define chromatin-QTLs in psoriasis-relevant immunocytes. This will be accomplished by (a) mining relevant existing chromatin data from GTEx, ENCODE and the Roadmap Epigenomics Project; (b) using ATAC-seq to generate chromatin structural data and transcription factor (TF) binding footprints for resting vs. stimulated mDC and skin-homing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from the same 75 PsC cases and 75 controls from Aim 2; and (c) performing chromatin-QTL (chrQTL) analysis using data from Aims 2a and 3. 4. To relate psoriasis GWAS signals to psoriasis-relevant eQTLs and chrQTLs. This will be done by (a) integrating association signals from Aim 1, eQTLs from Aim 2, and chrQTLs and TF footprints from Aim 3; (b) further prioritizing these signals based on psoriasis immunobiology; and (c) testing the strongest candidate variants via genetic manipulation. These experiments will generate an unprecedented genetic/epigenetic resource that will help us understand the pathophysiology of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases."
"9185235","?     DESCRIPTION:      Dementia affects over 7% of veterans age 65 and above seeking care through the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA), amounting to one out of every eleven veterans in some VISNs. The unique functional and behavioral impairments associated with Alzheimer's or a related dementia (ADRD) contribute substantially to psychological and physical morbidity of family caregivers and high rates of nursing home placement, with 60% of ADRD caregivers rating the emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high, and over one third reporting depressive symptoms. Although numerous evidence-based interventions have been developed to reduce caregiver burden and improve mental health and functional outcomes of the person with dementia, a recent systematic review noted almost none of these interventions make it off of the shelf to be readily available in clinical settings.           Care Consultation (CC) has emerged as a rare exception. CC is an evidence-based telephone intervention delivering psychoeducation, care coordination, and resource referrals in diverse areas such as safety and mental and behavioral health support. Yet CC's focus on coaching and support is inadequate for dyads experiencing high levels of distress. A stepped- intervention approach would address the VA's efficiency needs while allowing the flexibility for more resource-intensive additional counseling beyond the established CC framework when warranted by high dyad distress. This CDA-2 proposal would move such a dyadic intervention forward. Objectives: 1) Manualize the integration of care consultation and counseling components (i.e., the CC+C intervention). CC+C is guided by a rehabilitation recovery-based conceptual model to address the most common high distress targets (e.g., relationship distress, veteran or caregiver depression, anxiety, or pain) using patient-centered approaches. 2) Evaluate preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of the CC+C Intervention in a randomized controlled pilot study of distressed dyads to compare: a) the established CC intervention, to b) the CC+C intervention on veteran and caregiver outcomes. 3) Conduct exploratory analyses of the CC+C intervention on veteran long-term care placement at six and 12 months and examine two key treatment moderators (behavioral symptoms and spousal relationship status) that may impact intervention engagement and response to treatment.           Methods: Ten modules combining successful elements from existing manualized therapies and exercises developed by the investigative team during the CDA-1 period will be integrated with CC into a draft CC+C intervention manual. The manual will be finalized with input from the mentoring team and an Expert Advisory Panel for completeness, feasibility, and safety and risk considerations. Next 68 distressed veterans with dementia and their family caregivers will be recruited and randomized to either the CC+C intervention group or the CC comparison group. Patient, caregiver, and relationship outcomes (e.g., burden, depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, relationship distress) will be measured at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Treatment implementation and feasibility data will be collected. Anticipated Impacts: The goal of this career development proposal is to acquire the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to successfully compete for an RR&D Merit Review Award evaluating a randomized controlled trial powered to establish efficacy and test effectiveness of the CC+C intervention. Rehabilitation- focused interventions that maximize functioning are essential for successful non-institutional VA dementia care in the future. Work completed during the CDA-2 period will serve as a foundation for a career committed to this goal. The impact of this work will be realized when an efficacious and highly-accessible rehabilitation intervention, such as the telephone-based dyadic intervention being piloted, becomes available for aging veterans and their families."
"9187854","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) interactions with the cellular microenvironment or niche provide adhesion based signaling, which is necessary for the maintenance of HSPC proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Despite the clinical successes from using HSPC transplantation for the treatment of blood cancers, the mechanisms that regulate HSPC interactions with their microenvironment remain largely unknown. As such, it is critical that we identify the mechanisms and molecules that regulate HSPC adhesion to the microenvironment to provide clinical targets to enhance HSPC transplantation therapies. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which CD82 regulates integrin-mediated HSPC adhesion by modulating integrin clustering and activation. We will test the hypothesis that CD82 regulates HSPC adhesion and homing by modulating integrin clustering and activation. In Specific Aim 1, I will use Western blot and flow cytometry analyses to quantify ?1 activation levels in response to ligand to address how CD82 expression and specific CD82 mutations regulate ?1 activation. Furthermore, I will use super-resolution imaging (SRI) to resolve the membrane protein organization of total and activated ?1 integrins. For Specific Aim 2, I will use mutant CD82 and primary human CD34+ cells in adoptive transfer experiments to assess how CD82 regulates the homing and niche localization of HSPCs. Additionally, I will use SRI to quantify the molecular organization of B1 and CD82 at the HSPC contact site with niche cells to identify how CD82 regulates integrin organization in response to the microenvironment. This proposal is significant because we expect to identify CD82 and its regulatory partners as molecular targets to enhance HSPC transplantation therapies. This proposal is innovative in that it combines cutting-edge imaging techniques with in vivo analyses to provide a multi-scale understanding of how tetraspanins regulate HSPC homing. Moreover, my study takes a unique approach by targeting an upstream regulator of integrins, CD82, for the control HSPC homing. As such, this proposal will provide insight into novel molecular regulators that can be targeted to enhance the adhesive properties of HSPCs prior to transplantation."

"9226205","Urgent Needs in Surveillance and Diagnostics. Zika  Firebird Biomolecular Sciences LLC Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory, the University of Florida  Steven A. Benner  Barry W. Alto ABSTRACT  The potential hazards of the Zika virus to both American citizenry and citizens of the world need no discussion. We are still learning the distribution and impact of the virus on human development in utero, as well as its distribution in patient saliva, sexual fluids, and urine. With several dozen cases in the US at the time of this writing, most obtained overseas, the extramural research programs of public health agencies are being asked to seek better public health surveillance technologies and immediate human diagnostics tools for Zika. For example, in Brazil, the immediate need is a test that to distinguish between dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in public clinics; at this time, this distinction is made based on interrogation of patients with respect to the timing of the appearance of various symptoms. The work proposed here will deliver those technologies and tools for Zika.  However, this work will provide more. Today, the NIAID, CDC, and other public health units responsible for managing infectious disease outbreaks move from disease to disease, with each new outbreak and news cycle. This is inefficient, at best. Efficient public health services in an age of emerg- ing diseases need a robust and reproducible technology platform that is sufficiently flexible to sur- vey for any emerging infectious diseases without crisis. The work proposed here offers such a platform as part of its ability to survey for Zika, and distinguish it from other arboviruses, based on reagent innovations drawn from the field of ?synthetic biology?, including artificially expanded genetic infor- mation systems (AEGIS), self-avoiding molecular recognition systems (SAMRS), biversal nucleotides, transliteration, and evolution-based arbovirus sequence analysis, in a collaboration between the Flor- ida Medical Entomology Laboratory (FMEL), which has live lab-infected mosquitoes with Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, and Firebird, a serial innovator in synthetic biology and diagnostics technology.  This R21 project will first add Zika to an already established kit that detects 22 other arboviruses, common and exotic.13 We will benchmark that expanded kit, delivering it to beta testers in FMEL, where multiplexed readout is done using a Luminex instrument. This independent testing guarantees scientific rigor, and will be done by Month 12. In Year 2, we will seek a simpler system, focusing the multiplex on geography-specific target sets, adding biversals to manage sequence evolution of the RNA viruses, replacing Luminex in 10x target assays by a readout based on a 4x4 micro array, and going as far as possible towards a 10x multiplex system that can assay ~ 10 mosquitoes in the field. Towards these ends, we will meet the following specific aims:  The outcome of this project will include new Zika science, as well as kits that will allow public health services to enjoy the advantages of these reagent innovations in managing the Zika outbreak, just as those advantages are now enjoyed in many products, including FDA-approved products, for human diagnostics."
"9231219","Project Summary The malaria parasite is one of the most deadly eukaryotic pathogens, causing over 400,000 deaths in 2014, 78% of which occurred in children less than 5 years old. Due to growing resistance to currently available medications, there is a pressing medical need for new drugs to prevent and treat malaria infection. An ideal antimalarial drug would target biochemical pathways that are absent in human. Such a drug would be expected to have excellent safety characteristics, especially for children and pregnant women, who represent the most susceptible populations. We have identified a compound 1a (MMV008138) that inhibits Plasmodium falciparum IspD (PfIspD), the third enzyme in the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway for isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis, and inhibits growth of the parasite in vitro (IC50 = 250  70 nM). Since isoprenoid precursors are essential for parasite survival, and since humans synthesize them by the mevalonate pathway, compounds like 1a could provide the basis for a new safe and effective therapeutic strategy for malaria. In the R21 phase of this proposal, we will obtain high resolution X-ray crystal structures of PfIspD, to locate the binding site of 1a on the enzyme, and to understand the structural determinants of PfIspD inhibition potency. In parallel, we will use two methods to search for new inhibitors of PfIspD. First, we will leverage our collection of P. falciparum growth inhibition data for 92 close analogs of 1a, to carry out atomic property field-based virtual ligand screening (VLS) of a library of 5 million publicly available compounds. Secondly, we also prepare new bisubstrate analog inhibitors of PfIspD by linking mimics of the two substrates of PfIspD, MEP and CTP. Compounds identified by VLS and bisubstrate analog inhibitors will be screened for inhibition of PfIspD and P. falciparum growth. In the R33 phase of the proposal, the X-ray crystal structures of PfIspD obtained will be used to optimize the antimalarial efficacy of 1a and the new compounds identified in the R21 phase. Compounds meeting minimum potency and selectivity thresholds will advance to ADME-Tox and pharmacokinetic studies (mouse). The best compounds emerging from these studies will be evaluated for in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of malaria. Efficacious compounds identified in this way will thus be well-positioned for further preclinical development."
"9191308","Project Summary Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is marked by aberrant distribution of lipid species, such as incompletely oxidized non-esterified fatty acids in skeletal muscle. However, the mechanism by which fatty acids reach the muscle, and in particular how they transverse across the endothelium barrier, is largely unknown. We have uncovered that the poorly-studied metabolite 3-hydroxyisobutyrate (3-HIB) plays a novel role in fatty acid uptake. Produced in the skeletal muscle as a product of valine catabolism, 3-HIB induces trans-endothelial fatty acid transport both in vitro and in vivo. Valine is a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), a class of molecules recently shown in a number of epidemiological studies to be implicated in insulin resistance. The discovery of 3-HIB?s role in fatty acid uptake opens a new avenue for exploring the connection between BCAA flux, lipid deposition, and insulin resistance. Moreover, fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs) have been shown to play a major role in fatty acid uptake in numerous tissues, and, intriguingly, knockdown of FATP3 and FATP4, the predominant FATPs in endothelial cells, abrogate 3-HIB mediated fatty acid uptake in these cells. Together, these observations lead to us to hypothesize that 3-HIB is a dominant paracrine modulator of trans-vascular FATP3/4- mediated fatty acid transport, and that excess BCAA catabolism and 3-HIB leads to inappropriate lipid accumulation and insulin resistance. We propose to examine the molecular nature of 3-HIB, FATP3 and FATP4, and discern how they work in concert to induce fatty acid transport across the endothelium. These questions will be addressed by various methods: a genome-wide, high-throughput screen to identify critical components of the pathway; cell culture experiments identifying the subcellular localization and the relevance of the acyl-CoA synthase activity of FATP3/4; and studies in newly generated genetic models of endothelial cell specific FATP3/4 knockout mice. Ultimately, we hope to use these investigations to validate these new targets for the prevention of lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues, and thus for therapeutic intervention for treating patients with T2DM."

The training program builds upon the candidate's background in methodological research in biostatistics and risk prediction modelling and is focused on learning lipidomics and advanced statistical techniques that are used in targeted, untargeted and network pathway analyses of metabolomics data. This application is supported by a team of established mentors and by a strong institutional commitment of a leading research hospital which is part of a network of Boston-area universities and institutions with abundant opportunities to learn about cutting edge medical research, and to build cross- disciplinary collaborations. The research goal of this proposal is to define lipid profiles that best predict the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and to characterize their metabolomic signatures. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are a causal biomarker in the development of atherosclerosis and CHD. Yet recent studies reported that there is residual lipid-related risk information beyond standard lipid biomarkers. Dr. Demler will extend the standard lipid panel and use additional lipid parameters such as non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and LDL particle concentration, among others. Of special interest are the individuals with discordant combinations of LDL-C and apoB (e.g. low LDL-C, but higher than expected apoB), a group that has substantially higher CHD risk than those with concordant combination of the two parameters even after controlling for LDL-C level and standard risk factors. First, in the Women's Health Study, Dr. Demler will find the most informative combinations of lipid parameters and discordant lipids that best predict CHD events. She will validate these findings in a more demographically diverse VITAL cohort. Second, Dr. Demler will characterize the metabolomic profiles of lipids and lipid combinations including discordant lipids associated with CHD in the VITAL metabolomic sub-study, using state-of-the-art statistical techniques in untargeted, and network metabolomic analyses. This project leverages the candidate's strong background in risk prediction and combines an outstanding research and training environment with already collected CHD outcomes, lipid measurements, and large-scale metabolomics data, providing a unique opportunity to the candidate to gain skills and experience necessary for her career as an independent researcher in statistical analysis of metabolomics/lipidomics data in cardiovascular diseases. The knowledge gained from this project will increase our understanding of specific metabolic mechanisms that govern the association between wide array of lipid measures and CHD by identifying their underlying metabolic dysregulation. Thus, it will address important public health issues and could provide insight into disease pathogenesis and potential development of therapeutic targets."
"9189612","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The etiology of myopia is still unclear, but it is believed to be a failure of the emmetropization mechanism, a mechanism that alters the eye's growth rate after birth to bring the image into focus on the retina. When the emmetropization process fails, and the eye grows too big, myopia occurs. The results of these experiments are fundamental to understanding how temporal changes in the visual environment interact with visual sensitivity, and how this affects eye growth, and will ultimately pave the way to the development of visual environments that prevent myopia development. The hypothesis is that eye growth depends on the relative cone contrast sensitivity of the long-, middle-, and short-wavelength sensitive cones (S-, M-, and L- cones)-and hence to the temporally sensitive, color and luminance contrast signals. Increased relative cone contrast sensitivity of the L- and M- cones, and/or the absence of contrast at short-wavelengths, and low temporal frequencies, would be expected to make the eye more myopic as the eye compensates preferentially for the focal plane of longer wavelengths. Specific Aims 1 and 2 aim to determine how relative cone sensitivity and temporal sensitivity affects emmetropization in the chick. Chicks will be binocularly exposed to white light modulated either in color, or luminance (Mean level 650 lux), with or without blue light. First, they will be exposed at a range of temporal frequencies (0, 0.2, 1, 5, 10 Hz) for three days. Then, chicks will be binocularly exposed to color and luminance modulated stimuli, of varying cone contrast ratios comparing either L- and M-cones, or S- and LM-cones, at three temporal frequencies (0.2, 2, 10 Hz) for three days. Measurements of the change in ocular components will be made be made with a non-contact ocular biometer (Lenstar LS 900) and Hartinger Refractometer. The analysis will compare the change in ocular components with frequency and illumination condition, and the weighting of the resultant luminance and color signals. Specific Aim 3 aims to determine if cone contrast sensitivity is related to myopia development in humans. Two types of test stimuli will be used: (A) A 3 cycle per degree, horizontal Gabor patch, in sine phase (2? standard deviation) modulated along four different directions in cone contrast space (B) a Gaussian Blob, with ?=2?. This blurred spot has a single contrast polarity, unlike the Gabor patches, and thus can be used to test increment (S+) and decrement (S-) stimuli separately. In addition to measuring simple detection thresholds, the S+ and S- thresholds will be re-measured in the presence of S-cone masking noise. Ninety seconds of adaptation to the gray background screen precedes each run of 100, 2-alternative forced choice trials. Data are fit by the Weibull psychometric function, with threshold determined as the contrast corresponding to 82% correct. Cone sensitivity will be described relative to an individual's sensitivity to luminance contrast."
"9216553","PROJECT SUMMARY Elevated plasma levels of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B (apoB), including low density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), are among the most important causal risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite major advances, the factors that regulate plasma levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins remain incompletely understood. Furthermore, elevated levels of apoB- containing lipoproteins, particularly TRL, are often associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is a major cause of end-stage liver disease but of which the pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Unbiased `genome-wide' human genetics studies have identified a genomic 8q24 locus near the gene TRIB1 significantly associated with all major lipid traits (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG), CVD, and liver enzymes, making TRIB1 of high interest for functional evaluation. In vivo overexpression and loss-of-function mouse studies have confirmed this association. Studies in mice with liver-specific deletion of Trib1 (Trib1_LSKO) have shown that hepatic Trib1 not only regulates plasma lipids in mice, but also hepatic de novo lipogenesis, the latter of which is accomplished via turnover of the transcription factor C/EBP?. Interestingly though, while Trib1_LSKO mice exhibit increased plasma lipids, this appears to be due to a C/EBP?-independent mechanism. Thus the underlying mechanism for hepatic Trib1 regulation of plasma lipids remains unclear. We present evidence suggesting that increased expression of Angptl8 due to the absence of Trib1 may lead to decreased hepatic clearance of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles. We propose to formally test this hypothesis and to identify the downstream effector of Trib1 responsible for the increased Angptl8 expression. Variants in the TRIB1 genomic locus are all significantly associated with CAD in humans, and while the effect of Trib1 on plasma lipid levels is clear, no study to date has tested its implications for atherosclerosis. Additionally, no role for extra-hepatic TRIB1 in atherogenesis has been investigated. Trib1 has been shown to regulate the polarization of macrophages, and thus, the combination of its roles in liver and extrahepatic tissues likely interplay in Trib1's overall contribution to risk for CAD. We will perform a deep phenotypic analysis of atherosclerosis in mice that lack extrahepatic Trib1 (with and without rescue of liver Trib1 expression). Finally, while our mouse ChIP-Seq data indicates a negative feedback loop between Trib1 and C/EBP?, (C/EBP? binds to downstream non-coding regions corresponding to the human GWAS signal), the functional sequence variation linking TRIB1 and lipoprotein metabolism has yet to be identified. We will identify the functional non-coding SNP underlying the TRIB1 GWAS signal though chromatin conformation capture, and we will validate these functional SNPs with reporter assays and in iPS-derived hepatocytes. In addition, through resequencing efforts, we have found multiple coding sequence variants in TRIB1 and have begun functional testing of them. The studies proposed here will increase our understanding of the novel roles TRIB1 plays in lipid metabolism, shed light on another novel regulator of lipid metabolism (ANGPTL8), and create genomics tools allowing for interrogation of human variation in the TRIB1 locus."

The Division comprises three intramural research branches Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, and Health Behavior, and its mission is to design and implement original research with the potential for high impact findings for public health and its special populations. Accumulating evidence from animal and human studies suggests that adverse intrauterine exposures may lead to permanent fetal adaptions in anatomy and physiology, which may be beneficial for short term fetal survival, but result in an altered long-term risk of disease later in life. Maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are exposures of particular interest given that a very high proportion of women (~25%) are obese when becoming pregnant. Moreover, hyperglycemia in pregnancy as exemplified in GDM has long been regarded as a teratogen which affects fetal structure, function, and development and has long-term adverse impacts on the offspring. Data from mechanistic studies indicates that fetal exposure to obesity and/or hyperglycemia may lead to long-term metabolic and vascular function alteration. Thus, investigators at the NICHD have designed and will implement a cohort study of offspring of an existing cohort of mothers using both retrospective and prospective data collection to evaluate impacts of GDM and obesity on the metabolic, vascular, and reproductive health of the offspring, their determinants and the underlying molecular mechanisms"

"9369389","The Division of Cancer Prevention and Control?s Board of Scientific Counselors approved the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial in January 1991. Contracts were awarded in September 1992. Ten Screening Centers (SCs), a Coordinating Center (CC), and a Laboratory (Lab) were competitively selected. Screening began upon OMB approval of study forms in November 1993. The NCI Executive Committee approved Special Studies to investigate research topics using questionnaire and biological data on October 8, 1996. In 2009, the NCI Director approved the continuation of follow-up of PLCO participants beyond the originally planned 13-year follow-up period.   As screening had now ended, the next phase of follow-up and associated data collection was thought to be more efficiently collected centrally by a new CDCC.  In March 2011, a new contract to the CDCC was awarded (contract number: HHSN261201100008C) to Westat for a period of 5 years to permit centralized follow-up of all PLCO participants who consented to continuation in the study as either active (transfer to CDCC for follow-up activities as previously done at SCs) or passive (remain as PLCO participant through linkages conducted only by the SCs).  (To date, a little less than $12,000,000 have been obligated to the contract.)  Before the site contracts ended, participants were mailed consent forms informing them of the new centralized follow-up and given three options: 1) consent for active follow-up by transferring all PII and future data collection efforts to the CDCC; 2) consent for passive follow-up by their screening centers including linkages to healthcare databases such as state tumor registries, National Death Index, and Medicaid and Medicare; or 3) withdraw from PLCO.  In this effort, nearly 20,000 participants or approximately 15% of the eligible PLCO participants at the time withdrew from the study completely, translating to a significant volume of data loss for this invaluable study.  This renewal must be re-awarded to the current CDCC contractor so that we can avoid further data loss; awarding this contract to any other contractor would require another consent process, yielding further data loss which would be detrimental to the PLCO study.  Extending follow-up of PLCO participants will add more important data to this rich scientific resource but only with as many eligible PLCO participants as possible.    For this task order, implementation of a new questionnaire and initiation of a new specimen collection will increase the value of the PLCO data and specimen resource by allowing new types of analyses for risk factors for cancer"

Background The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. NINDS intramural labs are headed by federal employees who work for the Institute, primarily located in Bethesda, MD. For more information on the NINDS Intramural program visit the website http://dir1.ninds.nih.gov/ninds/Home.aspx For extramural research, NINDS awards grants and cooperative agreements to outside academic institutions, small business concerns and other organizations all over the U.S. and world to fund promising basic, translational, and clinical research projects. Specifically, the NINDS Office of Translational Research (OTR) is committed to facilitate the translation of basic discoveries into the development of new therapeutic interventions through nonclinical development and early clinical investigation. Recently, OTR launched a modality specific program, the Cooperative Research to Enable and Advance Translational Enterprises for Biotechnology Products and Biologics (CREATE Bio). This new program is dedicated to support the discovery and development of biologics-based therapies - such as peptides, proteins, antibodies, oligonucleotides, gene therapies, and cell therapies. The program distinguishes between two tracks: a Discovery Track supporting lead optimization and a Development Track supporting IND-enabling studies that may include early-phase clinical trials. For more information about the CREATE Bio Program visit the website (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/translational_research/CREATE-Bio.htm). Since CREATE Bio projects are funded through a cooperative agreement award mechanism, a collaborative team is formed between the principal investigators (PI) group with NINDS program staff participation in guiding the project plan. The PI?s team performs all of the experiments while NINDS role is to establish performance milestones for each project to facilitate go/no-go decision making and then monitor research progress and achievement of project milestones. STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE The NINDS is seeking senior-level, industry-experienced discovery and development consultants with expertise in biotechnology products and biologics to assist NINDS program staff to vet and advance only the most promising therapeutic biologics through the development pipeline.

Background:  The NINDS Udall Centers program is a Congressionally authorized effort established in 1997 immediately following the passage of the Morris K. Udall Parkinson?s Disease Research Act (P.L. 105-78) into law. The NINDS currently funds 9 Udall Centers across the country, a central component of the NINDS portfolio in Parkinson?s disease research. The goal of this program is to fund multidisciplinary Centers of Excellence that can rapidly advance innovative research to improve understanding and treatment of Parkinson?s Disease (PD) and related disorders. Udall Centers perform state-of-the art basic, translational, and clinical research on PD. This includes the examination of underlying neurobiological and neuropathological mechanisms, identification and characterization of candidate and disease-associated genes, establishment of improved PD models, target identification and early testing of potential therapeutic strategies, and the exploration of novel avenues of clinical research.    Since the initiation of this program, the NINDS has convened annual meetings of the currently supported Udall Centers.  Meetings are planned by the Udall Center Coordinating Committee (UC3), consisting of the Udall Center Directors, NINDS leadership and staff, and two outside members from patient advocacy groups.  Recent meetings have emphasized collaborative planning based on emergent areas in the PD field (translational research, 2011) as well as on common areas of interest across the Centers (e.g. coordination of clinical cores, 2012; priorities for Parkinson?s disease research, 2013;  big data resources/data sharing, 2014 and collaborative approaches to emergent issues in Parkinson?s disease, 2015).     8.

Sociometrics was the contractor for this service. This Sociometrics archive now contains more than 150 studies. It has made extant data accessible, so that not all research projects addressing adolescent pregnancy prevention or interventions are needed to initiate costly data collection efforts. In order to select appropriate studies for the archive, ongoing federally funded and other research projects were evaluated as to their scientific quality, by a panel of experts in the area of teen pregnancy prevention research. Those studies that met the standards stated in the original OPA guidelines, as revised, were included in the archive. It is available for purchase in CD Rom format and by download from the web by Sociometrics with supporting documentation including the data collection instruments used in the original studies. The cost for purchasing this data covers the costs incurred by Sociometrics to duplicate the data. Over the intervening years, sufficient numbers of users of the data archives have been developed so that the ongoing maintenance of the holdings has become self-sustaining. In addition, the contractor started, with separate funding, a data archive on intervention programs and training in the use of selected intervention programs. This archive was named PASHA. NICHD contributed to the early development costs of PASHA through an interagency agreement. The CDC and OPA no longer contribute to the archiving, due to lack of funds. But the project remains funded by NICHD and is included in the follow-on award. The Data Archive on Adolescent Pregnancy and Pregnancy Prevention (DAAPPP) was established by the US Office of Population Affairs (OPA) in 1982 as the repository for the best social science data on the incidence, prevalence, antecedents and consequences of teenage pregnancy and family planning. In 1994, the scope of DAAPPP was expanded to include studies that focus more broadly on adolescent sexual health issues, thereby including studies examining behavioral factors related to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in addition to pregnancy. The resource is currently funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) under contract number N01-HD-4-3387. DAAPPP currently holds data from over 150 premiere studies (many of them longitudinal) on sexuality, health, and adolescence. Data sets were selected as being among the best in the field by a national panel of experts in adolescent fertility and sexual behavior."

"9339115","Many patients are unable to make medical decisions for themselves (Raymont V, et al 2004; Silveira MJ, et al 2010). Current clinical practice relies on shared decision-making between clinicians and surrogates to make treatment decisions for these patients. This decision-making process is meant to promote medical care that accords with the patients own preferences and values. However, empirical data suggest that this approach faces two significant challenges. First, surrogates and clinicians have trouble predicting which treatment course patients would have chosen. Second, surrogates often experience significant emotional distress as a result of making treatment decisions. To address these concerns it has been suggested that the shared decision-making process might be supplemented with a Patient Preference Predictor (PPP). A PPP would provide a prediction of which treatment a given patient would want based on the treatment preferences of similar patients in similar circumstances. Preliminary research suggests that incorporating a PPP into the shared decision-making process might help to improve the extent to which medical decisions reflect the preferences of decisionally incapacitated patients and alleviate some of the emotional burden felt by surrogates and clinicians. A survey of patients found that, if the use of the PPP would increase the predictive accuracy of the shared decision-making process, a majority of patients believe that incorporating it into the shared decision-making process would be beneficial (Rid et al, 2014). Based on these findings, the present study proposes to interview surrogates who have been involved in making decisions for an incapacitated patient to explore their perspectives on the PPP and how to incorporate it into medical decision-making."
"9339123","Previously, we demonstrated that by combining ferumoxytol (F) with protamine (P) and heparin (H) resulted in a self assembling nanocomplex that could be used to label cells. Transmission electron microscopy of HPF revealed that these nanocomplexes were spheroid shaped with the HP in center surrounded by F. Incubating stem cells and T-cells in HFP nanocomplexes in serum free media for 2 hours followed by complete media resulted in cell labeling. HPF labeling did not impair the cells viability, proliferative capacity, apoptotic rate, activation, phenotypic surface marker expression, or capacity to differentiate. MRI at 3T of HPF labeled BMSC implanted in the rat brain demonstrated the ability to detect 1000 cells with a 50% decrease in T2* in the rat brain compared to the surrounding parenchyma. Pre-clinical safety/toxicity studies of intracerebrally administrated HPF-labeled NSCs in mice were also performed, and demonstrated no significant clinical or behavioral changes, no neuronal or systemic toxicities, and no abnormal accumulation of iron in the liver or spleen. The HPF labeling technique has been scaled up, and the NIH Cell Processing Section cGMP facility was able to label BMSCs in biofactories with no changes in BMSC function or viability of the labeled cryopreserved cell product. The HPF method was also used to label genetically engineered neural stem cells (NSC) that express cytosine deaminase as part of an ongoing clinical trial to treat patients with recurrent glioblastoma.  The HPF labeled NSC are to be directly implanted deep into brain around the periphery of the surgical resection sight in order that they can migrate to areas of residual tumors or satellite metastasis.   MRI monitored the migration of the HPF labeled NSC in the brain over 30 days. Initial studies performed at City of Hope report that there was essential no adverse events following the implantation of labeled cells.   We have recently optimized the HPF labeling approach by changing the order that the three drugs are added to cells to FHP resulted in significant increase in the intracellular iron content in BMSC and NSC as compared to HPF labeled cells.  We also report on the physicochemical characteristics for optimizing the H, P, and F components in different ratios, and mixing sequences, producing NCs that varied in hydrodynamic size. NC size depended on the order in which drugs were mixed in media. Electron microscopy of HPF or FHP showed that F was located on the surface of spheroidal shaped HP complexes. Human stem cells incubated with FHP NCs resulted in a significantly greater iron concentration per cell compared to that found in HPF NCs with the same concentration of F. These results indicate that FHP could be useful for labeling stem cells in translational studies in the clinic."
"9339124","The pathology of traumatic brain injury in experimental models includes acute inflammatory reaction, blood brain barrier disruption, hemorrhage, demyelination, axonal transection and chronically with axonal neuronal loss and gliosis. Stem cell (SC) therapy is a potential treatment either as replacement therapy or via paracrine effect with release of growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines for TBI injury. Experimental studies in rodent models of TBI have been limited and usually a single dose of cells is administered within 24 to 72 hours after experimental injury. The optimal timing and dose of cell delivery to maximize functional recovery and transplantation survival during the acute inflammatory and edematous phase of damage is unknown. We evaluated the natural history of control cortical impact (CCI) to induce TBI in the rat brain by serial MRI, molecular biological and histological analysis. We reported that the efficacy of multiple intravenous or intracardiac administrations of rat mesenchymal stromal cells or human mesenchymal stromal cells in female rats after controlled cortical impact by in vivo MRI, neurobehavior, and histopathology evaluation. Neither intravenous nor intracardiac administration of mesenchymal stromal cells derived from either rats or humans improved MRI measures of lesion volume or neurobehavioral outcome compared to saline treatment. Few mesenchymal stromal cells (<0.0005% of injected dose) were found within 3 days of last dosage at the site of injury after either delivery route, with no mesenchymal stromal cells being detectable in brain at 30 or 56 days post-injury. These findings suggest that non-autologous mesenchymal stromal cells therapy via intravenous or intracardiac administration is not a promising treatment after focal contusion traumatic brain injury in this female rodent model. We reported on a longitudinal study in a mild TBI rat model based on MRI and correlated to histology over 2 months. We reported that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) axial diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) were sensitive to axonal integrity, whereas radial diffusivity showed significant correlation to the myelin compactness. We also observed that FA was correlated with astrogliosis in the gray matter, whereas mean diffusivity was correlated with increased cellularity and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) demonstrated a strong correlation with both axon and myelin integrity. We also were able to demonstrate that in rats with mild ventriculomegaly (MVM) demonstrated insignificant changes in FA, suggesting less axonal injury compared to normal rats following mild TBI.  The MVM animals had significant increase in MTR compared to normal rats following mild TBI. On histological examination, limited axonal injury with significant increase of microgliosis and astrogliosis in MVM brains compared with normal animals. MVM rats exhibited greater inflammation following TBI compared to normal rat brains.  These results indicated the importance of using MRI to screen for brain abnormalities in experimental animals used in TBI studies and that the variation observed in TBI studies may be due to the variability in response to induced trauma as a result of structural morphology."
"9340944","Two approaches have been used to address this issue.  (1) Healthy and HIV-infected patients receive up to 5 days of continuous infusions with 6,6-2H2-glucose, a nonradioactive, stable isotope of glucose that is safe to administer.  The deuterium is incorporated into DNA via metabolism of glucose to ribose and incorporation into nucleotides.  The rate of incorporation can be measured in subpopulations of cells to determine the rate of replication of those cells, and the rate of loss of the incorporated deuterium can be used to examine the turnover rate of the replicated cells.  (2) Administering bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU; 200 mg/m2), an analogue of thymidine, to HIV-infected patients. BrDU is incorporated into DNA and incorporation can be measured using an anti-BrDU monoclonal antibody.  By FACS analysis, both surface markers and BrDU can be measured.  Thus, FACS analysis can be used to directly measure subpopulations of cells that have replicated.  To date, approximately 110 patients have been enrolled in these studies.  Techniques for measuring incorporation have been developed and validated for both methods.  Studies with BrDU have identified two populations of proliferating cells, one with a rapid turnover, and the second with a slow turnover.  The size of the rapidly proliferating pool, but not the slowly proliferating pool, is directly related to the log viral load, suggesting that HIV drives cells to enter the rapidly proliferating pool.  Activated central memory cells are the primary population of cells that are proliferating for both CD4 and CD8 cells.  For CD4 cells, both CD4 (inverse) and viral load (direct) correlated with proliferation, while for CD8 cells only viral load (direct) correlated.  The BrdU studies have been terminated based on DSMB recommendations to no longer enroll patients, and completion of follow-up of the patients previously enrolled in the study.  Currently we have no ongoing in vivo labeling projects with deuterium labeling, but this labeling approach is available as an adjunct to other studies.  In vivo labeling studies provide information about lymphocyte kinetics that have relevance to better understanding HIV infection and other disease states."
"9340947","Cell and gene therapy products must be tested for sterility, stability, purity and potency. In addition, its important to test clinical cell therapy products for identity, consistency and comparability.  Testing cellular and gene therapies is challenging. These therapies are generally collected from a single person so the quantity of material available to test is limited. They are typically transfused immediately or shortly after they are produced so there is a very limited amount of time to complete the assays. Many of these therapies are complex cells that have multiple functions. The cell functions that are critical to the clinical effectiveness of these therapies are often not known. Traditionally, analytic assays such as flow cytometry, ELISA, ELISPOT and cell culture have been used to analyze cellular and gene therapies. While these assays have proven to be very useful, the number and types of factors that can be analyzed with these assays is limited.   We have been investigating the use of gene and micro RNA expression assays for the analysis of cellular therapies. These assays can require the use of only small quantities of cells and can be used to assess the expression of the entire transcriptome. We have been testing the ability of global gene and micro RNA expression profiling to determine the utility of these assays for assessing the stability, purity and potency of cellular therapies. We have shown that gene expression profiling can detect changes in stored cells and detect differences between peripheral blood leukocytes (T cells, B cells and monocytes) and hematopoietic stem cells. Gene expression profiling has also been able to detect differences between immature and mature dendritic cells (DCs) and has been useful for comparing mature DCs produced using different combinations of maturation agents. We will soon begin analyzing clinical DC products to compare gene expression with clinical outcome in order to identify biomarkers that might be useful of consistency, stability, identity and potency testing.  Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSCs) are being use to modulate the immune system and for a number of regenerative medicine applications including bone repair. BMSCs are a heterogeneous population of cells and a small number of BMSCs are skeletal stem cells which are important for regenerative medicine clinical applications. We have been investing BMSCs to determine markers that identify skeletal stem cells.  We are using single cell analysis and next generation DNA sequencing to identify markers for the skeletal stem cells.   Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells are being used to treat a number of hematologic malignancies, however,  clinical outcomes have varied among recipients of these therapies and some of this variability is likely due to variability, and hence, differences in potency among CAR T cell products.  We are using gene expression analysis, mRNA analysis, single cell analysis and next generation sequencing to identify factors associated with the clinical potency of these cells."

"9348205","Although the immunosuppressive drugs currently in use are effective in reducing the incidence of acute rejection after transplantation, they also put the patient at risk for life threatening infections and cancers. The long term administration of immunosuppressive agents results in an increase in both morbidity and mortality. In addition, the long term cost of these agents represents a financial burden.  Establishment of tolerance to a well-functioning transplant without nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs is a major goal of organ transplantation therapy. The induction of recipient (host) tolerance to the histocompatibility antigens of the organ donor could eliminate the need for long term administration of these nonspecific immunosuppressive drugs. This would have a major impact on the quality and quantity of life of patients with long term surviving organ grafts by reducing the immunologic and non-immunologic complications associated with long term immunosuppressive therapy.   Induction of immunotolerance in animal heart transplant models has for the most part involved donor-based tolerance. One well established model is injection of donor splenocytes plus a single injection of the T-cell supressing agents anti-rat lymphocyte serum or RIB 5/2. Adoptive transfer (altering the hosts immune system using lymphoid cells from another individual) of ex vivo generated alloantigen-specific regulatory T cells induces immunotolerance in a rat transplant model. This method has also been used in bone marrow transplantation and can be the basis for recipient-based immunotolerance induction. In heart transplantation, recipient-based immunotolerance induction is clinically more applicable than donor-based since donor genotype is rarely known prior to transplant. To date there is limited data on recipient-based immunotolerance induction in heart transplantation, but data exists from the bone marrow transplant literature.  In addition, although allograft tolerance has been achieved using a wide variety of donor-based immunologic interventions in laboratory animals, no reliable method of confirming tolerance following cardiac transplantation has been established. Standard of care in the field of solid organ transplantation remains initial treatment with triple immunosuppression followed by long term maintenance therapy with 1-3 immunosuppressive agents. One cannot withdraw drugs confidently even if the graft seems to be tolerant.   This study will apply high throughput expression profiling with the goal of studying donor and recipient-based immunotolerance induction protocols and identifying protein and gene changes that could serve as possible candidate biomarkers of tolerance. Identifying laboratory methods that will permit safe and precise confirmation of immune tolerance in the transplant patient has the potential to improve outcome substantially.  There have been 403 animals used since the protocol was approved in 2006. The protocol is divided into 2 parts: Part 1 (recipient-based tolerance); and Part 2 (donor-based tolerance). In Part 1 (recipient-based tolerance), Stage 1 we were able to successfully generate Th2.rapa cells from recipient BN rats.  In Part 1, Stage 2 these adoptively transferred ex vivo generated BN Th2 cells were tested in culture using flow and cytokine phenotype tests, and an optimal rapamycin dose has been determined.  In 2009, we completed studies in Part 1 Stage 3, which was designed to determine if Th2-shifted hosts (recipient-based tolerance) have reduced rejection.    In Part 2 (donor-base tolerance), Stage 1 (Induction donor-based tolerance) we have successfully learned the techniques to remove the spleen of the rat (DA) that will donate the heart in stage 2.  We have also successfully injected its processed splenocytes into the thymus of the rat (BN) that will receive the donor heart in stage 2.  In 2009, we completed studies in Part 2, Stage 2 which were designed to determine if donor-based tolerance induction reduces rejection.   In 2010, total RNA was prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used for high density oligonucleotide microarrays.  A manuscript was accepted and published in 2011 establishing the ability of host-type Th2. Rapa cell therapy given pre-transplant to shift post-transplant cytokines towards a Th2 phenotype and prolong allograft viability when used in combination with a short course of cyclosporine therapy.  In 2012 the protocol was closed; however, we continue to do further data processing and analysis of previously run studies and their stored samples."
"9348206","HUMAN SUBJECT RESEARCH   Rationale for Subject Selection The total number of subjects and different categories--gender, ethnicity, race, and age--continue to depend on the prevalence within the patient population availability at the Clinical Center. This protocol is a retrospective study with existing data; therefore, no new patients have been or will be recruited, and no additional imaging procedures will be performed.   Risk/Benefits Analysis There is no risk to these subjects because this protocol consists of reviewing radiologic studies that have already been obtained under another IRB protocol. The potential benefit to patients is that the improved diagnosis of infectious disease will lead to advanced and earlier detection of a pathogen, leading to more prompt and effective treatment. This study is not designed to provide any direct benefits to the subjects.   Consent and Documentation There is no consent form for this protocol since this study is analyzing retrospective data. Data is extracted from the CRIS, PACS, and RIS systems at an aggregate level, not at the study level. No documentation is or will be entered into the patient's medical record.   ANNUAL SUMMARY   The widespread prevalence and potential lethality of infectious diseases like tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, and abnormal airway enlargement pose potentially significant public health threats, and it raises the importance of needing prompt and specific diagnosis for these diseases worldwide.  Diagnostic imaging--CT, MRI, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, and/or radiographic images such as mammography in an unmasked form--can possibly play a significant role in early diagnosis and in characterizing severity that can lead to morbidity and mortality.   Since imaging of infectious diseases has historically been relatively nonspecific in identifying the precise pathogen, our hypothesis for this study continues to be defining imaging analysis techniques that will provide consistent qualitative visual analysis and consistent computer-aided quantitative analysis when evaluating infectious disease diagnostic studies. These new methods we are developing will soon determine if a specific methodology can increase the specificity of infectious disease imaging by using retrospective data in order to improve the prognostic value of radiology when assessing clinical severity and when enhancing the measurement of response to therapy.   Since the fall of 2011, our research team retrospectively reviewed a data base of thousands of radiologic imaging studies after patients were imaged for known infections. Many of these imaging studies were categorized, examined, and analyzed by the lab staff for the identification of specific visual and quantitative imaging features to improve the accuracy of infectious disease imaging, ultimately stepping closer to a more defined patient diagnosis. Our aims were to (1) statistically evaluate all data and compare all imaging findings associated with infectious diseases, and to (2) continue to develop software algorithms that will accurately detect, quantify, and characterize infectious diseases for all diagnostic imaging studies. Using state-of-the-art computerized techniques such as graph theory algorithms and deep convolutional neural networks, we are now able to automatically and accurately evaluate imaging patterns related to various diseases."
"9348210","Summary of studies using the transgenic rats: 1. Based on previous studies in the literature we had expected to find significant microglial activation in the brains of the HIV transgenic rats which would increase with age. In order to develop an imaging biomarker we decided to use 18F-DPA714 PET imaging at three different age groups: young, middle aged and old (3, 9 and 16 month-old). We compared Tg to age matched controls at each of those ages. We used the quinolinic acid animal model as a positive control.  Contrary to our expectations, we observed only slightly higher mean SUVc (SUV corrected for weight) values in the Tg rats compared to age-matched WT rats, which did not reach statistical significance in any region or age group. Similarly, immunofluorescent staining for Iba1 in the Tg rat brains at different ages showed no significant differences when compared to age matched controls. We further confirmed our findings by measuring cytokine levels in the brain lysates of Tg and age-matched controls and found them to be similar. 2. We further performed a detailed immunohistochemical evaluation of the Tg rat brains at different ages, and compared to age-matched WT rat brains.  The most significant finding in the Tg rat brains was progressive loss of GFAP staining, suggesting astrocytic dysfunction/damage, significantly worsening with age in the striatum and corpus callosum. Besides decreased conspicuity of the astrocytic cell bodies, there was definite loss/attenuation of astroctytic processes in the Tg rats. In comparison, the microglia appeared to be slightly activated early-on (1-3 months of age), but this decreased as the animals got older.   3. Despite the motor and behavioral deficits we saw in the Tg rat compared to WT rats, the longitudinal and cross-sectional differences by 18F-FDG -PET did not reach significance between the two cohorts.  These results were further confirmed by the lack of significant difference in glucose metabolism as measured by 14C-DG-autoradiography performed on the same animals after the last FDG imaging sessions. We observed however significantly decreased D2/3 receptors in the adult Tg rat brains compared to age-matched controls, in both the dorsal striatum (DS) and ventral striatum (VS), using 18F-fallypride PET imaging.  In younger animals, the decrease in D2/3 receptors was only significant in the DS, suggesting that there was a continuous trend of neurological/dopaminergic damage that worsens with age.  The combination of decreased TH that we saw on immunofluorescence (early step in dopamine synthesis) and decreased post synaptic receptor density (D2/3) seen on PET supports the notion of dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction/loss in this animal model. We concluded that 18F-fallypride can detect dopaminergic system dysfunction in the Tg rats and may be a reasonable imaging biomarker to evaluate neuroprotective approaches. 4. We are now evaluating the role of oxidative stress in the neuropathology of the tg rat.    Summary of studies using the SIV infected monkeys: 1. We hypothesized that 11C-DASB binding will decrease in the acute phase of SIV infection (with respect to pre-inoculation scans) and will potentially reverse with ART treatment. We are using rhesus macaques infected with the neurovirulent SIV strain, SIVsm804E. We are performing PET imaging targeting SERT using 11C-DASB in monkeys before and after inoculation, in order to detect serotonergic system status under the effect of SIV infection. We found that the serotonin transporter (SERT) levels/expression increased in most animals (6 out of 7) who were infected with SIV when we compared the last time point imaging (11C-DASB PET) to the preinoculation scans. We are investigating a potential epigenetic effect of the virus on SERT expression at this point. 2. We are also investigating the evolution of neuroinflammatory changes in the SIV-infected monkeys using peripheral viremia and disease control (simulating optimally treated HIV+ patients) as covariants. Towards this goal, we are using 18F-DPA-714 as PET imaging biomarker of microglial activation (neuroinflammation), in vivo, in the SIV-infected monkeys. We are imaging pre-inoculation as well as post-inoculation, before and after treatment. Unlike what we expected, we did not find increased translocator protein expression using 18F-DPA714 PET imaging in the monkeys (5 out 5 showing decreased binding after inoculation rather than increased binding). We believe this correlates to the severity of CNS involvement as measured by CSF viral load. We are now continuing the imaging study after treatment and interruption of treatment."

"9352008","Early studies focused on septic shock pathophysiology (Am J Physiol 1988; Chest 1990), the role of endotoxemia (J Clin Invest 1989; J Exp Med 1989; Chest 1991; N Engl J Med 1993; Infect Immun 1996), and the efficacy of various anti-endotoxin therapies (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1989) including lipid A analogs (J Clin Invest 1987; Pharm Res 1990) and antibodies (JAMA 1993; J Infect Dis 1994).  Nitric oxide (NO) was examined as an important mediator of septic shock (Crit Care Med 1993; JAMA 1996). Non-selective NO synthase inhibitors were found to be sometimes toxic and never beneficial (J Exp Med 1992; Crit Care Med 1998; Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1998).  Increased NO production in normal volunteers challenged with endotoxin was blocked by ibuprofen, but blood pressure was unaffected, suggesting that other mechanisms compensated to maintain vasodilation (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 1999).  Severity of illness (risk of death) influenced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents in septic shock (Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2002).  The administration of L-arginine without or with N-acetylcysteine in a canine model of septic shock was found to be harmful (Crit Care Med 2006). L-arginine had been a component of immunonutrition formulas marketed for use in critically ill patients.  Our canine septic shock model was redeveloped to better balance animal welfare and scientific relevance. Both specific and supportive titrated therapies routinely used in septic patients were fully integrated into the model (Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 2007).  Whether risk of death altered the effects of hydrocortisone was investigated in a mouse model of E. coli pneumonia (Intensive Care Med 2008).  Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation was demonstrated to prolong survival in a hypodynamic canine model of Staphylococcus aureas pneumonia induced septic shock (Crit Care Med 2009). A low cardiac output is seen in 10 to 20 percent of adults and up to 50 percent of children with septic shock.  The U.S. Critical Illness and Injury Trials Group (USCIITG; http://www.usciitg.org/) was founded to create a clinical research framework that can reduce the barriers to investigation (Crit Care Med 2009).  A meta-analysis of bundled care for septic shock demonstrated consistent and significant improvement in survival and antibiotic use. Use of other bundle components changed heterogeneously across studies, indicating that their impact on survival uncertain (Crit Care Med 2010).  SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, improved cardiac function but worsened lung injury and survival during E. coli pneumonia in mice (J Trauma 2010).   Fluids and vasopressors, standard approaches to septic shock were harmful in a rat model of anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx)-induced shock (Crit Care Med 2009). In sedated canines receiving mechanical ventilation, edema toxin increased mortality when added to equimolar lethal toxin challenges (J Infect Dis 2010).  Heparin in a mouse model of E. coli pneumonia failed to improve lung injury or survival (Crit Care Med 2011).   Corticosteroid regimens that activate both mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) consistently reverse vasopressor-dependent hypotension in septic shock, but have variable effects on survival. In a canine model of S. aureus pneumonia-induced septic shock, MR and GR selective agonists were examined separately. Mineralocorticoid was only beneficial if given prophylactically, while glucocorticoid was most beneficial when given close to the onset of infection (Crit Care Med 2012). Stress dose corticosteroids were only beneficial in cases of sepsis with a high risk for death (Intensive Care Med 2012).  Tigecycline was found to be associated with increased mortality and non-cure rates. Effects were not isolated to type of infection or comparator antibiotic regimen, and the impact on survival remained significant when limited to trials of approved indications (Clin Infect Dis 2012).  Staphylococcal enterotoxin including B (SEB) can trigger a lethal super antigen-mediated cytokine storm. These exotoxins contribute to the high mortality of S. aureus sepsis and also pose a threat as potential bioweapons. Using an aerosolized-toxin, mouse model, gene-expression changes across multiple organs implicated a host-wide IFN-response in SEB-induced death (PLoS One 2014).  The pathophysiology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in sepsis has not been well characterized. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function was characterized serially over five days in 101 canines with severe Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. HPA axis unresponsiveness and high aldosterone levels identified a septic shock subpopulation with poor outcomes that may have the greatest potential to benefit from new therapies (Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 2014).   Infections caused by multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant gram-negative organisms are an important emerging threat to critically ill patients worldwide. Intravenous colistin administration identified a severely ill population with a high probability of having culture-confirmed extensively drug-resistant bacteria. Colistin-cases at 40 academic medical centers nearly trebled over 7 years (Clin Infect Dis 2015).  Meningoencephalitis was documented for the first time in a patient with Ebola virus disease at the NIH Clinical Center (Ann Intern Med 2016).  The Surfactant, Positive Pressure, and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial (SUPPORT) consent forms suggested that the low oxygen saturation arm was a widely practiced subset of usual care. An analysis of usual care practices demonstrated that oxygen targets and other interventions in the trial differed substantially from routine management outside of the trial (PLoS One 2016).  A survey of intensivists found that diagnosing sepsis is extremely subjective and variable, indicating the need for objective and standardized critieria (Critcal Care 2016).  A clinical surveillance definition based on concurrent vasopressors, blood cultures, and antibiotics accurately identified septic shock hospitalizations and suggested that the incidence of septic shock has risen and mortality rates have fallen, but less dramatically than estimated using ICD-9 codes (Chest 2016).  The impact of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) on survival in necrotizing fasciitis with vasopressor-dependent shock was investigated in a propensity-score matched cohort of patients from 130 US hospitals (submitted).  Difficult to Treat Resistance (DTR) was defined as the treatment-limiting, cumulative burden of resistance to all high-efficacy, low-toxicity antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, quinolones). A multicenter repository of hospitalized patients was examined to determine the prevalence of DTR gram-negative bloodstream infections and its impact on mortality (in preparation)."

"9353638","Overview: This research program addresses basic molecular and physiological processes of nociceptive (pain-sensing) transmission in the peripheral and central nervous systems and new ways to effectively control pain.  The molecular research is performed using animal and in vitro cell-based models. We concentrate on primary afferent pain-sensing neurons located in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) that send nerve fibers to skin and deep tissues and make connections within dorsal spinal cord, which is the first site of synaptic information processing for pain. The mechanisms of transduction of physical pain stimuli in DRG fibers are investigated through models of pathophysiological damage or using reductionist preparations such as primary DRG cultures or heterologous expression systems of ion channels or receptors. Our goals are (a) to understand the molecular and cell biological mechanisms of acute and chronic pain at the initial steps in the pain pathway, (b) to investigate mechanisms underlying human chronic pain disorders, (c) to explore neuronal plasticity and altered gene expression in persistent pain states, and (d) to use this knowledge to devise new treatments for pain.   New Treatments for Pain: We address the new treatment goal by a translational research and human clinical trials program aimed at developing new molecular interventions for severe pain. Studies with the TRPV1 agonist resiniferatoxin (RTX) have resulted in a Phase I clinical trial of RTX for pain treatment in patients with advanced cancer. RTX activates TRPV1, which is an inflammation- and heat-sensitive calcium/sodium ion channel that normally converts painful heat or acidic pH into nerve action potentials by opening the pore of the ion channel. The influx of ions depolarizes pain-sensing nerve endings and sends electrical signals to the spinal cord (which in turn sends the signals to the brain where we perceive pain). RTX is a potent capsaicin analog that props open the TRPV1 ion channel, causing calcium cytotoxicity. Depending on the route of administration this disables or deletes TRPV1 pain-sensing neurons, their nerve endings or axons (i.e., the nerve fiber). RTX produces very effective pain control in pre-clinical models. The central route involves administration into the cerebrospinal fluid around the spinal cord (intrathecal). We can also inject directly into sensory ganglia, both routes produce permanent effects because TRPV1-containing neurons or axons are killed. For cancer pain, after IRB approval of the clinical protocol and the Investigational New Drug application by the FDA, we treated several patients with severe pain from advanced cancer. Each patient is a unique case since the tumor presents and progresses differently in each one. Thus, multiple endpoints for determining efficacy are necessary. Peripheral routes of RTX administration include direct injection into skin, joints, nerve bundles, or topically onto the cornea. Analgesia by these routes can be long-lasting but temporary since nerve endings and axons regrow. We are also in the process of generating new protocols for post-herpetic neuralgia, localized cancer pain, and osteoarthritis (OA). The OA project is incentivized by observations of strong efficacy and long duration of action (4 to >12 months) upon RTX injection into knee joints of clien-owned dogs with OA. These results reinforce the objective of therapeutic use of vanilloid agonists for pain control and the translation to human patients.  Early Translational Investigations: A new approach to using TRPV1 as an analgesic target involves identification of small chemicals that act as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of TRPV1 activation. Our lab developed a high throughput calcium fluorescence assay for TRPV1 PAMs and we screened the Molecular Libraries small molecule collection at the NIH Chemical Genomics Center of NCATS.  We discovered several new chemical compounds that enhance the activation of TRPV1 upon orthosteric agonist (capsaicin) binding or by elevated H+ ions, consistent with positive modulation of the TRPV1 ion channel open state. Further medicinal chemical modifications of one lead compound identified an analog, DPM-32. This was tested in vivo for nerve terminal inactivation and was active (results published). These results represent the first in vivo observations of TRPV1 positive allosteric modulation. Further modification to increase metabolic stability yielded DPM-74. This was shown to enhance neuropeptide release from rat primary DRG cultures. In collaboration, we have also examined TRPV1 agonist activity of various polyunsaturated ethanolamines and fatty acids, which comprise one of the major classes of putative endovanilloids. These could function as the endogenous orthosteric agonist at TRPV1.  The present studies reveal the existence of a new class of pharmacological agents for pain modulation and pain control. Our investigations support the idea that TRPV1 agonist activity, induced in several different ways, has the potential to yield novel, non-narcotic, non-addictive, selective, long-lasting analgesic agents that may be effective in acute, persistent, or chronic pain disorders.  Basic Pain Mechanisms: Underlying the translational and clinical studies are investigations of molecular biology, neuronal function, behavior, and mechanisms of pain transduction. We are systematically investigating molecular alterations at the first three steps in the pain pathway beginning with injured peripheral tissue, the dorsal root ganglion and the dorsal (sensory) spinal cord. One goal of this approach is to obtain a comprehensive, quantitative molecular understanding of nociceptive processes related to inflammation and nerve injury. Our studies reveal a complex, dynamic modulation of gene expression and tissue cellular composition at all three steps. We have identified prominent roles for new, key molecules with distinct combinatorial patterns of expression among the three tissues. We are using a method called RNA-seq to sequence all of the mRNAs in a given tissue or cell population. This method is sensitive and quantitative. We also combine it with genetically or pharmacologically manipulated mice and rats to obtain specific cell population for sequencing. The results have proven to be both compelling and informative, and allow us to define the pain transducing genetic complement of specific sensory ganglion neuronal populations.  We also have used it to define genes involved in inherited peripheral neuropathies and pain channelopathies.  We now have a much better quantitative assessment of genes expressed in the multiple tissues of the nociceptive circuit, in the periphery and under pathophysiological conditions. Through this basic research we shall obtain a deeper understanding of mechanisms that trigger and sustain chronic pain."

The Division relies on its staff to represent the Institute on various trans-NIH and other collaborative workgroups and committees, to liaise with members of the Institute's federal advisory committees and boards, and to lead implementation of extramural policies and procedures for the NICHD.  The Division also performs grants management and scientific review functions, including conducting initial scientific merit review of grant applications and contract proposals for the NICHD. With a focus on scientific expertise, the DER also develops and supports extramural staff training while enhancing communication about standardized procedures, policies, methods, and approaches across the Institute.   There is a critical need in hastening our understanding of the placenta. Although the placenta is a short-lived organ, its importance is often underappreciated in being a crucial organ for the propagation of our species and future health of our progeny. The placenta is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy. The prominent function of the placenta is in the transfer of nutrients, gases and waste products between the mother and fetus. It is effectively the lung, gut, and kidney of the fetus. The placenta is also involved in the production of hormones that are involved in the maintenance of pregnancy and the initiation of labor. Another important function of the placenta is to act as a selective immunological barrier, so that the mother?s immune system does not attack the fetal allograft. Thus, perturbations in one of its many functions can have dire consequences for the fetus, ranging from intrauterine growth retardation to fetal death.  In contrast to many other research fields, there is a lack of any substantial internet based resources for hastening placental research. In the era of digital big data, enhanced internet tools for data centralization, cataloguing, integration and dissemination has resulted in a boon for all areas of science. Many entities have supported centralized internet resources, realizing the vast return on their investment. Examples of some large internet based resources supported by various NIH institutes include the NCBI databases, the Cancer Atlas and Brain Atlas. In contrast to many other research fields, there is a lack of any substantial internet based resources for hastening placental research.  The goal of the contract is to create a curated data set that will serve as a resource for placental research. It should be underscored that the solicitation is not to simply create a redundant resource of information, but rather to identify gaps in knowledge and explore and integrate the current foundation of knowledge that future pipelines of analysis would be built from.  This contract is the first step in an envisioned trajectory for reaching the ultimate goal of creating a comprehensive placental atlas that encompasses all the molecular regulatory pathways that drives both normal and abnormal placental development and function.  It is expected that the resource would be a particularly useful tool to identify research gaps, potential therapeutic targets for drug development, and potential biomarkers. The knowledge gained by completion of the atlas is anticipated to be invaluable for formulating effective molecular based interventions to improve pregnancy outcomes."
"9354071","Although the primary aim of diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal impairments is to restore functional three-dimensional (3D) movements, the majority of the quantitative diagnostic and evaluation tools available to the clinician have remained static and two dimensional. Thus, the current focus is to develop and ultimately validate a combined set of tools that will enable the accurate and precise measurement, analysis and visualization of 3D static and dynamic musculoskeletal anatomy (i.e., bone shape, skeletal kinematics, tendon and ligament strain, muscle force, and joint space). To accomplish this, the MR imaging and analysis capabilities already developed will be combined with highly accurate, imaging-based measurement and registration methodologies in order to non-invasively quantify complete joint anatomy and tissue dynamics during functional movements. Additionally, these tools will enable the quantification of 3D bone shape so that the effect that alterations joint and tissue dynamics have on bone shape can be quantified. Accomplishing the aims of the VFA initiative will fill an important knowledge gap that exists between the relationship of normal or impaired joint structure/function and the functional movement limitations associated with performing activities of daily living. In doing so, it will position the National Institutes of Health as an international leader in diagnostic evaluation of musculoskeletal impairments by advancing musculoskeletal diagnostic and evaluation tools from primarily static 2D tools to dynamic tools that can quantify 3D musculoskeletal function during dynamic tasks.  Due to the natural tiered structure of this research, two primary paths are currently being pursued, one based using the VFA project in its current state to evaluate both normative and impaired joint kinematics and the other is the continued development of the VFA tools so that full musculoskeletal kinetics can be evaluated. The latter will require the development of methodologies for creating 3D digital images of loaded and moving joint tissues (bone, cartilage, and connective tissues) to reveal joint contact patterns and tissue loads. As part of the kinematics branch, the variability of bone shape and the sensitivity of defined joint posture (translation and rotation of one bone relative to another) to osteo-based coordinate system will be quantified. We intend to use these capabilities to document and evaluate the function of normal and impaired joint structures (e.g., Cerebral Palsy, Ehlos Danof syndrome, and patellar tracking syndrome) under simulated conditions experienced during activities of daily living.   VFA Dynamic Tool Development Over the past year, we have maintained a research focus on developing the backbone for VFA and began to explore the issues surrounding the dynamic MR scanning of the musculoskeletal system. The key focal points for the algorithm development remained the image registration process along with continuing improvement in the integration algorithms. Fast-PC MRI provides 3D kinematics information for the bones of a joint (e.g., knee and ankle) as the subject brings this joint through a specified range of motion. Yet, this information cannot be readily applied to 3D models of the bones, which are created from static high-resolution scans of the joint. In order to apply the kinematics from the fast-PC MRI to the static models, the two image data sets have to be aligned (e.g., registered). Visualization is made possible by programs that have been written in-house using Matlabs scripting language. The development has now advanced to incorporate the evaluation of cartilage contact mechanics and much of the research focus is now concentrated in this area. A paper detailing the accuracy of this technique and a paper providing the first dynamic quantification of in vivo patellofemoral cartilage contact mechanics has been published.  Another focus of the tool development is to expand the imaging modalities that are included within the VFA toolbox. To this end, we are collaborating with George Mason University in order to develop ultrasound techniques that can accurately track muscle motion.  Lastly, through a collaboration with CIT and Eramacus (Netherlands), the VFA toolbox has been expanded to include automatic segmentation of the patellar and femoral bones from MR images.  In Vivo Normal and Impaired Knee Joint Function On the experimental side, a primary focus has been on evaluating the clinical applicability of the tools being developed by applying them to the study of knee joint function in children and adults diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome (n=100). The ultimate goal is to evaluate pre- and post-intervention joint function. We are in the process of analyzing the data acquired in order to quantify the various musculoskeletal parameters, such as joint kinematics, tendon strains, and tendon moment arms. Much of this analysis has been completed and presented to the scientific community by way of peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. As we complete the VFA toolbox, we should also be able to quantify forces in the quadriceps muscles, patellar tendon, the anterior cruciate ligament, and the cartilage during an extension/flexion cycle of the knee joint. The kinematics from these populations are being compared to our normative database. A major focus of this year has been on patellofemoral pain syndrome, knees that have experienced a single dislocation, and cerebral palsy.  In Vivo Hip Joint Function As part of Dr. Sheehan's work as a mentor for a K-award, a project evaluating the dynamics of the hip joint in both healthy controls and female subjects with hip pain has begun. The project is in its preliminary stages.  In Vivo Shoulder Function 3D static MRI has been collected for 15 children with unilateral obstetric brachial plexus palsy and 12 matched controls. The current goal is to evaluate muscle volume and bone shape in these children and correlate that to measures of shoulder kinematics and strength. To this end, we have published a paper on 3D humeral shape changes in children with OBPP and a paper on the shoulder muscle volumes in typically developing children. A paper in regards to the relationship between muscle atrophy and loss of strength in children with OBPP is in review. Finally, a paper in regards to the 3D gleno-humeral shape changes in children with OBPP is being prepared for submission. This project garnered the interest of outside clinicians and has promoted new collaborations, which will allow this project to continue to expand.  PF pain in Adolescent Females In this past year, much of our attention has focused on studying the potential etiologies of PF pain in adolescent females. PF pain is typically assumed to be an overuse issue in adolescents. Yet, we have demonstrated that patellar maltracking is a likely contributor to this pain. Interestingly, these maltracking patterns are unique from those seen in adults and they appear not to change as the adolescents mature into adulthood."

"9355429","Understanding of factors associated with recovery following allogeneic transplant can increase the likelihood that patients will ultimately return to a normal, productive life. Existing research regarding the recovery of adult survivors of allogeneic HSCT indicates that many patients experience difficulties in a variety of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) domains. A critical issue which has remained unexamined concerns the extent to which domains improve, remain static, or perhaps even deteriorates with the passage of time after allogeneic HSCT.   This prospective longitudinal study accrued research participants once they have survived a minimum of three years from date of transplant.  The protocol provides a mechanism to examine the health status and health outcomes of long term survivors ( 3 years following allogeneic HSCT). Patients were approached for participation during their annual transplant follow-up at the Clinical Center. Patients were evaluated at approximately yearly intervals beyond the first time point within 60 days of their annual transplant follow-up. This parallel with their medical care will allow for potential work in the future comparing biological and self-reported markers of recovery.  Questionnaires address topics such as HRQL, functional status, psychosocial adjustment, symptom distress, fatigue, spirituality and sleep quality.  The study has closed to enrollment and is currently undergoing data anlaysis. 227 HSCT survivors were screened and 173 enrolled.Results will be discussed with respect to their implications for both the encouragement of realistic expectations for recovery following allogeneic HSCT as well as the development of intervention."
"9355432","Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) generates multiple symptoms and problems that can vary in complexity. Although it seems evident that patients and caregivers experience clinically significant levels of psychological distress, few interventions studies have been explored to address this concern in this population.    Problem-solving is an essential skill for individuals to successfully cope. Increased problem-solving skill has been shown to decrease psychological distress and may improve symptom distress and health related quality of life (QOL). The COPE (Creativity, Optimism, Planning, and Expert Information) problem-solving education (PSE) intervention has demonstrated benefit and has been reported as a positive therapy by cancer patients and their families.   Based on the findings from our pilot study and recent published reports, this study is designed to determine preliminary efficacy of problem solving education by increasing self-efficacy in caregivers during allogeneic HSCT. In addition, this study explores factors associated with change in caregiver self-efficacy and distress such as demographics, clinical variables, mutuality, caregiver reaction, sleep quality, fatigue and health behaviors.    This is a phase two clinical trial applying a prospective repeated measure design. Subjects were accrued to this protocol if they agreed to participate in an allogeneic HSCT at the Clinical Center, NIH, are > 18 years old, able to read English and able to comprehend the investigational nature of the study. Patient volunteers must have at least one caregiver throughout the study period.   The study was closed to enrollment in November 2010; open for data anlysis only. 330 potential subjects were screened; 195 patient and careagiver volunteers were enrolled.   Each caregiver (and patient) was scheduled for three individualized PSE intervention sessions (study intervention) in addition to the usual care group education. Three surveys were administered to all study participants. The baseline questionnaires were administered twice; once prior to allogeneic HSCT and again directly before the first PSE, at the time of initial discharge from the hospital. The post-intervention questionnaires will be administered 6 weeks post discharge. There will be no long term follow-up after the intervention period. Questionnaires include: Distress Thermometer, Family Caregiving Inventory Mutuality Scale, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, Cancer Self-Efficacy scale, Brief Symptom Inventory, Caregiver Reaction Assessment, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form. In addition, the subjects participated in a semi-structured interview at the end of the study and the interventionist will complete a log that tracks subject attendance, session length, and discrepancy between planned and actual session date and time.

"9356763","Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of injury and death among adolescents. The Naturalistic Teenage Driving Study (NTDS), using objective measures ofrisky driving, found that novice teenage drivers have nearly four times the crash/near crash (CNC) rates and nearly five times higher rates of kinematic risky driving (KRD) (e.g., elevated gravitational force event rates) compared with adults (parents driving the same vehicles) (Simons Morton et al., 2015).  Previous funding supported the development of a large data base, The Uniform Naturalistic Driving Study (UNTDS), made up of several naturalistic  driving studies, including the NICHD-funded  Naturalistic Teenage Driving Study (NTDS) with 42 teenage and 54 adult participants and the Supervised Practice Driving Study (SPDS) with 90 teenage and 114 adult participants, and the Transportation  Research Board-funded  SHRP2 (Strategic Highway Research Program) study with 281 novice  16-17 years old, a sample of 200 young drivers  18- 20 years old, a sample of 200 young adult drivers 21-25 years old, and a sample of 200 adult drivers 35-55 years old.

"9357197","Most knowledge of the effects of prenatal exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) is based on atomic bomb survivors and animal studies data.  We are examining what effects CT exposure may have on the human embryo using hESC in culture as a model for studying the effects of IR on the hESC cellular biology.  hESC have been proposed for therapy in replacing damaged cells in organs such as the brain and heart in patients who, through various disease processes, sustained the loss of vital differentiated cells.  Numerous trials of stem cell therapy using hESC or induced pluripotent stem cells, are underway.  Yet, no one fully understands the effects of even diagnostic CT ionizing radiation exposure on these cells while they are delivered in vivo for therapies of such patients.  Thus, we examined hESC irradiated in situ in a tissue-equivalent, organ-torso, phantom using a commercial CT, at the diagnostic test settings routinely in use.  We asked if such exposures induced cell responses such as changed growth, gene expression, or possibly induced mutations in the genomes.  Finally, radiation safety concepts have been generally based upon the assumption that all of us, regardless of our unique genomes, are equally susceptible to the deterministic and stochastic effects of ionizing radiation, even at low doses.  However, we today know about multiple genetic mutations, such as the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations, which affect DNA repair processes to the extent that a percentage of individuals with these genetic changes have an increased risk of developing certain cancers.  When an individual has DNA repair deficiency, it stands to reason that exposure to any DNA-damaging levels of ionizing radiation is likely to be more detrimental than to an individual without such a deficiency.  By using the multiple hESC lines available to us in the NIH, each genetically distinct, we began to examine differences between the various hESC lines responses to relevant, low-dose, ionizing radiation exposures.  Using the increase in the hESC colony area as a surrogate measurement for cell proliferation, we assessed the effect of IR on seven lines of hESC.  The immediate effect of hESC exposure to IR is some cell death by apoptosis.  After an initial drop in the cell population, all lines show recovery of their growth after 24 to 48 hours.  We found that relative cell survival (RCS) varied for hESC lines.  The RCS of the most radiation sensitive H7 cell line was ca. 1.5 times less than that of the least sensitive WA24 cells.  Interestingly, we found strong direct correlation between RCS and cell population doubling times; meaning that faster growing hESC are more prone to some apoptotic cell death after exposure to IR than slower growing cell lines.  One possible explanation of this observation could be that the faster growing cell lines have higher percentage of cells in S phase.  That could reflect a higher sensitivity to IR of cells in S phase; perhaps they cannot effectively repair their damaged DNA during replication, and thus more cells die from apoptosis.  Results of our genomic mutation study of hESC suggest that exposure to a modest dose of IR (0.2Gy) did not result in any detectable increase in genetic alterations occurring within multiple cancer hotspot regions of the genome in four hESC lines.  Nonetheless, a higher dose of IR (1Gy), that led to much more cell death within 24 hours after exposure, resulted in one detectable gene sequence variation in one of the four hESC lines tested.  We believe that our first results support a need for further studies of genetic alterations in human cells caused by IR using next generation sequencing.  It should be possible for us to sequence increasingly larger portions of the hESCs genomes with progressively deeper coverage.  We plan to extend this particular work to whole-genome sequencing."

"9358834","Ovarian cancer is diagnosed in over 20,000 women in the United States each year. While it accounts only for about 3% of all cancers in women, it is the most lethal gynecologic cancer in this population. The five-year survival rate for women with ovarian cancer remains less than 50%, and it precipitously declines to less than 30% in those diagnosed at 65 years of age or older. The high mortality rate is due in part that there are no effective screening tests currently available, nor early symptoms of ovarian cancer, which prompt patients to seek medical attention. Consequently, the majority of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. While identifying a high-risk cohort and developing better screening strategies is key to early detection and improved survival outcomes, safe and effective preventive measures are also critically needed to further reduce ovarian cancer morbidity and mortality.       Risk factors for ovarian cancer include age (middle aged or older), a family history of ovarian cancer, low parity, endometriosis, obesity, a long-term use of estrogen for hormone replacement therapy, and the presence of certain genetic mutations. In particular, highly penetrant germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been linked to the increased risk of not only breast cancer but also ovarian cancer. Most ovarian cancers arising in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers are invasive epithelial cancers of serous histology. Emerging evidence points to the fallopian tube as the origin of high grade serous ovarian cancer.       One of the mouse models for ovarian cancer developed to date is a genetically engineered conditional Dicer-Pten double knockout (DKO) mouse model reported by Kim et al. The PI3K pathway activating mutations are frequently found in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Both PTEN and DICER are demonstrated to have frequent allelic loss in the human cancers, and the low DICER levels are often associated with advanced ovarian cancer and poor survival. The conditional DKO mice (Dicerflox/flox;Ptenflox/flox;Amhr2cre/+) developed by Kim et al. develop high-grade serous carcinomas that arise from the fallopian tube, recapitulating human HGSOC pathology.      Recent advances in immunotherapies for various cancers have indicated that the immune system can be harnessed to mount robust antitumor immune responses to tumor antigens, if tumor-derived immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment is effectively blocked by immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is highly plausible that the host immune system can be stimulated to generate antitumor immune responses against tumor-associated antigens over-expressed early in the tumorigenic process, where tumor-associated immunosuppressive mechanisms may have a significantly less impact on the host?s immune function than in advanced disease.       Mesothelin is physiologically expressed in normal mesothelium, but has been found to be overexpressed in various human cancers, including malignant mesothelioma and cancers of the ovary, pancreas, stomach and lung. It is a 40-kDa protein encoded by the MSLN gene as a C-terminal region of the 71-kDa precursor protein, which also consists of the megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF) on the N-terminus. Blood levels of mesothelin and MPF have been shown to be elevated in patients with mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. Although the functional role of mesothelin has yet to be fully elucidated, mesothelin does not seem to play an essential role in growth, development or reproduction, as mesothelin knockout (KO) mice (both males and females) produce offspring normally and have no detectable anatomical or histological abnormalities.       Scholler and her colleagues have previously shown through the PREVENT project that vaccination with a recombinant mesothelin protein adjuvanted with CDN/AddaVax elicited humoral and cellular immune responses, which were associated with protective effects against the development of syngeneic ID8 ovarian tumors in C57BL/6 mice.  Using the ID8 syngraft and conditional DKO mouse models described earlier, the current project will focus on further development and refinement of mesothelin based vaccine, including the identification of optimal antigenic epitopes and protective immunity, for the prevention of BRCA-driven ovarian cancer."
"9358880","The glycolytic enzyme alpha-enolase (ENO1) is a tumor-associated antigen and therapeutic target, known to be overexpressed in a variety of cancers compared to normal tissues. Upregulation of ENO1 at the mRNA and/or protein levels have been demonstrated in cancers of pancreas, breast, colon, gastric, prostate, head and neck, kidney, lung, ovary, and brain, with its higher expression generally associated with more advanced diseases and a shorter disease free interval. ENO1 catalyzes the reversible conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the glycolytic pathway in the cytoplasm, while on the cell surface it functions as a plasminogen receptor. In cancer cells, ENO1 is believed to facilitate aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) as well as plasminogen-dependent cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting cancer development and progression.       In the clinical setting, patients with pancreatic and other cancers have been shown to harbor autoantibodies against ENO1 protein. In breast and lung cancer patients, anti-ENO1 autoantibody levels were decreased in the advanced diseases, while higher antibody levels against Ser419-phosphorylated ENO1 have been associated with longer disease free survival in pancreatic cancer patients. In another study, detection of autoantibodies to glycolytic enzymes, including ENO1 protein, was shown to precede the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer by several months. Autoantibody reactivity declined as sampling got closer to the time of diagnosis. ENO1 has also been demonstrated to elicit CD4+ and CD8+ mediated T cell responses, which correlated with the production of anti-ENO1 IgG, indicating the integrated T and B cell responses against the tumor antigen. Despite the presence of autoantibodies against ENO1, cancer patients do not exhibit signs of autoimmune diseases, suggesting a certain level of down-modulation of immune response to self-antigens in normal tissues. These findings support the notion that boosting host immunity against ENO1 tumor antigen may be safely achieved without increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases, and that it may prevent the development of cancers.       To examine the feasibility and potential antitumor effects of ENO1 vaccination, Novelli et al. tested ENO1 DNA vaccine in two preclinical mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) driven by constitutively activated mutant Kras oncogene, Pdx1-Cre;KrasLSL.G12D/+ mice (KC mice) and Pdx1-Cre;KrasLSL.G12D/+;p53R172H/+ mice (KPC mice). In both models, where mutant Kras is activated prenatally, animals develop a spectrum of pre-invasive ductal lesions, which mirror human pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), shortly after birth. Human and mouse ENO1 are highly homologous with 95% amino acid sequence identity. Novelli and colleagues have shown that ENO1 DNA vaccine administered at 4 weeks of age followed by two booster shots given 3 weeks apart significantly delayed the development of PDA and improved the overall survival in the vaccinated animals as compared to control. ENO1 vaccination elicited anti-ENO1 antibodies that bound to the cell surface of syngeneic murine PDA cells and mediated complement dependent tumor cell killing. Higher levels of ENO1-specific Th1 and Th17 responses were demonstrated in the vaccinated mice, while the numbers of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg) were decreased in circulation and in tumor tissues. Importantly, there were no overt signs of autoimmune diseases in any of the vaccinated animals.       Safe and effective preventive measures are urgently needed to reduce cancer-associated morbidity and mortality, especially against highly aggressive cancers. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers in both men and women. Because pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, the survival rate is extremely poor. Known risk factors for pancreatic cancer include cigarette smoking, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, and family history of genetic syndromes associated with increased cancer risk, including BRCA2 gene mutation, Lynch syndrome, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome (caused by mutations in p16/CDKN2A), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Other forms of aggressive cancer include triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for 10-20% of invasive breast cancers. Risk factors for TNBC include race (African American), age (younger at diagnosis), and BRCA1 mutations. In summary, there are well-defined groups of individuals with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer or TNBC, who can be targeted for active screening and preventive intervention. The current project will examine the cancer preventive efficacy and immunogenicity of ENO1 DNA vaccine developed by Novelli et al. and determine immune correlates of protection, using genetically engineered mouse models of PDA and TNBC."

"9200958","Laboratory of Human Toxicology and Pharmacology (LHTP) - The Laboratory of Human Toxicology and Pharmacology (LHTP) provides technical and operational support for DCTD programs designed to increase the pace and accuracy of drug development in oncology and facilitate the entry of new chemical entities (NCEs) for cancer treatment into Phase 0 and I clinical trials. LHTP is an integrated, multi-disciplinary laboratory program that builds on the foundation of pharmacodynamics (PD) and toxicodynamics (TD) to predict the desirable and undesirable human drug effects that will likely be encountered during the clinical evaluation of both traditional cytotoxic as well as newer molecular target based small molecules and engineered therapeutic viruses. LHTP expertise in predictive human toxicology using in vitro models, pharmacodynamic assay development and clinical implementation, and preclinical drug formulation combine to humanize treatment regimens, therapeutic assessment, and interpretation of non-clinical models of cancer. The laboratory integrates this novel expertise to ?humanize? treatment and assessment of mouse models of human disease in order to validate pharmacodynamic assays for use as primary endpoints of Phase 0 trials, which are conducted under exploratory IND guidelines from the FDA to confirm that a NCE works in man as it has in the preclinical models. The integrated approach includes a route of administration, dosage form, dose level, and clinical sampling procedures (e.g., anesthesia, needle, or excisional biopsy) that are directly relevant to a Phase 0 clinical trial. The LHTP introduced the concept and practice of completely humanizing preclinical models of cancer therapy, which led to the use of clinical biopsy procedures in human xenograft and orthotopic tumor models to prove the clinical readiness of a PD assay. LHTP took the lead in ?reverse translational? research, to learn the clinical procedures of tissue collection and then transfer them to DTP/BTB. Comparing humanized and traditional preclinical study designs in cancer models over several years will yield the results required to determine whether this approach improves the correlation between nonclinical models and the clinic. The LHTP is organized into four specialized, but interrelated, sections that align with the technical support needs of DCTD: Pharmacodynamic Assay Development and Implementation (PADIS), Predictive Toxicology (PTS), Viral Vector Toxicology (VVTS), and Formulation Development (FDS). The laboratory director manages the overall scientific program of the LHTP and its coordination with DCTD operations, including coordinated interactions and assay transfers from LHTP to the National Clinical Target Validation Laboratory (NCTVL) operating at the NIH campus.  Pharmacodynamic Assay Development and Implementation Section (PADIS) -  Modern developmental therapeutic efforts for cancer utilize an understanding of signal transduction or differentiation pathways to identify new drug candidates that exert defined actions on the functional status of these targets. Some of these defined molecular effects will have therapeutic potential, leading to apoptosis, differentiation, or other desirable changes in the function of cancer cells. By coordinated use of the preclinical efficacy models of the Biological Testing Branch of DTP, it is possible to define the relationship between the extent of drug effect in the tumor and the level of drug exposure associated with these effects. Clinical confirmation of these preclinical findings would provide strong rationale for a full clinical development program, and the FDA recently authorized a new type of early clinical trial to explore microdoses of investigational agents prior to full dose finding and safety trials. This exploratory IND mechanism (x-IND) is relevant for multiple therapeutic classes, and is being used by the DCTD to conduct such confirmatory studies of molecular drug action on tumor target in a small number of patients prior to full clinical development (termed ?Phase 0 trials? at the NCI). Failure of a NCE to affect molecular target during the Phase 0 trial would provide a rationale to halt its development. The mission of PADIS is to provide expert technical support to this DCTD initiative by developing and validating laboratory assays that quantify a drug's effect on a molecular target in a tumor (and, if possible, in surrogate tissues as well), and can be readily implemented in the clinical setting. PADIS uses preclinical models to develop and validate pharmacodynamic (PD) assays and companion procedures for tissue acquisition that will be used in the clinical trial without change. A unique aspect of the PADIS approach is the constraints imposed on the development and validation of PD assays by the radiological, surgical, and anesthesia procedures and practices that will eventually be used clinically to obtain the tissue specimens for the PD assays. This is a technical area that has been underappreciated in the past, and PADIS works closely with BTB to integrate anticipated medical procedures into the preclinical models and develop clinically ready assays. When they can be established as accurate reporters of drug action in tumor, surrogate organ compartments (such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells or bone marrow or buccal keratinocytes) are useful for less invasive monitoring of drug effects than biopsies. As the final step in PD assay development and implementation, PADIS is responsible for cross-training the Bethesda-based NCTVL staff in the new assays and then coordinating with NCTVL to transfer the validated method to the clinical laboratory for deployment in the x-IND clinical trial. PADIS plays a key technical role in the developmental stages of clinical pharmacodynamic projects of the DCTD and its collaboration with the CCR in Phase 0 clinical trials. These stages can be summarized as: rapid development and validation of sensitive, SOP-driven methodologies to quantify the impact of drug treatment on molecular target(s) in tumors; identification of normal tissue that is a surrogate for tumor, if possible (PBMCs, skin, saliva, buccal mucosa, etc); development and validation of clinically-transferable, SOP-driven  procedures for tissue collection and processing that will provide evaluable specimens in the clinical setting; and oversee the transfer of validated PD assays to the NCTVL for deployment in clinical trials, and if necessary, contribute to assays of clinical specimens.  Predictive Toxicology Section (PTS) - The Predictive Toxicology Section (PTS) was established to facilitate the maturation and validation of assays that have been shown to predict human toxicity, and deploy them in concert with pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) programs in the DTP to facilitate development of NCEs more efficiently and accurately for potential advancement to clinical trials. Preclinical toxicology studies on potential cancer chemotherapeutic agents are generally conducted in two species of animals with the goals of defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), schedule dependency of toxicity, reversibility of adverse effects, and a safe clinical starting dose (SD). These animal studies do not always permit detailed evaluations of molecular toxicity, especially in relation to the expected mechanism in man and the role of off-target effects in mediating toxicity. Furthermore, the in vivo data sometimes show discrepancies between species that create uncertainty about human safety and result in low starting doses in early clinical trials. The PTS is tasked with the development of in vitro tissue, cellular, and molecular assays that use normal target tissues of drug toxicity and clinically relevant endpoints (e.g., in vitro ?transaminitis?) to evaluate potential human safety, predict tolerated human doses, and allow direct comparison of human and animal drug tolerance prior to clinical trials. This information can be used to include predicted human tolerated dose levels into studies by PADIS to validate PD assays at predicted clinical dose levels, increasing confidence that a target response to the drug will be detected clinically. The recent validation of in vitro bone marrow assays for neutropenia using rodent, canine, and human CFU-GM myeloid stem cells demonstrated the value of in vitro assays for predicting in vivo toxicities in animals and man. The PTS seeks to extend the application of the validated testing principles to other dose-limiting organ system toxicities, including pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac toxicities. In addition, PTS is tasked with assisting the Toxicology and Pharmacology Branch, DTP in its evaluation of newly developed in vitro toxicity tests under its grant program entitled ?Innovative Toxicology Models for Drug Evaluation? and the importing of promising assays into PTS for validation. The in vitro models of normal tissue response to adverse drug effects are expected to provide a simpler system than the in vivo models used for the discovery of off-target drug effects that can be circumvented via analoging and toxicodynamic markers of organ toxicity, which become candidates for valid assay development by PADIS and used by medical laboratories to monitor for early stages of drug toxicity prior to the development of symptoms. Newly developed in vitro assays are validated and then transferred to the VVTS for specialized applications in the assessment of human safety of engineered viral therapeutics (see below). These novel safety assessment tools can be deployed in the pre-IND or IND-directed setting.  Viral Vector Toxicology Section (VVTS) - The primary mission of the VVTS is to provide support for preclinical development of anticancer viral vectors. The research efforts are currently focused on the investigation of human toxicity potential of novel anticancer viral vectors by using humanized in vitro assay systems, and the evaluation of oncolytic activity and tumor selectivity of cancer-targeting viral vector agents. The VVTS explores the potential application of newly developed toxicity tests in PTS to the in vitro human safety assessment of engineered viral therapeutics. Additional areas of research include the assessment of the feasibility and efficacy of anticancer vector-combination therapy, consisting of viral vector agents and other cancer treatments of different modalities (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation); the elucidation of the molecular basis of tumor selection and oncolysis by candidate viral vectors; identification and establishment of tumor-specific biomarkers of viral agent-susceptible cancers, which can be adopted for future in vivo applications; and the development of optimal viral burden quantification assays to monitor the replication of viral vectors in targeted (tumor) and non-targeted (normal) tissue compartments in conjunction with in vivo safety and/or efficacy evaluations. During the reporting period, VVTS established a new in vitro assay system to evaluate the hepatotoxic potential of adenovirus-based anticancer vectors using primary human hepatocytes, characterized differential hepatotoxicity profiles of recombinant adenoviral vectors developed as therapeutic agents under the RAID program, and began collaboration with Biological Testing Branch (BTB), DTP, to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of oncolytic reovirus type 3 Dearing strain in a human melanoma xenograft model.  Formulation Development Section  Many NCEs that show promising anticancer characteristics exhibit very low aqueous solubility, which creates technical difficulties during in vitro and in vivo evaluations. The Formulation Development Section (FDS) is tasked with development of preclinical formulations of these NCEs suitable for intravenous injection and oral administration to mice and dogs and for testing in vitro in cell cultures. The FDS is developing a novel, moderate-throughput strategy comprised of an initial empirical screen, using 2?5 mg of each NCE, to test for solubility in a dozen proven vehicles representing diverse solubilizing mechanisms, which have been used clinically. Suitability of these candidate pre-formulations for injection is proven by continued solubility when challenged with physiological fluids. It is expected that 10?20% of poorly soluble NCEs will not be solubilized by conventional vehicles, and so the next step in the strategy is formulation testing of NCEs in novel pharmaceutical technology platforms, such as nanodispersions and emulsions, targeted nano-particles, and targeted carrier proteins. Although not all NCEs will have been formulatable by the end of the second step, this strategy is expected to achieve solubility and consistency requirements for in vitro studies of efficacy in the DTP screen and of in vitro human toxicity by PTS with a large majority of NCEs in the DTP pipeline. A large number of these formulated NCEs will also be suitable for intravenous and oral administration in animal models: BTB efficacy studies, BTB and TPB studies of PK and PD including validation of molecular PD assays by PADIS, and PTS assessment of toxicity via biomarkers (PTS) or clinical assessment. These preclinical formulations are intended to facilitate preclinical evaluation of developmental compounds, and are not necessarily the same as the formulated clinical product that may advance into clinical trials."
"9200959","The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) is the group in NCI that supports the discovery and development of novel therapeutics for treating cancer. These can be either low molecular weight compounds or biological entities such as antibodies or virus vectors. The low molecular weight compounds can be either novel synthetic compounds or purified natural products. The aim of the drug discovery efforts is to identify promising therapeutic strategies, especially associated with novel mechanisms of biological action. The aim of the development efforts is to get the most promising strategies ready for a clinical trial. An additional role for DTP is to provide the cancer research community with as much of the data generated by these activities as possible. This involves generating and documenting data sets and making them available via web pages. The DTP Computer Center (DTPCC) provides computer support, including operations, technical support services, and software development, to the DTP, DCTD, NCI. The DTPCC provides services for many aspects of the DTP's information systems requirements, including data acquisition within the laboratories, data transfer to the Oracle Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), analysis and statistical evaluation, and web publication of experimental results. Computer support is provided for many functions of the DTP, including identifying and scheduling compounds to test, preparing and handling the compounds, performing the experiments, and analyzing experimental results for activity.  The primary groups within the DTPCC are the Enterprise and Windows Server support groups, including support for Oracle, OpenVMS, Windows, HPUX and Linux-based servers; the Web Application Development Group, responsible for the creation and maintenance of program web pages and applications, as well as Java and Oracle development activities; the Legacy Applications Development Group, responsible for continued support and maintenance of core components of the existing DTP software infrastructure; the Workstation Support Group, responsible for end-user support of desktop applications; and the Target Structure based Drug Design Group (reported separately), providing expertise in rational drug design, protein modeling, and bioinformatics.  The DTPCC hosts several web sites for the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD).

This tool is known as PILOT(Pharmacophore Identification and Lead Organization Tool) as a web. This chemoinformatic tool searches for common pharmacophores within a user-specified set of molecules. This effort is the result of a collaboration with the Target-Structure Based Design Group.  The DTPCC also provides a Target-Structure Based Design Group (DPTCCTSBDDG). This group provides support to the Information Technology Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, in the area of molecular modeling, drug discovery, chemoinformatics, and software development. The majority of the work performed by this group consists of computational methods development and application to DTP-prioritized targets in collaboration with laboratories that are involved in the quantitative testing of lead compounds and the chemical synthesis of drug candidates. Cancer targets of interest include: multiple tubulin sites, CDK's, and recently, RSK protein and topoisomerases. The group has also been tasked with laboratory and computational support of the USAMRIID/NCI-DTP Joint Antibioterrorism Therapeutics Interagency Agreement (IAG). This project has focused on the development of therapeutics for certain Biothreat Level A and B agents that pose the greatest threat due to their infectiousness, relative ease of transmission, or high rate of mortality. Currently under investigation in the IAG are: Bacillus anthracis toxins, Botulinum neurotoxins, Ricinus communis or ?ricin? toxin, Staphylococcal enterotoxins, and Filoviridae targets (Ebola and Marburg). The IAG began in March of 2001 and all of the staffing, procurement, and subcontract management have been executed through the TSBDDG. All of the data and techniques developed through the IAG efforts have been important for not only generating therapeutics to counter biological weapons, but have also resulted in more effective and efficient molecular modeling services for cancer researchers requesting NCI support with regard to  drug design and development."

"9201001","The Biopharmaceutical Development Program (BDP) supports development, manufacturing, and testing of new concepts in cancer therapeutics based on biological agents and biological response modifiers. Located at the NCI-Frederick campus, the BDP uses leading-edge technologies for development of monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, immunotoxins and other recombinant proteins, peptide and DNA vaccines, virus vaccines and targeted cytolytic viruses, gene therapy products, and other biological agents. The BDP maintains Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP)-compliant facilities that provide complete support from evaluation of manufacturing feasibility through process development and clinical manufacturing with all required regulatory documentation for proof of concept clinical studies. BDP is a major component of the research grant and contract program of the Biological Resources Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, of the National Cancer Institute (BRB, DTP, DCTD, NCI).    During the 2008 Fiscal Year, the BDP released 22 manufacturing lots to support clinical trials or toxicological studies, and performed QC stability studies to support more than 40 other lots still in use. With a staff of 100 highly trained and experienced personnel, the BDP has undertaken over 100 projects since its inception, and over 60 of these have gone into clinical trials. BDP facilities are designed to be highly flexible, enabling work on multiple projects for a variety of different therapies. An innovative, dynamic program, the BDP mission is to concentrate on products that are in early development, beginning with demonstrating product feasibility, through to production of Phase I/II clinical supplies and complete testing.    In support of an NCI Immunotherapy Workshop initiative, BDP established a new cGMP manufacturing process for Interleukin-15. IL-15 from BDP is now in toxicological studies for the first clinical trial that is expected to start in FY09. In FY08, BDP also supported QC re-certification of Interleukin-12 that had been donated by the original manufacturer. IL-12 will be made available through a CTEP mechanism to qualified investigators for a number of new cancer immunotherapy and vaccine trials. Ad-CCL-21, another Immunotherapy agent manufactured by BDP, was shipped to two institutions for vaccine trials using chemokine gene-modified dendritic cells in advanced non-small lung cancer and malignant melanoma. In FY08, BDP released a clinical lot of Ad5-SSTR/TK.RGD a tropism modified adenovirus vector for an initial clinical trial in patients with ovarian cancer. Manufacturing and testing were completed for rRp450, a recombinant herpes virus, and an IND will be filed for treatment of patients with liver metastases. Ad-Delta-24-RGD is now in a clinical trial in patients with ovarian cancer and another trial in glioma. A second trial in glioma is in the process of regulatory filing. A BDP product that was released before FY08 is MR1-1, an immunotoxin that targets glioma. The first two patients were treated with MR1-1 during FY08. AdAFP and two plasmids targeting alpha-feto protein (AFP) entered a phase I clinical trial in hepatocellular carcinoma, and a second trial is pending at another institution. Ad5/3delta-24 was released and toxicological studies are underway for a Phase I clinical trial in ovarian cancer. During FY08, STAT3 decoy, an oligonucleotide targeting the STAT3 pathway of head and neck cancer entered a Phase?zero clinical trial. A previously released measles-based oncolytic virus, MV-NIS, that is already in a Phase I trial for multiple myeloma, entered a new Phase I clinical trial in ovarian cancer. The 11-1F4 project is an earlier RAID project for development of a chimeric antibody targeting amyloid deposits. In FY08, interesting imaging of amyloid deposits was achieved in initial patients entered on an imaging study using murine-11-1F4. The continued results in this study are being followed for leads in this challenging disease. Other BDP activities in FY08 supported development of many other new agents for clinical trials in patients with prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, glioma, cervical cancer, and lymphoma, among other cancer indications. Under the Economy in Government Act, BDP also performed reimbursed manufacturing activities for other institutes in support of clinical trials in Type I Diabetes and Malaria Vaccines. In these projects, BDP developed new expertise that will be directly applicable to projects coming into the BDP cancer ?pipeline.?    BDP saw some of its earlier products reaching FY08 clinical milestones beyond early Phase I/II studies. During FY08, BDP released several lots of HA-22, an immunotoxin in clinical trials in non-Hodgkins lymphoma. A commercial company has licensed this agent and will perform further manufacturing at their facilities. Hu14.18-IL2, a cytokine?antibody fusion protein that targets the GD-2 antigen on malignant melanoma and pediatric neuroblastoma is a ?legacy? BDP project for which multiple clinical lots have been manufactured. During FY08, Hu14.18-IL-2 entered combination clinical trials with an anti-angiogenesis agent, in melanoma patients with minimal residual disease. BDP is supporting technology transfer for further development at the commercial company holding the intellectual property. Another ?legacy? BDP project is a patient-specific Id vaccine for lymphoma that was licensed and taken over by a commercial company after BDP made over 100 patient-specific products for several early studies. In FY08, this vaccine completed a Phase III clinical trial in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the company announced plans to discuss results with FDA.    FDA requires testing to demonstrate product stability during the planned administration of many BDP agents, because biologicals can be susceptible to degradation over time in interactions with various fluids, even plastic intravenous tubing. In FY08, BDP performed an increasing number of point-of-use studies for a variety of products, including monoclonal antibodies and viruses. These studies require a number of tests to validate the accuracy of these critical assessments of product quality during administration. In addition, BDP QC staff are collaborating directly with FDA investigators to improve in vitro adventitious virus assays for oncolytic viruses, a challenging safety issue in this field.    In FY 08, BDP made its established systems and experienced personnel available to provide assistance to other academic and government programs. BDP hosted visitors from outside U.S. institutions, other government agencies, and foreign countries, providing training on establishing other programs similar to the BDP. In tours and training sessions of BDP manufacturing facilities, outside investigators were presented an overview of how BDP Quality Systems translate Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations into practice for a Phase I/II product. The BDP scientific staff members continued to be active within the extramural community, serving on academic faculties and advisory committees, and presenting scientific findings at national and international meetings."

"9208682","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality during the first four weeks of life world-wide. The overarching goal of this research is to enhance our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that mediate myometrial quiescence and contractility during pregnancy and labor, and their dysregulation leading to preterm birth. We suggest that progesterone (P4)/progesterone receptor (PR) maintains myometrial quiescence throughout most of pregnancy by inhibiting expression of inflammatory (e.g. IL-1b, IL-8, COX-2) and contractile (CAP) (e.g. OXTR, CX43) genes. We propose that this occurs via two basic mechanisms: (1) PR may tether to transcription factors (e.g. NF-kB, AP-1) bound to promoters of inflammatory genes and recruit corepressors to inhibit gene expression; (2) PR also may bind directly to promoters of genes encoding transcriptional repressors (e.g. ZEB1) to activate their expression. ZEB1, in turn, binds to promoters of CAP genes and recruits a repressive complex to inhibit their expression. By contrast, during the initiation of term and preterm labor, PR function in myometrium is impaired by its direct interaction with NF-kB, by increased expression of enzymes that metabolize P4 to inactive products, by decreased expression of PR coactivators and by upregulation of truncated PR isoforms (e.g. PR-A). The truncated PR isoforms may have reduced transcriptional and transrepressive activity. We postulate that these changes in inflammatory and CAP gene expression are mediated by alterations in chromatin modifications and structure. The goals of this proposal are to define the genes and mechanisms that underlie the inhibitory actions of P4/PR and differential actions of PR- A and PR-B on inflammatory and CAP gene expression, and to characterize the chromatin modifications that mediate myometrial quiescence and accompany enhanced CAP and inflammatory gene expression leading to term and preterm labor. To achieve these goals, we will use mouse models and human myometrial cells and tissues to: (1) define and characterize components of the complex of transcription factors/coregulators that interact with PR in the pregnant myometrium to mediate its anti-inflammatory actions and that interact with ZEB1 to inhibit CAP gene expression; (2) analyze expression and promoter-binding of these PR-interacting factors during pregnancy and with term and preterm labor and the effects of hormones and microRNAs in their regulation; (3) use RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to discover myometrial genes that are critical for the maintenance of pregnancy and initiation of labor and the underlying transcriptional mechanisms for their regulation. RNA-seq will enable discovery of genes involved in maintenance of pregnancy and the initiation of labor. The combined use of ChIP-seq will provide global insight into the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie these gene expression changes. Studies using PR-B-KO mice will elucidate the differential roles of PR-A vs. PR-B in regulation of the myometrial transcriptome. Collectively, our findings will reveal novel genes and pathways that can serve as therapeutic targets to prevent preterm birth and its consequences."

"9239351","PROJECT SUMMARY Various neuromuscular diseases result in impaired cough (dystussia). Disorders of these airway protective behaviors increase pulmonary infection due to aspiration, the leading cause of death in neuromuscular disease. Mortality rates of aspiration pneumonia - present in over half of long-term care residents - can approach 40%. Defense of the airway is achieved through coordination of multiple protective behaviors by brain circuits that remain incompletely understood. A contemporary data-driven computational model incorporating the brainstem network for breathing can rapidly reconfigure to produce the three phases a cough motor pattern: inspiration, compression, and expulsion. However, critical elements of airway protection cannot be explained. Based on motivating preliminary data and network simulations, we propose that a circuit in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and dorsal medulla regulates phase timing and respiratory muscle drive during paroxysmal coughs and exerts a command function over the brainstem respiratory control system to coordinate coughing and breathing. The project has 3 Specific Aims: (1) Determine dynamic behavior- dependent organization of NTS circuits during the expression of airway protective behaviors. (2) Determine functional connectivity between NTS and VRC neurons during expression of coughing. (3) Reconstruct our respiratory system model to incorporate regulation of both airway protective reflexes and breathing. Our unique approach, building upon experimental interrogation of the NTS region, incorporates multi-array recording technologies in an animal model system that generates defensive behaviors in response to physiologically relevant airway perturbations. We anticipate that the project will lead to: a) a new, predictive model of airway protection will be produced, b) we will understand functional relationships between conditionally active cells and t-E NTS neurons in producing cough, and c) we will identify critical NTS to parafacial/VRC functional relationships that regulate cough and breathing. This new knowledge will provide a critical step in understanding the neurogenesis of cough and how this behavior is controlled to protect the airway."

"9231109","Abstract  Individuals who are exposed to life-threatening trauma are at significant risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). People with PTSD experience extreme psychological distress by repeatedly reliving their trauma through intrusive flashback memories. These memories are accompanied by other symptoms, including emotional numbing, avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, and a persistent state of hypervigilance. In addition to the psychological manifestations, PTSD is also associated with enhanced progression of coronary atherosclerosis and an increased likelihood of experiencing a myocardial infarction. However, the impact of PTSD on the ischemic heart has not been well studied. Specifically, it is unclear whether PTSD induces myocardial changes that influence the extent of ischemia-induced injury. Such studies are difficult to conduct in human patients because PTSD is associated with increased rates of smoking, sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, depression, and other factors that influence cardiovascular function. Thus, our laboratory is using an animal model of PTSD to examine its impact on the myocardial response to ischemic injury. The model is advantageous because it permits the controlled induction of myocardial ischemia independent of atherosclerotic blockage of coronary arteries, and it avoids the confounding cardiovascular risk factors mentioned above. Our preliminary studies provide evidence that this animal model of PTSD induces changes in the heart that increase myocardial sensitivity to ischemic injury. Some of the physiological and behavioral alterations induced by this model can be reversed or prevented by drugs that are used to treat human PTSD patients. However, it is unknown whether these agents can reverse the increased myocardial sensitivity to ischemic injury that results from this exposure to this model. Therefore, Aim 1 of this study is to determine whether the psychosocial stress-induced increase in myocardial sensitivity to ischemic injury can be reversed or prevented by pharmacotherapy. Exposure to this rat model of PTSD increases cerebral and hippocampal production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increases signaling through the pro-inflammatory NF- ?B signaling pathway, and increases the production of reactive oxygen species. Inflammation and oxidative stress are important components of myocardial ischemic injury. However, it is unknown whether the pro- inflammatory events that have been reported in the brain following exposure to this PTSD model also occur in the heart. Aim 2 of this study is to identify the mechanism by which this PTSD model increases myocardial sensitivity to ischemic injury. Finally, women are at significantly greater risk of developing PTSD than men. However, few animal models of PTSD have included females because of complexities associated with the effects of the estrous cycle on the stress response. Aim 3 of this study is to examine the influence of estrous stage on behavioral responses and myocardial sensitivity to ischemic injury in female rats exposed to our animal model of PTSD."

"9356882","Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite improvements in early diagnosis that were made possible by emerging imaging technologies and newly developed targeted chemotherapeutic agents that improve initial treatment responses, the overall 5-year survival for lung cancer patients has remained a dismal 10-15% over the past 3 decades. Although the primary preventive strategy for smoke related diseases is quitting smoking, even after smoking cessation the risk of developing lung cancer remains significantly higher than in non-smokers for 15 years. Thus, the development of chemopreventive strategies that could prevent the progression of lung lesions to malignant cancers would reduce the mortality and morbidity resulting from this deadly disease. The population of tobacco smokers and ex-smokers constitutes a readily identifiable group of individuals at risk for lung cancer who would benefit from intervention with chemopreventive regimens.  The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel chemopreventive strategy based on the delivery of microRNA mimetics in an experimental model of lung carcinogenesis in mice. MicroRNAs are noncoding small RNAs acting as post-transcriptional repressors and regulators of gene expression. MicroRNAs are grossly dysregulated in human cancers, including lung cancer. The microRNAs that are under-expressed in cancer can be functionally classified as tumor-suppressors while those that are over-expressed act as oncogenes. The let-7 microRNA family is a well characterized family of tumor suppressors whose genes map to different chromosomal regions that are frequently deleted in lung cancer. Let-7 microRNAs negatively regulate multiple oncogenes, including ras, myc, hmga2, and cell-cycle progression regulator genes, such as cdc25a, cdk6, and cyclin D2. . Accordingly, microRNA delivery has been proposed as a new strategy for lung cancer therapy. Previous studies by Kumar et al. (Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. 105: 3903-8, 2008) and Trang et al. (Oncogene 29: 1580-7, 2010) have shown that intratracheal or intranasal exposure of genetically engineered mice to viral vectors expressing let-7 miRNA mimetics resulted in reduced lung tumor burdens. However, these studies were done in genetically engineered mouse models that developed highly aggressive tumors more relevant for a treatment regimen. In addition, Kumar et al. noted that some tumors emerged that were resistant to the let-7 miRNA. The success of this approach may thus be limited by the fact that the patterns of altered microRNAs continuously change due to the instability of cancer cell genome. In healthy and premalignant cells, the alterations in microRNA expression may be less unstable and more likely to be reversible with agent treatment.   Thus, testing of let-7 miRNA in murine models of chemical carcinogenesis utilizing chemical carcinogens implicated in tobacco smoke-induced disease would be important for determining the potential use of these agents in prevention strategies. This model develops tumors with a longer latency and allows an assessment of agent effects at the earliest stages of tumor initiation and progression. It will be important to develop an intranasal or aerosol delivery system that could be subsequently tested for safety and efficacy of microRNA administration aimed at preventing lung cancer by blocking the progression of the carcinogenesis process."
"9356897","Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive, therapy-resistant lung cancer that arises primarily from the mesothelial lining of the pleural and peritoneal cavities. Patients with MM usually present with advanced-stage disease that is often surgically inoperable and refractory to standard chemotherapeutic regimens. A marked increase in MM incidence is predicted in developing countries, where usage of asbestos is increasing at an alarming rate. Thus, new approaches for the prevention and management of this disease are urgently needed.  MM is a cancer characterized by recurrent genomic losses that typically occur in combination. Molecular genetic studies of human MMs have uncovered recurrent mutations/deletions of several tumor suppressor genes, particularly CDKN2A (encoding p16INK4A and p14ARF), NF2, and BAP1. Genetically engineered mouse models of MM have demonstrated that haploinsufficiency for Cdkn2a, Nf2, or Bap1 accelerates asbestos-induced MM onset and progression, thereby providing both experimental evidence in support of the pivotal role of these tumor suppressor genes in MM pathogenesis and relevant murine models to facilitate preclinical studies of novel chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents.  Upon exposure to asbestos, macrophages are recruited to sites of asbestos deposition, indicating that one physiological response to mineral fiber exposure is inflammation. Mice exposed to asbestos exhibit recruitment of activated macrophages to the mesothelium. As a result of increased macrophage accumulation, the nearby mesothelial cells are thought to be exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1? and TNF?. Interestingly, IL-1? and TNF? can act in concert with asbestos fibers to transform normal mesothelial cells in vitro, suggesting that inflammation may directly contribute to MM development. IL-1? has been shown to increase the proliferative capacity of mesothelial cells in vitro while depletion of activated macrophages in an orthotopic mouse model of MM was found to diminish tumorigenesis.  Another cytokine, IL-6, is also potentially a key player in asbestos-induced MM formation as the levels of this proinflammatory cytokine are elevated in asbestos exposed mice. Collectively, these data imply that recruitment of activated macrophages as a result of inflammation contributes to mesothelial proliferation and transformation through release of the cytokines IL-1?, IL-6, and TNF?. Thus, chronic inflammation associated with exposure to asbestos may represent a form of extrinsic cancer-related inflammation and may serve as an early intervention target for the delay or prevention of this cancer. Targeting the immune regulators of asbestos induced inflammatory represent a novel approach to the prevention of this deadly disease."

"9358806","Significant advances in the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors have yielded durable responses in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer. Unfortunately, many patients who might ultimately respond to this important therapy may not receive it because they are considered biomarker negative by today?s Companion Diagnostic (CDx) tests. To address this critical unmet need, BioMarker Strategies proposes to develop a CDx test using the SnapPath Cancer Diagnostics System to predict patient responses to PD-1/PD-L1 targeted immune checkpoint inhibitors. Unlike traditional indirect approaches that measure static biomarkers in dead tissue, SnapPath enables treatment of a patient?s live tumor cell biopsy with different modulators and measures their functional responses to predict an individual patient?s response to therapy. This unique approach enables NSCLC tumors to be measured for their ultimate PD-L1 expression potential, not just their expression at time of biopsy. Ultimately, the development of this SnapPath CDx test will yield highly predictive results for NSCLC patients, in particular addressing biomarker negative patients who could otherwise be excluded from the benefit of these very important therapies."

Dr. Walker's research focuses on the mechanisms mediating arterial aging with a specific focus on cerebral artery function. Her long term goal is to direct an independent extramurally- funded research laboratory who can integratively study vascular aging at the gene, cellular, tissue and systemic (whole-body) levels. The proposed K01 award will provide Dr. Walker with the necessary protected time for career development to achieve this goal. Career Development Plan. This award will support the further career development of Dr. Walker, allowing her to complete a well-rounded training plan in aging, vascular biology, and genetics. The career development plan will follow several separate but coordinated efforts to enhance the expertise of the applicant including training in new experimental techniques related to endothelial function and telomere biology; didactic course work designed to facilitate a better understanding of molecular genetics, biostatistics and gerontology; and attendance at regular aging, cardiovascular, and molecular medicine seminar series as well as other formal meetings within the university and nationally. Environment. The University of Utah is an ideal environment for Dr. Walker's career devolvement. This environment will allow for collaboration with renowned experts in aging, endothelial biology, and genetics, as well as opportunities for formal and informal training in areas related to vascular aging and general career development. Research. The aim of the research project is to examine novel mechanisms underlying impaired cerebral artery function with aging. We hypothesize that age-related increases in arterial stiffness lead to telomere dysfunction in the endothelial cells of cerebral resistance arteries. We further hypothesize that this telomere dysfunction, characterized by telomere uncapping, stimulates cell senescence and increased inflammatory signaling, ultimately resulting in endothelial dysfunction. We will address these hypotheses by studying animal and endothelial cell culture models of aging, isolated large artery stiffening, and endothelial cell telomere uncapping. The knowledge gained from the results of these studies could identify novel pharmaceutical targets for the prevention/treatment of age-related cerebral artery dysfunction. This is a worthwhile and relevant goal given the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease among older adults and the associated morbidity, mortality, and health care burden."

"9231019","ABSTRACT Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, low grade neoplasia affecting primarily women of childbearing age. LAM is characterized by the nodular proliferation of SMA and HMB-45 positive LAM cells throughout the lung, producing cystic destruction and respiratory insufficiency. Mutations in the tsc2 or tsc1 genes leading to activation of the mTOR pathway underlie the disease. LAM cells express mainly progesterone receptors (PRs) rather than estrogen receptors; however the role of PRs in the disease has not been investigated. Preliminary studies using a new, well characterized, sporadic-LAM-derived LAM cell line (LAM1) which expresses PRs suggested that the progesterone (P4)/PR axis stimulates LAM cell proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteinases expression, and pericellular proteolysis, all independently of mTOR activation, whereas mifepristone, a P4 antagonist, abolishes these effects. In a separate pilot study we found that TSC2 transfer suppresses PR expression in LAM1 cells. Additionally, we found that a LAM cell subpopulation expresses PLAP (placental alkaline phosphatase) and preliminary studies suggested a direct correlation between PR positivity and level of secreted PLAP. Finally, intratracheal delivery of LAM1 cells to ovariectomized immunodeficient female mice receiving P4 resulted in LAM-like features undistinguishable from human pulmonary LAM. Based on these observations we hypothesize that: A. the P4/PRs axis contributes to the pathogenesis of LAM by stimulating LAM cell malignant behavior and lung cystic destruction; B. PR expression in LAM results from lack of TSC2-mediated PR transcription repression. C. PLAP levels in serum are a marker for PR positive (PR+) LAM cell burden; and D. concomitant blockage of mTOR and the P4/PR axis is more effective in preventing/ameliorating LAM manifestations in an orthotopic mouse model that blockage of mTOR alone. To test these hypotheses we specifically propose: 1. A To determine the involvement of the P4/PR axis in the promotion of LAM cellular features associated with a low grade neoplastic behavior, including LAM1 cell proliferation, death, production of ECM proteolytic enzymes, etc. 1. B To determine the involvement of the P4/PR axis in the development of pulmonary LAM-like disease in an orthotopic mouse model by quantifying LAM cell burden, cystic destruction, and metastatic dissemination. 1. C To determine the effect of the P4 antagonists mifepristone and lonaprisan on LAM cell low grade neoplastic behavior in vitro and in vivo using the same read outs presented in sub-aims A and B. 2. To determine the effect of TSC2 transfer on pr transcription by LAM1 cells using qPCR, promoter reporter assays and ChIP analysis. 3. To assess whether PLAP level is a marker of PR+ LAM cell burden by determining the potential in vitro and in vivo correlation between PR+ LAM cell burden and PLAP levels in medium and serum. 4. To compare the effectivity of rapamycin alone versus rapamycin plus a P4 antagonist in the treatment of LAM-like disease in an orthotopic mouse model. The experimental protocol will be modeled on that presented in aim 1 B, with same read outs."
"9233776","NIH policy requiring independent data and safety monitoring boards (DSMB) for all multicenter Phase III trials has existed since 1979; the most recent restatement was issued in 1998 (NIH Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring, NIH Guide Notice 98-084).

"9242733","Project summary / abstract The diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) (both pulmonary and disseminated forms) in children is extremely difficult as current tests rely on culture of the causative bacteria from sputum or gastric aspirates. Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may take several weeks and obtaining appropriate samples from young children is difficult. Even with the best available current methods a definitive diagnosis of childhood TB is only achieved in 20-30% of children clinically diagnosed as having TB. Lack of accurate and rapid diagnostic tests results in delayed treatment for many children, and conversely over-treatment of children who may not actually have TB is also common. There is thus an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for childhood TB. As an alternative to detecting the causative Mycobacterium, identification of changes in blood proteins or the pattern of activation of genes in blood cells (protein or gene signatures or biomarkers) is a promising method for diagnosing many infections. The members of our consortium have previously studied well-characterised large groups of children with TB, and a range of other infections with similar symptoms to childhood TB. We have identified candidate protein and gene ?signatures? which may be useful in the diagnosis of childhood TB. Our proposal is to take forward six promising protein and gene signatures (three based on proteins and three based on changes in expressed genes) for further validation in well established cohorts of children with suspected TB in four African countries which have high burdens of childhood TB (South Africa, Malawi, Kenya and The Gambia). Using available samples from over 4,000 well characterised child TB suspects, each of the six candidate biomarkers will be validated first using the same technology as used to detect the original biomarker and then using simpler technology which enables large numbers of patients to be analysed. In order to ensure that only the most accurate and reproducible biomarkers are taken forward, we will validate each biomarker in at least three different country cohorts. We will use sophisticated statistical methodology to select the most accurate biomarkers which can be taken forward for development as tests for clinical use. In order to translate promising biomarkers to clinical tests which can be applied even in resource poor settings we will use novel technology to detect the protein and gene signatures which will be validated as the basis of a diagnostic test."
"9242826","Disease modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain a major unmet medical need despite numerous large-scale clinical trials. Among the reasons for these disappointing outcomes to date is the choice of proposed therapeutic targets that appear not to be critical for disease development or progression. But our current understanding about the molecular pathogenesis of PD has provided new therapeutic targets and the opportunity to develop disease-modifying therapies. Accumulating evidence from human genetics, cell biology and animal model studies suggest that ?-synuclein is a key protein in this disease as it misfolds, aggregates and forms fibrils that can propagate across neurons, explaining the progressive nature of the disease and the emergence of additional disturbing symptoms including dementia. A strong driver of its pathological aggregation is its concentration in the brain. Accordingly, reducing the expression of ?-synuclein has the potential to mitigate downstream cascades of pathologic events and slow down neurodegeneration. We propose to identify small molecules that downregulate the expression of ?-synuclein using a novel approach that we have developed. Our lead identification strategy, named Inforna, is designed to target RNA and impart biological activity. In this project, we will use Inforna to design small molecules that inhibit ?-synuclein production, followed by optimizing these molecules for further development."
"9247059","In 2000, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) awarded contracts to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in young children with sickle cell disease (SCD) to test the hypothesis that Hydroxyurea (HU) can prevent the onset of chronic end organ damage in children recruited before two years of age. Contracts were awarded to ten Clinical Centers to recruit, enroll, and follow patients to monitor clinical responsiveness to study treatments, to assess growth and development, and to monitor for toxicity from study treatments. Surrogate markers of end organ damage were used to evaluate pulmonary, renal, splenic, and brain function as well as developmental milestones. One Medical Coordinating Center was awarded to oversee drug distribution, coordinate central laboratory functions, perform data collection and analysis, and conduct clinical sites visits to monitor study performance. The trial enrolled 193 subjects with SCD between the ages of 9 and 17 months from October 2003 to June 2007. Subjects remained on study drug for a period of two years. HU demonstrated substantial clinical benefit without serious toxicity in this cohort of very young children. In 2008, a follow-up study was added to the contracts to provide structured follow-up of the children after they completed their two years on study drug. The purpose of the initial Follow-Up Study is to characterize the long-term toxicities and unexpected risks (if any) associated with treatment with HU at an early age. Information obtained from this follow-up study is vitally important to understanding the risks and benefits of early treatment, and ultimately for creation of an optimal paradigm for HU therapy in young children with sickle cell anemia. The follow-up study ends in December 2011. The purpose of the Baby Hug Follow-Up Study II is to provide continued structured follow-up of the children enrolled in the Baby Hug Follow-Up Study I, to characterize the long-term toxicities and unexpected risks (if any) associated with HU treatment at an early age, and to determine if there are clinical benefits from the treatments. Collection and ongoing evaluation of growth and development and clinical data are crucial for determination of the long-term effects of HU. The objective is to intensively monitor and assess this unique group of children for growth, development, and clinical status at least through the first decade of life to document any alterations in the natural history of sickle cell disease associated with early HU therapy. The follow-up will include enhanced neuropsychological, brain, cardiac, and pulmonary evaluations. All children enrolled will be followed to a common termination date of December 31, 2016. Results from the Follow-up Study II will improve understanding of the natural history of SCD in young children and in a cohort receiving HU. Whether or not HU reduces organ damage in these children will be established. If HU has a beneficial effect, the standard of care for children with SCD will be permanently altered."
"9252904","ABSTRACT  Formation of misfolded protein oligomers in neurons is an early and causative event in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer?s Disease (?-amyloid and tau oligomers), Fronto-temporal lobe dementia (tau oligomers), and Parkinson?s Disease (?-synuclein oligomers). These toxic oligomers share a common aggregation mechanism that involves formation of hydrogen bonds between individual monomers. A therapeutic that can disaggregate these oligomers, or prevent their formation from monomers, could therefore have extraordinary potential to treat a host of neurodegenerative diseases/disorders. Regarding Alzheimer?s Disease (AD), currently available therapeutics (e.g., AChE inhibitors and memantine) only temporarily slow the rate of cognitive decline without affecting the disease process. This may be in large part because these drugs have not been shown to penetrate the brain?s neurons to disaggregate toxic ?-amyloid (A?) oligomers and tau oligomers therein. The critical importance of addressing the oligomeric forms of A? and tau in AD pathogenesis, along with the failure of many clinical studies using anti-A? aggregating drugs, highlight the need for new, innovative therapies. Since 2007, Dr. Gary Arendash (NeuroEM?s PI) and his collaborators have been developing and testing a new non-pharmacologic intervention against AD ? Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment (TEMT). In multiple peer-reviewed papers, he has demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo studies using AD transgenic mice that TEMT prevents and reverses A? oligomerization/aggregation, both inside and outside neurons. These anti-aggregating effects demonstrate that TEMT penetrates the brain parenchyma and neurons to destabilize A? aggregates. The result is a prevention/reversal of cognitive deficits in AD transgenic mice. This proposal?s Aims will focus on administering TEMT through a new prototype head device developed for human TEMT administration against AD. To effectively validate and greatly extend our approach, Aim 1 will utilize assays for oligomeric forms of A?, tau, and ?-synuclein to specifically measure TEMT?s effects on each of these three toxic oligomers in CSF samples placed within a human head mannequin. Aim 2 will then seek to optimize the TEMT parameters for maximum anti-oligomerization and investigate direct mechanisms of TEMT action. The successful execution of these Aims will provide validation of the ?direct? anti-oligomerization effects of TEMT across toxic proteins involved in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In a follow-up SBIR Fast Track application, NeuroEM will continue this work by: 1) investigating the ?indirect? effects of TEMT in neuronal cell cultures over-expressing these oligomers and 2) performing a Phase II clinical trial involving TEMT administration to AD patients utilizing the optimal set of TEMT parameters. Thus, the extent of both direct and indirect TEMT actions across multiple pathologic oligomers will be determined, as will insight into the anti-oligomerization mechanisms of TEMT action ? all this, utilizing a TEMT head device that we will utilize in a Phase I AD clinical trial starting in Summer 2016 that involves our current set of TEMT parameters."

"9263568","Neurons and endocrine cells release signaling molecules by Ca2+?triggered exocytosis. Ca2+ enters a nerve terminal or endocrine cell, binds to a Ca2+ sensor protein on the vesicle membrane, and triggers the fusion of the vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane to expel some or all of the vesicle content into the extracellular space. To explore the mechanisms of this process our research focuses on the fusion pore, the initial aqueous passage between the vesicle interior and the outside of a cell. Studies of the fusion pore have given us valuable insights into the roles of specific molecules in the regulation of membrane fusion. The previous funding cycle saw progress in the identification of the vesicle protein synaptobrevin 2 as a fusion pore?forming protein in endocrine cells. This work revealed new unanticipated details in the structure of the fusion pore. We also showed that the transmembrane domain of this protein alters fusion pore stability by perturbing lipid bilayers. These findings raise new questions which we will attempt to answer by performing amperometry and capacitance recordings along with recordings of unitary synaptic current to obtain sensitive measures of fusion pore permeability and stability. We will build on insights from studies of endocrine fusion pores to test the role of the transmembrane domains of syntaxin and synaptobrevin in synaptic vesicle fusion pores. We will test the role of the vesicle protein synaptophysin in endocrine fusion pores by assaying flux and lipid perturbation. We will test the role of contacts between linkers and transmembrane domains of syntaxin and synaptobrevin in providing an energetic driving force for fusion pore expansion. These experiments will establish the specific functions of proteins associated with exocytosis. We will determine how these proteins contribute to the formation of specific structural intermediates of fusion, and how these proteins deform and remodel lipid bilayers to carry out these functions."

"9185255","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 60% of adults age ? 65 years have high blood pressure (BP), but optimal management of high BP in the elderly remains controversial. Contrary to evidence in middle age that lowering BP is clearly beneficial, data in older adults are inconsistent and high BP may not be a risk factor in all elders. We recently reported that, among participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey age e65 years, high BP was a risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) death only among persons in better health status (defined as fast walking of a 20-ft walk test). In contrast, high BP was not a risk factor among slow walkers. Additionally, the benefit of lowering BP in all elders remains an issue of debate; a recent meta-analysis in persons age 80 years and older reported no benefit of BP treatment on mortality, and significant heterogeneity across trials. Finally, there is growin concern for potential harms associated with treatment to lower BP. Excessive lowering of BP, particularly diastolic, has been associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in some studies. In the proposed research, we propose a novel paradigm where the associations of BP with adverse outcomes in older persons are considered in the setting of the complex aging process. Our long-term goal is to reliably identify elderly persons in whom BP treatment is beneficial and those in whom treatment is ineffective or even harmful, by defining subpopulations of similar health status. Specifically, aim 1 proposes to elucidate factors from four domains (functional, cognitive/mental, self-rated health, and physiologic) that can identify elderly persons in whom high systolic BP is strongly associated with higher risk for death and CV events, and those in whom it is not, using data from three NIH-funded cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) and Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA). In aim 2, we will evaluate the role of diastolic BP across level of health status. Finally, based on findings from these observational cohorts, in aim 3 we will evaluate whether these factors can identify elderly persons in whom treatment to lower BP is of maximum benefit in two randomized controlled trials: the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SHEP) and the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3). Since participants in trials are healthier than the U.S. population, we will also evaluate the effect of treatment in the observational studies, using state-of-the-art causal inference methods, which can correct for the bias of standard analytic approaches. Completion of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the importance of high BP in older adults; will improve our ability to identify elderly persons who will benefit from BP treatment; will allow a systematic understanding of groups in whom evidence for BP treatment is lacking; and will guide design of future trials of hypertension in elderly adults."
"9191249","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) are radially symmetric inhibitory interneurons essential to confer the direction- selective (DS) properties of DS visual circuits in the mammalian retina, which impart image motion detection, a critical function for organismal survival. SACs have evolved to release neurotransmitter from varicosities in their distal dendritic arbors, since they lack axons. The principles that govern circuit assembly of neurons that lack clearly distinguishable axonal-dendritic compartments, and therefore discrete regions of specialization, are poorly defined. In the mouse retina, signaling through the guidance cue semaphorin6A (Sema6A) and its receptor is required for proper SAC circuit assembly. Two mirror populations of SACs exist that respond to either increases (ON) or decreases (OFF) in light. SAC are initially intermingled in the developing retina, but then stratif into the ON and OFF SAC circuits. Sema6A-PlexA2 signaling drives not only ON and OFF SAC stratification, but also establishes appropriate radial symmetry of individual ON SACs, which is necessary for accurate DS visual responses. Sema6A is also required for proper light (i.e. visual cue) evoked inhibitory postsynaptic responses in ON SACs. How the Sema6A-PlexA2 signaling pathway elicits such disparate cellular responses is unclear. This proposal is designed to study the mechanisms that distinguish these branches of guidance cue signaling within single SACs, and to define the range of guidance cues that contribute to DS SAC wiring. The specific aims of this study are to 1) assess the directionality of Sema6A-PlexA2 signaling pathways during retinal development with respect to segregation of the ON and OFF SAC circuits and development of SAC symmetry; 2) probe the mechanism underlying improper SAC inhibition in Sema6A mutants; and 3) to ask if other class 6 Semas and/or class A Plexins contribute to wiring DS circuitry. I will address these basic biological questions by 1) conditional removal of either Sema6A or PlexA2 in single SACs to determine the directionality of signaling; 2) examining the localization of synapses in Sema6A and PlexA2 mutant SACs, to ask if inappropriate synapse formation contributes to improper SAC inhibitory input; and 3) phenotypic analysis of class 6 Sema and class A double mutant combinations, to ask if any of these molecules regulates SAC stratification or elaboration of SAC symmetry. The answers to these questions have the potential to reveal general principles that guide CNS circuit assembly, especially in contexts where neurons lack axodendritic polarity. Since these molecules also contribute to wiring other circuits in the developing CNS, in addition to wiring DS circuits in the  retina, understanding the directionality of their signaling and the mechanisms by which they direct distinct aspects of circuit refinement in the retina will have significant implications for treating developmental neuronal circuitry disorders where these and related signaling molecules are non-functional."
"9216507","Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable hematological malignancy characterized by accumulation of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM) which impede production of normal blood cells. The average survival of MM patients has improved in recent years as a result of introduction of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents into treatment regimens but is still quite poor at only 5 years. FDA approval of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib validates the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) as a therapeutic target for MM drug development. Recent research efforts have focused on the discovery and development of small molecule inhibitors of other major components of the ubiquitin proteasome system including deubiquitylating (DUB) enzymes which remove degradative ubiquitin signals from protein substrates. The DUB ubiquitin specific protease 7 (USP7) has garnered interest as a therapeutic target in MM due to its role in degradation of tumor suppressor protein p53. USP7 stabilizes MDM2, the protein responsible for adding ubiquitin and driving degradation of p53. Importantly, USP7 is highly expressed in MM patient tumor cells and MM cell lines versus normal primary BM cells. And mutations or deletions in p53 are late events in MM suggesting that increasing p53 via pharmacological inhibition of USP7 may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for this malignancy. We recently reported on the effects of the covalent USP7 inhibitor P5091 on p53 stabilization and growth suppressive effects against MM cells ex vivo and in MM xenograft models. Moreover, P5091 triggered apoptosis even in bortezomib-resistant MM cells. Overall, our results validate USP7 as a therapeutic target in MM. To further assess the potential of USP7 as a target in MM and move USP7 inhibitors from bench to bedside, we propose to utilize USP7 structure-guided medicinal chemistry to develop more potent and selective USP7 inhibitors with improved pharmacokinetic properties and in vitro safety profile. Novel USP7 inhibitors will be evaluated for efficacy using both in vitro and in vivo models of MM and in primary human samples. A multi-disciplinary team has been assembled to perform the medicinal chemistry (Sara Buhrlage, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), biochemistry and structural biology (Sirano Dhe-Paganon, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), and cell and cancer biology in MM models (Kenneth Anderson and Dharminder Chauhan, Dana- Farber Cancer Institute) required to pharmacologically interrogate USP7 in MM."
"9236809","Project Summary  T cell is central to maintaining health. Over-exuberant T cell function leads to debilitating and fatal inflammatory disease. Activated T cells have to grow, exit quiescence, proliferate and differentiate in order to function. Therefore, one of the main goals for T cell research is to reveal the factors critical for the growth, proliferation and differentiation of activated T cells. Genome-wide high-throughput approaches have been quite powerful to reveal genes and pathways critical for T cell function. Most of the T cell high- throughput studies performed in the past used mRNA-based analysis, with the notion that mRNA expression will reflect the protein expression. However, accumulating evidence supports that protein and mRNA expression does not entirely correlate and can be quite different at times. In addition, the post- translational modifications of a protein and the factors a protein associating with can profoundly influence the function of a protein. Thus, to appreciate how the function of activated T cells is controlled, we need to know the protein-networks underlying T cell function in a systemic fashion, the knowledge we grossly lack to date. The recent advance of proteomic technology afforded high-speed, high-throughput, high-sensitivity and high-resolution protein analysis with microgram-scale protein samples. We have established robust experimental system to evaluate functional protein-networks in T cells. This system aided us to successfully identify new factors critical for the function of activated T cells. Encouraged by the results, we set the overarching goal of this study to reveal the protein networks underlying the function of activated T cells. A particular focus of this proposal is to reveal and assess the function of factors whose protein and mRNA are discretely regulated, aiming to identify novel molecular mechanisms that could not be revealed by classic mRNA-based analysis. By combining cutting edge MS/proteomics approach with innovative mouse model and genomic editing/genetic methods, we strive to reach the following research aims: Aim 1: Systemically analyze the protein expression dynamics during T cell growth, quiescence exit, and proliferation. Aim 2: Investigate the differential protein expression and its biological significance for Th cell differentiation.  Systemic analysis of the protein expression and interaction in various stages of T cell function will, for the first time, provide an atlas for the protein networks underlying T cell biology. In combination and comparison with mRNA-based genomic analysis, it will establish a molecular map for the normal function of activated T cells. This map will help us to identify new factors and pathways critical for specific T cell functions and to reveal the deregulated factors in T cells in immune diseases including cancer, SCID, inflammation and autoimmunity, aiding the efforts to discover the bio-markers for disease diagnosis and prognosis and to find strategies and drug targets for disease treatment."
"9240446","Summary Cardiac performance significantly impacts quality of life; cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmia increase with age and can lead to heart disease, the number one cause of death in the United States. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia and AF significantly increases the risk of heart failure and stroke. A genetic basis for AF is indicated in one third of patients and pro-fibrotic and apoptotic effects of sustained AF in patients and animal models have been documented. A major barrier to understanding the interplay between electrical and structural cardiac remodeling is the overwhelming complexity of mammalian systems. In order to define fundamental molecular/genetic links, I propose to use a simpler, genetically tractable model, Drosophila. The fruit fly has proven extremely useful in elucidating the first conserved genetic networks responsible for heart development and in identifying cellular mechanisms underlying adult heart function and disease. I have identified important similarities in ion channel function and cardiac arrhythmias between flies and humans including early afterdepolarizations that lead to tachyarrhythmias. Genetic analyses of hearts from flies with mutations in these channels reveal interesting differences in wnt and hippo signaling pathways and suggest possible connections between them. Individually, these pathways have been implicated in human heart cardiomyopathies and there are tantalizing suggestions that these pathways may be involved in maintenance and regeneration of adult cardiac function. I will use the fly cardiac model I have developed to elucidate underlying genetic/molecular connections between these pathways in both ?healthy? and ?diseased? hearts with subsequent validation in the vertebrate zebrafish heart model. The interplay between electrical activity, Ca2+ handling, and cardiac function/structure is likely a balancing act for post-mitotic organs with limited regenerative capacity; understanding this will be important in developing effective therapies to treat human cardiomyopathies."
"9336451","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the prevalence of childhood obesity may have started to plateau for some groups of children, other groups such as low-income and minority children are experiencing increases in childhood obesity. These growing disparities may be linked to unanswered questions regarding the home environment and childhood obesity. For example, research has shown that healthful food availability/accessibility in the home, frequent family meals, and authoritative parenting style are associated with healthful dietary intake, bette psychosocial health, and fewer unhealthy weight control behaviors in youth, but findings are inconsistent across studies with minority and low-income families. These conflicting findings suggest that mixed- methods studies are needed for an in-depth examination of the home environments of diverse families to identify potential explanatory mechanisms of childhood obesity that may have been overlooked in prior research. In addition, previous studies have not included state-of-the-art measures that may help illuminate factors in the home environment that differ by race/ethnicity. The primary objective of this study is to identify how familial factors, including interpersonal relationships that exist between family members, of racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse children act as risk or protective factors for predicting childhood obesity. To achieve this objective, a two-phased incremental mixed-methods approach will be used. Phase I (yrs. 1-2) will include in-home observations of diverse families (n=120; 20 each of African American, American Indian, Hispanic, Hmong, Somali and white families) to identify individual, dyadic (i.e., parent/child; siblings), and familial factors that are associated with, o moderate associations with, childhood obesity. The in-home observations, using our community-based participatory research partners, will include: (1) an interactive observational family task and family interview; (2) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) 17 of parent stress, mood and parenting practices; and (3) child accelerometry and 24-hour dietary recalls. Using state-of-the-art measures, such as EMA, will allow for identifying within-day fluctuations in parenting practices or parent stress levels, which may help to identify nuances within the home environment that amplify or exacerbate childhood obesity risk. Results from the in-home observations will be used for rich analyses and to inform the development of a culturally-appropriate survey in Phase II (yrs. 3- 5). The survey will be administered at two time points to a diverse sample of up to two caregivers (n=2400) of children ages 5-7. Individual, dyadic, and familial factors that are longitudinally associated with child BMIz score and weight-related behaviors will be identified. Phase I and II recruitment will occur via the electronic Primary Care Research Network in Minnesota primary care clinics (n=82). This comprehensive evaluation of diverse home environments will identify potential factors that increase childhood obesity risk in order to create culturally-tailored interventions that will be effective in reducing childhood obesty disparities."
"9345973","AREDS2 is one of the longest and perhaps the largest randomized controlled clinical trial of lutein/zeaxanthin. The AREDS2 cohort provides valuable resources with which to assess safety and efficacy data on use of these compounds.

In 2009, Satia et al. reported an increased risk of lung cancer associated with long term lutein supplement use participants of the VITamins And Lifestyle (VITAL) Study aged 50 to 76 years.a As AREDS2 is a randomized controlled clinical trial, additional follow-up of study participants would permit us to determinate whether high-dose oral lutein supplement use increases risk of lung cancer. Information regarding mortality will be collected through telephone interviews and the National Death Index search. We will also use this opportunity to ask for the ocular outcomes by asking at the telephone interview for cataract surgery and treatment for AMD.

"9338024","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recently accepted as the third member of the gasotransmitter family that includes nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Due to homologous biological functions to NO, we posit that H2S has a critical role in estrogen-induced uterine vasodilatation. Endogenous H2S is mainly produced by metabolizing L-cysteine via two key enzymes: cystathionine ?-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine ?- synthase (CBS). We have obtained compelling data showing that estrogens stimulate CBS but not CSE expression, in ovine uterine artery (UA) endothelium and smooth muscle in vitro and in vivo as well as human UAs. Inhibition of uterine artery endothelial and smooth muscle cell H2S production by a CBS inhibitor attenuated estrogen-stimulated endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation in UA endothelial cells in vitro and the vasodilatory effects of estrogen on KCl-preconstricted UAs in rats. Thus, in this competitive renewal application we propose to test a novel hypothesis that endogenous H2S production by enhanced CBS expression in UA endothelium and smooth muscle functions as a novel vasodilator for mediating estrogen actions on uterine endothelium via interactions with endothelial eNOS-NO. This conjecture will be tested by four specific aims with comprehensive biochemical, cellular, molecular, physiological, and pharmacological approaches using in vitro cell culture models of UA endothelial and smooth muscle cells and ex vivo studies of various artery samples collected from sheep estrogen replacement therapy models and human UAs associated with different estrogens status from hysterectomy. Aim 1 will determine if estrogens stimulate H2S production via upregulating endothelial and smooth muscle CBS expression in UA but not systemic arteries from animal models ex vivo. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms by which estrogens utilize to stimulate CBS expression and H2S production in UAEC vs. UASM cells in vitro. Aim 3 will determine if UASM and endothelium-derived H2S functions as a mediator for estrogen activation of the eNOS-NO pathway in endothelial cells. Aim 4 will determine if endogenous H2S mediates vascular reactivity to estrogens in human UAs from hysterectomies of post- and pre-menopausal (both secretory and proliferative phases) as well as late pregnant women. The proposed studies are novel because they are entirely different from the existing literature and they will determine for the first time whether a new vasodilator H2S mediates estrogen-induced uterine vasodilatation and the underlying mechanisms. Thus, data obtained will significantly improve our cellular and molecular understanding of estrogen and uterine blood flow biology; this, in turn, will drive the development of new strategies for combating preeclampsia, intrauterine uterine restriction, and other pregnancy failures. New data obtained will also shed lights on the understanding of the cardiovascular protective effects of estrogens."
"9338034","Project Summary/Abstract The overall goal of this research program is to understand how to regenerate mammalian central visual pathways. This proposal specifically focuses on the question of how to regenerate projections from output neurons of the eye, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to their targets in the brain (collectively referred to `retinofugal pathway')- a circuit absolutely essential vision. Significant progress has recently been made in identifying molecular programs capable of triggering some RGC axon regeneration. The next crucial milestones for the field are to discover ways to increase the number RGC axons that regenerate and the distance they regro. It is also crucially important to determine whether regenerating RGCs can find and reconnect to the correct targets, such visual capacities return. The three major aims of this proposal are to: 1) test the hypothesis that specific forms of visual stimulation can enhance the number and distance of RGC regenerating axons 2) test the hypothesis that combining visual stimulation with molecular triggers of RGC axon growth can cause RGC axons to regrow long distances back into the brain and 3) determine whether regenerating RGCs are capable of pathfinding back to and re-connecting to their appropriate targets, as well as avoiding targets incorrect for their function. Results from these experiments should lead to new understanding of how mammalian visual circuits can be replenished in response to injury and pave the way for the cultivation of tools applicable to humans suffering from vision loss."
"9354946","Historically, the detection and identification of bacteria, mycobacteria, yeasts, and molds have relied primarily on their morphologic and phenotypic properties. This approach is imprecise and slow for many clinically significant microbes. We have explored alternative methods, such as targeted sequencing and mass spectrometry, for the detection and identification of selected organisms. Studies in the current fiscal year have focused on alternative identification methods, specifically MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry) for the identification of Nocardia, mycobacteria, and molds and rapid genomic assays for identification, typing and detection of antibiotic resistance in M. abscessus group. MALDI-TOF MS provides a reproducible spectral pattern based on the mass/charge (m/z) ratio of ionized proteins. Preparation of samples is rapid and inexpensive. Well-characterized reference strains of mycobacteria, Nocardia and molds allowed us to build a NIH database that was then challenged with clinical isolates. Following a demonstration of excellent performance, MALDI-TOF MS has been recently selected as the method of choice of the NIH Microbiology Service for identification of both rapid and slowly growing mycobacteria as well as filamentous molds. This approach has been recently validated for the identification of Nocardia at the NIH and more recently also at two other academic centers. A multi center evaluations of the performance of the NIH mold database is ongoing. Finally, we are exploring the use of proteomics and in particular Maldi-Tof MS for direct detection of microbial antigens in clinical samples. Preliminary findings support the validity of this approach for detection of circulating antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria"

"9386843","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socio-economic status (SES) produces wide disparities in health. These disparities are a problem because they describe increased risk for chronic diseases and early death for lower SES individuals and large costs to the U.S. economy due to health care and lost productivity. The long-term goal is to better understand the pathways by which lower SES results in worse health. The overall objective in this R03 is to test chronic stress as an explanation of SES-related health disparities. In contrast to previous daily stress studies, this R03 uses data from an economically and racially diverse sample of adults and has fine-grained data regarding the timing of stressors. The central hypothesis, drawn from several health disparity theories, is that lower SES individuals experience persistent exposure and prolonged response to stressors and that this frequent and extended activation of emotional responses results in physical wear-and-tear and eventual disease. The rationale for the proposed research is that by understanding the pathways by which SES-related stress reduces physical health, interventions can be developed to reduce physical symptoms on a daily basis and delay or prevent disease over the long-term. Guided by preliminary work, this chronic stress hypothesis will be tested on short- and long-time scales. Specific aims extended from this hypothesis include: 1) Test the prediction that, over the short-term, low SES will be associated with more frequent daily stressors and emotional responses to stressors which are larger in magnitude and duration, 2) Test the prediction that, on a daily basis, having emotional responses to daily stressors which are larger magnitude and longer duration predicts experiencing more frequent and severe physical symptoms on a daily basis, and 3) Test the prediction that, over a lifetime, low SES in childhood predicts worse physical health in adulthood because of more exposure to stressors and reduced psychosocial resources with which to respond to them. Under the first aim, magnitude of emotional reactivity will be distinguished from duration of emotional recovery - which the applicant has demonstrated is feasible in her preliminary work. Under the second aim, these magnitude and duration slopes of emotional responses to stressors across the day will be used to predict end of day physical symptoms. In the third aim, childhood and lifetime stress will be tested as mediators of the effects of objectiv indices of childhood SES on adult health. The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it tests theory-based predictions for health disparities, leverages a diverse sample, and approaches the predictions at multiple time scales. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of how SES disadvantage results in wide disparities in health. Such knowledge has the potential to direct interventions to the chronic stress pathways most predictive of daily and long-term health."
"9395767","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The axon initial segment has a unique composition of ion channels that enables action potential initiation. Studying the biophysical properties of this compartment is crucial for understanding neuronal excitability and associated neuronal disorders, including epilepsy. Recently, we found that Ca channels are clustered in the initial segment. Our lab showed that those channels play a critical role in neuronal excitability, and that these channels are subject to dopamine neuromodulation. Modern models of the initial segment includes realistic distributions of Na and K channels, but do not include Ca channels. Here, our goal is to utilize electrophysiological and imaging techniques, both in acute brain slice and heterologous systems, to understand the role of Ca channels in action potential initiation, and to determine how dopaminergic signaling alters the biophysical properties of axonal Ca channels. These data will be incorporated into new models of axon initial segment excitability using novel, GPU-based simulation environments."

"9187019","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How visual information is processed and transformed in the nervous system is a fundamental question in vision research. Given its clear importance in visually-guided behaviors and the available genetic tools, the mouse superior colliculus (SC) holds great promise for understanding visual signal transformation and its mechanisms. The SC is a layered structure important for multimodal integration and sensorimotor transformation, and its superficial layers are purely visual and receive direct retinotopic inputs from the retina. In his proposal, the investigators will study the brain circuitry and synaptic mechanisms underlying the important transformations that take place in the retinocollicular pathway, especially the processing of motion direction. First, 2-photon calcium imaging will be performed to determine the direction selectivity of individual SC neurons and their spatial organization. These experiments will establish whether there is a depth-, region-, and/or cell type-specific organization of direction selectivity in the superficial SC, thereby forming a foundation for the following aims. Second, the investigators will determine the response properties of the retinal input that project to the SC. Genetically-encoded calcium indicators will be expressed in retinal ganglion cells and 2- photon imaging will be performed to visualize their axonal terminals in the colliculus. Third, the methods of imaging retinal terminals and collicular neurons will be used in a line of transgenic mice where retinocollicular projections are spatially altered, in order to determine whether direction selective retinal input is required for the direction selectivity in th SC. Finally, the investigator will perform in vivo whole cell recording to study visually-evoked responses in the SC. These experiments will be performed in transgenic mice where excitatory SC neurons can be silenced by optogenetic stimulation, thereby exposing the retinal input to the recorded cells. By comparing the selectivity of the total and retinal input to individual SC neurons, these experiments will start to reveal the synaptic mechanisms underlying the processing and transformation of direction selectivity in the retinocollicular pathway.  Together, these experiments will generate important data needed for a complete understanding of visual processing in the brain. Because normal visual processing is compromised in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as dyslexia, schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, these studies will provide insights for the understanding and treatment of these disorders."
"9229235","  Project Summary/Abstract A modifiable risk factor that is highly prevalent in populations translates into a substantial number of cases that can be prevented through clinical and public health interventions targeting the risk factor. In the field of cancer research, weight cycling represents a potential modifiable risk factor that is highly prevalent but under- investigated. Albeit limited, available evidence suggests that weight cycling, characterized by repeated episodes of intentional weight loss followed by regain of weight, may promote the development and progression of cancers through the insulin pathway, particularly among individuals of normal weight who are generally conceived as healthy and at lower risk for obesity-related cancer endpoints. The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) and Nurses' Health Study (NHS) are among the few cohorts to have administered questionnaires specifically designed to examine health consequences of weight cycling and thus, are equipped to examine not only its effects on cancer incidence and mortality but also the following heterogeneous aspects of the relationships. With available information on weight cycling experience over different durations and timing in adulthood, Aim 1 will identify the etiologically relevant period of weight cycling, which informs the optimal timing of public health interventions. Aim 2 will examine the relationship by subtypes of weight cyclers defined by methods used to lose weight. Exercise, without caloric restriction, is not an effective method of weight loss, but it has many health benefits. By specifically comparing the risks of cancer endpoints between the two weight loss regimes (caloric restriction alone versus caloric restriction and exercise combined), this aim will identify the weight loss regime that would minimize the adverse consequences of weight cycling on cancer endpoints. Additionally, by conducting stratified analysis by smoking status, Aim 2 will adequately evaluate the true associations of weight cycling with cancer incidence and mortality, minimizing smoking from distorting or masking the associations. Aim 3 will utilize stratified analysis across three adiposity trajectories (maintain normal range, maintain overweight/obesity, and become overweight/obesity), which offers a unique opportunity to identify a novel and modifiable risk factor for individuals with normal adiposity who are generally considered to have lower baseline risk for obesity-related cancers. In summary, weight cycling represents a full picture of energy imbalance over time and thus, research on weight cycling will complement limitations of previous studies on either weight gain or intentional weight loss alone. If weight cycling is demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for cancer incidence and mortality, clinical practice and public health recommendation should emphasize sustainable weight loss when guiding individuals attempting to lose weight and discourage approaches that predispose to weight cycling.

"9150626","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Family planning options, including hormonal contraceptives, are essential for improving reproductive health among HIV-infected women. For these individuals, prevention of unintended pregnancy decreases maternal and child mortality, as well as reduces the risk of mother-to-child HIV transmission. Similarly, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential for reducing morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected individuals, in addition to preventing HIV transmission. Thus, it is of critical public health importance to safely combine hormone contraceptives and ART. Millions of HIV-infected women on ART currently use subdermal progestin-releasing implants as a preferred method of long-acting, reversible contraception despite the lack of critically needed pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-interaction data to inform their safe and effective concomitant use. Highlighting this concern, our research team recently demonstrated that combined use of efavirenz (EFV)-based ART, the only preferred first-line ART regimen in low- and middle-income countries, with a levonorgestrel (LNG)-releasing implant for one year reduced LNG plasma concentrations by approximately 50% compared to women not on ART. Importantly, we also observed three unintended pregnancies (15%) in our study group of women on EFV-based ART plus the LNG implant, in contrast to the <1% expected failure rate of the implant for women without drug interactions. Still, subdermal implants remain an essential family planning option and are routinely co-prescribed with ART. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposed study is to build upon and extend our prior work in order to provide comprehensive, evidence-based guidance on the use of LNG implants with ART in HIV-infected women. Overall, we hypothesize that detrimental drug-drug interactions between the LNG implant and EFV-based ART can be overcome by using an increased dose of the LNG implant and/or alternative ART combinations. We will accomplish this through the following three specific aims: Aim 1) determine if increasing the dose of the LNG-releasing subdermal implant effectively overcomes the known PK interaction with EFV- based ART; Aim 2) predict optimal strategies to comprehensively combine LNG implants with ART options using physiologically-based PK (PBPK) modeling; and Aim 3) determine the in vivo PK of LNG released from a subdermal implant over one year in combination with emerging ART strategies. Collectively, these aims significantly extend our preliminary findings to identify a strategy to overcome the drug-drug interaction between LNG and EFV-based ART, advance contraceptive therapeutic options for HIV-infected women, and advance the science of the drug-drug interaction field. Overall, our proposed study will provide an evidence- based approach to safely combine LNG implants with ART regimens spanning the continuum of HIV care. In turn, this collaborative study is strongly expected to improve the management of reproductive health in millions of HIV-infected women worldwide."
"9190342","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Therapeutic reprogramming of a patient's diseased cells represents a potential curative approach to treating skin diseases like epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Currently, an incomplete understanding of the regulation of skin cell lineage commitment is a major limitation to safely manufacturing genetically-corrected induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Advances in regenerative medicine demonstrate that treatment of iPSCs with skin-specific morphogen signals drives stem cell differentiation into keratinocytes (KCs), mimicking embryonic development. Preliminary data show that morphogen treatment drives KC lineage commitment through increasing expression of epithelial lineage selectors including p63 and AP-2a. It has become evident, however, that this morphogen treatment also induces dynamic chromatin interactions and genome accessibility to establish a framework for long-range gene regulation during KC lineage commitment. The objective of this application is to define the chromatin landscape and the role of early lineage selectors that are induced by the skin-specific morphogens. The central hypothesis is that the morphogens initiate and establish an epithelial-specific genomic landscape through inducing chromatin looping interactions and expression of lineage-specific licensing factors. Locus-specific and high-throughput chromosome conformation assays will be conducted to define the dynamic chromatin architecture of early differentiating KCs. Additionally, deletion of skin cell lineage licensing factors, such as AP-2a, from cultured stem cells, will allow for the elucidation of how these factors mechanistically enforce epithelial fate commitment. Functional analyses including expression profiling, genome accessibility assays, and genome-wide binding experiments will be performed to characterize subsequent changes in epithelial lineage commitment. The results of these assays will reveal the epigenetic complexities within developmental biology that govern early cell fate determination. This contribution will be significant because it will allow for the more effective characterization of stem cells, which will ultimately benefit the field of regenerative medicine."
"9192126","Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a silent epidemic, which recently has been labeled the signature injury of current combat operations, a population often exposed to stressful stimuli and emotional trauma. While TBI is typically known to impair learning and memory for neutral events, traumatic fear memories are enhanced after TBI, consistent with increased prevalence of comorbid TBI and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mechanisms that underlie the complex TBI-PTSD comorbidity and associated emotional consequences are poorly understood. Although categorized separately from the emotional consequences of TBI, common physical symptoms including phonophobia, hyperacusis, and sensory sensitivity in other modalities may interact and influence emotional and stress responses. Given the highly conserved and redundant connectivity between auditory and limbic networks, and their vulnerability to TBI, alterations in sensory processing after diffuse TBI may result in otherwise neutral stimuli adopting aversive properties and impacting the encoding of traumatic memories. Our findings demonstrate that diffuse TBI causes dynamic changes in plasticity within amygdala neurocircuitry known to underlie stress, emotion, and fear learning processes and that TBI-induced changes within auditory fear circuitry correspond to robustly enhanced contextual fear when footshocks are paired with white noise auditory stimuli, but not low frequency pure tones. This proposal will test the hypothesis that auditory sensitivity following diffuse TBI underlies enhanced fear learning to white noise. We will first determine whether diffuse TBI heightens sensitivity in emotional-auditory networks in a series of convergent and novel anatomical, immunohistochemical, and behavioral approaches. Second, using novel viral mediated technology that allows direct manipulation of activity in specific target projections, we will causally determine the involvement of auditory-amygdala network function during white noise fear conditioning on the observed enhanced fear phenotype after TBI. Findings from these studies could uncover a novel interaction between common TBI sequelae that has not been considered previously. Translational research on the underlying contributing mechanisms of posttraumatic stress after TBI is a critical line of work in need of immediate investigation to determine targets for treatments and preventions for human patients in both military and civilian contexts."
"9233398","Project Summary: Obesity increases the incidence and severity of asthma, but an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-related asthma make it difficult prevent and treat this phenotype. Parasympathetic nerves mediate one mechanism of airway hyperreactivity. These nerves provide dominant autonomic control of airway tone and release acetylcholine (ACh), which activates M3 muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle, causing contraction and bronchoconstriction. ACh release is controlled by inhibitory M2 muscarinic receptors on these nerves. Thus, airway hyperreactivity results from decreased neuronal M2 receptor function and subsequent increased ACh release. Our preliminary data show that obesity is associated with increased bronchoconstriction in response to parasympathetic nerve stimulation, with reduced neuronal M2 receptor function, and that these effects are mediated by insulin even in the absence of inflammation. Thus, our hypothesis is that increased insulin, as seen in obesity, binds to insulin receptors on airway parasympathetic nerves resulting in airway hyperreactivity by reducing M2 muscarinic function on parasympathetic nerves (thus increasing ACh release). We propose to test how insulin reduces M2 receptor expression and function, identify which insulin receptor and signaling pathways mediate neuronal M2 dysfunction and test whether manipulating insulin (with diet, oral anti-glycemic drugs and with an insulin binding antibody) protects M2 receptor function and inhibits obesity induced airway hyperreactivity. This research is significant because it has the potential to explain why obese patients with increased insulin, are more prone to asthma and identify novel strategies, including control of insulin, and M3 selective muscarinic antagonists, that may treat obesity-related asthma."
"9235966","PROJECT SUMMARY Intensity is a key factor when considering the dose of physical activity (PA) required to achieve specific health and fitness outcomes. The intensity of aerobic PA can be defined either in terms of absolute intensity or relative intensity. Absolute intensity refers to the energy or work required to perform an activity and does not take into account the exercise capacity of the individual. Relative intensity takes into account or adjusts for a person's exercise capacity. For many obese and/or unfit adults, it may not be possible to achieve moderate- intensity PA as measured on an absolute scale due to their low exercise capacity. However, these adults may be able to perform moderate-intensity PA on a relative scale. There is limited evidence regarding the dose of relative intensity PA necessary to promote and maintain health. Addressing this question has important implications regarding how individuals should monitor their PA intensity, how physicians should prescribe PA, and how exercise interventions should be designed. One reason for the limited amount of evidence on the relationship between relative intensity PA and health is the fact that it is difficult to measure relative intensity. As a result, nearly all large prospective observational studies measure PA intensity on an absolute scale. Wearable monitors (accelerometers) are widely used in both epidemiological and clinical research studies for capturing objective estimates of PA without a large participant burden. These devices convert body movement into derived accelerometer ?counts? and there are several published thresholds or cut-points for classifying PA intensity on an absolute scale based on counts. The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is an ongoing cohort study of 5,115 African American and White men and women aged 18-30 at baseline in 1985-1986. In 2005-2006, an ancillary CARDIA Fitness Study was performed on 2,760 participants aged 38 to 50 who wore accelerometers during a standardized graded exercise treadmill test and for 1 week of normal activity. Participants were subsequently re-examined in 2010-2011 and 2015-2016 to measure the development of cardiovascular disease risk factors. Using data from the CARDIA study, we will develop and validate statistical methods for objectively measuring relative intensity PA using accelerometry. Our specific aims are: 1) Develop statistical methods for calculating relative-intensity PA accelerometer cut- points and apply these methods to data from the CARDIA exercise treadmill test; 2) Use the CARDIA data to estimate the relationship between relative-intensity PA and the development of cardiometabolic disease as compared to absolute-intensity PA. 3) Investigate the generalizability of our methodology to more translational calibration settings."
"9236277","PROJECT DESCRIPTION ? This R01 proposal resubmission from The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is founded on recent work spearheaded by Dr. Daniel Thorek in close collaboration with basic science and clinical investigators. Based upon extensive preliminary and pilot data, the central hypothesis is that a novel targeted radioimmunotherapy construct, [225Ac]hu11B6, will be an important tool to treat late-stage disseminated and locally advanced prostate cancer. The monocloncal antibody hu11B6 enables highly specific targeting of active-hK2, a protease solely expressed in prostate-derived tissues and prostate carcinoma, that is tightly regulated by the androgen receptor (AR). While treatment is effective if disease is detected early, disseminated prostate cancer is incurable and claims a staggering 30,000 lives/year in the United States. To address our hypothesis that targeted alpha-particle radioimmunotherapy with [225Ac]hu11B6 can effectively ablate late- stage and disseminated disease, we propose three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1 (SA1) we establish the global pharmacokinetic profile and survival benefit of the construct in models of 1) osseous metastases and 2) novel genetically engineered models of aggressive adenocarcinoma with appropriate non-specific and excess- blocked controls. Next, in SA2 we profile the microscopic distribution and radiobiological action of [225Ac]hu11B6 in the advanced tumor setting. This rigorous approach enables us to define biological factors which influence uptake, and to evaluate treatment response at the scale upon which alpha-particle therapy exerts its effects. SA3 builds upon our extensive evaluation of the approved alpha-emitting 223Ra in models of advanced disease to use it in combination with [225Ac]hu11B6. This forms an innovative combination alpha- particle therapy strategy to enhance the efficacy of each agent by irradiating both the cancer cells and their surrounding bone metastatic microenvironment, while avoiding overlapping toxicities. The innovation of this proposal derives from the original design of the [225Ac]hu11B6 construct in addition to its evaluation in advanced models that reflect fatal late-stage disease biology. There is a clear biological mandate that AR- amplification is the mechanism by which advanced disease develops to the castrate resistant stage. The proposed approach is distinguished from contemporary targeted prostate cancer radionuclide therapies (such as PSMA- or bombesin-targeting therapies) in that it systematically targets a tumor-associated protein whose expression is exclusively associated with prostate tissue and correlates with AR-activity. These considerations directly influence the overall impact of this proposal, as we respectfully submit that we have developed a uniquely potent and specific tool to eradicate disseminated foci of disease for which there is no current treatment. As indicated by our Preliminary Data, this proposal has the potential to motivate a significant shift in the clinical management of prostate cancer."
"9237134","Project Abstract Heart disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, much of it due to ischemic injury. Mitophagy and biogenesis (mitochondrial turnover) are essential for ischemia tolerance and appropriate recovery during reperfusion. Factors that affect mitochondrial turnover include age, sex, time of day, comorbid conditions such as age and metabolic syndrome, nutritional status, exercise, and a long list of drugs and natural products. The overarching hypothesis is that monitoring mitochondrial turnover will allow us to infer a patient?s response to ischemic stress, and that normalizing turnover will improve outcome. In this proposal we develop tools to measure mitochondrial turnover (Aim I), define the regulation of mitochondrial turnover (Aim II), and leverage the knowledge gained to monitor mitochondrial turnover in the human heart during cardiopulmonary bypass (Aim III). Additionally we will measure mitochondrial function in endomyocardial biopsies of heart transplant patients, where it will be possible to relate mitochondrial function to cardiac contractility. In Aim I we will use our novel MitoTimer mice and organelle flow cytometry to develop a proteomic signature of mitophagy and biogenesis. The protein profiles will be used to create a mass spectrometry assay (multiple reaction monitoring, MRM) to infer mitochondrial turnover in tissue extracts including human heart biopsies. This index of mitophagy and biogenesis will be used to assess mitochondrial turnover in rodents in Aim I and in human heart biopsies in Aim III. In Aim II, we will delineate the regulation of mitophagy by PINK1, Parkin, and optineurin; and the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by PGC-1alpha, PARIS, and translational machinery. We have established polysome profiling to interrogate translational control of mitochondrial biogenesis. In Aim III we will use paired atrial biopsies (before and after cardiopulmonary bypass) to characterize mitophagy and biogenesis in the human heart?s response to ischemic stress; we will use paired atrial and ventricular biopsies to gain much-needed information about the differences in mitochondrial function and cardiac proteome; and we will correlate mitochondrial respirometry, mtDNA damage, and MRM assays of mitochondrial turnover to correlate with clinical parameters, specifically postoperative atrial fibrillation. These studies will establish the molecular signatures of appropriate mitochondrial turnover during cardiac surgery, providing markers of target engagement that will position us to evaluate therapeutic interventions. Importantly, understanding this pathway will reveal new therapeutic targets that regulate mitochondrial turnover and influence function of the human heart recovering from ischemia."
"9237822","Project Summary Biomarkers that predict the effects of therapeutic or preventative treatments hold great promise for im- proving health outcomes and decreasing medical costs. For example, if a treatment is thought likely to bene?t only a subset of subjects, a biomarker that identi?es these subjects can be used to recommend the treatment to them, and allow others to pursue alternatives. Potential treatment selection biomarkers, also called predictive or prescriptive biomarkers, are being produced in abundance due to technological advancements and a heightened interest in ?personalized medicine?, and yet a comprehensive statistical framework for study design and analysis of biomarker performance is lacking. We propose to build on a successful research program to develop novel statistical methods for marker identi?cation and evaluation, with the ultimate goal of advancing such a framework. Aim 1 develops novel statistical analysis methods for discovering and evaluating markers for guiding treatment. The ideal setting for marker evaluation is a randomized and controlled trial. For this setting we will develop methods that address challenges not accommodated by existing methodology. For early-phase marker studies, which are typically not random- ized trials, methods for evaluating a biomarker's potential performance do not yet exist and our research will ?ll this gap. Methods will also be developed that incorporate medical cost data into the evaluation of a biomarker. Aim 2 will develop novel study designs for discovering and evaluating markers for guiding treatment. A basic ?rst step in study design is identifying what is the desired performance of the biomarker, and we will develop techniques for this. Study designs will then be developed to assess whether a marker achieves this standard. Early-phase studies? either cohort studies or single arm trials? will be sized to evaluate a marker's potential performance. Novel randomized trial designs will be developed to de?nitively assess marker performance and will require smaller sample sizes than existing designs. A sequence of studies will be put forth for developing a biomarker, from early-phase studies of potential performance to late-phase studies of actual performance. The research will be conducted by an inter-disciplinary team of investigators with extensive expertise in biomarker evaluation, clinical trial design and analysis, health economics, and clinical research. Collaborations with cooperative groups such as the Early Detection Re- search Network, focused on biomarker discovery and evaluation, and SWOG, focused on clinical trials of cancer prevention and therapeutic strategies, will ensure that the research has immediate application and impact. Studies to which the methods will be applied include one that aims to identify women at high risk for epithelial ovarian cancer who can be recommended prophylactic removal of the fallopian tubes at the time of hysterectomy; and another that seeks to identify women with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer who are unlikely to bene?t from adjuvant chemotherapy."
"9240166","Project Abstract While studies of gap junctions often cite their fundamental importance to normal electrical activation of the heart, there is little agreement on the degree of gap junction remodeling required to slow electrical activation. Our prior work has made the following seminal observations. First, the degree of cardiac hydration can modulate whether gap junction uncoupling will be associated with measurable conduction slowing and increased arrhythmia risk. Second, the microdomain adjacent to gap junction plaques is rich in the cardiac sodium channel isoform Nav1.5, is nominally 150 nm long and 10-20 nm wide. Through the use of super- resolution microscopy, electron microscopy, optical mapping, and cutting edge computations simulations, we provided evidence that the perinexus is a strong candidate structure as the cardiac ephapse. Third, we demonstrate that the buffer used to perform ex vivo whole-heart studies can modulate both perinexal width and the relationship between cardiac conduction and gap junctions. In short, altering extracellular sodium and potassium can compensate for a 50% loss of connexin43 such that conduction appears normal. These findings are entirely consistent with the various groups that have analyzed the relationship between conduction velocity and gap junctions, so much so that it is possible by post-hoc literature analysis to determine whether a group will find conduction slowing secondary to loss of Cx43 simply by the buffer used. This work is not just important for understanding alternative modes of electrical communication, but it points out an even more sobering issue: the foundational tool of ex vivo and in vitro biology (buffers) may yield investigator dependent results simply based on ionic buffer composition. In this application we will test three new aims. 1. We will test unique computational predictions of gap junctional and ephaptic coupling to demonstrate that the conduction reserve hypothesis is unique to continuous ?cable-like? propagation, and ephaptic coupling can self-attenuate conduction when intercellular widths are very narrow. 2. We will demonstrate how changing interfibrillar and perinexal separation separately alters cardiac conduction. These findings will be compared to models of ephaptic coupling in order to further support the hypothesis that ephaptic coupling is an alternative form of electrical coupling between myocytes. 3. We provide evidence that altering perfusate ion concentration can rescue conduction to the same degree as gap junction based therapy during acidosis. In this final aim, we will determine how perfusate composition modulates electrical coupling during no-flow ischemia and complete coronary artery ligation. Also, we will test whether perfusate composition can agonize the effects of gap junction therapy during ischemia."
"9241227","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal requests 5 years of support to train Dr. Forgacs to be an independent clinical investigator, with a research focus on promoting recovery after severe brain injury in acute care settings. To advance towards these goals, Dr. Forgacs? research will characterize specific circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms important to recovery of consciousness in patients with severe anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest. A K23 award will enable him to carry out this research in the setting of a cohesive training program concentrating on specific translational research aspects of neurological recovery of patients in acute care settings, neuroimaging in clinical research and detailed training in analysis of complex multivariate data obtained during multi-modal monitoring. These career development goals will be pursued via customized tutorial interactions with his primary mentor, Dr. Nicholas Schiff and a mentoring team including Drs. Jan Claassen, Henning Voss and Jonathan Victor. The central hypothesis of the current proposal is that a specific circuit, the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (AFM) underlies the recovery of consciousness after cardiac arrest. The AFM consists of widespread connections from the central thalamus to the frontal cortex and striatum, which is modified via inputs from the basal ganglia, and has been linked to recovery of consciousness in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness primarily as a result of a traumatic brain injury. Functional integrity of AFM related to output from the central thalamus can be measured using EEG spectral analysis and 18FDG-PET. Dr. Forgacs will test this hypothesis in two patient populations with limited evidence of conscious awareness, an acute cohort (patients in the ICU after cardiac arrest), and a chronic cohort (patients who survived cardiac arrest for longer than 6 months). Specific Aim 1 will involve the acute cohort of patients and will investigate fronto-central spectral EEG features of AFM integrity in relation to bedside assessments of consciousness. Specific Aim 2 will involve the chronic cohort of patients and in addition to EEG spectral analysis this aim will also utilize 18FDG-PET and functional MRI or EEG-based assessments that are not feasible in the acute care settings. This will allow further characterization of AFM using metabolic activity patterns of AFM and correlate it with fronto-central EEG spectral features. Furthermore, fMRI/fEEG methods allow assessment of the possibility of covert conscious awareness by demonstrating motor imagery responses to auditory command in patients with limited bedside exam secondary to injury of the motor system. Studies in the chronic cohort will provide detailed characterization of these patients and thus yield further insight into the role of AFM in mechanisms of the recovery of consciousness after cardiac arrest. The outcomes of these aims are expected to provide a detailed mechanistic model of recovery mechanisms after cardiac arrest; thereby providing a basis for selecting patients with better chances for good recovery and for developing new therapeutic interventions based on neurobiological principles."
"9243354","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Acute atherosis (AA) is an inflammatory condition of the uterine spiral arteries within the placental bed that is typically confined to poorly transformed vessels. Although only a subset of women with impaired spiral artery remodeling (ISR) also have AA, the presence of AA is linked to more severe pregnancy complications such as abnormal fetal growth, early onset PE, and a greater risk of maternal and neonatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) in later life. The mechanism of AA is poorly understood, but it has been proposed that women with AA have underlying endothelial dysfunction that is uncovered during the stress of pregnancy. Moreover, subclinical infection by pro-atherogenic bacteria may be a causative factor of AA. Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) is a common periodontal pathogen that is implicated in both atherosclerotic disease and obstetric complications associated with placental bed vasculopathies such as PE and fetal growth restriction (FGR). Using a rat periodontitis model, we recently demonstrated that certain Pg strains indeed induce atherosis in the decidua/metrial triangle (placental bed) with ISR. A surprising feature of our study was that Pg infected dams with AA had large for gestational age (LGA) fetuses/pups rather than FGR as reported in the literature. This implies that Pg-induced AA is not a direct cause of FGR as suggested in the literature. A caveat of our study is that we used Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, which do not develop pro-M1 immune responses to infection during pregnancy. Whereas previous studies that reported Pg-induced FGR used rodent strains that develop pro-M1 immune responses to pathogens. Particularly relevant to our model is that women with PE especially with FGR, exhibit pro-TH1 inflammatory profiles. Based on these features we propose that the host immune response at the maternal-fetal interface is a determinant of fetal growth during Pg-induced ISR and AA. The objective of this application is to use our rodent model to define the Pg-specific and host-specific inflammatory pathways that affect spiral artery remodeling, AA, and influence fetal growth. The central aim of this proposal is to evaluate the impact of preexisting Pg infection on maternal endothelial injury, utero-placental pathology, and its effects on fetal growth in WIS and SD rats. Sub aim 1a will define the subclinical Pg-induced CVD, ISR, and AA phenotype in WIS and SD rats. Sub aim 1b will define the inflammatory profile in WIS and SD rats that is specific to FGR and LGA at gestation days 9 and 18.  Relevance to public health: Completion of these studies will provide new insights into 1) how a common pathobiont of the human oral cavity, Pg, promotes obstetric complications, and 2) how the maternal immune response at the maternal-fetal interface, influences fetal growth in the presence of AA."
"9242529","The mission of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) is to advance the progress of medicine and improve the public health by: 1) providing all U.S. health professionals with equal access to biomedical information resources; and, 2) improving the public's access to information systems and information resources to enable them to make informed decisions about their health. The Program is coordinated by the National Library of Medicine and carried out through a nationwide network of health science libraries and information centers. The Network comprises eight geographic regions, with a contract for one Regional Medical Library to manage program activities for each region. This contract is for the RML for Region 2, which is located within and provides services to the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The NN/LM goals are: to develop collaborations among network members and other organizations to improve access to and sharing of biomedical information resources throughout the nation; to promote awareness of, access to, and use of biomedical information resources for health professionals and the public, with a particular emphasis on contributing to the Healthy People 2020 goal of eliminating health disparities; and to develop, promote, and improve electronic access to health information by network members, health professionals, and organizations providing health information to the public. A. Network Infrastructure. Each RML is expected to maintain a level of programs and services to continue supporting the infrastructure of the network. Included are activities related to planning, promoting, and implementing services within the region; coordinating the activities of the region with other regions and within the national program; and serving as a contact point for the region in relation to other library and information networks or health organizations and professional associations. The network infrastructure supports health sciences libraries' collaborations with a variety of organizations, including other health sciences libraries as well as affiliate member organizations. Collaborations with affiliate network members such as public libraries and community-based organizations often lead to outreach projects with broad community impact. Specifically the contractor shall undertake the following: Develop and implement a program designed to provide health professionals in all parts of the Region with a basic level of information services; provide document delivery to provide health professionals; assess and respond to the needs of health sciences libraries in order to support programs to improve the transfer of health care and biomedical information within their institutions and through their participation in the network; assist NLM with the implementation of a National Emergency Preparedness Plan; obtain ongoing feedback from users about their information system and information resources preferences, needs and uses, and recommend ways of improving health professional and consumer access to information; conduct or participate in needs assessments or surveys of users and non users of NLM; assist Network members with negotiating e-licensing agreements; develop programs to assist the information professional in promoting evidence based health information in the institution; and assist NLM in identifying and increasing access to collections of historical and unique materials related to the health sciences. B. Outreach Programs. Each RML will implement an outreach program designed to provide health professionals in all parts of the region with basic information services, by maintaining or by negotiating arrangements with libraries willing to serve individuals without a library affiliation. Health professional outreach programs include targeted programs to make underserved rural, minority, and inner city health professionals aware of available health information resources (including PubMed and other specialized NLM databases). In the development of programs to improve the public's access to health information, the RMLs will work with network libraries, state library agencies, state, public and school libraries, community-based organizations, as well as other regional, state, and local organizations that provide health information to the public. Outreach efforts will focus on MedlinePlus and PubMed as resources for locating health information. Outreach programs encompass the following types of activities: 1. Outreach to Health Professionals and Public Health Workers. The contractor shall continue to develop, implement, and evaluate targeted outreach programs to bring biomedical information resources within easy reach of U.S. health professionals and the public health workforce, who are not directly affiliated with an institution with a medical library, with special focus on those in rural, inner cities, Medically Underserved Areas (MUA), and minority health practitioners or those who serve minority populations. The RML outreach program shall focus on: special populations or subject disciplines that have been identified as priority initiatives (e.g., health disparities, consumer health, health information literacy, HIV/AIDS, health services research, toxicology and environmental health); local/state public health departments with particular emphasis on Internet access and collaborations with other organizations/institutions that work with public health personnel; and institutions whose objective is to train minority health practitioners or those who serve minority populations; and to develop culturally and linguistically appropriate resources and provide training in the effective use of electronic health information resources. Health professionals serving minority populations have a special set of problems in accessing information. 2. Consumer Health Information Services. NLM's mission includes providing timely, accurate, and understandable consumer health information to help patients, their families, and the public play a more active role in managing their health and health care. An NLM outreach goal is to reduce health disparities among African American, Hispanic, American Indian and Alaskan Native, and other minority populations through training to promote access to and use of health information among diverse communities. The contractor shall develop, implement, and evaluate outreach programs to increase the public's awareness of and access to high quality electronic health information. In carrying out these programs, the contractor shall work with a variety of intermediaries, including network members, health professionals, public health workers, information professionals, educators, community, faith-based, volunteer, and other types of organizations, including those serving minorities, special and underserved populations, health advocacy and self-help groups. The NN/LM consumer health outreach program shall include: developing programs that reach special populations (e.g. minorities, seniors, teens, veterans' groups, low income populations, etc.), focus on special topics (e.g. health disparities, health information literacy, HIV/AIDS, public health, culturally and linguistically appropriate information, personal health records, emergency preparedness, etc.); promoting NLM resources to consumers; fostering collaborations and encourage outreach partnerships among Network members, community, faith-based, and volunteer organizations to improve access to electronic consumer health information at the local, state, and regional levels; developing culturally and linguistically appropriate resources; providing training in the effective use of electronic health information resources; and developing pilot projects to identify and promote the roles of libraries in institutions that have received or are seeking NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) with a focus on community engagement. 3. Training to Support Electronic Access to Health Information. The contractor shall support training in the effective use of electronic health information resources on the Internet. Emphasis should be on reaching health professionals, public, school and other librarians, and other intermediaries who do not have access to such training or who intend to train others, including consumers. Training should focus on topics not available through other sources and should include, but not be limited to: PubMed, MedlinePlus, and other specialized NLM databases; and finding and evaluating health information resources on the Web. 4. Technology Improvement. The contractor shall develop and implement an NN/LM technology improvement program, if needed, to encourage high quality health information access and delivery to Network members, health professionals and consumers in the Region. Emphasis should be on the ?underconnected,? particularly in inner city and rural health organizations, to upgrade and maintain technology access."
"9244990","Project Summary  It is estimated that 7 million children live in households in which severe parental intimate partner violence (IPV) is occurring and that well over 150,000 marriage dissolutions involve child witnesses to parental IPV in the US each year. Children who are exposed to parental IPV are at increased risk of internalizing problems, externalizing behavior problems, post-traumatic stress disorder, concurrent child maltreatment (CM), and other adverse outcomes compared to children living in households without parental IPV. Importantly, especially from a primary prevention standpoint, exposure to parental IPV during childhood and being a victim of CM are the strongest known predictors of perpetration of and victimization by an intimate partner in adulthood. The totality of these findings points to the critical need for ensuring the fulfillment of legal protections awarded in the context of marriage dissolution for IPV victims and their children. One potential intervention for improving the safety and future well-being of IPV victims and their children is to award greater protections in child custody and visitation plans to lessen children's continued exposure to parental IPV, conflict and concurrent CM. Results from a parent study show that attorney representation of the IPV victim resulted in greater legal protections being awarded in child custody and visitation orders. Despite the widespread use of and call for greater protections in child custody matters involving a parent with a history of IPV perpetration, we know of no studies that have examined whether legal representation of the IPV victim and the legal protections awarded in child custody and visitation result in lower rates of abuse following marriage dissolution from an abusive partner.  The proposed study was designed to address this critical gap in IPV research by accomplishing the following specific aims:  1. Evaluate if the rates of post-marriage dissolution IPV and CM are lower for families in which the IPV victim was legally represented than those in which the IPV victim was unrepresented, propensity score matched counterparts.  2. Assess specific conditions of child custody and visitation orders for their association with lower rates of post-dissolution IPV and CM independent of legal representation status of the IPV victim in marriage dissolution proceedings.  3. Examine specific conditions of child custody and visitation orders for their effect in mediating the relationship between legal representation of the IPV victim in dissolution proceedings and post-dissolution IPV and CM."

"9248172","Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine essential for the development and progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although GM-CSF is mainly produced by pathogenic Th17 and Th1 cells, GM-CSF receptor (GM-CSFR) is not expressed on T and B cells, but is expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Among them, Ly6ChiCCR2+ monocytes are essential for the pathogenic role of GM-CSF in EAE. Further, GM- CSF signaling in peripheral, but not CNS cells, plays a vital role in the development of acute EAE. However, whether lack of GM-CSF signaling results in development of immunoregulatory APCs has not been studied, and the role of GM-CSF signaling in CNS cells in EAE chronicity, for which microglia activation plays a major role, remains unknown.  Our preliminary results for the first time show enhanced production of immunoregulatory molecules in APCs, and increased IL-10 and Foxp3 expression in CD4+ T cells of mice lacking GM-CSF. Similarly, neutralizing GM-CSF in human monocyte culture results in an increase of IL-27 and TGF-? production. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that GM-CSF induces proinflammatory monocytes, whereas its blockade results in the induction of immunoregulatory APCs and suppression of EAE. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of GM-CSF on phenotype of APCs and T cells in EAE. We will test the hypothesis that blockade of GM-CSF signaling in monocytes leads to the development of immunoregulatory APCs that promote development of Tr1/Treg cells, resulting in suppression of EAE. 2) To investigate the effect of GM-CSF on the phenotype of microglia/macrophages in chronic phase of EAE. We will test our hypothesis that GM-CSF promotes activation and pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype of macrophages/microglia in chronic phase of EAE, which contributes to disease chronicity. 3) To determine the effects of blocking GM-CSF on phenotype and function of human monocytes. We will test the hypothesis that GM-CSF promotes development of a proinflammatory phenotype of human monocytes. These studies should fill the gap in our knowledge on mechanisms of proinflammatory action of GM- CSF and its relevant cellular targets in EAE/MS, with potential therapeutic effect in certain autoimmune diseases."
"9255086","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States and the number one leading cause of long-term disability in adults. Thrombolytic agents are available for acute treatment, but their efficacy is modest and their use is limited due to temporal restrictions on administration. Inflammation in stroke is characterized by the activation of glial cells and an influx of peripheral immune cells. Microglia, the resident immune cells in the CNS, play a significant role in the neuroinflammatory response to ischemia. Although microglial activation has typically been considered a pro-inflammatory process, recent publications suggest that microglia could play a protective role in stroke. Progress in the development of effective pharmacotherapies for acute stroke has been limited and centered on neuronal preservation despite extensive and robust data implicating glial cells, including microglia, in the pathophysiology of ischemic injury. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is a brief period of ischemia that confers robust neuroprotection against subsequent ischemic events. Elucidating the mechanisms of IPC is considered a critical challenge in stroke research. Recent studies, including from our group, has implicated innate immune pathways, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling in IPC mediated protection. In this study we will characterize the potent IPC-like neuroprotective effects of IFN? administration prior to stroke using a variety of methods, including transgenic mice with either systemic IFNAR1 knockout or microglial-specific IFNAR1 knockdown. These studies will help us better understand the role of type 1 IFN signaling in IPC with a focus on microglia specifically. Using immunofluorescent microscopy/in situ hybridization as well as ex vivo flow cytometry techniques, we will also address key mechanistic questions, such as which CNS cell types are producing type I IFNs in response to ischemia, and which cell types are responding to type I IFNs. The overall goal of this project is to characterize the cell type specific contribution of type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling in microglia, infiltrating macrophages, astroctyes, oligodendrocytes and neurons to both IPC- and IFN-induced neuroprotection. Identification of the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms of IPC may hold the key to unlocking a rich source of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in acute stroke."

"9264214","Nerve injury dramatically increases NPY expression in sensory neurons and NPY receptor-mediated analgesia, yet this is underappreciated as a potential pain relief mechanism that might prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain. Among 35 original research articles, reviews, and a book published during the previous funding cycle (28 as first or senior authors), our work published in PNAS discovered that intrathecal NPY receptor antagonists or conditional genetic NPY depletion reinstated hyperalgesia, even when applied months after nerve injury or inflammation. Our overall hypothesis is that injury induces a sustained release of NPY and activation of NPY Y1 receptor signaling that opposes the transition to a chronic state of lasting pain vulnerability. However, whether tissue- or nerve-injury induced increases in spinal NPY Y1 receptor (Y1R) signaling is associated with a tonic increase in the releasable pool of NPY has been difficult to determine. To address this gap, we developed a new in situ assay of functional NPY release (Y1R internalization). Our new data indicate that Y1R internalization is greater with nerve injury after high frequency electrical stimulation of dorsal horn slices or after in vivo non-noxious stimulation of the hindpaw. Specific Aim 1 will use this novel method to test the hypothesis that non-noxious stimulus-evoked release of NPY from A-fibers will remain primed for weeks and even months after nerve injury. We now report that NPY produces an outward current and inhibits action potentials evoked by dorsal root stimulation (DRS) in Y1-EGFP labeled neurons. To test the hypothesis that injury increases synaptic inhibition by NPY, Specific Aim 2A will patch-clamp lamina II neurons and conduct Fura-2 [Ca2+]i imaging at peak of hyperalgesia after injury. We predict that Y1R agonists will inhibit stimulus-evoked responses and their concentration-response curves will be left-shifted by injury. Our progress with NPY saporin-conjugated neurotoxin indicates that Y1R-expressing dorsal horn neurons contribute to neuropathic pain, and new double-label immunohistochemistry and patch-clamp electrophysiology data in Y1R-EGFP mice support the concept that Y1R-positive neurons are excitatory. To test the hypothesis that Y1R-expressing neurons maintain LS after inflammation or nerve injury, but are held in check by NPY, Specific Aim 2B will evaluate the effects of Y1 receptor antagonists on [Ca2+]i mobilization and NMDA or AMPA receptor currents in Y1R-expressing neurons upon dorsal root stimulation or laser-directed NMDA/AMPA uncaging. Specific Aim 3 will then use an intrathecal pharmacology approach to determine whether NPY silences pronociceptive GluN? AC1? Epac signaling on Y1R-expressing dorsal horn neurons and TRPA1? TRPV1 signaling on central afferents terminals. Completion of this project will bring us closer to our long-term goal of alleviating chronic pain by either: a) facilitating endogenous NPY analgesia, thus restricting pain within a state of remission; or b) extinguishing spinal neuron sensitization altogether, for example with a selective AC1 or Epac1 inhibitor."
"9275437","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Up to one third of the 700,000 men and women who served in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm during the 1990-1991 Gulf War (GW) have developed a chronic multisystem illness known as Gulf War Veterans' Illness (GWVI). Neurobehavioral findings include memory problems, executive system deficits, slowed motor and processing speeds, sustained attention deficits, reduced visuospatial skills and psychomotor dysfunction. Given the spectrum of cognitive deficits noted above, combined with evidence of structural and functional abnormalities on neuroimaging, it is likely that neuropathological changes also occur in GWVI. Several environmental exposures have been implicated as potential contributors to GWVI including exposure to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as pyridostigmine bromide (PB; anti-nerve gas pills) and organophosphate (OP) pesticides/nerve agents (e.g., sarin/cyclosarin). The pattern of deficits may be related to whether GWV were exposed to OP nerve agents as well as their premorbid vulnerability (e.g., PON1 status) to such exposures. GWV may also be at higher risk for developing a progressive neurodegenerative disorder    such as Alzheimer's Disease as they age. Some studies suggest that accelerated aging may occur in GWVI related to axonal transport deficits, increased axial diffusivity, increased WM anisotropy on diffusion tensor imaging and insulin resistance and/or metabolic syndrome. Findings of reduced hippocampal volume in GWV suggest that that the pattern of deficits may be consistent the development of an Alzheimer-type dementia. This is important to investigate because the GWV cohort in general is aging; 52% of GWV are age 45 and older and 16% are age 55 to 85+. In addition, recent evidence suggests that an unexpectedly large number of GW veterans sustained traumatic brain injuries (TBI) so they may also be at risk for long term sequelae such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Given the issues raised above, there is a critical need for a GWVI CNS tissue biorepository that will conduct extensive ante mortem longitudinal assessments on enrolled GWV.    Our first specific aim is to establish a VA GWVIB as a national resource to support research on the etiology and pathogenesis of GWRI and our second aim is to perform selected psychometric and biological assessments on enrollees to maximize the value of tissue donated to the GWVIB. Well-characterized CNS tissue when combined with antemortem health data and biological assessments (such as ApoE genotype and serum PON1 activity) will be invaluable to advance research on GWVI. The GWVIB will be a multi-site collaboration among VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) and the Southern Arizona VA Healthcare System (SAVAHCS). The GWVIB will utilize strengths across the Boston and Tucson sites in enrollment, tissue collection, processing, storage, neuropathological diagnosis, medical informatics and data management. VABHS will serve as the operations/data coordinating center and conduct the neuropathological diagnostic analyses, with SAVAHCS contributing expertise in CNS tissue processing and storage. SAVAHCS will also coordinate CNS tissue distribution. Notable enhancements to be initiated are the utilization of an active versus passive recruitment approach, enlarging our collection of tissue from Veteran controls through a collaboration with the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI), and improved outreach to investigators to increase the utilization of the GWVIB in GWI research. This will allow us to leverage the substantial investment of VA resources already in place at GWVIB and to add value to existing clinical and CNS tissue resources."

"9287915","This genetic toxicology testing contract has supported the overall mission of NTP to provide detailed toxicological profiles, including potential for carcinogenicity, of compounds of interest for 30 years. Assessment of genetic damage, an important factor in the etiology of cancer as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, neurological conditions such as autism, aging, birth defects such as Down syndrome, mitochondrial diseases, and other adverse human health effects, is a critical component of any in-depth toxicological profile of a chemical or product. This Genetic Toxicity Testing contract provides information on exposure-related genetic damage to NTP using standard tests as well as innovative protocols when necessary. The capabilities of the contract are continuously updated to remain current and compatible with international guidelines for conducting these kinds of tests. Testing systems employed include both in vitro (animal cell-based and bacterial) and in vivo (rats and mice) assays. In vivo studies using human blood samples can also be conducted to translate findings from animal studies to human exposure scenarios. Three main tests are conducted routinely: in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays, in vivo rodent peripheral blood micronucleus (MN) assays, and in vivo rodent DNA damage (Comet) assays in multiple tissues including, for example, liver, brain, stomach, kidney, and lung. Using peripheral blood as the sample source, MN and Comet studies can also be conducted in humans. In addition, in vitro MN assays have become increasingly used as a substitute for stand-alone in vivo rodent MN assays. An animal mutation endpoint that holds promise for application in human clinical and biomonitoring studies in the future, has been investigated in the testing laboratory: the pig-a mutation assay (phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class A gene). Mutations in this gene are easily detected in red blood cell samples from laboratory rodents, and updated methods to streamline the assay have been developed, so that integration into existing toxicity tests can easily be accomplished. In future studies we plan to multiplex this assay with the in vivo MN and Comet assays, increasing the genetic damage information we obtain from test animals to provide an even more comprehensive profile of the genetic toxicity potential of a chemical. In addition to our cell-based and animal model studies, human blood samples provided by collaborators such as NIOSH and the NIEHS Clinical Research Unit may also be examined for specific genetic endpoints following an environmental exposure that is suspected of inducing genetic damage, or has been shown to do so in NTP animal studies. The number of studies of each type described above varies annually, depending on the needs of the NTP. For example, this past year, the NTP genetic toxicity testing laboratory conducted innovative in vitro chromosomal damage studies with 14 cohosh samples (botanical products) to provide mechanistic information to support the previously observed induction of MN in rats and mice, and to provide insight into the NTP?s MN investigations that are currently ongoing in women who are using this product. These tests were in addition to the usual number of studies planned annually."

"9276328","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing health problem worldwide and currently available treatments are of limited efficacy. Prevention of AD may be a more relevant goal, particularly in lower and middle-income countries. Studies of AD prevention however, are challenging, in part because of the unpredictable onset of the disease in elderly individuals. Persons inheriting mutations causing fully-penetrant autosomal dominant familial AD (FAD) provide an informative and motivated population for assessing the efficacy of AD prevention strategies. The PI has been working with clinician investigators in Mexico for 10 years, characterizing multiple families with FAD due to PSEN1 or APP mutations. Multi-center collaborative efforts to perform prevention trials in preclinical persons carrying FAD mutations are underway (the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network in which the PI is a site investigator and the Alzheimer Prevention Initiative) but such efforts have not reached Mexico. The capacity to perform FAD prevention trials in Mexico may be limited due to lack of understanding among families and physicians of the disease and its genetic nature as well as by the availability of infrastructure including personnel appropriately trained to perform such studies. The goal of this project is to enhance the ability of Mexican investigators to perform such studies through the following specific aims: Aim 1) Enhance local capacity to perform quality cognitive, clinical, imaging, and biochemical assessments as outcome measures for prevention trials in Mexico. This project will be the planning stage in which the possibility of exchange programs wherein health professionals from Mexico come to the UCLA to receive specialty training in dementia diagnosis, management, and research will be explored. Aim 2) Investigate attitudes towards and promote education regarding AD, genetics, FAD, and prevention trial procedures among members of families with FAD in Mexico.

This objective is accomplished through re-examination of each of the three Framingham cohorts (Original, Offspring, Generation III) for measurement of complex phenotypes; through rapid distribution of DNA for extensive and focused genotyping; for rapid distribution of genetic and phenotypic measurements for use by investigators internal and external to the Framingham Study; and through analyses of the contribution of genes, new and established risk factors, and innovative biomarkers to the development and progression of subclinical and clinical disease. Starting in late 2009, the Framingham Omni cohorts will be integrated into the contract for the Framingham Heart Study. The Omni cohort participants, consisting of minority residents of Framingham, MA, were recruited by Framingham Heart Study investigators in 1994-1995 (Omni Cohort 1) and 2003-2005 (Omni Cohort 2) to complement the study and reflect the growing diversity of that community. The Omni cohorts consisted of Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and a few American Indians. Three examinations and one examination were conducted on the Omni Cohort 1 and Omni Cohort 2, respectively, with funding provided through NIH grants to Boston University. By integrating the Omni cohort into the Framingham Heart Study contract, the Omni cohorts will consistently receive the same surveillance and examination as the rest of the Framingham Heart Study participants.

"9368961","Gastric cancer (GC) is the 4th most common incident cancer and the 2nd leading cause of cancer death worldwide.1 Approximately 990,000 people are diagnosed with GC worldwide, of whom close to 75% die from this disease.2 GC also is responsible for one of the highest cancer burdens, as determined by disability-adjusted life years lost.3 Despite the overall decrease in the incidence of GC since the 1930s, the annual global burden of cancer is projected to double by 2030 to 22.2 million incident cases and 13.1 million deaths, with over two-thirds of the burden in resource-limited nations.4, 5 In the US, the American Cancer Society estimates that in 2015 24,590 new cases of GC will be diagnosed and approximately 10,720 individuals will die from this type of cancer.6 The average risk that a person will develop GC in his/her lifetime is about 1 in 111, with the risk being 2 to 3-fold higher in men than women. However, GC incidence rates vary dramatically across different countries and are higher in less developed countries.2 GC is more common in East Asia, Southern and Eastern Europe, and South and Central America whereas the lowest incidence rates are observed in Africa and North America.7 Although nearly 60% of the new GC cases are diagnosed in Asia,8 significantly better outcomes have been reported among Asian individuals compared to those diagnosed in Western countries.9 Five-year GC survival rates are 40% lower in the US and Europe compared to Japan.10   With the high GC mortality-to-incidence ratio and the lack of routine screening methods available for asymptomatic individuals, the management of GC remains a challenge and warrants further investigations to more fully understand the biologic basis of progression and to develop chemopreventive strategies for individuals at increased risk.  Curcumin is a phenolic antioxidant compound derived from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa. This bioflavonoid is a potent inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism, and blocks both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase activity in the intestinal mucosa. Curcumin exerts a variety of additional immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects and is thought to have broad chemopreventive potential through a variety of molecular mechanisms and cellular pathways, as recently reviewed.11  The investigators (Drs. Cruz-Correa & Morgan) from the Mayo Consortium are proposing a chemopreventive trial on a population at risk for gastric cancer (GC) using Meriva (a liposome-encapsulated formulation of curcumin) and placebo. The hypothesis is that curcumin given to individuals with gastric precancerous lesions ? multifocal atrophic gastritis (MAG) & intestinal metaplasia (IM) will have a decrease in markers of inflammation including DNA damage, as compared to placebo, after six months of taking the study agent.  Meriva (Curcumin) is a patented formula of curcumin that includes a dietary phenolic with soy lecithin (non-GMO).

"9313761","A 1996 congressional mandate founded the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pain Consortium (www.painconsortium.nih.gov). The NIH Pain Consortium includes representatives from 24 NIH Institutes and Centers. Its purpose is to coordinate the NIH's pain research and dissemination activities. In 2010, the NIH Pain Consortium held a workshop on the state of pain education in the education of future health care providers, including medical, dental, nursing, and pharmacy schools. The findings of this workshop were distressing. Although pain is the most commonly problem faced in medical practice, it receives relatively little attention in the education of health care providers. For example, on average, medical students receive only 8 hours of training on how to measure, diagnose, and treat pain. Relatedly, pain often is poorly treated, with some patients receiving the wrong pain treatment or far less medication than is warranted to provide relief, and others receiving too much medication, which places the patient at a high risk of addiction to pain medications. This situation is especially problematic since 100 million people in the United States suffer from persistent pain, and prescription pain medication abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, with nearly 15,000 people dying each year as a result of In an effort to help improve pain treatment while reducing the prescription pain medication epidemic, the NIH Pain Consortium, in an effort led by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), created an initiative to increase pain education in medical, nursing, pharmacy, and dental schools across our nation. The plan included support of Pain Champions at health care schools, who were people in these institutions who already realized the need to increase pain education, and could, with support from the NIH Pain Consortium, increase pain education in their institutions. The NIH Pain Consortium also remains committed to increasing and improving pain education even beyond the institutions that receive associated NIH funding. Thus, the funded Pain Champions are required to create interactive teaching tools, which other institutions can freely download and use to teach their students about pain and its treatment. the abuse of prescription pain medication. Key people in these health care crises are health care providers, who in general lack the necessary training to adequately treat pain or identify and minimize the risks of pain medication abuse or diversion by their patients. While the NIH Pain Consortium was building support for this initiative, the Institute of Medicine released a report mandated by the Affordable Care Act titled Relieving PAIN America. A Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education, and Research. Education of health care providers on treating pain was a major emphasis of this report. Two recommendations in particular were: ? Recommendation 4-2 Improve curriculum and education for health care professionals. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Service Administration, accrediting organizations, and undergraduate and graduate health professions training programs should improve pain education curricula for health care professionals, and ? Recommendation 4-3. Increase the number of health professionals with advanced expertise in pain care. Educational programs for medical, dental, nursing, mental health, physical therapy, pharmacy, and other health professionals who will participate in the delivery of pain care should have increased capacity to train providers who can offer advanced pain care. With this additional mandate and guideline, in 2012 the NIH Pain Consortium selected certain health professional schools as designated Centers of Excellence in Pain Education (CoEPEs). The CoEPEs are acting as hubs for the development, assessment, and distribution of pain management curriculum resources for medical, dental, nursing, and pharmacy schools to enhance and improve the teaching of health care professionals about pain and its treatment. These CoEPEs are increasing pain education in their institutions. They represent approximately 100 teaching units (departments, universities, teaching hospitals, etc.). They also are creating interactive web-based teaching modules for use in the CoEPEs and any other interested teaching institutions.

"9339109","Acute cardiac allograft cellular rejection remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality within the first year after heart transplantation. Afterwards, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), as a result of chronic vascular rejection, is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Within the first year post-transplantation, almost two-thirds of recipients will experience at least one rejection episode and approximately one third of these patients will have multiple episodes. At five years post-transplantation, nearly 50% of survivors will have CAV. The clinical symptoms of acute cellular rejection (ACR) are relatively nonspecific (fatigue, dyspnea, low grade fever). Most CAV patients remain asymptomatic until they develop serious problems such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, ventricular dysrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. No widely accepted noninvasive method exists for the accurate diagnosis of acute or chronic cardiac rejection. Noninvasive methods such as electrocardiography, echocardiography, and nuclear imaging all have been studied, but have been unsuccessful, thus far, for either condition. The current gold standard for the diagnosis of ACR remains right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy (EBx), an invasive method of diagnosis subject to morbidity and random sampling and interpretation error. Likewise, the gold standard for diagnosing CAV is cardiac catheterization with intravascular ultrasound, an invasive procedure also subject to morbidity.  We are applying functional genomics, detection of donor DNA, and peptidomics to study ACR and CAV. By correlating putative biomarkers with clinical, histological, and imaging based evidence of allograft disease we hope to build a database comprised of genomic and peptidomic data relevant to the immunologic relationship between the donor organ and recipient.  Our group has developed and tested standard laboratory procedures for sample processing and if necessary transcriptome amplification. We have established laboratory and bioinformatics infrastructure to support oligonucleotide microarray investigations.  Published reports have established that detection of donor DNA in recipients blood can serve as a diagnostic tool of graft injury. The level of donor DNA measured as percentage of circulating cell-free donor DNA (%ccfdDNA) has the potential to accurately diagnose acute rejection with a high sensitivity and specificity, possibly at times earlier than the diagnosis obtained by conventional EBxs. The ability of cell free DNA to diagnose graft injury early opens a new window to re-examine markers of rejection. These markers are traditionally evaluated using biopsy results, often positive late during rejection. %ccfdDNA offers an opportunity to better characterize our analyses. In collaboration with the NHLBI Laboratory of Transplantation Genomics, we are embarking on biomarker discovery using our collected samples and their recently developed genomic approaches.  Peptidomics has emerged as a viable and promising diagnostic tool and has been applied to diseases such as tuberculosis and chemotherapy-induced heart disease.  This tool, has been used to identify peptide biomarkers of diagnostic and prognostic significance in these disease entities.  In collaboration with the Peptidomic Nanoengineering Core at The Houston Methodist Hospital Research Institute we are embarking on biomarker discovery using our collected samples and their recently developed peptidomic techniques.    Blood and urine specimens were obtained serially from heart transplant recipients during periods of immunological tolerance of the allograft (no ACR) and immunologic intolerance of the allograft (ACR) and from heart transplant recipients with and without CAV. The samples will be analyzed to determine whether unique gene and/or protein/peptide expression patterns are associated with each state. In the latter phase of the project we hope to translate these profiles into an acceptable test for acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection. In addition to developing a biomarker approach to the diagnosis of rejection in cardiac transplant patients, expression profiling has the potential to identify immunoregulatory pathways that can serve as new targets for immunosuppressive therapy (rational drug development).  In 2010, we processed 64 samples for high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis. In the latter part of 2010, a second batch containing 168 samples was processed to TRNA, the required step before going to microarrays. In 2011, an additional 139 samples were processed to TRNA and 89 samples further processed for high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis. In October 2011 through August 2012 reporting period we processed 44 samples to TRNA and processed 397 TRNA samples to a RNA stable state. In the 2012 - 2013 reporting period we processed an additional 30 samples to TRNA. In the 2013-2014 reporting period we obtained an additional 17 blood samples temporally related to 17 heart biopsies and processed 64 prior samples to TRNA. In 2014-2015, we obtained 15 blood samples temporally related to 15 heart biopsies.  Over the current reporting period (201516) we shared a subset of our plasma (1,205) and urine samples (74) with the NHLBI Laboratory of Transplantation Genomics. One hundred and one of the plasma samples have been analyzed to date for cell free DNA. The remainder await external validation of biopsy specimens to confirm rejection status before proceeding further. The urine samples are being analyzed to determine the physical properties of cell-free DNA in urine to aid in protocol development.  In addition, during the 2015-16 reporting period we entered into a collaborative biomarker discovery study with the Peptidomic Nanoengineering Core at The Houston Methodist Hospital. The goal is to identify markers of graft injury as well as markers that can identify the cause of injury. Our protocol has created at NIH a bio-bank of samples from transplant patients with well-characterized clinical phenotypes. Under a Materials Transfer Agreement executed on August 14, 2015, we are in the process of sharing a subset (639) of our plasma samples with the Houston group. We are waiting for external validation of biopsy specimens to confirm rejection status before shipping samples.  During the 2015-16 reporting period the protocol was closed (Oct 29, 2015) to new transplant candidates with a total enrollment of 187 subjects. At that time there remained 4 subjects we were following from the transplant waitlist who had not been transplanted. Two were inactive and two were awaiting transplant. As of December 15, 2015 we no longer obtain samples with biopsies from those we follow that have been transplanted. In addition, as of December 15, 2015 we no longer follow the subjects who remain on the transplant wait list as it is doubtful they will be transplanted and obtain 1 year of follow-up data before we finish the analyses in progress. We continue to follow clinical information (i.e. survival) and also continue to recruit healthy volunteers to match our remaining unmatched patients.  The protocol has obtained a minimum of one year of sample collections from all patients being actively followed that have been transplanted. We have collected blood and urine samples during 621 EBxs. On average from each biopsy time point we stored 5 plasma tubes, 4 serum tubes, 1 tube of RNA, and 1 urine sample.  Two abstracts were presented at the 2016 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 36th Annual Meeting (Urine Cell-Free Donor-Derived DNA after Heart Transplantation.

"9339122","During the fiscal year we accomplished the following:  1. During development, the Hippo signaling pathway regulates key physiological processes, such as control of organ size, regeneration and stem cell biology. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a major transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo pathway. The scaffold protein IQGAP1 interacts with more than 100 binding partners to integrate diverse signaling pathways. We showed that IQGAP1 binds to YAP and modulates its activity. IQGAP1 and YAP co-immunoprecipitated from cells. In vitro analysis with pure proteins demonstrated a direct interaction between IQGAP1 and YAP. Analysis with multiple fragments of each protein showed that the interaction occurs via the IQ domain of IQGAP1 and the TEAD-binding domain of YAP. The interaction between IQGAP1 and YAP has functional effects. Knockout of endogenous IQGAP1 significantly increased the formation of nuclear YAP/TEAD complexes. Transcription assays were performed with IQGAP1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and HEK293 cells with IQGAP1 knockdown by CRISPR/Cas9. Quantification demonstrated that YAP/TEAD-mediated transcription in cells lacking IQGAP1 was significantly greater than in control cells. These data reveal that IQGAP1 binds to YAP and modulates its co-transcriptional function, suggesting that IQGAP1 participates in Hippo signaling.   2. Helicobacter pylori infection is responsible for gastric carcinogenesis, but host factors also contribute. We showed that 1 year after infection with H. pylori, IQGAP1+/- mice developed more preneoplastic lesions and 8-fold more gastrointestinal neoplasia than littermate control mice. In vitro, IQGAP1 knockdown favored the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype and cancer stem cell-like properties induced by H. pylori infection. These findings indicate that alterations in IQGAP1 signaling promote the emergence of cancer stem cells and the development of gastric adenocarcinoma in the context of H. pylori infection.  3. In signaling, Rho-family GTPases bind effector proteins and alter their behavior. We solved the crystal structure of Cdc42GTP bound to the GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) of IQGAP2. Four molecules of Cdc42 are bound to two GRD molecules, which bind each other in a parallel dimer. Two Cdc42s bind very similarly to the Ras/RasGAP interaction, while the other two bind primarily to extra domain sequences from both GRDs, tying the GRDs together. Calorimetry confirmed two-site binding of Cdc42GTP for the GRDs of both IQGAP2 and IQGAP1. Mutation of important extra domain residues reduced binding to single-site and abrogated Cdc42 binding to a much larger IQGAP1 fragment. Importantly, Rac1GTP displays only single-site binding to the GRDs, indicating that just Cdc42 promotes IQGAP dimerization. The structure identifies an unexpected role for Cdc42 in protein dimerization thus expanding the repertoire of interactions of Ras family proteins with their targets.  4. The intracellular bacterial pathogen Shigella infects and spreads through the human intestinal epithelium. Effector proteins delivered by Shigella into cells promote infection by modulating diverse host functions. We demonstrated that the effector protein OspB interacts directly with the scaffolding protein IQGAP1, and that the absence of either OspB or IQGAP1 during infection leads to larger areas of S. flexneri spread through cell monolayers. We showed that the effect on the area of bacterial spread is due to OspB triggering increased cell proliferation at the periphery of infected foci, thereby replacing some of the cells that die within infected foci and restricting the area of bacterial spread. We demonstrated that OspB enhancement of cell proliferation results from activation of mTORC1, a master regulator of cell growth, and is blocked by the mTORC1-specific inhibitor rapamycin. OspB activation of mTORC1, and its effects on cell proliferation and bacterial spread, depends on IQGAP1. Our results identify OspB as a regulator of mTORC1 and mTORC1-dependent cell proliferation early during S. flexneri infection and establish a role for IQGAP1 in mTORC1 signaling. They also raise the possibility that IQGAP1 serves as a scaffold for the assembly of an OspB-mTORC1 signaling complex."

"9352023","Although shock resistant to conventional hemodynamic support with fluids and vasopressors contributed to death in all five non-survivors in the 2001 United States anthrax outbreak, its mechanisms and optimal management remain unclear. Lethal (LeTx) and edema (ETx) toxin are major contributors to the pathogenesis of anthrax. Both LeTx and ETx consist of protective antigen (PA), which is necessary for cellular uptake of the toxic moities; lethal factor (LF) for LeTx and edema factor (EF) for ETx. Lethal factor is a zinc metalloproteinase that inhibits mitogen activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKK1-4, 6 and 7) while EF is a calmodulin dependent adenyl cyclase. Recent research has shown that LeTx and ETx produce cellular changes different from those associated with more commonly encountered bacterial toxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the exotoxins of gram-positive organisms like S. aureus. Despite this research, there has been limited in vivo work defining these toxins cardiovascular effects. Furthermore, although there have been major efforts to develop and test new toxin directed agents, little attention has been paid to the efficacy of conventional fluid, vasopressor and inotrope support during anthrax toxin associated shock. Work done largely in our laboratory suggests these responses may be difficult to predict.   In a rat model, 24 h LeTx infusion produced lethality and shock, but it did not alter circulating inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide or catecholamines. In this model, while PA directed monoclonal antibody (PA-mAb, 5H3 or Raxibacumab) (HGS, Rockville, MD) was protective, regimens of fluid or norepinephrine support beneficial with LPS or E. coli, were not with LeTx (4 - 6). In fact fluids not only worsened survival with LeTx but also negated the effects of PA-mAb.   Although informative, the rat model did not permit the duration (i.e. > 24h) or type of hemodynamic monitoring (i.e. systemic and pulmonary arterial catheter measures and serial cardiac imaging) necessary to fully characterize the cardiovascular effects of LeTx and ETx. Therefore a canine model was developed with support from the Trans-NIH/FDA Biodefense Program. In initial studies, LeTx challenge in the canine produced many of the same changes noted in the rat. LeTx was also associated with myocardial depression in the canine.   The purpose of present study is to use the now developed canine anthrax LeTx model to comprehensively investigate the effects of fluid and vasopressor treatment alone and in combination with a toxin directed treatment. An advantage of this model not possible in smaller animal models is the ability to titrate hemodynamic support based on measures of preload and perfusion pressure just as it is done in critically ill patients. Specifically, this study will address whether a standard regimen (fluid and norepinephrine infusion) or a toxin directed therapy (i.e. 5H3-mAb or Raxibacumab) are beneficial when used alone or together in canines challenged with 24 h infusions of LeTx. Based on earlier studies with this canine model, treatment algorithms have been developed for the sequential administration of fluid and norepinephrine titrated using preload measures.   Studies examining the effects of hemodynamic support and Raxibacumab with LeTx challenge are complete. Addition of Raxibacumab to hemodynamic support improved hemodynamics, reduced vasopressor needs and fluid retention and increased survival following LeTx challenge. This data was presented at the International Conference of the American Thoracic Society 2011 and has now been published. (Barochia et al. Protective antigen antibody augments hemodynamic support in anthrax lethal toxin shock in canines. J Infect Dis. 2012; 205: 818-829.)  Studies are completed examining the effects of Raxibacumab and hemodynamic support alone or together with ETx challenge alone and with ETx and LeTx in combination inthis same canine model. Raxibacumab augmented hemodynamic support and improved survival with ETx alone and with ETx and LeTx together. These findings were presented at the International Conference of the American Thoracic Society in 2013 and 2014.   Additional agents are now under consideration for study in this model."

In terms of work in progress, we are currently working under a CRADA with the NMR manufacturer for improving the algorithm for measuring lipoproteins, which is close to completion.  With the new algorithm, we have developed a novel technique for identifying Type-III hyperlipidemia, which is now commonly misdiagnosed.  It is relatively common lipid disorder affecting as much as 1-2% of the population and it is important to recognize these patients because they should be treated with not only statins but with lipid lowering medications that lowers triglycerides."
"9354082","The most widely accepted model addressing the source of PF pain is that a force imbalance in the muscles controlling the knee joint leads to static patellofemoral (PF) malalignment and dynamic PF maltracking. In turn, this malalignment and maltracking leads to elevated joint contact stresses, which ultimately leads to PF_pain and potentially OA. This model has been substantiated by a recent study that demonstrated a direct correlation between the degree of pain at the PF joint and patellofemoral kinematics. In addition, studies focused on McConnell taping have consistently shown that by adding a medializing force through taping an immediate reduction in pain can be seen. Yet, the source of the force imbalance around the knee is still open to debate with some postulating the cause to be delayed timing in the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) muscle, imbalance in the passive structures, or a loss of strength in the VMO. Numerous studies refute these claims as well.   Therefore, the goal of this current protocol is to determine if a temporary immediate medialization of the quadriceps force can reduce excessive lateral shift and tilt in individuals with PF pain and by doing so provide immediate pain relief. This will be accomplished by using bupivacaine to create a short-term, instantaneous loss of function in the VL muscle in patients with PF pain. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic which is closely related to lidocaine and commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks.  Cine-PC (CPC) MR imaging will be the primary measurement tool to assess the PF kinematics pre- and post-block. This is the only non-invasive technique that can accurately (<0.33mm) measure three-dimensional skeletal and muscular motion simultaneously. The two specific primary hypotheses and the secondary hypothesis to be addressed are: 1) A short-term loss of function in the VL in patients with PF pain will result in a reduction in their PF lateral shift and tilt; 2) A short-term loss of function in the VL in patients with PF pain will result in a reduction of pain; and 3) A short-term loss of function in the VL will result in a no change in the maximum isometric extensor strength of the quadriceps muscles. Ultimately, we hope to establish direct links between medialization of the quadriceps force, normalization of knee kinematics, and a reduction in pain.  In order to better understand potential confounding variables, this protocol plans to enroll 10 healthy control subjects prior to evaluating individuals with PF pain.  To date, five asymptomatic volunteers with no prior history of knee pain, trauma, leg surgery, or contraindications to having an MRI have been enrolled. For all subjects, the PF and tibiofemoral (TF) kinematics will be derived from dynamic cine phase contrast velocity data during the first visit. The subject will then be asked to return within a week for the second segment of the study. For the second visit, the subjects isometric strength and level of pain during various activities will be assessed first. Then, the vasti lateralis block will be performed using 1-5 cc of 0.5% solution of bupivacaine. After it has been confirmed that the block is effective, the subject's strength and level of pain will be reassessed. Following this, cine-phase contrast data will be again collected during a flexion-extension exercise in order to quantify the subject patellofemoral kinematics. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to test the null hypothesis that the post- and pre-injection kinematics were no different across the knee angles of extension. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality will be run. If the data are normally distributed a repeated measures ANOVA was run using Hotellings T2 test statistic; if not, the non-parametric Friedman's test statistic will be used. Upon rejection of the null hypothesis a post-hoc analysis (Wilcoxon signed rank test) will be completed to determine at whichknee angles the null hypothesis could be rejected. Pearsons correlations between the change in kinematics post-injection and the pre-injection kinematics will quantified at these same knee angles. This will followed by a step-wise linear regression. Significance was set at p less than or equal to 0.05.  This project remains in the data collection phase."

"9355436","There are few studies in the literature that examine yoga in minority or diverse populations but none specifically address rheumatic disease.  The goal of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of providing yoga to an urban, minority population with arthritis. Our plan is to use the pilot data from this study to design future yoga interventions in this population.  The protocol was originally approved on 5/22/2012. This study has been closed to accrual as of 6/29/2016, but remains open for data analysis. Thirty-seven (37) subjects were enrolled.   Attending the first yoga class is considered the starting point for the study.  Eighteen (18) RA/OA and three (3) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) participants met criteria of attending at least one yoga class.  The remaining 16 participants are a combination of those who withdrew, were lost to follow-up or were not able to attend the yoga class times as offered therefore remained in a wait list status.  No further follow-up is required for any participants.     Assessments were made from a convenience sample of participants (with rheumatoid and osteoarthritis) undergoing an 8-week program of yoga classes consisting of 60-minute sessions, twice a week. The yoga classes are designed especially for people with arthritis.  Psychosocial measures were assessed at the beginning of the study and at the completion of taking yoga classes twice a week for 8-weeks. Physical function measures were assessed through NIH Rehabilitation Medicine. For this study self- care is defined as adopting behaviors (regularly doing yoga) that improve physical and mental well-being and may decrease arthritis symptoms and side effects.    Acceptability of this study will be evaluated based on the response rate, percent of classes completed, exit interview comments and the percent of patients continuing yoga after 3 months. Feasibility will be determined based on exit interview comments and qualitative data.  Qualitative field notes were kept to monitor/document related to issues such as site capability (location/space), personnel (bilingual yoga teachers/investigators), equipment (computers/yoga props), and the amount of modifications needed.  A record was kept of eligible patients who declined and reasons for declining."

"9358801","Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and women in the US and around the world. Although lung cancer incidence and mortality rates have been slowly declining over the past decade, the five-year survival rate for lung cancer remains less than 20%, as most lung cancer patients are diagnosed with advanced disease at presentation. While developing better screening and therapeutic modalities is key to improving the treatment outcome of individual patients, newer and more active measures of cancer prevention are also critically needed, especially in high-risk individuals.       To date, lung cancer prevention has largely been based on avoidance or cessation of smoking or reduction of exposure to environmental lung carcinogens. Active chemopreventive intervention remains elusive for lung cancer. Recent advances in immunotherapies for lung and other cancers have indicated that the immune system can mount effective antitumor immune responses if tumor-associated immunosuppression is blocked. It is conceivable that effective antitumor immunity may be more efficiently elicited by active immunization in the prevention setting, where tumor-derived immunosuppression is believed to play a lesser role in premalignant lesions.       One of the most important steps toward developing effective cancer preventive vaccines is the selection of the antigen. Emerging preclinical evidence suggests that tumor growth can be blocked or slowed by active immunization against oncoproteins (e.g. EGFR) or proteins overexpressed in cancers (tumor associated antigens). It has previously been shown that high binding affinity of peptides across multiple HLA class II alleles predicts immunogenic human epitopes. By using the in silico scoring algorithms, You, Disis and colleagues have recently shown that a rationally designed multi-peptide vaccine directed against EGFR protein could elicit robust immune responses and reduce lung tumorigenesis in a murine model of lung cancer.       Recent approaches to the development of preventive vaccines for non-viral cancers have centered on strategies to target known tumor antigens discovered in established cancers. Novel and more promising target antigens for preventive cancer vaccines may be identified from careful analyses of molecular alterations in premalignant and/or malignant tissues discovered through the TCGA and other cancer genomics projects. Some of the genes overexpressed in premalignant and malignant lesions, but not in normal tissues, may be immunogenic and capable of eliciting protective antitumor immune responses.       In the current project, high priority candidate genes will be selected from the list of genes overexpressed in premalignant and malignant lesions, and will be prioritized based on differential expression patterns in premalignant and malignant lesions compared to normal tissues, functional roles in physiologic or oncogenic signaling pathways if known, confirmation of antigen expression, and in silico hotspot analysis for peptide selection. Once candidate target proteins are selected, multi-antigen multi-peptide vaccines will be formulated, and preclinically evaluated for in vivo immunogenicity and antitumor preventive efficacy in a relevant mouse model of lung cancer."

"9271531","VISUALIZATION OF HIV-1 INTEGRATION IN REAL-TIME PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Retroviral infections, including HIV and HTLV, continue to be a pandemic problem. While several drug therapies are able to treat HIV-1 infection, the virus's propensity to develop resistance mutations remains challenging. A clear priority for the HIV-1 treatment arsenal is to identifying novel drug targets. Stable integration of a retroviral donor cDNA into the host chromosome is absolutely required for a productive infection. Nearly three decades of research have established that retroviral integration is extremely inefficient in vivo and in vitro. Integration is catalyzed by the retrovirus encoded integrase (IN), which in many retroviruses forms a tetramer complex with the two viral cDNA long terminal repeat (LTR) ends (termed an intasome). The IN protein removes two 3' nucleotides and catalyzes end joining (strand transfer) of the resulting recessed 3' hydroxyls across one major groove of the target DNA separated by 4-6 bp. HIV-1 integration requires a host protein co-factor PSIP1/LEDGF/p75 for stable intasome assembly and to target integration to chromatin marked with the histone H3(K36) trimethylation post-translational modification (PTM). Remarkably, the prototype foamy virus (PFV) remains the only complete intasome structure. While anti- retroviral drugs that target the HIV-1 enzyme integrase also inhibit the PFV integrase, it remains unclear whether the integration mechanics of these respective retroviral intasomes are similar. We have used novel single molecule analytical tools to demonstrate that the PFV intasome catalyzes the two strand transfer events during integration in quick succession. We also visualized PFV intasomes on a linear target DNA and determined that the vast majority of IN-mediated search events were nonproductive. Together these observations suggested that target site selection limits PFV integration. We propose to extend our single molecule analysis to the biophysical mechanism of HIV-1 integration. Our preliminary studies have already identified significant differences between PFV and HIV-1, suggesting that the biophysical analysis of HIV-1 is likely to be more relevant to human health. Several important questions will be addressed in this new grant application: 1.) What are the protein dynamics of HIV-1 IN during the DNA target search and integration? 2.) What are the viral DNA dynamics during the DNA target search and integration process? 3.) What constitutes an efficient DNA target site? 4.) What factors influence the DNA target search process? 5.) What are the dynamics of intasome targeting on chromatin? We propose to utilize several innovative single molecule imaging systems to visualize HIV-1 integration in real- time. We will examine DNA lesions and mechanically altered DNA structures that may mimic the preferred target DNA configuration as well as chromatin containing histones with specific PTMs. These studies are designed to fully interrogate the animated processes associated with HIV-1 integration."

"9277289","Seven year imitative called Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes, ECHO. Capitalize on existing National Children?s Study participants. Longitudinal studies investigate environmental exposure, including physical, chemical, biological, social, behavioral, natural and built environments, on childhood health and development. The focus is on outcomes in upper and lower airway, obesity, pre, peri and postnatal outcome, neurodevelopmental. Studies share data analysis center. The National Children's Study (NCS) is prospective longitudinal cohort study of the individual and combined effects of environmental exposures and gene environmental interactions on child health and development in a representative sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the United States. The children will be followed from before birth until age 21. The importance and timeliness of this study are based on many factors, including past experiences demonstrating profound effects of environmental exposures, such as exposures to alcohol during pregnancy and to lead in early childhood on child health and development; the special vulnerabilities of children to environmental exposures compared to adults; known ongoing exposures, such as prevalent levels of non-persistent pesticides or hours of media exposure per day in young children; and evidence for environmental contributions or causes to such high-impact conditions as autism, developmental delay and developmental disability, asthma, and obesity. The primary aim of the NCS is to investigate the separate and combined effects of environmental exposures (chemical, biological, physical, psychosocial) as well as gene-environment interactions on pregnancy outcomes, child health and development, and precursors of adult disease. Unique features of the study include its focus on environmental exposures at the earliest stages of pregnancy (as well as thereafter) and the breadth of planned exposure and outcome measurements. NICHD and a consortium of federal agencies plan and conduct a longitudinal study of the impacts of environmental exposures on children.  Because the focus of the study includes assessment of the impact of exposures that occur early in pregnancy, both pregnant women and their partners, and women of childbearing age, comprise the initial target population for enrollment. Data will be collected in combinations of face-to-face contacts and remote collection methods, e.g., telephone, computer, or mail-in questionnaires. The expected frequency of contact (face-to-face or remote) is approximately every three months through age one, every six months through age five years and annually thereafter. For a sample of children enrolled in the study, visits will also be made to child care and school settings for collection of environmental samples and observational data. Anticipated biologic specimens include blood, urine, hair, and nail clippings from mothers and children; blood, urine, and hair from fathers; cord blood, umbilical cord and placental tissues, and meconium collected at/around the time of delivery; vaginal swabs, and breast milk from mothers. Anticipated environmental samples include air, dust, soil, food, and water.  ."

"9361631","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ?15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice."

"9369149","One of the missions of the Surveillance Informatics Branch within the Surveillance Research Program is to support innovative methods and approaches for analyzing, interpreting, and reporting cancer burden measures.  The SEER data is extensively used to monitor national trends in cancer incidence, prevalence and survival in the US (http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2012/).  Registry data linked to Medicare claims (SEER-Medicare) provide an opportunity to extend these types of reports to other types of measures such as treatment utilization, prevalence of comorbidities prior to diagnosis and other longitudinal information such as second line therapy. Importantly NCI is receiving real time claims from oncology practices to enhance and supplement SEER data with detailed treatment information for the Georgia cancer registry.  This process is being extended to 5 other registries.  The availability of claims data provides an opportunity to expand on the types of cancer burden measures included in standardized reports.   The Jigsaw software has been designed to automate the extensive data organization and cleaning process required to create analyzable data sets from electronic health data such as claims data. Jigsaw is actually a study builder. It can be used to select a cohort of individuals for a study from a complex set of health claims. The software also has the potential to create baseline exposure and outcome variables.   Jigsaw generates variable labels, a data dictionary, a cohort file (one record per person) and events file (multiple records per person which is the best way to store data for longitudinal analyses).  The key to this functionality is the Jigsaw Algorithm Repository, which stores the algorithms required for manipulating the data and creating analysis data sets.  This is accomplished by using ConceptQL, an open-source, domain-specific language for storing algorithms to find clinical events in electronic health data.  By storing algorithms in a flexible, reusable way, they can be combined to produce many different types of studies.

"9335709","Studies to investigate the potential for 4-Methylcyclohexanemethanol (MCHM) to induce dermal sensitization were completed and reported in FY16. Dermal exposure to pure MCHM was found to produce irritation of the skin at the application site at concentrations above 20% and overt toxicity at the 100% concentration, but did not induce sensitization. Mice treated with ?75% crude MCHM also showed evidence of dermal irritation, although weaker when compared to pure MCHM. There was also evidence of overt toxicity in mice treated with 100% crude MCHM, although the severity was less than pure MCHM. Dermal application of crude MCHM resulted in increased lymphocyte proliferation in the draining lymph node at concentrations ?5%. The Stimulation Index (SI), a measure of sensitization, was significantly increased in mice treated with ?20% crude MCHM, relative to the vehicle control group. These results indicate that crude MCHM has the potential to cause dermal sensitization at exposure concentrations that are non-irritating. The PAC Mixtures Assessment Program (PAC-MAP) provides the framework for assessing a breadth of individual polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), defined PAC mixtures, and complex PAC-containing environmental samples using an in vitro/short-term in vivo testing battery that includes a broad spectrum of endpoints. Select PACs have been associated with a wide range of toxicities (carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity) and a complicated array of mechanisms of action. In particular, many PACs have been associated with suppression of humoral immune function and immunotoxicity has been identified as an informative parameter for estimating the carcinogenic potential of PACs. As part of the potential testing battery to predict mixture effects, we have examined the potential for individual PACs to modulate the antigen specific antibody response and affect bone marrow cytology.  Dose response studies for the positive control Benzo(a)pyrene and the less potent PAC, Phenanthrene have been completed and draft reports received for both studies. Laboratory protocols for three additional compounds, pyrene, dibenzothiophene and acenaphthenequinone, have been approved and the in life studies are expected to be completed in Q1FY17.

"9355435","There are approximately 65.7 million unpaid caregivers in the United States with an estimated 8% providing care to someone with cancer. Although benefit-finding has been reported, providing care to a spouse or loved one with cancer is stressful and can have negative consequences for an individuals psychological and physical health. In cancer caregivers, studies have documented negative outcomes including symptoms of fatigue, impaired sleep quality, poor quality of life, anxiety and depression. These outcomes are of particular concern when cancer patients receive intense treatment such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) where caregivers are embedded in a treatment trajectory that can extend 4  12 months.   Few studies have explored the association among physiological and clinical factors that may affect HSCT caregivers overall risk for cardiovascular disease. While there is evidence indicating that the profound stress experienced by cancer caregivers appears to be associated with autonomic nervous system dysregulation, very little existing evidence suggests that this dysregulation is related to cardiovascular risk. The evidence is lacking even more in transplant caregivers, where no published studies have examined the physiological and behavioral changes that occur in this population over time, nor the cardiovascular risk these individuals face as a result of the overwhelming burden of assisting their loved one through the fear and suffering associated with transplantation.    The design of this study was informed from the results of a prior pilot study and phase II study completed at the NIH, Clinical Center. Data from these studies, along with findings from our prior analyses have provided essential information to inform the design of this pilot study which will explore the physiological and clinical markers of chronic stress and cardiovascular risk in a sample of allogeneic HSCT caregivers.   The primary objective of this study is to compare physiologic and biomarkers of cardiovascular illness among HSCT caregivers to non-caregivers. A sample of non-caregivers, matched minimally for age, gender, and race/ethnicity are also recruited study participation to serve as study control for each enrolled caregiver subject. The study was approved by the IRB originally on September 30, 2011. Study recruitment began in November 2011; the 1st subject was enrolled in December 2011. The study completed participant accrual in April 2013 and remains open for data analyses only. N=50 subjects (n=26 HSCT caregiver subjects and n=24 matching normal volunteers) have been enrolled with 41 participants (21 caregivers and 20 matching normal volunteers) completing all study procedures.

"9358496","The rising prevalence of obesity in the U.S. over the past several decades and the accompanying spread of adverse long-ranging health effects pose serious public health and economic consequences. While a genetic contribution to obesity is well-established, genetic factors underlying individual susceptibility to common obesity have modest effects, which can be amplified considerably in the presence of certain triggering environmental factors. Approximately two-thirds of women of reproductive age now enter pregnancy at a high body mass index, and the majority of women experience pregnancy-associated weight gains in excess of Institute of Medicine guidelines, leading to increased perinatal and chronic health risks for both mother and child. The increased prevalence of obesity among women of reproductive age is reflected in a concomitant increase in the prevalence of gestational diabetes (GDM), which confers additional increased risk of adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Limited previous intervention research has indicated modest improvement in short-term maternal diet and gestational weight gain, with little evidence of long-term adherence. The well-documented inadequacies of these and traditional weight-loss interventions relying on existing health behavior paradigms suggest the need for innovations that allow for a shift in the theoretical framework underlying the determinants of eating behavior. Recent findings from basic research in neuroscience suggest that the brain reward response to highly palatable foods is a critical element that is currently absent in current theoretical frameworks. Individuals vary with respect to their ?food reward responsivity?, which refers to susceptibility to the effects of food and eating on the brain reward system. Simultaneously, foods vary with respect to their ?reinforcement value?, which refers to the degree to which foods activate the brain reward system. Whereas certain foods elicit a normative food reward response that is sensitive to homeostatic regulation of appetite, it is hypothesized that ?hyperpalatable? foods, which elicit exceptionally pronounced activation of the brain reward system, may blunt this sensitivity, leading to hedonic, non-homeostatic overeating characterized by food intake beyond energetic needs. Repeated consumption of hyperpalatable foods reinforces the brain food reward response and culminates in neurological changes similar to those observed with drugs of abuse. However, this rapidly-expanding body of work has not yet been incorporated into population-based research. Research to date on food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value has been conducted primarily in small samples in the general population. However, to date, no studies have examined these constructs among pregnant women. While it is known that most women gain more weight than recommended and many do not return to their pre-pregnancy weight, there is insufficient data on individual determinants of dietary intake and weight change during and after pregnancy. Understanding the association of food reward responsivity and food reinforcement value with dietary intake and weight change during pregnancy and postpartum may be informative for the development of clinical and public health interventions that promote optimal diet and weight in this population."
"9360365","Diindolylmethane (DIM) is the major in vivo derivative of indole-3-carbinol, which is present in cruciferous vegetables and has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and immune-modulating properties with an extensive history of safe use in humans. DIM has demonstrated chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activity in multiple translational models of prostate and other cancers, and has been evaluated clinically (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PIN) and Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) clinical trials). However, the extremely low solubility of pure, crystalline DIM in water limits the oral bioavailability of DIM in current formulations.  A new formulation of DIM (BR-9001) has been developed which is expected to yield significantly greater oral bioavailability and good tolerability of DIM. The purpose of this task order is to evaluate this new formulation pre-clinically. In Task 1, we intend to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this new formulation of DIM in rats. The older formulation, BR-DIM, shall also be included in the same study as a comparator.  A PK and toxicity bridging study shall be initiated in Task 2. This study shall evaluate the PK and toxicology of the new formulation in rats after 28 days of BR-9001 administration.  Based on the relatively similar DIM concentrations achieved previously in rats and humans administered similar doses of DIM (on a mg per body surface area basis), the rat is an appropriate species for this study. In addition, dosing of at least 28 days shall be required to support a clinical trial, as systemic concentrations of DIM appear to decline with daily dosing (dogs after 12 weeks of dosing, and humans after 4 weeks of dosing)."

"9239516","Heart failure (HF) affects nearly 6 million individuals in the US, one of every eight death certificates lists HF as a primary or contributing cause of death, and HF is associated with a significant reduction in quality of life for patients and caregivers alike. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has represented one of the most important advances in the care of select patients with HF. Although CRT has substantially improved outcomes among HF patients, it is widely recognized that approximately 1/3 of patients who undergo this invasive procedure do not derive clinical improvements. Research on causes of CRT non-response and approaches to mitigating non-response is a priority in the fields of HF and electrophysiology. Although many important questions can be answered through national registries and secondary analyses of landmark trials, lack of data granularity and adjudicated outcomes in registries, and small numbers of patients in key subgroups in trials, limit these approaches. Our group has successfully used Bayesian statistical methods to combine primary patient-level data from RCTs of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator. We propose that a similar approach for CRT trials, combined with stakeholder prioritization and a decision modeling framework, have the power to overcome many important limitations of existing platforms for CRT research.  Our long-term goal is to enhance the ability of the NHLBI to provide evidence-based decisionmaking tools to aid patients, providers, and policymakers in the use of CRT for the treatment of HF. To achieve this overall goal, we have four specific aims (SA): (1) To work with diverse stakeholders to identify and prioritize timely clinical and policy questions regarding the comparative effectiveness of CRT; (2) To develop a generalizable decision modeling framework for the treatment of HF; (3) To use Bayesian statistical techniques to devise a model for predicting patient and population health and economic outcomes; and (4) To combine the framework from SA#2, the Bayesian model from SA#3, and patient level data from existing RCTs and registries, to explore high-priority questions identified in SA#1. Our research will build off our team's expertise and experience in research prioritization, evidence synthesis, chronic disease modeling, Bayesian statistical techniques, stakeholder engagement, and methods of disseminating evidence-based decision models to patients, providers, and policymakers. We will collaborate with principal investigators from existing trials of CRT to harness the power of patient-level data from over ten years of clinical trials representing nearly 10,000 patients and use registry data to explore whether the outcomes observed in the community are predicted by available RCT evidence. In an era in which great importance is placed on defending clinical practice with rigorous supporting evidence, our research brings together stakeholder engagement, decision analytic methods, Bayesian statistics, the strength of RCT data, and medical informatics tools to enhance patient outcomes and provide powerful methods to aid patients, providers, and policy makers in their decisionmaking."
"9240336","PROJECT SUMMARY Following myocardial infarction (MI), patients have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Remodeling of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system (SNS) occurs post-MI and recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that both sympathetic hyperinnervation and denervation are associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Adverse electrophysiological (EP) remodeling also occurs post-MI and includes changes to ion channels, gap junctions, and Ca2+ handling that can lead to both the trigger and substrate for ventricular arrhythmia. Individually, many SNS and EP factors have been linked to ventricular arrhythmias. However, the precise mechanisms by which post-MI SNS remodeling contributes to ? and interacts with ? EP remodeling have never been systematically investigated. The overall objective of this project is to determine the individual and interacting roles of SNS and EP remodeling in producing the triggers and substrate for ventricular arrhythmias post-MI, which may unveil novel anti-arrhythmic strategies. To meet this objective, an innovative set of methodologies has been developed, including novel approaches for modulation of cardiac innervation combined with dual optical mapping of Vm and intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ in the intact, fully innervated Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart. Aim 1 will focus on acute effects of SNS stimulation in the normal heart and how SR and intracellular Ca2+ handling play a role in mediating arrhythmogenic changes. Experiments will address the hypothesis that SNS-dependent effects on SR Ca2+ and Ca2+i generate triggers for arrhythmia and modulate repolarization to create the substrate for reentry. The impact of non-classical neurotransmitters in mediating these effects will also be examined. Aim 2 will determine the impact of chronic SNS remodeling (hyper- or denervation) on arrhythmogenesis, including the role of Ca2+ handling in mediating these effects. Here, hyper- or denervation will be created independent of MI, allowing for the separation of MI-induced changes from SNS remodeling. The contributions of acute SNS stimulation and circulating catecholamines to hyper- or denervation-induced arrhythmias will be examined. Aim 3 will focus on the interplay between SNS remodeling and EP remodeling in the post-MI rabbit heart and novel anti-arrhythmic strategies aimed at preventing SNS remodeling will be tested. The results of this study will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the individual and synergistic contributions of SNS and EP remodeling in post-MI arrhythmogenesis and will determine whether targeting key nerve-heart interactions represents a novel therapeutic approach."
"9246756","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The University of California Preclinical Animal Study Site (UC PASS) is a collaborative effort between UC Davis and UC San Diego that brings together the scientific expertise, state of the art technologies and facilities, and institutional support to achieve the primary objectives goals of the PASS, which are to: 1) develop animal models that best complement the endurance and resistance training protocols used in the human trials, and 2) provide organ and tissue samples collected at multiple time points after both acute and chronic exercise for analysis by the Chemical Analysis Sites. The animal studies to be undertaken by the PASS will begin to elucidate the molecular pathways responsible for the acute and chronic effects of both endurance and resistance exercise on individual organs, as well as identify the interactions between organs; the goal being to understand the mechanisms by which different modes of physical activity impart their health benefits. In order to reach this goal, experts in model development and phenotyping of the resulting muscle and global health adaptations will be essential. The UC PASS team has exactly these traits. The team acknowledges that the ultimate animal model and exercise tests to be utilized in the PASS will be determined by the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Common (MoTrPAC) Steering Committee. In this application we provide a strong rationale and justification for the use of the rat as the animal model and propose specific endurance and resistance exercise programs to be used in Phase I of the PASS, highlighting the major advantages and limitations of each paradigm. In Phase II of the PASS we build on the models established in Phase I and propose three specific aims to begin to produce a standard curve of molecular transducers versus adaptive response to exercise. In Phase II we propose to exercise animals of increasing age or increasing adiposity, determine the adaptive response to 12 weeks of training, and relate this with the acute molecular transducer response to exercise. With this secondary screen, we will be able to identify molecular transducers that directly correlate with the local or global health benefits of exercise. We will then use this information to test the genetic requirement for these molecular transducers for the health benefits of exercise. The UC PASS is composed of an exceptional team of primary investigators and key collaborators/advisors with expertise in the development of animal models of exercise, the molecular response to exercise, and applied human exercise interventions. This team will provide leadership and the necessary skill sets to successfully model human exercise in animals, which is essential to the success of the MoTrPAC Common Fund and achievement of its goal: to define and understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the human health benefits of physical activity."
"9259266","Forgetting is an adaptive process that plays a critical role in sustaining the efficiency of mnemonic operations and can actively inhibit unwelcome (e.g. unpleasant or irrelevant information) memories from our awareness. The intentional forgetting of unwanted memories during encoding can be accomplished, via prefrontal control regions, by directly inhibiting hippocampal encoding processes, or by engaging hippocampal retrieval processes to replace the unwanted memory with substitutes. The neural mechanisms that underlie intentional forgetting, however, is not well understood -- the goal of this research project is to characterize how competition dependent learning via neural competition of memory representations ? a neural mechanism shown to contribute to incidental forgetting ? explains intentional forgetting. We also propose using real-time neurofeedback (providing information about a person's brain activity while they are performing tasks inside an MRI scanner) to either selectively improve or impair subsequent remembering.  One recent theory provides a compelling explanation for a mechanism underlying forgetting. The co- activation of multiple thoughts during encoding and retrieval of an item can lead to neural competition between these thoughts, which in turn, are detrimental to the subsequent remembering of an item. This finding is consistent with the `non-monotonic plasticity hypothesis' generated by computational models of learning. In the following proposal, Study 1 tests whether the principle of non-monotonic plasticity during memory encoding also extends to motivated forgetting. We propose to administer an item-method intentional forgetting task in which participants will be required to either remember or forget items dependent on a cue following the presentation of the item. We hypothesize that neural competition between `to be remembered' and `to be forgotten' items will contribute to the subsequent forgetting of the item representation that `loses' the competition. We will use multivariate pattern classification of fMRI data to quantify the level (i.e. low, medium or strong) of activation for the `to be forgotten and `to be remembered' items in order to decode or track the relative strength of these items across each trial. The findings of this first study also allow us to test the relationship between the amount of neural competition in ventral temporal cortex, the connectivity from control regions in the prefrontal cortex to subdivisions of the hippocampus, and subsequent forgetting behavior. Furthermore, in Study 2, we intend to use neurofeedback training to calibrate the amount of neural competition elicited during memory encoding. We will behaviorally modify encoding strategies in a closed-loop neurofeedback system in order to improve on or interfere with (i.e. induce forgetting) subsequent memory performance."
"9262330","Abstract Atherosclerotic plaque rupture is the cause of acute coronary syndromes and symptomatic carotid artery disease in 75% of cases with high mortality. Most studies in animal models have focused on investigation of early stage lesions, not advanced lesions which in humans contribute to late stage clinical events. As such, our understanding of mechanisms and factors that control stability of late stage lesions is relatively poor. In many vascular diseases such as post-angioplasty restenosis and atherosclerosis, contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo phenotypic modulation to a synthetic phenotypic in which VSMC exhibit increased proliferation and migration and decreased differentiation. Whether or not VSMC phenotypes controls plaque stability hasn't been well studied and, further, the factors controlling VSMC phenotype switch remain unknown. Our published and preliminary data including in this proposal have demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) ?2 deficiency results in decreased expression of contractile proteins and increased synthetic proteins in the plaque and promotes the features of unstable plaques in vivo. Mechanistically, we have found that AMPK?2 deficiency upregulates the expression of Krppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), which is a key regulator of VSMC phenotypic switch. Based on this exciting preliminary data, we hypothesize that AMPK?2 is essential in suppressing atherosclerotic plaque growth and vulnerability by inhibiting the VSMC phenotypic switching in a KLF4-dependent mechanism. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims. Aim 1 is to establish the essential role of AMPK?2 in regulating VSMC phenotypical switch, atherosclerosis, and the instability of atherosclerotic plaques in VSMC-specific ApoE-/- /AMPK?2-/- double knockout mice (Apoe?/?AMPK?2sm-/-) with or without metformin, a potent AMPK activator; After that, we will determine if phenotypic transitions observed in our mouse studies also occur in human atherosclerotic lesions (from autopsy samples). Aim 2 is to demonstrate that KLF4 is required for AMPK?2-deficiency-induced VSMC phenotypic switching. We fully anticipate the completion of the proposed studies will provide the rationales for developing AMPK?2-specific agonists as novel strategies for the prevention and efficient treatment of plaque destabilization and rupture that contribute to end stage clinical events leading to myocardial infarction and stroke."

"9336505","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the nation continues its efforts to contain healthcare costs and improve quality, healthcare information technology provides some of our most potent yet underutilized tools. Clinical prediction rules are frontline decision aids that combine state-of-the-art evidence with real-time patient history, physical examination, and laboratory data. While often well-validated, clinical prediction rules have been underutilized in practice. Recently, our team developed the integrated clinical prediction rule (iCPR) system, embedding CPRs within the nation's largest commercial electronic health record (EHR) system. Using this novel system, we demonstrated high rates of provider utilization and a significant reduction in antibiotic prescribing and diagnostic test ordering among suspected cases of strep throat and pneumonia at a single healthcare facility. The objective of the proposed project is to generalize this platform across diverse settings and create a toolkit for further dissemination. Building on the success of the original iCPR project, the specific aims of this proposal are to (1) integrate our previously tested and refined iCPR tool into the same commercial EHR in three different clinical settings, adapting the innovation to provider preference, culture, and local workflow rather than imposing a rigidly standardized tool, (2) identify and measure rate and variability of iCPR uptake across different settings, (3) determine iCPR impact on antibiotic prescribing and diagnostic test-ordering patterns across diverse clinical settings with a randomized controlled trial, and (4) use a well-established theory-driven implementation framework to identify facilitators and barriers to integration in each setting, and develop a toolkt for adapting and implementing the tool in diverse settings. To achieve these aims, we propose a five- year study in which we first adapt, integrate and usability-test the original iCPR at three new diverse sites. We will then conduct a two-year randomized controlled trial with a one-year post-trial open-access observation period to determine the persistence of: 1) the tool's utilizatio and 2) its impact on antibiotic- and test-ordering in patients with suspected strep throat or pneumonia. In the final year, study findings will be compiled into a toolkit so that any healthcare facility using the Epic EHR can integrate iCPR into its ambulatory workflow. The study uses several innovative and significant approaches, including: 1) adapting the nation's most widespread commercial EHR system; 2) building the new tool with off-the-shelf technology included in every Epic EHR package, so the innovation can be easily ported to all Epic EHR users; 3) using highly specific, well-validated clinical prediction rules as its core content; 4) guiding the integration process with highly generalizable usability testing techniques; and 5) using a hybrid RE-AIM and normalization process theory implementation evaluation framework. Together, these innovative approaches make iCPR uniquely suited to overcome longstanding barriers and integrate and disseminate evidence-based tools into the primary care workflow at the point of care in real time."
"9339110","The adrenal glands are endocrine glands which produce both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones in response to critical illness.  The primary glucocorticoid hormone is cortisol, whereas the primary mineralocorticoid hormone is aldosterone.  Cortisol has important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic, and hemostatic functions.  In comparison, aldosterone is important in salt and water regulation and therefore critical to the maintenance of intravascular volume and blood pressure. Acute adrenal insufficiency is the failure of the adrenal gland to respond appropriately to physiologic stress, such as infection. The clinical presentation of acute adrenal insufficiency is due to insufficient mineralocorticoid activity rather than inadequate glucocorticoid activity. As such, critically ill patients with acute adrenal insufficiency can present with low blood pressure and severe dehydration.  Thus, it has been hypothesized that mineralocorticoid deficiency may contribute to the development and severity of septic shock. Although many researchers have studied the importance of glucocorticoid activity in septic shock, the importance of mineralocorticoid activity and aldosterone in septic shock remains unclear.  Aldosterone is produced in the adrenal gland and causes increased renal sodium reabsorption via the activity of an amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium (Na) channel (ENaC). Increased reabsorption of sodium leads to expansion of intravascular volume and increased blood pressure.  Amiloride is a potassium sparing diuretic that blocks ENaC thereby inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the late distal convoluted tubules, connecting tubules, and collecting ducts in the kidney. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT), a well described diuretic, will be used in conjunction with amiloride to ensure maximal effect on eNaC function. ENaC is expressed on the apical plasma membrane of many organs including the kidneys, lungs, urinary bladder, distal colon, sweat glands, and salivary ducts.1 For the purpose of this protocol, we will concentrate on the importance of ENaC in the kidneys and the lungs  Using a canine model of septic shock, our lab has previously conducted experiments suggesting mineralocorticoid activity via aldosterone may be important to the pathophysiology of septic shock. We demonstrated that administration of desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA), a selective mineralocorticoid with physiologic effects similar to aldosterone given 72h before the onset of sepsis, led to a more rapid reversal of shock and improved survival. The direct effect on sodium reabsorption or ENaC activity was not measured in these experiments but these results suggest that the administration of DOCA leads to increased renal sodium reabsorption and preservation of intravascular volume resulting in less severe shock and improved survival.   As a basic physiologic question, this study will expand our understanding of sodium channels in the kidney and lung and the role mineralocorticoids plays in managing fluid balance during critical illness. This study will also show how the expression of these channels can be influenced to improve survival. From a clinical perspective, if prophylactic treatment is shown to improve survival this would immediately benefit patients subject to high risk for infection surgical procedures, ie, abdominal. In addition, these results will define which components of the sodium channel could be targeted for drug development.  This series of studies investigates the independent roles of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids in a sedated and ventilated model of sepsis. We began by defining normal adrenal function during sepsis in an ICU setting (Sweeney, JID 2010). We then determined the efficacy of selective corticosteroid agonists during sepsis (Hicks CCM 2012) and the role of corticosteroids on bacterial clearance (Hicks ICM 2012). We then investigated the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis in Lethal Canine Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia (Corts-Puch AJP, 2014). The current study will expand our understanding of the mechanisms behind water handling and how survival is affected during critical illness"
"9339113","This project represents is a continuation of series of collaborative studies performed to better characterize and understand immune deficiency. Mutations involving the genes for the common gamma chain (X-SCID) and Fas (ALPS) are being evaluated using Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA with fluorescent probes. These studies have continued to identify a number of new mutations in both diseases and these data have been entered into the NIH NHGRI web site supporting each of these two disorders.  This was followed by the inclusion of mutation analysis of patients with hyper IgM syndrome directed at the genes encoding CD40L and NEMO followed by sequencing for immune deficiency associated mutations focused on host defense defects with recurrent infections involving opportunisitc intracellular organisms including genes encoding the interferon gamma receptor 1 and 2, the IL-12P40 and IL-12 receptor beta 1 genes. Finally, new additional genes have been added to the repertoire including genes encoding: AIRE, ARTEMIS, BTK, FOXP3, ICOS, IL-7Ralpha, JAK3, mu heavy chain,SAP, WASp. This initial work is now complemented by NextGen sequencing using the Ion Torrent PGM platform focused on expanding number of genes evaluated associated with primary immunodeficiencies that currently is focused on 172 known or possible primary immunodeficiency genes to screen patients refered to the NIH and on clinical research protocols with suspected primary immunodeficiency disorders. THis approach to gene mutation screeningd depends on emulsion PCR platform (Haloplex system) that has been validated in house. This togetehr with the choice of the appropriate library has been validated using deidentified patient gDNA samples with previously defined mutations linked to primary immunodeficiency disorders. To date we have identified at least a number of new genes associated with a previously uncharacterized primary immunodeficiency that have been confirmed by Sanger sequencing and functional testing. We continue to evaluate additional samples and will be moving to a more robust platform using the same principle but potentially allowing whole exome sequencing as well as targeted gene sequencing. We are in the process of preparing for publication our overall experience with the targeted gene approach (using the Ion Torrent and Haloplex technology) in screening a substantial number of patient samples. Our expereince to date suggests that this is a cost effective approach for screening referred patients with clear evidence of defects in host defense and that resequencing using the standard Sanger method under defined circumstances may not be necessary."

The Division defines environment as non-genetic, including environmental chemicals, diet, and lifestyle. Within the scope of environmental chemicals, both persistent (e.g., metals and trace elements, organochlorine pesticides, perfluorochemicals, polybrominated biphenyls, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and non-persistent (e.g. parabens, phenols, phthalates) chemicals are of interest. Of note is the Division?s research focusing on emerging classes of chemicals as well as biomarkers of lifestyle exposures and diet. Moreover, ophisticated aliquoting schemes are typically required for much of the Division?s research to enable additional biomedical laboratory analyses to compliment the environmental analyses. For example, a plasma sample may be used for the quantification of persistent chemicals and for metabolomic analyses, while a urine sample may be analyzed for both short-lived chemicals, such as phthalates, and for reproductive hormones."
"9339008","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human genome integrity depends on many processes to ensure the fidelity of the duplication of DNA. The efficiency of these processes is crucial since errors in DNA can often be key to disease onset. An important process to insure genome integrity is the repair of damaged DNA. There are several types of DNA damage including (but not limited to): alkylation, oxidation, hydrolysis, adduct formation, base mismatch, among others. Alkylated DNA bases may be removed by two main routes: excision of the damaged base and activation of the base excision repair (BER) process, or direct dealkylation. The former route involves several enzymes involved in the BER cascade. The latter route may be performed by the AlkB family of enzymes. AlkB family enzymes are non-heme iron and ?-ketoglutarate dependent enzymes that perform an oxidative dealkylation of DNA. Some cancer treatments involve alkylating agents, and attempts have been made to enhance these therapies by inhibiting alkylating damage repair. Information gained from a detailed understanding of the structure and reaction mechanism of AlkB family proteins can aid in the development of inhibitors for these enzymes by providing useful information to develop transition state analogue inhibitors. One approach for this is via computational methods, including quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods. Currently, most QM/MM implementations employ force fields that may not accurately describe the MM environment at close range, are not polarizable and lack methods to include long-range electrostatic effects. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanism, structure and function of enzymes involved in DNA repair by means of computational simulations. To this end, the goals of the present proposal are: i) To study the structure/function/reactivity of AlkB family of enzymes by quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM), molecular dynamics (MD) and homology modeling. ii) To develop the first QM/MM program that interfaces a QM program with a two advanced force fields (GEM and AMOEBA) to accurately describe the MM environment; and to develop a novel method to introduce long-range electrostatic effects in QM/MM simulations. The detailed understanding of the structure, function and reaction mechanism of AlkB and its human homologues will provide insights into possible methods to inhibit these enzymes. Our collaborators, Prof. Robert Housinger and Prof. Thomas Hollis, will perform experimental studies based on our computational results. Profs. Pengyu Ren and David Case will provide assistance with the QM/MM implementation in the AMBER suite of programs. The successful completion of the proposed project will provide an accurate computational tool for the calculation of enzyme reactions, and the generation of structural and mechanistic insights on an important family of enzymes that may be used to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatments."

"9262386","PROJECT SUMMARY Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) is a component of the desmosome. Recent studies have demonstrated that PKP2 also acts as a scaffold for an intracellular signaling complex, and as part of the microtubule anchoring platform at the site of cell contact. Mutations in PKP2 associate with about 50% of cases of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) of known genetic origin. ARVC is an inherited disease characterized by replacement of ventricular mass with fibrous and fatty tissue, and an increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in the young. Our long-term goals are to: 1) establish the cellular origin of the fibroblasts and adipocytes that populate the ventricular wall in an ARVC-affected heart, and 2) define the molecular mechanisms that act on the progenitor cell population to bring about the disease phenotype. We focus on epicardial cells, a cardiac-resident pluripotent stem cell population that gives rise to various non- myocyte cardiac cells, including fibroblasts. Our central hypothesis is that, in epicardial cells in situ, PKP2 deficiency disrupts the structure of intercellular junctions and their associated intracellular signaling nodes; this disruption alters cellular function and leads to a pro-fibrotic, pro-arrhythmogenic phenotype. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To define the molecular anatomy of intercellular junctions, and the structure/function of the corresponding intracellular signaling platforms in epicardial cells. Hypothesis: We postulate that in epicardial cells, PKP2 is a functional component of: a) the intercellular junctions, b) the anchoring platform for the microtubule plus-end, and c) the scaffolding of an intracellular signaling hub that includes beta-catenin, PKC?, and RhoA. We further propose that in epicardial cells, loss of PKP2 expression leads to separation and loss of components of both the intercellular junction and the signaling node, thus driving ?among other events- Rho-dependent MRTF activity, with the consequent activation of the motile gene program that facilitates the fibrotic phenotype. 2) To characterize the consequences of PKP2 deficiency on epicardial cell function, and their impact on cardiac anatomy and electrophysiology. Hypothesis: We propose that PKP2 deletion in epicardial cells in vivo drives excessive mobilization of epicardium-derived progenitor cells and their subsequent differentiation into fibro-fatty tissue both during development and in response to cardiac injury. We further propose that expansion of the epicardium-derived fibroblast population upon injury creates heterogeneously-distributed anatomic obstacles for propagation of the electrical impulse, and that these obstacles differ in dimensions depending on PKP2 expression."

"9326876","This research study aims to increase understanding of factors that predict poor asthma control during pregnancy as well as add to our knowledge of the basic immunology of pregnancy. Asthma is a common chronic disease and some women experience exacerbation and worsening of their asthma during pregnancy while others improve. Change in asthma severity/control in pregnancy has been noted frequently in the literature (about one-third worsen and one-third improve) but this change is not explored in any depth 1 Patients with asthma may have a defect in regulatory T (Treg) cells, which favors further T H2-cell proliferation 2. Treg cells are integral to the process by which the immune system differentiates foreign antigens (pathogens, etc.) and self antigens and, as such, they also play a key role in mediating pregnancy tolerance 3? Treg can be measured in peripheral blood and the levels vary over the course of pregnancy and post-partum as well as across the menstrual cycle. Foxp3 is the primary gene responsible for Treg regulation. We will investigate predictors of asthma control variability during pregnancy including demographic, biologic, genetic and environmental factors with particular interest in the role of maternal allergy. Pregnancy requires the immune system to tolerate the not self fetus and the clinical presentation of asthma including improvement or worsening will contribute to knowledge of the basic immunology of pregnancy. Women who get worse during pregnancy may represent a vulnerable subgroup with respect to environmental exposures, such as poor air quality, which can exacerb asthma and may have an independent effect on poor pregnancy outcomes."

"9237010","Project Abstract Numerous studies have documented a role for inherited genetic variation in common chronic diseases, their risk factors and overall longevity. However, the distributions and incidence rates of these same conditions have changed dramatically during modern times (1946-2014); a shift too dramatic in too short of a period to be affected by evolutionary pressures leading to changes in allele frequencies. Rather, this shift is most likely accounted for by changes in health care and lifestyle, which, in turn, have led to increased longevity and opening the door to successful aging. Lifestyle changes and aging itself can lead to alterations in the action of relevant genes via epigenetic modification of the DNA. This proposed research will test the hypotheses that signatures of DNA methylation measured in the blood of middle-aged adults are associated with successful aging patterns later in life (Aim 1); that these signatures persist in old age (Aim 2); and these signatures are associated with subsequent differences in the expression level of relevant genes (Aim 3). Replication opportunities have been identified and are an integral part of the workscope. We will focus on the overall construct of successful aging (i.e., physical, cognitive and functional well-being) instead of any one disease entity or risk factor for both scientific (i.e., pleiotropy) and practical (impact on quality of life) reasons. We will use the Level II definition of successful aging proposed and validated by McLaughlin et al in the Health and Retirement Study. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, a biracial longitudinal cohort study of the development of atherosclerosis and its risk factors, has collected and stored biosamples at each of its previous five examinations, and measured blood biomarkers and DNA sequence variation in successful searches for predictors of disease risk. This proposed ancillary study will support measurement of epigenetic patterns associated with successful aging. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1) To identify signatures of DNA methylation measured in the blood of middle-aged adults that are associated with successful aging status later in life; 2) To determine whether DNA methylation signatures of successful aging established in middle age among 1,800 ARIC participants from Aim 1 persist ~21 years later when they reach old age; 3) To examine whether the DNA methylation status of the genes identified in middle age (Aim 1) is correlated with gene expression in old age. The long-term goal of the proposed project is that by increasing our understanding of the biological determinants and trajectory of successful aging, this study may help to inform public health interventions focused on modifiable risk factors and the development of new therapeutic agents that will make successful aging an attainable goal for a greater number of individuals in the population."
"9237469","Our ultimate goal is to develop novel and effective treatments of glioblastoma, the most common and lethal human brain cancer. To achieve this goal, we propose to develop the SUMO1 inhibition compound (SMIC1) as a new anticancer drug for glioblastoma therapy. SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier-1) is a small regulatory protein that is linked to substrate proteins through enzymatic reactions. SUMO1 conjugation of its substrate proteins controls the cellular function of substrate proteins. In our recent work, we have revealed that SUMO1 conjugation pathway is overactive in glioblastoma and drives the cancer progression. To target this pathway, we have developed glioblastoma cell-based SUMO1 assays for drug screening and identified the SMIC1 from the NCI drugable compound library. In the efforts of preclinical development of SMIC1 as an anticancer drug, we have followed the FDA guidance for nonclinical evaluation of new anticancer agents and tested the toxicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) of SMIC1 and demonstrated that SMIC1 has an acceptable safety margin and drugable PK features in animals. In systemic administration, SMIC1 can be quickly delivered to brains through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and effectively inhibits glioblastoma xenograft growth. In search of target proteins, we have shown that cyclin-dependent kinase-6 (CDK6) is a substrate of both SUMO1 and ubiquitin (UB). SUMO1-CDK6 conjugation blocks CDK6 ubiquitination and the UB-mediated degradation and thus stabilizes CDK6 kinase for driving cell growth through phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein-1 (RB1); thus, SMIC1 treatment blocks SUMO1-CDK6 conjugation and eliminates CDK6-RB1 pathway. On the other hand, CDK4/6 inhibitors have been developed targeting CDK4/6-RB1 pathway and they are now in clinic for cancer therapies. RB1 deletion and mutation occurs in about 11% glioblastomas and results in the cancer resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. In contrast, we have shown that SMIC1 can overcome the resistance through inhibition of various SUMO1 substrate proteins. The objective of this proposal is to develop SMIC1 as a new anticancer drug for treatment of glioblastomas. To achieve this, we will first determine the molecular mechanisms of action of SMIC1 in treatment of glioblastoma cells. In particular, we will examine how SMIC1 treatment induces the ubiquitination and degradation of SUMO1 protein and abolishes SUMO1 conjugation pathway in human glioblastoma cells. Next, we will examine the bioactivity and pharmacodynamics of SMIC1 in comparison with CDK4/6 inhibitors in genetically heterogenous glioblastoma cells and thus determine why SMIC1 treatment can overcome the resistance of RB1 deletion and mutation. Finally, we will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SMIC1 using the cancer stem cell cultures and xenograft models generated from patients' glioblastoma tissues. Upon completion, this project will lead to the genesis of a new class anticancer drug for clinical treatment of glioblastoma patients."
"9238909","ABSTRACT  End stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis (HD) affects >400,000 patients in the US and is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and costs. While HD can prevent immediate death due to uremia, the long-term survival of patients on HD remains poor. Median survival from the time of initiating HD is 3 years and 5-year survival is <35%. Over 50% of all deaths in HD patients are due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 50% of these (25% of all deaths) are sudden cardiac deaths (SCD). The high rates of SCD in HD patients have not changed in recent decades. The key barrier to progress in reducing SCD rates in HD patients is our limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying SCD. It has been assumed that the arrhythmic mechanisms for SCD in HD were the same as in the general population and that the majority of cases were due to ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), but other mechanisms have also been described in HD including bradyarrhythmias, asystole and non-arrhythmic events. Little is known regarding the prevalence of these mechanisms in HD and this is widely recognized as a major clinical challenge. In addition, several characteristics of the HD session may contribute to arrhythmic risk. The typical dialysate prescription, low in potassium and calcium and high in bicarbonate concentrations, and rapid fluid shifts and hypotension during HD may further increase the risk of arrhythmias. Previous studies of arrhythmic risk in HD patients have been limited by the lack of continuous cardiac monitoring or by small sample sizes.  We propose to conduct the Cardiac Arrhythmia Monitoring and Related Outcomes in HD (CAMARO- HD) Study, a cohort study of the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias and their associated outcomes among 1,000 patients recruited within the first 6 months of initiating HD. We will implant a subcutaneous cardiac monitor (Reveal LINQ) in each patient to continuously record the cardiac rhythm and identify all episodes of VT/VF, bradycardia, asystole, and atrial fibrillation during 3 years of follow-up. We will then evaluate the association of arrhythmic events and arrhythmic burden with study outcomes (all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization). CAMARO-HD will also test the hypothesis that specific characteristics of the HD session contribute to arrhythmic risk and will assess if differences in arrhythmic burden between Black and White patients mediate the well-known race-survival paradox in HD.  CAMARO-HD will be the largest cohort of HD patients with long-term continuous cardiac monitoring and precise information on ventricular and atrial arrhythmic episodes with a sample size large enough to quantify their clinical consequences in terms of mortality and heart failure hospitalization. CAMARO-HD will also provide actionable information related to the arrhythmic mechanisms responsible for deaths or heart failure hospitalizations and to the association of specific characteristics of the HD session with arrhythmic events. This information will directly modify clinical practice and will inform the design of preventive trials."
"9244900","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Transient mixed hematopoietic chimerism and long-term survival of kidney allografts in the absence of immunosuppression has been achieved in monkeys and patients via non-myeloablative conditioning, infusion of donor bone marrow cells and short-term leukocyte costimulation blockade. However, a significant proportion of monkey kidney allografts (50%) undergoing long-term survival display features of chronic rejection (CR) within one year post-transplantation, a phenomenon also observed among many patients treated with a similar procedure at MGH. Recently, B cells have been implicated in both transplant rejection and tolerance. However, the nature of the B cells involved in these processes and their mechanisms of action are still unclear. Our proposed research will use a large collection of specimens (from blood and lymphoid organs) to characterize the phenotype as well as cytokine and gene expression profiles of the B cell subsets involved in chronic rejection vs. tolerance of kidney allografts in monkeys treated with our mixed chimerism procedure. In addition, we have recently identified a novel population of B cells in monkeys (and humans), which are CD19+ CD20+ BCR+ and unexpectedly CD8+. Most importantly, preliminary studies show an expansion of these unconventional B cells in the peripheral blood of chimeric monkeys, which became tolerant. To our knowledge, the nature, functions and association with tolerance of these B cells have never been investigated. Further characterization of the phenotype, cytokine signatures and regulatory properties of newly discovered CD8+ B cells (found in monkeys and humans) and evaluation of their association with immune tolerance has potential implications both in basic and clinical immunology Specific aim 1. To identify B cell subsets and signatures involved in chronic rejection vs. tolerance of kidney allografts. Specific Aim 2. To further characterize newly described CD8+ B lymphocytes and investigate their relationships with tolerance In addition to the theoretical implications of the work related to basic B cell biology, identification of the B cell subsets and signatures of transplant tolerance will enhance the safety and feasibility of clinical tolerance trials and facilitate management of patients receiving immunosuppression."

"9332709","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Indians have high rates of diabetes, prediabetes and cardio metabolic risk factors. There is strong evidence that lifestyle change, particularly weight loss, increasing physical activity, and improving diet quality can prevent or delay diabetes, reduce cardiometabolic risk factors such as elevated glucose, plasma lipids, and blood pressure, and improve outcomes among individuals with diabetes. Implementing lifestyle change education and support at the worksite may be an effective and cost-effective method to deliver prevention in a way that is acceptable, accessible, and sustainable and overcomes barriers to lifestyle change (e.g., lack of time or resources). Building off previous work by the international study team, this study proposes implementing and evaluating in a pre-post design trial the acceptability, delivery, effectiveness, and cost- effectiveness of a worksite-based lifestyle improvement package including a peer-led lifestyle change education program augmented with changes in the worksite environment that promote social support, healthy eating and exercise. The lifestyle education program will include 2000 adults with prediabetes (HbA1c of 5.7- 6.4%) or unmedicated diabetes (HbA1c = 6.5% identified at screening) across eight diverse worksites in India (changes to the worksite environment will impact a much broader population of employees). A mixed methods approach will be used to evaluate implementation of the program. The study aims to measure: (1) Success of implementation in terms of program adoption (participation and changes in weight and diet and physical activity behaviors among lifestyle class participants); fidelity to the program (activities of study-affiliaed worksite staff; changes to the food options at the worksite canteen; management support for the program; and changes in the worksite environment); and program acceptability as reported by employees, managers, supervisors, and lifestyle education program participants and dropouts during in-depth, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. (2) Program effectiveness by evaluating the number of cardiometabolic risk goals reached for reductions in blood pressure, triglycerides, and HbA1c (the primary outcome) and through changes in secondary outcomes including rates of diabetes incidence and regression to normoglycemia and changes in anthropometry, lipids, and fasting glucose. (3) Value and return on the investment of the program for employers by assessing program costs, cost-effectiveness, and changes in staff productivity, absenteeism, health status, and quality of life. This project will deliver scientific innovations (lifestyle education programs with text message supports during maintenance) with social innovations (educated peer health educators delivering a program to a large at risk population) and business innovation (worksite stakeholder commitment and partnering researchers to help deliver the program with fidelity, improve the workplace health environment, and evaluate the model). If the program is shown to be feasible, acceptable, effective, and cost-effective at these worksites, the program could be disseminated to other worksites throughout India and elsewhere."
"9235634","Project Summary/ Abstract Differences in both high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol abundance and function likely impact the cardiovascular protective potential of HDL. HDL classically mediates reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) to the liver via processes that include the binding of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in HDL to scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) in hepatocytes. Other actions of the HDL/SR-BI tandem may also be protective, such as their capacity to activate endothelial NO production and repair via kinase signaling that uniquely requires the adaptor protein PDZK1. However, we surprisingly discovered that endothelial- specific SR-BI deletion in apoE-/- mice, which have high VLDL/LDL and low HDL, results in decreased atherosclerosis. We have further discovered that this is related to a >80% decline in LDL delivery to the artery wall, revealing the mechanism underlying a critical step in atherogenesis. As such, there may be a dichotomous role for endothelial SR-BI in atherosclerosis, promoting it in the setting of low HDL yet affording atheroprotection in the setting of high HDL. This novel concept and its mechanistic underpinnings will be interrogated in mice and in human endothelial cells. Aim 1 is to compare how endothelial SR-BI influences atherosclerosis in the setting of relatively low vs. high HDL. Atherosclerosis will be evaluated with vs. without endothelial SR-BI and HDL raised via transgenic expression of human apoA-I, and findings will be compared with those made with low HDL. The impact of endothelial SR-BI signaling on atherosclerosis will also be evaluated at low vs. high HDL by deleting endothelial PDZK1. Aim 2 is to determine the roles of endothelial SR-BI and PDZK1 in the putative atheroprotective actions of HDL. To assess HDL's anti-inflammatory actions in vivo, endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion will be evaluated by intravital microscopy, and HDL, SR-BI and PDZK1 modulation of endothelial genes that influence vascular inflammation will also be interrogated. The roles of endothelial SR-BI and PDZK1 in RCT will be determined in models that query processes in both blood and lymphatic endothelium, and in both microvasculature and arteries. Aim 3 is to determine how endothelial SR-BI governs artery wall LDL deposition. LDL uptake will be studied in cultured endothelium expressing mutant forms of SR-BI with specific loss-of-function for lipid flux, sensing of plasma membrane cholesterol movement, or C-terminal protein interaction. Further studies in culture will evaluate possible roles of other LDL receptors, and co- trafficking of LDL and SR-BI across the endothelium. Aorta LDL uptake will be evaluated in vivo in models testing the role of PDZK1, the impact of elevated HDL, and if pharmacologic intervention targeting SR-BI can decrease LDL deposition. By accomplishing these aims, we will elucidate how vascular health is influenced by endothelial SR-BI, which may be a critical point of intersection of atherosclerosis modulation by HDL and LDL. The new knowledge gained will potentially identify novel therapies for atherosclerosis."

"9257145","Project Summary/Abstract: Genes in highly identical segmental duplications (SDs) play critical roles in human evolution and disease. SDs themselves mediate pathogenic duplications, deletions, and other rearrangements whose effects range from neurodevelopmental conditions like autism to syndromic congenital diseases. The genes contained within SDs, once duplicated, are fertile ground for adaptive tinkering, and may provide innovations that underlie the evolution of human-specific traits. However, the duplicate nature of these genes has always presented extra challenges to their study. They are found in regions of the genome that are some of the most difficult to sequence and assemble; they suffer from incomplete and inaccurate annotation due to the difficulty of correctly assigning and assembling sequenced fragments of transcripts; and related to this, for many duplicated genes it is not known if they are functional?i.e., if they encode a translated and functioning protein. This project seeks to annotate segmentally duplicated genes at the level of transcription and translation and proposes a strategy to address these challenges. We will leverage a haploid genome to better discriminate between highly identical copies of genome sequence, we will combine single-molecule long-read sequencing technology with a custom cDNA enrichment strategy to accurately determine transcription of SD genes, and we will take advantage of new developments in mass spectrometry technology to identify paralog-specific peptides and determine which of these genes are translated. The goal of this study is identify functional, protein-coding genes among segmentally duplicated regions of the human genome. The generalizable approach developed in this study can be applied to duplicated space in other genomes as well. These genes will serve as candidates for future studies of human evolution and disease. If successful, this study will shed enormous light onto one of the oldest and most challenging problems in the study of the human genome."
"9259673","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT The functional specialization, healthy life, and proper disposal of cells in all metazoans require precise responses to developmental and environmental signals. These responses are largely mediated by enhancers, regulatory DNA elements that contain specific recognition sequences required for binding of transcription factors. An ideal model for investigating the actions of enhancers and transcription factors on transcriptional programs is Estrogen receptor (ER?), which is activated by binding of the sex hormone 17?-estradiol (E2) and interacts with ~7000 possible enhancers in the human genome. A major unanswered question is how this factor and the associated enhancers concurrently regulate global programs of estrogen-dependent gene activation and repression. While the key role of short-range enhancer-promoter interactions in transcriptional regulation is well established, the detailed influence of the three-dimensional chromosomal architecture on the putative estrogen-dependent regulatory enhancer network remains poorly understood. To uncover the links between chromosomal structure and regulation of gene transcriptional programs, I hypothesize that that E2/ER? and the putative hierarchical network of associated enhancers play a key role in dynamically altering the three-dimensional chromosomal architecture, and these alterations in turn contribute to the regulation of transcriptional programs. To investigate this hypothesis systematically, I propose to develop and apply bioinformatics pipelines for analyzing data from several powerful contemporary global genomic technologies, including 5C, 3D-DSL, Hi-C, GRO-seq, RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq. I also propose to build an accurate 3D model of chromosomal architecture and to document its dynamic dependence and influence on E2-regulatory enhancers in human Chr21. To this end, I will apply several computational strategies to infer ensembles of chromatin conformations from experimental contact maps, such as those provided by 3D-DSL experiments. By providing critical mechanistic insights into the regulation of transcriptional programs relevant to the endocrine system, the proposed research may help to advance the design of new therapeutic modalities to address diseases of development, metabolism, endocrinology, and aging. I so doing, I will not only become scholarly in central biological and molecular biological issues, but also I will become proficient in the use of recently- emerging advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods for the analysis of large experimental data sets. This NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship will therefore enable me to acquire invaluable knowledge, training, and experience, while making important contributions to biomedical science, critical to my goal of becoming a particularly effective independent investigator, dedicated to making transformative discoveries regarding fundamental questions in regulatory biology."
"9263614","Project Summary: Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are among the most fatal cancers because of their extensive metastasis to distant organs, even at an early stage of tumor progression. A significant majority of pancreatic cancer patients also suffer from a very poor quality of life due to cachexia. Cachexia not only impedes the response to chemotherapy but also is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, a basic understanding of the mechanisms that promote cachexia will provide a basis for developing new methods for treatment and will significantly improve the overall quality of life.  Tumor cells display alterations in metabolite flux into biosynthetic reactions that induce systemic metabolic effects causing myodegeneration and adipocyte fat depletion. Although some studies have attempted to understand the mechanistic basis of muscle and fat degradation, the metabolic link between the energy need of tumor cells and cachexia syndrome remains largely unexplored. Our preliminary studies identify a number of key metabolic pathways that have increased flux in tumor tissues and muscle specimens from pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia, in comparison to the ones without cachexia. Furthermore, our results suggest that secreted small-molecule metabolites possess cachectic activity independent of the known cachectic agents. Hence, we hypothesize that metabolic flux in tumors and secreted metabolites lead to metabolic alterations in muscle tissues, causing oxidative damage and cachexia. Furthermore, we hypothesize that targeting the metabolic pathways in tumor cells and muscles will diminish cachexia in pancreatic cancer.  To test these hypotheses, we propose to elucidate the direct role of metabolites/metabolic pathways in regulating cachexia (Aim 1), to test if catabolic pathways in muscles can be targeted to abrogate cachexia in animal models (Aim 2), and to determine if elevated levels of metabolites in muscle tissues correlate with cachexia onset and prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients (Aim 3). We will validate the increased levels of identified tumor cell-secreted metabolites in the plasma specimens from cachectic cancer patients in comparison to that of the non-cachectic cancer patients and characterize the mechanistic aspects of direct myodegeneration caused by such metabolites in animal models. We will also determine if their levels correlate with the extent of myodegeneration in patients. Furthermore, we propose to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting the underlying metabolic pathways for diminishing cachexia. Overall, these studies will utilize highly innovative concepts and approaches to address the role of metabolites and metabolic pathways in cancer cachexia and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting these pathways to diminish cancer cachexia."
"9264796","PROJECT SUMMARY Identification of diagnostic and prognostic host biomarkers of Zika virus infection by transcriptome profiling  There is currently an unprecedented ongoing outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas, with more than 100,000 cases reported to date. Limitations to existing diagnostic tests include lack of specificity for antibody-based assays and a very narrow time window for PCR (<1 week). Better diagnostic tests are urgently needed to diagnose ZIKV infection. In addition, the weight of the combined evidence now shows that ZIKV is directly responsible for devastating adverse fetal outcomes in infected pregnant women, including in utero demise and microcephaly. There is currently no laboratory test to monitor infected women and assess their risk for fetal complications. Here we propose use transcriptome profiling analysis by RNA-Seq next-generation sequencing of blood, urine, and saliva samples from acutely infected patients to diagnose ZIKV infection, and of serially collected samples from ZIKV-infected pregnant women to monitoring the dynamics of the host response. The goal is to identify diagnostic and prognostic host biomarkers that may be correlated with active infection (for diagnosis) as well as fetal infection and outcomes in pregnant women, and that can be used to develop new assays for monitor ZIKV infection and disease."

The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  NINDS intramural labs are headed by federal employees who work for the Institute, primarily located in Bethesda, MD. For more information on the NINDS Intramural program visit the website http://dir1.ninds.nih.gov/ninds/Home.aspx  For extramural research, NINDS awards grants and cooperative agreements to outside academic institutions, small business concerns and other organizations all over the U.S. and world to fund promising basic, translational, and clinical research projects. Specifically, the NINDS Office of Translational Research (OTR) is committed to facilitate the translation of basic discoveries into the development of new therapeutic interventions through early nonclinical development and early clinical investigation. For more information about the Office of Translational Research visit the website http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/areas/translational_research/index.htm  Projects that are funded through a cooperative agreement award mechanism are led by the principal investigators (PI) team with NINDS program staff participation in guiding the project plan. The PI?s team performs all of the experiments while NINDS role is to establish performance milestones for each project to facilitate go/no-go decision making and then monitor research progress and achievement of project milestones.    STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE    The NINDS is seeking senior-level, industry-experienced discovery and development Biologics Regulatory Affairs consultants with expertise in biotechnology products and biologics to assist NINDS program staff to vet and advance only the most promising therapeutic biologics through the discovery and development pipeline. Both individual subject matter experts and multidisciplinary teams from consulting firms are encouraged to apply. The NIH anticipates awarding multiple consulting awards in reference to this requirement. Approximately two, and a maximum of three, awards are anticipated.   A. SCOPE OF WORK  General Requirements  Each consultant is expected to provide technical guidance and advice on advancing discovery and development projects through early nonclinical development and submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) package, and in some cases, design of early clinical protocol and launch of a first in human clinical trial. Consulting services will be for NINDS biologics-focused projects or any other NIH program with similar needs as outlined in the scope of this statement of work.  Consulting advice and guidance shall be required to supplement NINDS program experience from the pre-application stage and then throughout the life of each project to review and monitor progress.  Consultants will serve as a resource to NINDS staff from the start of early discovery stage projects to structurally modify and optimize design characteristics of leads through IND-enabling activities necessary to advance potential development candidates through scale up, and early phase clinical trials.  Consultants will be expected to provide feedback and guidance on projects to NINDS staff through written documents, conference calls, and by email. The consultants? major responsibility will be in offering review, guidance and advice on projects. They will be expected to offer technical review and feedback on project milestones, progress reports, or development plans, study design, and data interpretation. Specific consulting responsibilities will depend on the expertise of the individual consultant and the needs of individual projects.  On rare occasion, consultants may be asked to give oral presentations to NINDS staff or at an NINDS sponsored webinar, workshop or conference to provide training to investigators in their area of expertise.   Consultants may be involved in multiple projects.   Each project team is led by a PI and supported by NINDS staff with disease and therapy development expertise. The joint team establishes project milestones and monitors progress at least annually. The PIs conduct all of the research activities and report progress to NINDS. NINDS staff will interact directly with the PI and request assistance from consultants to review and provide expert advice on specific topics.

"9397628","ABSTRACT The shared epitope (SE) is the single most significant risk factor for severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet its mechanism of action is not completely understood. During budget years 01-05 of this R01 project, we identified the SE as a signal transduction ligand that specifically interacts with a well-defined binding site on cell surface calreticulin (CRT) and activates intracellular signaling events that lead to Th17 polarization and osteoclast activation. When administered to mice with collagen-induced arthritis, a synthetic SE ligand enhanced the severity of erosive joint destruction. Furthermore, based on structure-function characteristics of SE-CRT interaction, we have therapeutically targeted the pathway with CRT-binding small molecules that potently inhibited the arthritogenic pathway with resultant amelioration of experimental arthritis in mice. Based on preliminary results obtained in the current funding cycle of this project, in years 06 ? 10 we will carry out experiments that will advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and functional outcomes of the SE-activated pathway. Additionally, we will elucidate the signaling and functional effects of a protective epitope (PE) ligand that we recently discovered. This ligand appears to counteract the SE pathway and may explain a long-established but poorly understood epidemiologic association between particular HLA-DRB1 alleles and protection against RA. The hypothesis of this project states that in RA: A. Disease-facilitating and disease-protective HLA- DRB1alleles code for distinct ligands, which transduce reciprocal cell activation and differentiation signals; B. The SE pathway activates protein citrullination. The research plan in the coming 5 years will address this hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1. To delineate the respective signaling pathways activated by the SE and PE ligands and determine their functional effects on cell differentiation; 2. To analyze signature HLA- DRB1-coded ligand-activated transcriptomes using an RNA-seq approach; 3. To characterize the mechanism of a recently discovered SE-activated protein citrullination pathway, and determine its in vivo effects. Successful completion of the proposed research will illuminate fundamental questions concerning HLA-disease association, provide important new insights into the pathogenesis and etiology of RA, and set the stage for designing novel therapeutic strategies."
"9397784","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the UIC Multidisciplinary Oral Sciences Training Program (MOST Program) is to provide outstanding research training to predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees in five areas relevant to the oral- craniofacial complex: microbiology/immunology, oral cancer, wound healing, tissue engineering/biomaterials, and clinical/translational research. The MOST Program engages 35 training faculty from 6 UIC colleges to provide interdisciplinary and collaborative training in research related to oral and craniofacial sciences. MOST provides a comprehensive and flexible approach to training individuals at multiple levels, with the goal of establishing a pipeline of young scientists and clinician-scientists who are expertly trained and encouraged to pursue careers that includes oral and craniofacial research. The program consists of two different components. The first component, predoctoral training, trains DSTP students, and includes study within the COD doctoral program in Oral Sciences or an aligned doctoral program. Highly qualified non-dentists with thesis projects relevant to oral health are also eligible to participate in this component. Th second component, post-doctoral training, targets individuals who already hold a PhD, DDS/DMD, or DDS/DMD-PhD, with the goal of preparing them to be fully capable independent scientists in oral health research. Post-graduate dentists, including junior faculty, may obtain additional formal research training by completing either a PhD program or the MS in Clinical and Translational Research. For all trainees, the program is individually tailored according to prior experience, and each trainee is provided with a customized timeline of activities. Within this interdisciplinary yet integrated program, trainees and faculty interact through scheduled journal clubs, seminars, career development sessions, and other trainee events. The program is supported by faculty with substantial expertise in the five focus areas of research, and by an aggressive plan to recruit under-represented minorities. Due to growth in our research capacity and infrastructure, UIC is uniquely poised to provide research training that will support the NIDCR stated goal of developing a cadre of highly qualified independent scientists who can successfully address basic, behavioral, and clinical research questions to improve oral, dental and craniofacial health."
"9197591","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  This core is designed to support and advance our efforts to overcome the major shortcomings in risk adjustment and performance measurement needed to ensure that any health care reform (whether the currently legislated one or alternatives) results in improved efficiency. This Core is intended to provide key support for an ongoing initiative intended to advance the science of health risk, health outcome and health system performance measurement, while accelerating the broad scale adoption of more comprehensive, meaningful and reliable measures of health risk and health outcomes. First, the Core would support the development, testing and implementation of innovative measures of risk and outcome using Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), geographic based approaches and patient reported measures obtained from participating organizations. The core will assemble the databases needed to develop the measures described in Project 5 and will provide the infrastructure to support the collection and use of patient-reported measures by the three participating health systems. Second, it would support the Dartmouth Patient-Reported Measures Trust, which has two distinct but related goals: (a) to work with key stakeholders to build consensus on meaningful measures of health risks, health outcomes and health system performance, and (b) to help accelerate delivery system adoption and use of these measures. We anticipate that these collaborative efforts could yield key dividends in the next several years - patient-reported health measures (and biomarkers) across a wide range of health systems for use in Subprojects 1, 2, and 4. Finally, the Core would disseminate to collaborating investigators the advanced measures developed through this work. The Core will be able to provide to other investigators participating in this P01 (and through Core A, others in the research community where permissible) the following critical measures: (a) innovative measures for risk adjustment for use in all P01-related analyses using the Medicare data and HRS data; (b) innovative measures of risk and performance at the system level, beginning with the 3 pilot sites and (we hope) expanding to additional sites."
"9197594","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Prescription drugs accounted for 11% of Medicare spending in 2010, but are expected to account for 20% of this budget by 2020. The purpose of this subproject is to advance our understanding of the use and efficiency of prescription drugs among Medicare beneficiaries. First, we characterize the use of pharmaceutical drugs in the U.S. Medicare population at the level of the region or physician-hospital network (PHN) into four categories depending on efficiency or effectiveness - that is, value per dollar spent. These range from the first category, highly effective, to the fourth category, drugs which could lead to adverse effects on health. In this and subsequent analyses, we will consider factors that may affect the efficiency of pharmaceutical use, such as care fragmentation, academic affiliation, health information technology adoption, market structure, and for some physicians, board scores from the American Board of Internal Medicine examinations. These measures can also be used across other subproject analyses, for example for PHNs in subproject 1 and regions in subproject 4. Second, we focus on pharmaceutical treatments for specific cohorts: myocardial infarction survivors, hip fracture survivors, and incident cases of chronic pulmonary disease. This focus allows us to adjust more easily for patient level factors and identify clearly effective treatments (e.g., clopidogrel following a drug-eluting stent). In later years, data will permit assessment of the impact of payment structure such as shared savings and partial capitation on prescription use measures. Third, we use the cohorts developed in the previous subsection to measure substitution effects, the extent to which spending wisely on highly effective pharmaceuticals may have positive effects on downstream healthcare costs, and conversely for those drugs with little known value (or even negative value). To adjust for differences across areas in underlying risk, we will draw on Project 5's risk adjustment measures. Finally, we describe differences in prescription drug use in population subgroups. Early work shows substantial differences in use of some effective medications among Medicare subgroups (e.g. Black, older, poor) compared to the population overall. In addition, we intend to study the under-65 Medicare population (largely those receiving Social Security Disability Insurance) where pharmaceutical treatment for mental illness is likely to be common."

"9200971","BTB Support - The Biological Testing Branch Support Group is responsible for providing information relating to the preclinical chemistry and pharmacology of new anticancer agents identified by the Developmental Therapeutics Program. The analysis of drug candidates in biological fluids involves creating, applying, and validating methodology for each drug candidate. This analytical methodology then permits investigation into possible inter-relationships between dose, bio-fluid (such as plasma or urine) concentration, and bio-effect. The results of such studies may lead to a better understanding of drug activity as well as suggest the best route and dose schedule for administration. Such efforts requires extensive knowledge of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and molecular spectroscopy such as ultraviolet (UV), fluorescence, and all forms of mass spectrometry. Additionally, this group was charged with providing pharmacological support to the recently implemented NCI-sponsored Phase 0 clinical trials. In addition to the scientific studies supported by this effort, this group is also responsible for providing administrative support to the DCTD Animal Production Program. This program supplies rodents to the NCI, NIH, USAMRIID, FDA and other government agencies. In addition, surplus animals are provided to NIH grantees on an as-available basis. This effort supports many of the preclinical studies required to develop drugs to treat cancer, HIV and other viral diseases, bacterial and toxin-induced diseases, metabolic diseases including diabetes, immunologically induced conditions including autoimmune conditions, and other disease states supported by Federal research funds.  DTP Animal QC - Animal models of human disease continue to play a pivotal role in our understanding of disease progression and treatment. As part of the support to the diverse array of animal model studies, DCTD has animal production contracts that provide rodents to the NCI, NIH, FDA, USAMRIID, other Federal agencies as well as NIH grantees on an as available basis. As part of this effort, DCTD routinely assesses the health status of the animals being distributed so as to assure the research community of the quality and biosecurity of the research animals they receive. To this end, the Laboratory Animal Sciences Program (LASP) provides diagnostic services for routine and special-need assessments of the health status of the animal production colonies. These assays include murine antibody production (MAP) tests which identify occult viral infections, PCR-based assays for Helicobacter and certain viral agents as well as bacteriological assessment of rodent and fomite-derived samples to assure the status of the production colonies. In addition, this laboratory monitors the health of all rodent colonies at NCI-Frederick which further protects the DCTD Animal Production Program by identifying and eliminating possible sources of infection within the Frederick campus.  Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory (AHDL) - The Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory (AHDL) is responsible for monitoring the health of all rodents at NCI-Frederick, NCI-Bethesda, NCI-DTP Rodent Producers, and several NCI contract facilities. The AHDL also provides diagnostic resources to several other NIH facilities and USAMRIID. The major focus of the diagnostic services includes microbiology, parasitology, serology, and health-monitoring necropsies. The AHDL has been a consistent resource to the scientific community for more than 30 years.  BTB Animal Care Support - SAIC-Frederick, Inc., and NCI Bethesda are among the 730 organizations, institutions, and companies worldwide that are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC International). The animal support areas of LASP consist of the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory (AHDL), Animal Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory (AMDL), Receiving and Quarantine (R&Q), Laboratory Animal Medicine (LAM), and NCI animal facilities.

"9368962","Human Papillomavirus infection is mostly benign and self-limiting, however certain genotypes are considered high risk and oncogenic. HPV has been found in virtually all cervical cancers with HPV 16 causing 50% and HPV 18 another 20%. Currently, there are three licensed human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines with excellent efficacy, but poorly characterized correlates of vaccine induced immunity. One of the vacines is bivalent (Cervarix, GSK), the second is quadrivalent (Gardasil, Merck), while the third is nonavalent (Gardasil9). All three vaccines utilize virus like particles (VLPs) based on the L1 major capsid protein from HPV. VLPs are noninfectious protein capsids which can be produced by expressing the capsid protein in yeast or insect cells. The recombinant L1 capsid protein assembles in into the 60-nm HPV VLP. The efficacy of each vaccine has been evaluated with different standards, making comparison of the vaccines difficult. There has also been indication suggesting that one dose of these vaccines may be as efficacious as the three dose regimen currently in use, however there is no set of serological standards that could be used for evaluation. Currently, pooled human serum serves as the best standard and is used to create a curve from which results are extrapolated in arbitrary Units/ml. However, the pooled serum is a finite resource and subsequent studies require the development of a new pool that is calibrated against the previous pool and therefore has its limitations as a standard. The goal is to establish a laboratory that would standardize and harmonize serological assays for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) antibody testing through development of validated reagents and standards that will be available to the scientific community. The laboratory will provide well qualified and standardized high-throughput testing that adheres to regulatory requirements defined for vaccine development and implementation.

"9369154","The cancer surveillance data collected and released by the NCI?s SEER program has served as a cornerstone in describing national trends in cancer incidence and survival in the United States. The recent advances in medicine call for collecting more detailed information on patient and tumor characteristics, as well as treatment for evaluating cancer control interventions. However, because SEER relies heavily on data abstracted from hospitals? medical records, information about medical tests or treatments that are likely to be given at doctor?s office, is often not fully captured by SEER. Linking records of individual patients in SEER and health databases, for example medical claims data that have more detailed and complete therapy information provides a unique opportunity to augment the SEER data. Because the quality of the linked data heavily relies upon the methods that one uses to establish the linkage, it is important to evaluate record linkage methods and practices to ensure the linked data can be used for providing valid answers to scientific research. The efficiency and quality can be improved if such additional data can be acquired and linked to existing cancer registry records through the SEER Data Management System (SEER*DMS).  SEER*DMS is an NCI centrally-managed system deployed to SEER registries to import, edit, link, consolidate and report data. Record linkage is an integral component of SEER*DMS. However, the current deterministic linkage algorithm as implemented in SEER*DMS may be inferior to the probabilistic algorithm as commonly implemented in stand-alone software, such as Census? BigMatch and CDC?s Linkplus. True matches may not be identified especially when the linking variables are not accurate. The purpose of this project is to provide recommendations to the NCI about methods and approaches to link medical claims data with traditional cancer registry data using SEER*DMS, and design evaluation studies to identify areas for improvement on SEER*DMS linkage algorithm."

Diet quality indices such as the HEI are increasingly applied to prospective cohort data because of, 1) the relative ease and appeal of representing the complexity of the total diet with a standardized metric, and 2) their ability to readily translate findings into relevant public health messages (i.e., following a diet that aligns with dietary guidance is or is not associated with a specific health outcome). Given the recent release of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the associated HEI-2015 to be developed, there is a pressing need to establish the predictive criterion validity of the new HEI-2015 in a diverse cohort such as the Multi-ethnic Cohort, using all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality outcomes."

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducting research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of neurological disorders and stroke. The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease.       The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience (BPN) Research is a consortium of 15 NIH Institutes and Centers that support neuroscience research, established the Neurotherapeutics Network as a pipeline between the typical endpoint of NIH-funded research and the beginning of industry drug development. The BPN provides neuroscience researchers with funding and access to a full range of industry-style drug development services and expertise. The program is intended for projects requiring medicinal chemistry optimization and CRO support through phase I clinical testing. Each project is directed by a Lead Development Team composed of the principal investigator, industry consultants hired by NIH, and NIH staff. This team maps out a research strategy, including milestones, and oversees implementation by contract research providers. Bioactivity and efficacy studies are funded through an award to the principal investigator; other research services are provided without cost to the PI through NIH contracts.   STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE   The NIH is seeking senior-level, industry-experienced drug discovery and development consultants with expertise in the following specific disciplines to provide leadership and technical guidance on drug discovery and development projects in the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network and possibly other NIH neuroscience-focused drug discovery and development programs.    ?

"9200966","The Cancer Imaging Program (CIP) supports projects in regulatory affairs, medical imaging agent availability, and imaging informatics under the overall mission of supporting discovery and development of cancer treatment modalities utilizing imaging platforms. The regulatory support that CMRP provides to the Cancer Imaging Program has enabled wider availability of investigational agents for exploratory clinical trials -- by contract, in the research community, and within the Joint Early Phase Therapeutics Development Program (JDC) and the Imaging Drug Group (IDG). The program supports INDs for agents being evaluated in brain tumors, metastatic prostate cancer, cervical cancer, metastatic breast cancer and lung cancer. These medical imaging drugs include Position Emission Tomography (PET), single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) specific contrast agents.  Additionally, the Regulatory Affairs Director collaborates with other programs within NCI, with other groups within NIH at the Clinical Center and Frederick, and with scientific societies and FDA to support the CIP program goals of wider use of medical imaging in diagnosis, stratification of patients to treatments, response to therapy monitoring, therapeutic drug development and medical decision making. These activities include web, meeting, and workshop outreach; advising interested parties on the requirements of clinical research with IND agents, providing letters of authorization to CIP INDs to independent researchers and pharmaceutical companies that wish to file their own INDs for research, encouraging the small radiopharmaceutical manufacturers to file the needed Drug Master Files to permit wider use of short half-life agents that have no IP associated with them.  An important aspect of the program is its application to systems biology and investigation of the basic biological mechanisms of cancer genesis and growth. The effort is translations, with bench to bedside and back a key aspect of the program.  The IT management support is a major contributor to initiatives across NCI in support of its imaging informatics plan. An IT manager collaborates with multiple NCI-wide committees and oversees the major initiatives in imaging informatics. This work has proven important in the NCI's development of an infrastructure that supports imaging informatics and is aimed at higher-level compatibility with CBIIT's caBIG (Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid) and other NIH Roadmap Initiatives.

CGEMS has developed into a robust research program involving genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for a number of cancers to identify common genetic variants that affect a person's risk of developing cancer. In collaboration with extramural scientists, NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) has carried out genome-wide scans for common and/or highly lethal cancers extensively studied by the Division. CGEMS relies upon data from the NCI Consortium as well as collaborative case-control epidemiologic studies with biospecimens. By scanning the DNA collected from individuals participating in these cohort or case-control studies, scientists have identified common inherited genetic variants associated with cancer risk that may lead to new preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions. The pooling of large data sets provides the statistical power to quantify the risks associated with specific gene variants and exposures, and enables subset analyses that uncover gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Researchers are applying fine-mapping and deep sequencing techniques to regions or loci identified by these scans to pinpoint the specific functional variants responsible for disease risk and the biologic mechanisms involved. Ultimately, findings from these studies may yield new preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions for cancer."

"9348201","Persons with hemochromatosis were recruited via Internet-based educational and referral information and by letters to area physicians. Comprehensive care and phlebotomy therapy were offered free of charge regardless of whether subjects met criteria for allogeneic donation. Hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, the regulatory threshold for blood donation in the U.S., was used as the threshold for performing phlebotomy, and decreases in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and ferritin were used to guide the endpoints of therapy.  543 subjects with iron overload were enrolled as of August 31, 2016. 67% of subjects were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, 68% met eligibility criteria for allogeneic donation, and 56% were previous blood donors. A median of 25 weekly or biweekly phlebotomies (range 7-99) were performed before the ferritin reached the targeted endpoint of 50-150 mcg/L. The median phlebotomy interval necessary to keep the MCV at this level during maintenance therapy was 20 weeks.  Hemochromatosis donations were safe: no incident seroconversions for agents of transfusion-transmissible disease occurred during 9400 donations made by HH donors from 2002 through 2016.  As of June 30,2016 hemochromatosis donors were contributing 575 units of red cells yearly, resulting in a contribution of 10.5% of the units collected for allogeneic use in the NIH Clinical Center, and 135 units per year distributed for research use to NIH investigators from HH donors who did not meet standard allogeneic eligibility criteria. Family member screening and counseling were facilitated by concentrating the care within the Blood Center.  Our data demonstrate that hemochromatosis subjects can safely and significantly augment the allogeneic blood supply. Provision of phlebotomy therapy in the Blood Center, unrestricted by considerations of insurance reimbursement or suitability for donation, can improve access to care and remove incentives for incomplete risk disclosure.  Evaluations performed to date in this cohort indicate that there is a higher than expected incidence of thyroid abnormalities in hemochromatosis subjects, most commonly subclinical hypothyroidism. Thyroid function abnormalities were found in 28% of female subjects with homozygosity for the C282Y  HFE mutation. A series of cardiology studies in these patients indicated that C282Y homozygotes have a statistically increased incidence of mild, subclinical abnormalities in atrial contractility and exercise-associated arrhythmias when compared to normal subjects, and these changes may be associated with elevated serum markers of oxidative stress. Left ventricular contractility and response to stress were found to be normal in C282Y homozygotes compared with control subjects.  A comprehensive analysis of arthritis in these subjects revealed that 11.8% (43/363) C282Y-homozygous versus 2.2% (4/180) non-homozygous subjects underwent a total of 44 total hip, 21 total knee, and 10 total ankle replacements. The frequency of total joint replacement was significantly greater in C282Y-homozygotes than in the control group. The cumulative risk of total joint replacement hemochromatosis subjects was 31%.  Among C282Y homozygotes, the risk of total joint replacement was markedly greater in subjects with initial ferritin levels greater than the median value of 735 mcg/L.  Among the estimated 23,966 Caucasian U.S. males age 40-79 undergoing total hip replacement each year, the data suggest that 3-4% are C282Y-homozygous."
"9348209","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) is a rare disorder associated with poor survival. Endothelial dysfunction resulting from 1) genetic susceptibility, and 2) a triggering stimulus that initiates pulmonary vascular injury, the two-hit hypothesis, appears to play a central role both in the pathogenesis and progression of PAH. Inflammation appears to drive this dysfunctional endothelial phenotype, propagating cycles of injury and repair in genetically susceptible patients with IPAH and DaPAH. However, despite mounting evidence of vascular inflammation in patients with PAH, detailed phenotypic studies are lacking on the temporal evolution of this process and its contribution to right ventricular (RV) and pulmonary vascular remodeling.  In this protocol patients are thoroughly characterized by echocardiogram, 6-minute walk, cardiopulmonary stress testing, pulmonary function testing, cardiac CT, advanced cardiac MRI techniques, gene expression profiling, and serum biomarkers. We hypothesize that a detailed characterization of these patients in conjunction with a more rigorous profile of the temporal evolution of vascular inflammation in PAH and its impact on RV and pulmonary vascular function will add prognostic value to traditional measures of disease severity and suggest novel therapeutic targets for future research.  The protocol was initially approved by the NHLBI IRB in October 2012. Subsequently IRB approval was sought and obtained at collaborating sites and various amendments were brought into alignment at all institutions by summer 2013. In 2013 -15 we established at the NIH a clinical research PAH program consisting of a multidisciplinary medical staff with expertise in cardiology, pulmonary, and critical care as well as a regulatory and research nursing support staff with extensive experience in assuring compliance with clinical protocols while maintaining the highest standards of clinical care.  In 2015-16, in collaboration with the Center of Human Immunology at the NIH, we conducted a proteomic profiling study in order to determine the effects of spironolactone on circulating mediators relevant to PAH. Fluorescent bead-based immunoassay (Bio-Plex) was used to measure cytokines in healthy controls (N=24) and PAH patients (N=55) divided into 3 diagnostic groups (IPAH/Hereditary-PAH, n=26; Connective Tissue Disease Associated-PAH, n=19; and Other n=10 Congenital Heart Disease Associated-PAH, n=7; drug-induced PAH, n=1; hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-associated PAH, n=1 and porto-pulmonary PAH, n=1). Multiple linear regression models were used to adjust for PAH clinical characteristics: Age, gender, race, NYHA/WHO classification (I/II versus III/IV), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), prostanoid infusion, current use of  1 PAH-specific therapy, and spironolactone. Circulating cytokine levels were elevated across a diverse sample of PAH patients compared to healthy controls. Functional classification and 6MWD modestly tracked with a subset of the tested cytokines. Current therapies did not appear to influence this inflammatory signature, but confounding clinical comorbidities and the relatively small number of patients may have hindered our ability to detect PAH-treatment related differences.   An abstract from this work was presented at the 2016 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 36th Annual Meeting and Scientific Sessions:   Siddiqui AH, Weir NA, WoldeHanna ML, Mazer AJ, Biancotto A, Cai R, Graninger GM, Harper BJA, Sun J, Nathan SD, Danner RL, Solomon MA, and Elinoff JM.

"9352012","We are evaluating biomarkers in patients with severe infections that lead to shock and lung dysfunction. Samples are being analyzed in collaboration with collaborators at the University of Tennessee Memphis who have conducted a trial prospectively evaluating the effects of corticosteroids on outcome from septic shock or severe respiratory failure. Our goals are to evaluate biomarkers at the time of study entry and during the course of the illness to determine if there are molecules that will help characterize the patients who are likely to have a beneficial response from corticosteroid therapy. During the last year we have screened samples from patients with documented infection and ARDS for chemokines, cytokines, hemostatic, and growth factors that have been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of lung injury.    We utilized a highly sensitive antibody profiling technology to study autoantibodies in 48 patients with either acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or severe sepsis. 57% of ARDS and 46% of septic patients without ARDS had elevated autoantibodies compared to the healthy controls. Frequent high titer antibodies were detected against a spectrum of autoantigens including potassium channel regulator, gastric ATPase, glutamic decarboxylase-65 and several cytokines. Analysis of serial samples revealed that titers of low autoantibodies at early time points rose precipitously and peaked between days 7-14. The rapid induction of autoantibodies in ARDS and severe sepsis suggests that ongoing systemic inflammation and associated tissue destruction mediate the break in tolerance against these self-proteins and may contribute to late term sequela of systemic inflammation. (J Transl Med 2010; 8:97)  We studied biomarkers in 79 patients receiving methylprednisolone or usual care during early ARDS. Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, protein C, procalcitonin and proadrenomedullin were measured in archived plasma. We found that the changes in biomarkers changes varied with the precipitating cause of ARDS (infectious vs. noninfectious and pulmonary vs. non-pulmonary etiologies), suggesting that the underlying mechanisms and response to anti-inflammatory therapy may vary with the cause of ARDS. (Crit Care Med 2012; 40:495)  We are currently evaluating the differential effects of anti-inflammatory therapy on the expression of microRNA species associated with archived samples of peripheral blood cells from patients with ARDS. These molecules may provide insight into mechanisms that are engaged with the initiation of this therapy for severely ill patients.  Preliminary analysis of this work has been presented (microRNA Expression in Peripheral Blood Cells from Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Treated with Corticosteroids. American Thoracic Society International Conference, May 16-24, 2014, San Diego, CA ).

"9352022","Despite attempts at aggressive source control in addition to intensive care unit support, mortality in the recent UK outbreak of Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) soft tissue infection among intravenous drug abusers was very high (greater than 40% in more than 40 patients). A noticeable finding among many of these patients was a marked coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. These conditions greatly complicated efforts at debridement in patients. While laboratory evidence of coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia has not been consistently reported on in prior anthrax outbreaks, pleural fluid collections and meningitis have frequently been described as hemorrhagic. Thus disruption of coagulation, excessive fibrinolysis and platelet consumption or destruction may play an important role in the pathogenesis of anthrax. Understanding the basis for these processes will be important for targeted treatment of anthrax in the future.  Anthrax is associated with several virulence factors, which could potentially contribute to coagulopathy, fibirnolysis and thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction. On the one hand, anthrax produces lethal and edema toxins (LeTx and ETx respectively). LeTx inhibits is a zinc dependent protease which disrupts MAPK pathways important in innate immunity, cell cycling and replication and other essential host functions. Edema toxin has calmodulin dependent adenyl cyclase activity and increases intracellular cAMP to very high levels. Both toxins have the potential to alter both coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelet function. However, as a gram-positive bacteria, anthrax has a peptidoglycan cell wall which could also disrupt these functions via stimulation of inflammatory pathways. While such abnormalities related to LeTx or ETx might be best treated by toxin inhibitors, cell wall induced abnormalities might require alternate forms of therapy such as anti-inflammatory ones.  The purpose of the present protocol has been to directly compare the effects of LeTx, ETx and anthrax cell wall peptidoglycan on coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelets in a previously developed rat model. In experiments now completed, animals were challenged with 24-hour infusions of one of these three components using methods developed in prior experiments. During infusion, as well as from 24 to 48 hours, animals had serial coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelet studies performed. We previously developed techniques to measure prothrombin (PT) and partial thromboplastin (PTT) times, fibrinogen levels, and thrombin anti-thrombin (TAT) levels in this rodent species.  Other measures included tissue factor, protein C, anti-thrombin III, and plasminogen activator inhibitor.  In this study anthrax cell wall peptidoglycan had marked coagulopathic and inflammatory actions, while similarly lethal doses of LeTx and ETx did not.  This work was previously published.  (Qiu p, Li y, Shiloach J, Cui X, Sun J, Trinh L, Kubler-Kielb J, Vinogradov E, Mani H, Al-Hamad M, Fitz Y, Eichacker PQ (2013) Bacillus anthracis Cell Wall Peptidoglycan but Not Lethal or Edema Toxins Produces Changes Consistent With Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation in a Rat Model. J Infection Diseases 208:978-89)   Based on this work, additional studies are now underway examining the protective effects of anti-inflammatory agents in the setting of anthrax cell wall peptidoglycan challenge. These studies are now underway. Preliminary experiments from an initial study examining the effects of corticosteroid treatment in PGN challenged animals have been completed and were presented at the 2016 International Conference of the ATS."

Project Impact Statement This project has the potential to contribute to our fundamental understanding of brain injury as well as lead to new treatments to enhance motor and/or psychological well-being and promote neural recovery in those with TBI. The use of fast speed elliptical training is based on recent evidence on the fundamental role of exercise in neural repair and recovery of function across multiple brain subsystems (motor, sensory, cognitive, emotional, etc.). This project also has strong relevance to the intent and mission of the CNRM which is to create bridges across federal institutional efforts to advance the scientific study of traumatic brain injury, with a specific interest in the potential for neural plasticity and recovery of pre-injury functioning."
"9354079","This study received CNS IRB Blue approval on March 17, 2010. The study team is fully staffed and we are actively recruiting patients for this protocol.   In July 2011 we received IRB approval for a sub study that broadens the study inclusion criteria up to 5 years since injury. The sub-study will focus on collecting primarily the TBI Common Data Elements (CDEs), bloods, and imagining.   In June 2012 the IRB approved expanding our enrollment age range from 18-70, to 18 and older. This same amendment exchanged PET-CT for PET-MRI in the imaging section of the protocol.  A section regarding offered treatment was added to address the needs of those subjects who have functional needs with limited access to community resources.    At the end of 2014 approval to collect ultra-high field (7 Tesla) imaging parameters was granted by the IRB and the NMR Center allotted time monthly.  The 7T magnet has been used to scan both blast and non-blast TBI patients in order to determine if differences between the types of injury can be detected at ultra-high field.  In September 2015 the IRB approved expanding our study population with the addition of a healthy volunteer control group.  Additionally, we have noted that the local TBI patient population is not normally distributed and has a somewhat higher level of education than average.  Although normative data to which results are compared is demographically adjusted, direct comparisons to a control group from the same population will add support to our findings.  In earlier versions of the protocol the need for a control group was discussed.  However, the decision to hold off on a control group was made until the demographics of the local TBI population was known and healthy controls could be matched to the patient population.  Including a control group of healthy volunteers to the data set provides direct comparisons to be made with a normal local sample. Therefore, collecting imaging data on a control group on the identical scanner concurrently with the patient population would provide substantial influence to this research. Collecting the same clinical correlates on a local healthy volunteer sample population, as done in the TBI population, will address this critical need when assessing novel diagnostic imaging and biomarkers techniques.  In the case of this study, this control population may need to be matched for a variety of patient demographics as well as any co-morbid illnesses that might affect our imaging or serum results.    To date, this study has enrolled 166 patients, approximately 60% of which are enrolled in the prospective cohort study and followed longitudinally. Previous recruitment challenges have been addressed with the expansion of a formulized recruitment effort and the opening of communication between the Recruitment Core and the Acute TBI Protocol under Dr. Larry Latour. Our research team has also been engaged in outreach to the community via support groups, and has initiated discussions around more formal collaborations with other TBI experts in the area, including new trauma teams in the area, such as George Washington University   Publications generated by this year's research: Lopez KC, Leary JB, Pham DL, Chou YY, Dsurney J, Chan L.

"9356698","In spite of several novel drugs for metastatic melanoma entering the market in the last few years, there is an enormous need for novel effective treatments that would not rely on patients' specific genotypes, biochemical pathways or the variability of an individual?s immune response. Previously we conducted a successful Phase 1 clinical trial of an antibody to melanin radiolabeled with beta emitter 188Rhenium. However, the IgM isotype of that antibody presented an impediment to further clinical development. Recently we have identified a novel antibody to melanin with the IgG isotype which can be easily humanized for future clinical trials.    The long-term goal of the proposal is to develop and bring to the market the radioimmunotherapy of metastatic melanoma based on this novel IgG to melanin. We are planning the following Aims: 1) Perform the conjugation of 8C3 IgG with the chelating agents to enable radiolabeling with alpha- and beta-emitting therapeutic radionuclides; 2) Carry out pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics  studies of radiolabeled 8C3 in murine and human melanoma models. Use the data from these studies to perform radiation dosimetry calculations; 3) Perform proof-of-concept RIT experiments in  murine and human melanoma models. Assess the efficacy and short-term toxicity of the treatment. We anticipate that both beta- and alpha-emitting radionuclide radiolabeled IgG to melanin will be effective in slowing down or abrogating experimental tumor growth and also safe towards all major organs. Based on the realistic estimates of  radionuclides commercial availability, we will make the selection of the most suitable radiolabeled form of IgG to melanin for the future IND enabling experiments."

Therefore, our specific objective of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to standardize the procedure and collaborative set-up for developing novel ovarian cancer cell lines to advance OC health disparity research. This will be achieved in two parts: (A) development of in vitro cell line experimental model of ovarian cancer and fibroblast cells from freshly-resected tumors/ascites fluid of AA patients; (B) Genetic characterization of newly developed cells by isoenzyme profiling, Karyotyping, short-tandem-repeat profiling and mutational analysis. Moreover, we will characterize the developed cell line for typical morphology, growth rates (population doubling time), tumorigenic and metastatic potential and drug sensitivities. Successful completion of the proposed research would establish a standardized protocol for generation of novel cell line models of OC and thus provide a strong foundation for our next step i.e. Phase II for developing up to 50 cell line models from patients of AA backgrounds as well as genetic admixtures."

"9188015","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immune responses in the lung are essential for protecting against respiratory pathogens which constitute the most prevalent cause of illness and infant/child mortality worldwide. The majority of T cells in the lung comprise the memory subset, which is generated during a previous antigen exposure, and is functionally enhanced compared to naive T cells which reside in lymphoid tissues. Memory T cells resident in lung tissue can potentially mediate rapid in situ immunity for clearing respiratory pathogens; however, there are no strategies to specifically promote lung-resident immune responses. My laboratory has identified a novel population of influenza-specific memory CD4 T cells that are retained and remain resident in lung tissue, and can promote rapid, optimal protection to influenza virus infection compared to circulating memory T cells found in spleen and lymphoid tissue. These tissue-resident memory CD4 T cells (designated CD4 TRM) are distinct from circulating effector-memory T cells (TEM), and constitute a new memory subset analogous to tissue-resident memory CD8 T cell subsets (CD8 TRM) identified in skin, intestines and other mucosal sites. We have used innovative in vivo antibody labeling and imaging approaches to study lung CD4 TRM in situ, as well as RNA next-gen sequencing to compare lung TRM to spleen TEM to identify key pathways involved in lung CD4 TRM generation and retention. We have uncovered a novel role for the integrin CD11d, specifically expressed in mouse and human lung CD4 TRM, in sustaining T cell activation and differentiation, and a role for inflammatory signals via type I IFN in lung TRM maintenance. Our central hypothesis is that generation and tissue targeting of lung CD4 TRM involves antigenic and inflammatory signals in the lung coupled with T cell intrinsic expression of CD11d, while maintenance of lung TRM relies on low-level inflammation. In the proposed research, we will use murine targeted deletion models, imaging, and bioinformatics to investigate the roles of inflammation, antigen stimulation, and CD11d expression in the generation and maintenance of lung TRM. Results from these studies will provide crucial insights for targeting lung resident populations to enhance protective immunity, and for understanding maintenance of immune homeostasis in the respiratory tract."

"9208181","In 2000, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) awarded contracts to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in young children with sickle cell disease (SCD) to test the hypothesis that Hydroxyurea (HU) can prevent the onset of chronic end organ damage in children recruited before two years of age. Contracts were awarded to ten Clinical Centers to recruit, enroll, and follow patients to monitor clinical responsiveness to study treatments, to assess growth and development, and to monitor for toxicity from study treatments. Surrogate markers of end organ damage were used to evaluate pulmonary, renal, splenic, and brain function as well as developmental milestones. One Medical Coordinating Center was awarded to oversee drug distribution, coordinate central laboratory functions, perform data collection and analysis, and conduct clinical sites visits to monitor study performance. The trial enrolled 193 subjects with SCD between the ages of 9 and 17 months from October 2003 to June 2007. Subjects remained on study drug for a period of two years. HU demonstrated substantial clinical benefit without serious toxicity in this cohort of very young children. In 2008, a follow-up study was added to the contracts to provide structured follow-up of the children after they completed their two years on study drug. The purpose of the initial Follow-Up Study is to characterize the long-term toxicities and unexpected risks (if any) associated with treatment with HU at an early age. Information obtained from this follow-up study is vitally important to understanding the risks and benefits of early treatment, and ultimately for creation of an optimal paradigm for HU therapy in young children with sickle cell anemia.

"9235061","Is there a form of benign brain amyloidosis in aging? Although relatively rare, the identification of aged individuals with significant amyloid pathology (lacking tauopathy) that are cognitively normal is one of the lines of evidence that argues against the notion that amyloid-? (A?) deposition is a direct mediator of cognitive decline. Our study seeks a potential explanation for cases of amyloidosis that appear benign by testing the hypothesis that the brains of these pathologic aging (PA) individuals, as compared to Alzheimer disease (AD) brain, contain a distinct conformer of A? assembly that is essentially benign. One potential explanation for amyloid pathology that is benign, in regard to cognition, is that A? may assemble into structures that are conformationally distinct, with some conformations possessing an activity that diminishes cognitive function while others do not. To address this question, we will take advantage of recent studies that have shown that rate and character of amyloid deposition in vulnerable transgenic mice can be greatly influenced by injecting homogenates from human Alzheimer?s disease (AD) brains into their brains. Our preliminary studies, presented below, demonstrate that we have extended this model system to include brain homogenates of PA brains. As expected, we observed robust acceleration of A? pathology in transgenic APPswe/ind mice that were injected with two different AD brain homogenates. Although less consistent, we similarly observed accelerated amyloid pathology in mice injected with brain homogenates from 4 PA cases, with one seeding comparably to AD brain. We propose to seed the brains of two distinct lines of transgenic mice that develop amyloid pathology late in life with homogenates from AD and PA brains, and then assess whether pathology induced in these animals causes cognitive impairment. If PA represents a form of A? amyloidosis that is benign, then we would expect that only the mice seeded with AD homogenates will develop cognitive deficits. Apart from clarifying the distinction between PA and AD, our study may have therapeutic implications. If there are forms of A? amyloidosis that are benign, then it might be possible to chemically modulate the conformer of A? that is associated with cognitive decline to favor the benign forms and thus reduce the burden of A? assemblies that diminish cognitive function."

"9397655","Project Summary/Abstract The immune system surveys the skin and other barrier tissues such as lung and gut, but mechanisms for failed immunity in the periphery that lead to cancer or autoimmune diseases are unknown. The dendritic cell (DC) is a specialized immune sentinel that directs T cells to tolerance or immunity. DC comprise a rich network in skin consisting of several different populations, but are understudied, leaving a major gap in therapeutic intervention. We have identified distinct properties for DC in skin that relay information by migrating out to the draining lymph node (LN). We find during inflammation skin migratory DC may direct T cells to tolerance by unknown mechanisms, counter-regulating and controlling immunity. These cells are uniquely genetically programed in humans and in mouse to dampen immunity with a high expression of shared tolerance genes, including some genes such as PD-L1 that have been successfully targeted in the clinic for peripheral tissue cancers including melanoma skin cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer. We hypothesize homeostatic programming of skin DC leads to failed immune priming leading to impaired early detection of skin cancers. We find these pathways are of great importance as therapeutic targets to promote self-tolerance (such as during autoimmune disease) or to block tolerance (to improve immunity during cancer). Because these mechanisms are distinct they can be combined with current modalities for patients in immunotherapy of skin cancer, vaccine science, and inflammatory skin disease. In 2 discrete aims, this application will address programmatic conditioning of skin DCs and the unique cellular mechanisms by which they promote immune tolerance in both mice and humans, examining consequences during immune priming and early skin cancer growth."
"9182811","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most reinfections are initiated within tissues that comprise a frontline barrier with the outside world, such as the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary mucosae. Memory CD8 T cells protect against intracellular pathogens by scanning host cell surfaces, so their migration patterns directly impact their ability to detect reinfection. It was recently discovered that a major lineage of memory CD8 T cells, termed resident memory (TRM), occupies mucosal tissues without recirculating. However, TRM act as first responders against reinfection events that are initiated in barrier tissues, and they greatly accelerate pathogen control and decrease disease. Thus, eliciting TRM may be an important goal for T cell vaccines against mucosal pathogens. Because TRM are not present within the easily sampled peripheral blood, and also because they were previously conflated with recirculating effector memory T cells, TRM have not yet been well characterized. This proposal will address major gaps in our current understanding of TRM. The hypothesis that TRM comprise different subsets, but share lineage defining markers will be tested using model infections in mice, parabiotic surgeries, and transcriptional profiling. Defining and validating bona fide markers will allow othe investigators to examine TRM biology even in systems where monitoring recirculation is impractical, or impossible (e.g. in humans), and will put the field on a firmer molecular foundation. Preliminary data indicating that TRM regulation differs from conventional T cell memories will support investigations into TRM longevity, maintenance requirements, and issues of homeostatic regulation in nonlymphoid tissues; issues with immediate relevance for vaccination. While CD8 T cells are thought to comprise an entirely separate arm of the immune system from antibodies, provocative preliminary data supports the hypothesis that CD8+ TRM act as sensory cells within the mucosae that are capable of rapidly increasing mucosal antibody concentrations in the event of reinfection. This proposal will explore the underlying mechanisms for this novel observation, which may provide further rationale for coupling T cell vaccination approaches with conventional humoral vaccine approaches for protecting against intractable pathogens such as HIV. Lastly, this proposal will test novel hypotheses related to augmenting TRM establishment within desired mucosal sites using a strategy that could be feasibly translated to humans. Practicably achieving this goal is still one of the major ambitions in T cell vaccinology. In summary, significant expertise will be leveraged to pursue fundamental biology into the emerging field of T resident memory, with very high health relatedness and potential for impact. New discoveries made here regarding TRM regulation, defining markers, longevity, function, and permissiveness to manipulation could have wide ranging impact not only for vaccines, but other T cell mediated immunological processes in tissues, including immunopathology, tumor immunosurveillance, and autoimmunity."
"9186547","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most studies of human genomic variation, nutrition, and metabolic traits have focused on non- African populations. However, Africa is an important region to study as it is the site of origin of modern humans. Africa contains the greatest levels o human genetic variation and is the source of the worldwide range expansion of modern humans to regions outside of Africa. Several common complex diseases of metabolic origin, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and certain cardiovascular diseases occur at higher frequency in African Americans, and are on the rise in urban centers in Africa. It has been postulated that this is due to genetic variants adaptive for past environments with intermittent access to food but maladaptive in nutritionally replete Westernized environments. Metabolomics technology has begun to provide insight into metabolic processes and can be used for biomarker identification for disease risk and provide insight into metabolic pathways associated with risk. Given the intimate relationship between nutrition and metabolism and subsequent disease risk, metabolomics provides a unique and powerful tool in nutritional research. In this proposal, we will exploit metabolomic profiling to interrogate extant plasma from a unique set of ethnically diverse, well phenotyped indigenous African populations who practice different subsistence patterns (agriculture, pastoralism, agro- pastoralism, and hunting-gathering) who vary markedly in markers of cardiometabolic risk. We will perform untargeted metabolomics profiling in a sample of 365 individuals and will do targeted profiling of informative metabolites in a sample of 1500 ethnically diverse Africans to identify differences in metabolites and metabolic pathways that correlate with diet and anthropometric and cardiovascular phenotypes associated with disease risk. We will integrate these data with a large genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and whole genome sequence dataset collected in the same individuals to gain insight into how genetic, nutritional and other environmental factors contribute to variation in cardiometabolic risk traits in ethnically diverse African populations."
"9198883","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Von Willebrand Disease is a commonly diagnosed bleeding disorder that has recently come under scientific scrutiny for being under diagnosed in some groups (menorrhagia) at the same time it may be over diagnosed in others (up to 1-2% of the population). Retrospective studies have been done in the US, Canada, UK, and EU suggesting that the diagnosis of VWD is usually incontrovertible when levels of VWF are less than 30 IU/dL. Frequently, VWD is diagnosed when 1 VWF test is below the normal range (<50 IU/dL). Using the stringent level of 30 IU/dL, 69% of 548 VWD index cases, on restudy did not have reduced VWF:Ag or VWF:RCo. This proposal will study prospectively a large cohort of individuals referred to hematologists at one of 9 participating Centers and study the correlation of local diagnostic testing to central testing on repetitive study over a 5 year period. For the fist 2 years, this testing will be blinded and these results compared to similar testing over the next 2 3 years when there will be unblinded central testing and active quality control program between these institutions. Variant (type 2) VWD is diagnosed in 15-20% of individuals with VWD. New screening tests and a new VWF-phenotyping test will be developed and evaluated in this prospective study. Several quantitative bleeding scores (QBS) have been developed that help to differentiate subjects with VWD from those without VWD, but they have not been utilized to assess actual bleeding risk. Two large cohorts, one adult and one pediatric, will be studied with several QBS and these scores compared to their risk of hemorrhage prospectively. This project proposes to improve the fidelity, cost effectiveness, and sensitivity needed to diagnose VWD"

"9353637","The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches to infectious disease diagnostics is anticipated to result in substantial clinical advances. In particular, techniques based on unbiased shotgun sequencing and targeted amplicon sequencing of DNA and RNA extracted from primary specimens are expected to have many advantages over classical microbiological approaches, including the detection of pathogens directly from primary specimens that may be difficult or impossible to culture.  Nevertheless, routine application of this technique for diagnostic use is still challenging due to complicated requirements for sample preparation, the considerable expertise required for data analysis and interpretation, and the lack of off-the-shelf commercial solutions. This works aims to implement and validate an integrated NGS-based diagnostic system in a routine hospital microbiology service.  Development of this system requires choosing and optimizing appropriate DNA extraction and library preparation methods for both ubiased and targeted amplicon sequencing approaches, assembly of a local computer and network infrastructure to support in-lab processing of data, implementation and validation of bioinformatics pipelines for data analysis, and clinical reporting.   One exploratory aspect of this work is to determine the complexity of NGS pipeline output from clinical specimens, which has not been well characterized. The complexity of data obtained, in turn, will be used to guide the design of an interpretive framework for converting pipeline output into a form suitable for clinical reporting.  In the current fiscal year, we have developed SOPs for nucleic acid extraction and NGS library preparation from primary clinical specimens, designed and implemented in-lab computer and network infrastructure resources capable of manipulating and analyzing NGS data, and installed and debugged software pipelines for NGS data analysis.  Validation of the system for clinical use is currently in progress, and >100 samples representing various pathogen compositions and clinical specimen matrices have been sequenced and analyzed.  In addition, we have estimated limits of detection using a metric that relates DNA concentrations, read counts and CFU counts.  Initial validation results suggest that an NGS-based approach can offer superb sensitivity and specificity when variables are properly optimized."

"9356822","Patients treated for prostate cancer may experience treatment related late effects that adversely affect quality of life and may prove life-threatening. The objective of this Phase I SBIR application is to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of a biomarker panel predictive of radiation mediated late effects in patients treated for prostate cancer. We will develop a metabolite signature of radiation responses in a cohort of patients undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer. Analysis of banked plasma samples will be correlated with clinical outcomes to identify markers of urinary and gastrointestinal late effects for validation in a larger clinical population to be proposed in a subsequent Phase II application. The Phase II effort will allow Shuttle Pharmaceuticals to advance its proposed commercialization plan and to raise capital to support validation clinical trials leading to FDA approval. Patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancers on an IRB approved protocol have banked clinical specimens and detailed monitoring of quality of life parameters. Sub-sets of these patients have developed urinary incontinence (UI), symptomatic urinary flare (USF), obstructed voiding symptoms/retention (UR) and radiation proctitis (RP). We have used high resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomics/lipidomic profiling to analyze this unique cohort of patient samples and propose here, to leverage our established analytical platform to advance product development and validation of a biomarker panel predictive of radiation toxicities. Metabolites in plasma from a cohort of 100 de-identified patients will be analyzed to develop a kit supporting metabolomic analysis to serve as a biomarker panel predictive of patient susceptibility for radiation late effects."

"9356874","Vitamin D can have powerful anti-carcinogenic effects and oral supplementation offers the potential to reduce breast cancer risk in the US population, where a large proportion of women have insufficient levels. In a recent prospective cohort study, we showed that high levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were associated with decreased risk of breast cancer over the subsequent five years. We seek to expand upon our existing work by investigating how 25(OH)D levels change over time and the implications of these changes for assessing the association between vitamin D and breast cancer. We will do this by examining how breast cancer diagnoses and other time-varying, health-related factors affect changes in women?s 25(OH)D levels. To conduct this work, we will use data from the Sister Study, a large prospective cohort study of women who had a sister with breast cancer but had never had breast cancer themselves when they enrolled (2003-2009). We have already assessed baseline 25(OH)D levels in 3,386 participants (including 1,611 women who developed breast cancer and 1,775 women who did not). Serum specimens were collected from 2,430 of these same women in 2013. In this proposal, we will measure 25(OH)D levels in the repeat samples."
"9358850","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. While the five-year survival rate for localized CRC is excellent at 90%, more than half of new CRC cases have the disease spread to regional lymph nodes and/or distant organs at the time of diagnosis. CRC with distant metastasis has a dismal five-year survival rate of 13.5%. These data clearly indicate that CRC-related mortality can be significantly improved if the disease is detected early. Risk factors for CRC include age (>50), race (African American), obesity, cigarette smoking, type II diabetes, history of inflammatory bowel diseases, family history of colorectal polyps or CRC, and inherited genetic syndromes known to increase the CRC risks, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome. FAP and Lynch syndrome are caused by germline mutations in the APC gene and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, respectively. The management of individuals with hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes requires additional measures beyond what is recommended for the average-risk population to minimize the overall risk of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality.        Fusobacteria are common human oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora isolated from dental plaque and gum diseases, but rarely detectable in the colorectum of healthy individuals. In recent years, the enrichment of a specific pathotype, Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), has been demonstrated in the colonic tissues and stools from patients with colorectal adenomas and CRC. Clinical evidence suggests that the prevalence of Fn progressively increases from dysplasia, adenomas to CRC, and the higher amount of Fn is significantly associated with CRC with high microsatellite instability (MSI-high), which is caused by DNA MMR deficiencies as seen in Lynch syndrome-associated CRC. The potential association of Fn with CRC tumorigenesis has been examined in a mouse model of FAP. ApcMin/+ mice, which carry a nonsense mutation at codon 850 of the Apc gene (Apc?850), had a significantly accelerated onset and increased multiplicity of both small intestinal and colorectal tumors after oral inoculation of Fn. These data strongly suggested the tumor-promoting role of Fn in ApcMin/+ mice.       Although how Fn contributes to CRC tumorigenesis has yet to be fully elucidated, emerging evidence points to its two virulence factors, FadA and Fap2, as potential enhancers of CRC tumorigenesis and progression. FadA adhesin, which is expressed on the bacterial surface, mediates Fn attachment and invasion of endothelial and epithelial cells. A recent study has shown that the Fn FadA binds to E-cadherin and activates Wnt/?-catenin signaling, resulting in increased cell proliferation in human colon cancer cells. Disruption of FadA and E-cadherin binding by synthetic inhibitory peptides significantly reduced Fn-driven CRC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. In the clinical setting, the increased level of FadA expression has been demonstrated in colonic adenoma and CRC tissues obtained from human patients. The Fn Fap2 protein is another virulence factor suggested to play a role in Fn-associated CRC tumorigenesis in humans. The Fap2 binds to human T-cell immunoglobulin ITIM domain (TIGIT), an immunoglobulin superfamily receptor known to function as an immune co-inhibitory molecule. Its ligands, CD155 and CD112, are expressed on antigen presenting cells, T cells as well as on a variety of tumor cells. Fap2-binding to TIGIT on NK and other T cells protects tumor cells from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and blocks effector T cell functions in the tumor microenvironment. TIGIT has also been shown to promote Treg function. Taken together, Fn may exert tumor promoting effects not only by promoting CRC tumor growth via activation of Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway, but also by exploiting the immune-suppressive function of TIGIT via the Fap2 protein and contributing to tumor immune evasion mechanisms.      Prophylactic vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) have been associated with significant reductions in infection rates, which are expected to result in the dramatic decrease in the incidence of cervical cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Compared to the prevention of infection, the eradication of oncogenic infectious agents from the host is in general highly challenging, if not impossible. Nontheless, the host immune defense system may be fortified by pathogen-targeted vaccines, if they can boost anti-pathogen immunity and lead to the containment of infection or suppression of pathogen-mediated tumorigenic functions.       As with other gram-negative bacteria, Fn produces outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which contain much of the biological content of the Fn, but without replicative capacity. OMVs are naturally secreted, bi-layered lipid membrane nanostructures of 20-250 nm in size, and are highly stable and immunogenic. OMVs can also be engineered to express specific antigens, while genetically altered to reduce the endotoxicity. As has been demonstrated with the successful development of highly efficacious OMV based anti-meningococcal serogroup B vaccines (i.e. Trumenba and Bexsero), Fn OMV may be used as anti-Fn vaccines to elicit immunity that would reduce Fn colonization. The current project will attempt to develop Fn OMV based vaccines (Fn vaccines), which will result in the reduction of Fn colonization in the intestine and colorectum and in turn reduction of the CRC risk in individuals with FAP and Lynch syndrome as well as in other high-risk cohorts."

"9334379","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to emulate and model key mechanical and biochemical conditions of developing heart valves towards the ultimate goal of creating a robust tissue engineered heart valve (TEHV). We hypothesize that growth factors critical to embryonic valve development regulate valve interstitial cell (VIC) extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and remodeling in a tension- dependent manner. We propose that a quantitative understanding of growth factor-tension interactions will reveal conditions which stimulate VICs to produce tissues with high glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content that resist shortening. To test our hypothesis, VICs will be cultured in small-scale tissue models made from natural proteins which allow for control over tension generated by the cells and rapid analysis of tissue mechanical and biochemical properties in a high-throughput manner. We will quantitatively assess the effect of tissue tension and combinations of exogenous addition of transforming growth factor-beta1, epidermal growth factor, and bone morphogenetic protein-2 on tissue mechanics and composition and model the balance between ECM secretion and degradation computationally. The results from this systematic study will have a direct impact on tissue engineered heart valve (TEHV) development by determining optimal culture conditions for robust tissue formation with minimal shortening. The findings will also increase our understanding of how growth factors and mechanical stimuli coordinate valve development and repair and lead to pathological remodeling. The approach of creating immature tissue under low tension based on embryonic valve development is an innovative departure from standard TEHV fabrication paradigms."
"9338945","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aortic aneurysms and dissections (AAD) carry significantly high morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, no clinically proven medication is available to prevent disease progression. There is a critical need to develop effective pharmacological strategies to treat the disease. This project focuses on sporadic AAD which account for more than 80% of cases. One of the significant features of sporadic AAD is progressive smooth muscle cell (SMC) dysfunction and depletion, for which the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The aortic wall is constantly exposed to various insults such as hemodynamic disturbance, inflammatory factors and metabolic stress. These factors can interfere with normal cellular functions. Protein biosynthesis and folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is particularly vulnerable to stress. Disruption in this process causes protein misfolding and ER stress, which in turn can amplify stress and induce a cellular inflammatory response that leads to cell dysfunction, dedifferentiation, and even cell death. The overall objectives of this application are to determine the role of ER stress and ER stress sensor STING in aortic destruction, and the extent to which this mechanism represents a therapeutic target against AAD. We propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanisms by which the ER stress-STING pathway induces SMC dysfunction and depletion. Aim 1A, we will test the hypothesis that the ER stress-STING pathway, through IRF3, inhibits myocardin/SRF-mediated transcription of SMC genes, and induces SMC dedifferentiation and dysfunction. Aim 1B, we will test the hypothesis that the ER stress-STING pathway promotes RIP3/ MLKL phosphorylation/activation and induces SMC necroptosis. In Aim 2, we will define the role of the ER stress-STING pathway in biomechanical failure and AAD formation in vivo. Aim 2A, we will test the hypothesis that ER stress pro- motes SMC dedifferentiation and depletion, and thus renders the aortic wall vulnerable to hemodynamic stress and susceptible to AAD formation. Aim 2B, we will test the hypothesis that STING is critically involved in AAD development by inducing SMC dedifferentiation, necroptosis and depletion. In Aim 3, we will test the therapeutic potential of targeting the ER stress-STING pathway for AAD treatment. We will test the hypothesis that pharmacologically reducing ER stress (e.g. with phenylbutyrate) or preventing STING activation (e.g. with amlexanox) will prevent SMC aortic destruction and disease progression. The proposed research is significant because it will not only provide novel molecular insights into AAD development, but also test a new therapeutic approach to prevent disease progression by reducing ER stress and blocking its detrimental response. Our study is also significant because the novel mechanisms on SMC dedifferentiation and necroptosis have broad implications in many other cardiovascular diseases. This research is innovative because it investigates the ER stress-STING pathway in AAD development, which has not been examined before. This study is a novel mechanistic investigation of necroptosis that triggers significant tissue destruction and inflammation."
"9339830","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Long QT Syndrome Type 3 (LQT3) is an inherited channelopathy associated with a high-risk of life-threating cardiac events across the entire age spectrum from infancy through adolescence to adults and seniors with unclear therapeutics. The central theme of our Multiple-PI LQT3 R01 grant is that joint collaborative investigations into the clinical, phenotype, genotype, and mechanistic aspects of LQT3 will yield novel insights and innovative targets for existing (beta- blocker) and new (sodium/calcium channel blockers) therapeutic approaches for this incompletely studied disorder, with potential extrapolation of the findings to other SCN5A-related medical conditions. This grant application involves three major research activities, each involving genotype-phenotype-therapeutic investigations at different basic and clinical levels involving: 1) Clinical: continue the enrollment and long-term follow-up o patients with LQT3 mutations in our ongoing LQT3 Registry that currently involves over 400 LQT3 patients and carry out population-based LQT3 risk stratification studies involving clinical, phenotype, gender, genotype, and therapy factors, with the information providing lead-ins to mechanistic basic science studies and gene-specific therapies; 2) Basic science: conduct biophysical and pharmacological functional investigations on specific LQT3 mutations utilizing: a) innovative, patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from patients in the LQT3 Registry harboring high-risk LQT3 mutations refractory to conventional therapy; b) relevant LQT3 mouse models investigating genetic risk and therapy in the intact animal; c) specific cellular expression studies to cross-validate the findings from the iPSC and mouse model studies and to evaluate dose-response therapies on disordered sodium-channel kinetics; and d) cardiomyocyte studies to complement beta-blocker and Na+ channel investigation in Aim 2c; and 3) Data management/analysis: provide centralized data management and coordinated biostatistical analyses to optimize the integration and science of the clinical and basic laborator studies.

"9177745","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in the world and result in more than $1.5 billion USD in associated medical costs. The most common cause of UTIs is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). UPEC use the chaperone/usher (CU) pathway to assemble and secrete pili onto their cell surfaces. These pili are virulence-associated structures that project away from the cell surface in a hairlike fashion and mediate adhesion to the urinary tract. The chaperone and usher proteins of the CU pathway work in unison to construct these pili. The chaperone, a periplasmic protein, facilitates subunit folding, prevents premature subunit-subunit interactions, and targets subunits to the outer membrane usher protein. The usher is a multifunctional pilus assembly and secretion platform, catalyzing the exchange of chaperone-subunit for subunit-subunit interactions to assemble the pilus fiber and providing the channel for secretion of the fiber to th cell surface. The usher is a large protein consisting of a periplasmic N-terminal domain (N), a transmembrane beta-barrel domain that is gated by an internal Plug domain, and two periplasmic C-terminal domains (C1 and C2). These domains act together to facilitate the ordered assembly and secretion of the pilus. The overall goal of this proposal is to structurally and mechanistically characterize the usher's role in pilus biogenesis. This proposal will test the hypothesis that the usher is both a gated secretion channel and catalytic nanomachine, and that its catalytic activity is due to a carefully coordinated sequence of usher-chaperone-subunit interactions and the accurate placement of chaperone-subunit complexes relative to one another. I propose to use fluorescence techniques to understand how the usher transfers pilus subunits from its N domain to its C domains, a necessary step to clear the N domain for incorporation of the next pilus subunit. I will use similar techniques to understand the Plug's interaction with the C domains of the inactivated usher and how and when the Plug domain is removed from the usher channel upon usher activation. Finally, I propose to probe the structural basis for usher-catalyzed pilus assembly and secretion. I will use molecular techniques to generate pilus assembly intermediates suitable for analysis by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. The information gained by the experiments described in this proposal will lead to new advances in the field of protein secretion. The results will aid in the identification f physical and mechanistic targets for novel therapeutics against UPEC, a particularly important endeavor in the current era of rampant antibiotic resistance."

"9214666","Our proposal is focused on defining the molecular mechanisms by which hepatitis C virus (HCV) triggers inflammasome activation and signaling crosstalk from interleukin (IL)-1? to drive hepatic inflammation, innate immune activation, and therapeutic outcome of infection and immunity. HCV is a major cause of liver disease worldwide, wherein disease is marked by hepatic inflammation/chronic hepatitis that eventually compromises liver function. However, the molecular mechanisms by which HCV triggers hepatic inflammation to impart immune activation and disease are not known nor has the outcome of the new direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy on these processes defined. Our studies reveal a central role for hepatic macrophages or ?Kupffer cells? in responding to HCV to trigger hepatic inflammation through activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and show that IL-1 receptor signaling imparts novel cytokine crosstalk that promotes an innate immune/inflammatory circuit driving hepatic innate immune activation underscoring liver disease. Importantly, our preliminary studies suggest that the acute drop of HCV load by DAA therapy in HCV patients can abrogate this circuit for possible resolution of innate immune activation and inflammatory signaling. Our study design comprises two Aims to investigate the hypothesis that HCV activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in liver macrophages drives hepatic inflammation, innate immune activation, and chronic hepatitis through a virion- induced inflammasome-cytokine loop that underlies immune activation and liver disease."
"9389179","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanosensitive ion channels are essential for mechanotransduction, or the conversion of mechanical force into a biologically relevant signal. Recently, two novel membrane-spanning proteins, Piezo1 and Piezo2, were identified as pore-forming subunits of a vertebrate mechanosensitive ion channel. Piezos open in response to diverse mechanical stimuli, leading to an influx of cations; this in turn leads to depolarization o the cell membrane and initiation of downstream pathways. Piezos are required for responses to light touch in Merkel cells and normal development of the vascular system. Moreover, disruption of Piezo ion channel function is implicated in several human diseases and may contribute to hyperalgesia associated with inflammatory pathways. Piezos share little homology with other ion channels, and despite their important role in normal physiology many aspects of their function remain unknown. In particular, the specific forces on the membrane and/or channel that lead to pore opening have yet to be established. The experiments proposed here are designed to elucidate the activation mechanism of Piezos. Specifically, they test the contributions of membrane curvature and/or tension as potential physical stimuli that Piezos sense. Additionally, these experiments will examine the mechanisms by which inflammatory compounds as well as native inactivation modulate the sensitivity of Piezos to a given stimulus. Identifying the physica stimulus that activates Piezos and the means by which it can be modulated will help further the understanding of the role of these proteins in abnormal physiology, as well as inform pharmacological targeting."
"9187040","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnancy is associated with substantial cardiovascular adaptations including dramatically increased maternal uterine blood flow (UBF) and fetoplacental blood flows for fetal nutrient delivery. Vasodilatation and angiogenesis are the mechanisms normally controlling maternal fetal perfusion, but perfusion is reduced in pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Based on the Barker hypothesis, when reaching adulthood, these IUGR/small birth weight babies exhibit a host of adult onset diseases, including hypertension and its associated morbidity. It is of great importance to understand the causes and sequelae of IUGR. Limited uterine space in multi-fetal gestations and uterine anomalies cause IUGR from uterine and placental insufficiency. We developed a novel surgically-created ovine uterine space restriction model that partially maintained UBF with placental vasculature adaptations to sustain viable fetuses with asymmetric IUGR. We propose to utilize this model to study numerous physiological processes involved in placental, fetal, and postnatal vascular development. We will test the hypotheses that during uterine space restriction, both the maternal and fetal components of the placenta (uteroplacental/fetoplacental interface) and specifically their vasculatures initially adapt to preserve sustained fetal growth through partial maintenance of rises in uterine and fetal placental blood flows (Aim I) via NO-mediated vasodilatory (Aim II) as well as VEGF- and FGF2- mediated angiogenesis (Aim III) via cell and molecular signaling mechanisms. However, with growth arrest after 0.9 gestation, both vasodilatory and angiogenic mechanisms are inadequate, leading to placental insufficiency with consequent cessation of fetal growth velocity. Because the vascular adaptations ultimately define the postnatal cardiovascular phenotype of IUGR offspring, we will test the hypothesis that the outcome is postnatal programming of hypertension (Aim IV) with dysfunctional renal development, RAS activation, and altered blood volume and pressor studies in yearling lambs. These aims will address vascular adaptation to decreased uterine space through physiological, signaling, and molecular mechanisms of vasodilatation and angiogenesis."
"9187043","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a deadly disease, partially treated with pulmonary vasodilators. Emerging data suggest a potential role for insulin resistance in PAH. Both conditions are linked to chronic low- grade inflammation and monocyte (MNC) activation. However, direct measurements of insulin resistance in PAH patients have not been performed to date. Furthermore, the extent to which exercise and diet may improve PAH through the modulation of insulin sensitivity and inflammation has not been investigated. Our central hypothesis is that insulin resistance is a mediator of the disease process in PAH. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) Quantitate insulin sensitivity and body composition in PAH, and correlate with PAH severity. Indices of insulin sensitivity will be calculated using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and body composition will be measured by means of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. These data will be correlated with PAH severity and mortality during a 2-3-year follow up. 2) Measure the inflammatory response of PAH-MNCs to hyperglycemia. Our working hypothesis is that insulin resistance elicits an enhanced inflammatory response in PAH. We will test this hypothesis by measuring the release of interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis-alpha by peripheral MNCs, both in the fasting state and after an oral glucose load. Aims 1 and 2 will include age-, gender-, and BMI-matched healthy controls. 3) Determine the extent to which improvements in insulin resistance via diet and exercise impact PAH. The working hypothesis is that improvement in insulin sensitivity might lead to improvements in PAH parameters through blunting of the inflammatory response. We will assess the impact of a 12-week exercise and low glycemic index Mediterranean type diet program compared to standard of care on insulin resistance, PAH indices of severity (echo estimated pulmonary pressure and right ventricular function) and monocyte- derived inflammatory cytokines, and in a proof-of-concept randomized study. The candidate has a strong clinical background in PAH, a track record of successful research endeavors with publications in major pulmonary journals, and a clear commitment and passion for patient-oriented research. The proposal's feasibility and success are predicated upon the large PAH population followed at the Cleveland Clinic; the one on one mentoring by Dr. Dweik, a PAH expert, and Dr. Kirwan, an insulin resistance expert; the collaboration with Dr. Barkoukis, an expert in diet interventions; and the CTSA Clinical Research Unit where the metabolic testing, diet counseling and exercise training will take place.

"9188474","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Our ability to regulate our impulses enables us to plan for the future, to maintain our focus in th face of distractions, and to manage our emotions. Failures of self-regulation are an important component of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and co-occurring disorders, including substance abuse and PTSD. Because of the importance of self-regulation in our daily lives, impairments have profound effects on the lives of Veterans with mTBI, who complain of poor decision making, diminished concentration, and difficult-to-control emotions. Due to barriers to care including the severity of these symptoms, the remoteness of their homes, and concerns about disclosing the extent of their deficits, many of these Veterans are poorly able to participate in counseling and cognitive rehabilitation to address these issues. In such circumstances, effective adjunctive medications to improve self-regulation are important to reinforce the ability of these Veterans to manage their symptoms and to engage in behavioral therapies. Unfortunately, very few medications are effective for cognitive issues in patients with mTBI, and current agents are not effective for many symptoms and for many Veterans.  The purpose of this application is to develop adjunctive medication options for the treatment of impaired self-regulation. To this end, we will use functional MRI to identify relevant brain networks, and a medication, tolcapone, that our preliminary data suggests will improve brain function. Specifically, self-regulatory deficits ae thought to emerge from failures of top- down control - i.e. the ability of higher-order goals to constrain impulses, habits, and other more stimulus-driven responses. Convergent data from multiple fields argue that top-down control in the brain is reflected in the ability of prefrontal cortex to influence activity in other brain regions. Given the clear need for new therapeutic approaches to self-regulatory impairments, this mapping from brain to behavior identifies a potential biomarker for self-regulatory failure, and points toward a strategy for developing treatments. As we detail in our study, both our work and other reports suggest that tolcapone may improve the ability of prefrontal cortex to influence other brain areas by increasing the amount of dopamine in the frontal cortex. Thus, we propose to directly test the hypotheses that self-regulatory deficits in Veterans with mTBI result from diminished top-down control, and that administration of tolcapone will improve self-regulation. We will employ three clinically-relevant tasks within a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled translational functional MRI study to address behavioral, cognitive, and emotional self-regulation, respectively: a financial decision-making task that balances short-term and long-term goals, an attentional task that requires subjects to pay attention to some objects but not to others, and an emotion regulation task that addresses emotion-cognition interactions.  By testing tractable hypotheses, these studies address a critical barrier to progress in the fields of cognitive rehabilitation and psychotherapy. By using brain imaging to evaluate the influence of tolcapone on brain activity related to relevant tasks, we gain insights into mechanism of action that can guide the development of treatments, whether pharmacological or otherwise. This proposal thus represents an innovative, pragmatic approach to a problem - self-regulatory difficulty after mTBI - that is widespread, under-treated, and for which Veterans desperately want new therapies."
"9197593","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The elderly account for an increasing number of injured patients seen in U.S. hospitals, and a disproportionally large share of the deaths. While geriatric injuries continue to increase in frequency, the ability to predict outcomes for this population has not improved. Specifically, we are unable to determine which patients will do well, which will benefit from specialized trauma center care, and which interventions are best suited to their specific health needs. This lack of knowledge extends to the system level, with lack of policy (such as pre-hospital triage protocols) to help guide care for this population. Current paradigms for studying injury were designed to predict outcomes in young, otherwise healthy patients. In a resilient young person, morbidity and mortality are driven by injury characteristics (injury mechanism, pattern, and severity) and quality of the care they receive. This model fails in elderly patients for two reasons: (1) outcomes in the elderly are function of many different variables; and (2) the model fails to take into account important contextual data about health and well-being in the months and years before an injury. Since injuries occur in the setting of pre-existing conditions and functional impairment, outcomes cannot be predicted by injury characteristics alone. To address this gap in knowledge, we will create a database that is needed to inform future intervention studies and trauma-related policies. Specifically, we propose the creation a nationally representative database of injured elderly patients to better define the relationship between health, function, and injury using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and HRS-linked Medicare data. Several reasons make this database compelling. First, it will allow us to combine injury outcome prediction models (based on ICD9-derived injury characteristics) with detailed health and functional status information. Second, due to its longitudinal nature, we will be able understand the contextual nature of health and function over time for the injured population. Third, because we will have Medicare claims data, we will have valuable detail regarding healthcare utilization after injury. Finally, it will allow us to conducta study in a cost-effective and timely manner that would be difficult to do prospectively. We propose three aims to better define the relationship between health, function, and injury. Aim 1 will describe the characteristics of injuries and functional status in the injured HRS-linked Medicare population. Aim 1 will also evaluate the association between worsening pre-injury function and the risk for sustaining an injury. Aim 2 will focus on post-injury outcomes. Specifically, Aim 2 will describe how injuries impact the trajectory of functional decline, and wil determine the relative contribution of patient and injury characteristics to poor outcomes. Finally Aim 3 will determine the patterns of healthcare utilization and risk factors for high costs in this population."

"9221802","ABSTRACT Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a gram-positive, opportunistic, intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes food borne illness. Given its well-characterized infection cycle and genetic amenability, L. monocytogenes provides a powerful tool to interrogate the fundamental aspects of host pathogen interactions. Recent work in our lab has found that Lm as well as other pathogens induce the production of the toxic aldehyde 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) during infection. We have found that Lm induces a specific set of genes following 4-HNE exposure, consistent with a specific detoxification strategy employed by this organism. Here we propose to interrogate the role of 4-HNE production on bacteria growth restriction and the bacterial countermeasures to promote infection. In Aim I, we propose to explore the role of a MarR transcription factor in orchestrating the transcriptional response to 4-HNE exposure. In Aim II, we will interrogate the molecular mechanisms of 4-HNE detoxification by Lm oxidoreductases. In Aim III, we will use a murine model of Listeriosis to characterize the effects of 4-HNE on bacterial infection outcome. Together these studies will define the molecular mechanisms of 4-HNE detoxification by Lm and determine its role in combating bacteria during infection."
"9374400","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Conventional protocols for adult and pediatric tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment monitoring rely heavily on time-consuming bacterial culture or unquantifiable DNA detection methods for the presence of small numbers of bacteria. For pediatric TB, diagnosis and treatment are particularly difficult because current clinical protocols demand much from these young patients. Although they comprise a small percentage of the health care caseload, children who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB represent one of the most vulnerable groups with one of the highest mortality rates. We choose this challenging cohort (provided by a NIAID-sponsored clinical trial) to push the boundaries of what our technology platform can do. In order to address the current limitations in clinical management of pediatric TB, we have developed a rapid and quantitative diagnostic and monitoring platform for active TB wherein porous silicon nanodisks (referred to as pSiND), loaded with target biomarkers, are used for identification of disease signatures by a bench-top mass spectrometry (MS). Using this new biomarkers detection modality, pSiND-MS, we could detect and quantify two TB-specific blood-born biomarkers (CFP-10 and ESAT-6) at extremely low concentrations (1.0 fmol), which serve as signs of bacterial infection in advance of physiological manifestations observable by conventional protocols. Characteristics of ESAT-6 and CFP-10, i.e., antigens secreted by actively proliferating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), make them ideal biomarkers for active TB diagnosis and candidates for TB vaccine development. We used this approach to distinguish adult patients with active TB from those with latent tuberculosis infection, or healthy volunteers. Also, based on multiplex detection and quantification by pSiND- MS, we differentiated pediatric TB-infected patients (n=36) from non-TB children (n=35) according to the peptidic patterns of CFP-10 and ESAT-6. Our categorization of patient samples matched clinical designations at 100% specificity and 94.4% sensitivity. Just as important, we could render accurate diagnoses within one hour of sample-to-answer processing rather than wait the typical 4-6 weeks. In this proposal, we aim to: 1) design and develop the scale-up nanodisk microfabrication protocol with FDA compliant in cGMP facilities; 2) conduct an extensive clinical validation of pSiND-MS using samples from a large cohort of children with HIV/TB; 3) determine effectiveness of our approach for rapid evaluation of treatment efficacy; and 4) optimize development and clinical validation of a portable pSiDN-miniMS system for identification and quantification of CFP-10 and ESAT-6. The pSiND-MS technology platform has an added advantage in that high-throughput and accurate mass spectrometry has become a virtually essential technology for clinical diagnosis in many parts of the world. The miniaturized and easy-to-use MS system at a shoebox size for point-of-care applications is aimed at serving patients in resource-limited areas. Achievement of all of our aims will significantly improve clinical management strategies for global TB control."
"9391438","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am proposing a training program that will prepare me for an independent research career in the field of evolutionary genomics. I received my PhD from the Laboratory of Genetics at the University of Wisconsin- Madison for my work on the genetic and evolutionary basis of mammalian species differences in global recombination rate. I then completed a 2-year postdoc in the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington where I acquired considerable experience and proficiency in the computational analysis of large genomic datasets. Through the proposed training program, I will expand my experimental skill set to include genomic library construction, diverse cytogenetic methods, and functional analyses of candidate genes in mammalian model systems. I propose a 5-year research program composed of a 2-year phase of organized mentorship and training in the Initiative for Biological Complexity at North Carolina State University (NCSU), followed by a 3-year research phase as an independent investigator.  The proposed training program will leverage cutting-edge sequencing technologies and innovative methods for chromosome visualization to elucidate the mechanisms of recurrent degeneration and loss of the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) in voles (genus Microtus). This research will draw on diverse research fields, including genomics, evolutionary biology, and cytogenetics. Dr. Trudy Mackay, William Neal Reynolds and Distinguished University Professor of Genetics, will act as the primary mentor for my scientific development. Dr. Mackay is a world-renowned for her work in evolutionary and quantitative genetics, and has an impressive record of successful students and postdocs as a testament to her commitment and enthusiasm for training young investigators. Dr. David Threadgill, Professor and head of the Department of Genetics at NCSU, will provide specific instruction in mouse functional genetics. Dr. Matthew Breen and Dr. Lisa McGraw, both at NCSU, will provide focused mentoring in cytogenetics and vole genetics, respectively. The remarkable breadth of faculty research interests and their overlap with the intellectual and experimental foci of the proposed training program make NCSU the optimal place for conducting the mentored phase of this research. The mammalian PAR promotes pairing, synapsis, and recombination between the heterogametic sex chromosomes at meiosis. These processes are integral to proper sex chromosome segregation. Failure to initiate pairing or recombination in the PAR can lead to spermatogenic failure, infertility, and sex chromosome aneuploidy, including Turner and Kleinfelter Syndromes in humans. Despite its important meiotic function, the PAR is structurally dynamic, rapidly evolving, and has even been completely lost in several exceptional mammalian species. Voles (genus Microtus) display particularly exciting trends in recent PAR evolution. Across the vole phylogeny, there is evidence for ?3 parallel losses of X/Y chromosome pairing at meiosis, including multiple closely related species pairs with and without meiotic sex chromosome associations. I propose to study these recurrent evolutionary episodes to address 3 specific questions:  1. What structural and sequence-level changes precipitated the degeneration and loss of the PAR along these vole lineages? I propose cytogenetic assays and genome sequence comparisons between closely related vole species with and without meiotic X/Y pairing and recombination to answer this question.  2. How do unpaired, achiasmate sex chromosomes reliably segregate at meiosis? I propose cytological studies linking sex chromosome dynamics with the localization patterns of meiotic proteins to identify candidate achiasmate segregation genes. 3. Do candidate X/Y segregation genes identified in voles rescue sex chromosome segregation defects in organisms with obligate requirements for PAR pairing that harbor disruptive mutations across the region? I will carry out these functional tests using a mouse model with a high frequency of sex chromosome aneuploidy. The availability of multiple, independent episodes of PAR loss across the vole phylogeny presents a logical transition between a mentored phase focused on dissecting the basis of X/Y pairing loss in one species set, and an independent investigator phase that builds on this training to determine the mechanisms of PAR degradation and sex chromosome segregation in other vole species. The proposed research program will provide key insights into the mechanisms of PAR evolution and sex chromosome segregation at meiosis, with potential clinical consequences for understanding the genesis of sex chromosome aneuploidies in humans."
"9393264","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In both chronic HIV-1 and SIV infection, virus replication is concentrated in lymphoid tissues in follicular CD4+ T cells, which are 30 to 40 times more likely to be productively infected than extrafollicular CD4+ T cells. Reasons why lentiviruses are preferentially replicated by follicular CD4+ T cells and why virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) cannot suppress replication in these cells are not understood. Virus replication is not concentrated in B cell follicles in acute SIV infection, suggesting that te follicular concentration of virus may be related to adaptive immunity. T follicular helper cells (TFH) are a specialized subset of antigen-specific cells that migrate into B cell follicles where they interact with B cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDC) to promote B cell maturation and antibody production. We hypothesize that virus replication is concentrated within TFH in chronic HIV-1 and SIV infection due to 1) increased intrinsic susceptibility of TFH to productive lentiviru infection, 2) their location in germinal centers (GC) adjacent to antibody-virion complexes on FDC, and 3) numerical and functional deficiencies of follicular CTL. These hypotheses will be tested through a series of experiments both in vitro and in vivo using lymphoid tissues from humans and rhesus macaques. In Aim 1, we will establish whether human and macaque TFH are intrinsically more susceptible to productive lentivirus infection than other CD4+ T cells through in vitro experimental infections with GFP reporter viruses. In aim 2, we will determine the distribution and phenotype of productively infected T cells in vivo in both chronic and acute lentivirus infection by in situ tissue analyses as well as measuring viral RNA in sorted subsets of cells. In Aim 3 we will investigate the hypothesis that numerical and/or functional deficiencies in follicular CTL contribute to the propagation of HIV-1 within B cell follicles using in situ studies in vitro assays of follicular CTL function, and CD8 depletion of rhesus macaques in vivo. In the context of all aims, we will evaluate the impact of T follicular regulatory cells (TFR), on HIV-1 replication and CTL function. Collectively, these studies will provide a wealth of new information on the cells that foster HIV-1 replication in B cell follicles and factors in the follicular milieuthat may promote or impair lentivirus replication. A better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie permissiveness of follicular CD4+ T cells to lentiviruses is vital to development of a protective vaccine or a functional cure for HIV-1."

"9174853","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Free radical-induced damage makes an important contribution to secondary neuronal injury in stroke. No therapy exists at present to prevent or alleviate these effects. The use of catalytic degradation of free radicals is a promising therapeutic approach to address the secondary damage in CNS. Antioxidant enzymes and their low molecular weight mimetics have recently been proposed as potentially powerful therapeutic agents for reducing free radical-induced injury in stroke, and have been shown to be efficient in a number of animal models. However, therapeutic use of these agents for treatment of stroke is limited due to their inability to efficiently penetrate blood-brain barrier. Recently, ability of several targeted nanoparticulate an liposomal constructs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier has been demonstrated. Here, we propose to achieve targeted delivery of a SOD mimetic AEOL 10150 to the site of CNS injury using antibody-coated nanoparticles (NPs) and liposomes. Targeting will be achieved through conjugation of anti-NR1 receptor antibody, which was found to specifically target injured brain parenchyma in our preliminary studies. Our working hypothesis is that enhanced delivery of targeted antioxidant NPs to the site of injury can reduce free radical damage and reduce the degree of secondary neuronal damage in stroke. The strategic goal of this study is to develop a medication for intravenous administration, which could be used as neuroprotective treatment to reduce free radical mediated secondary neuronal damage in stroke. To accomplish this goal, we will first prepare optimized targeted conjugates with maximized binding ability. Experiments with rat cortical neuronal cultures will then be used to evaluate safety and efficacy in vitro, and estimate dosage ranges for animal experiments. Finally, a mouse stroke model will be used for the in vivo evaluation of the efficacy of the proposed therapeutic approach. The short-term goal of this project is to collect in vivo data necessary for translation to a large animal model. In th long term, this research will lead to the development of a novel therapy for treatment/prophylactics of secondary neuronal injury in stroke. More broadly, results of this research will have implications in development new targeting approaches for treatment of various CNS conditions including traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury."

"9385839","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality despite decades of advances in diagnosis, therapeutics and delivery of health care. Many of the traditional treatments for common infections are no longer effective because of the emergence of new infections (e.g. SARS, norovirus) and the fast-growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. Although the prevention of many community and healthcare-associated infections is theoretically within our reach, progress is often slow because of the multi-factorial nature of the problem. The origins of this widespread problem of infection stem from issues in such diverse areas as microbial genetics, health care policy, economics, and human behavior. This level of complexity mandates a new generation of scholars ready to begin their careers from an interdisciplinary perspective. Therefore, through this program, Training in Interdisciplinary Research to Prevent Infections (TIRI), we propose to prepare pre- and post-doctoral scholars for participation and leadership in interdisciplinary research to prevent infections. Building on a highly productive T90, the aims of TIRI are to (a) expand an interdisciplinary research curriculum, (b) recruit and train a qualified diverse cadre of interdisciplinary pre-doctoral and post-doctoral fellows to conduct research focused on the prevention of infections across the continuum of care, (c) expand and assess collaborative research activities between nursing faculty and trainees and those from other disciplines, and (d) evaluate the training program structures, processes, and outcomes on an ongoing and annual basis.  Based on preliminary work to define competencies essential to successful interdisciplinary research, the training program includes three key activities for trainees: 1) a didactic course, Building Interdisciplinary Research Models, 2) an Interdisciplinary Research Seminar, and 3) Supervised Field Experience. Each programmatic element will be coordinated by an interdisciplinary Faculty Leadership Team, and each trainee will be mentored by an interdisciplinary team of senior researchers.  We will support 2 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral trainees for 2 years each. Predoctoral trainees will be selected from among students who have successfully completed one year of doctoral education in any school or department. Recruitment strategies for both include our well-established Center website and, because of our particular commitment to assuring a diverse cadre of trainees, we have collaborative recruitment plans with established outreach programs, as well as the City University of New York and Hunter-Bellevue School of Nursing, both of which have a high proportion of Hispanic and African-American graduate students. The training program will be evaluated at several levels, including individual courses, dissertations, post-doctoral field projects, and career trajectory of trainees. These evaluations will be a focal point of discussion within the Faculty Leadership Team, and suitable program modifications will be implemented by the Leadership Team."

We are a second-generation teaching program, informed by the experience of the many biomedical informatics training models that have come before us. Our program is designed to produce graduates with depth in both computational methods and biomedicine, an intimate familiarity with the science and technology that synergizes the two, and the skills necessary to pioneer novel computational approaches to significant biomedical questions. We are aware of the difficulty of achieving both breadth and depth in a reasonable amount of time, and believe we have identified a novel approach that is capable of training productive interdisciplinary scientists in a relatively short period. The program is tightly focused on transforming already strong students and recent Ph.D.'s into mature and productive scientists. Our program is structured around a set of four categories of educational goals and objectives: knowledge, communication skills, professional behavior, and self- directed life-long learning. Our graduates demonstrate the knowledge of core concepts and principles of biomedical informatics, and have the ability to apply computation to gain insight into important biomedical problems. Their knowledge includes mastery of the fundamentals of biomedicine, clinical and translational research, statistics and computer science, as well as proficiency in the integration of these fields. Our graduates have contributed to the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge. They demonstrate interpersonal, oral and written skills that enable them to interact productively with scientists from both biomedical and computational domains, to communicate the results of their work in appropriate formats, and to teach others biomedical informatics skills; they effectively bridge the gap between biomedical and computational cultures. Our graduates demonstrate the highest standards of professional integrity and exemplary behavior, as reflected in a commitment to the ethical conduct of research, continuous professional development and thoughtfulness regarding the broader implications of their work. Our graduates demonstrate habits and skills for self-directed and life-long learning, and recognize that biomedical informatics is a rapidly evolving discipline. Our program itself is also undergoing continuous improvement, carefully tracking our efforts and quickly responding to changes in the field and our situation. We are justifiably proud of our outstanding track record as well as our dynamic and adaptive approach to the training of adept, flexible and curious scientists able to comfortably assimilate new ideas and technologies during the course of their professional careers. During the next period, we propose to develop a training track in Clinical Research informatics, to complement our existing training in Translational Informatics. Our training grant supports six predoctoral and three postdoctoral trainees; it is currently supplemented by an ARRA-related award of an additional one predoctoral and three postdoctoral slots. Based on our successful track record, we are requesting that the ARRA supplemental slots be continued, the addition of one predoctoral and one postdoctoral slot, and the creation of four short term diversity-related positions, for a total request of 8 predoctoral, 7 postdoctoral and 4 short term positions."
"9388391","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Past studies of focal brain lesions, such as those arising from stroke or traumatic brain injury, focused on determining how specific behavioral deficits are related to the properties of the damaged tissue in a localization of function approach However, considerable evidence now suggests that focal lesions also affect the physiology of remote regions of the brain. Here, we investigate a novel view that the widespread consequences of a lesion may partly be predicted by large-scale network interactions of the damaged region. Specifically, some regions (connectors) have strong interactions across many different networks while other regions (system hubs) have strong interactions mainly within their own network. We hypothesize that these designations will predict the extent of impairments seen after brain lesions, providing important clinical and scientific insight into these system-levl effects.  This hypothesis will be tested through two aims. Aim 1 examines the relationship between damage to connectors and hubs on behavioral performance across a number of domains in lesion patients. Aim 2 uses functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to examine network interactions in these lesion patients' brains and healthy controls. This aim will examine interactions within pre-specified brain systems and whether system organization is itself altered by brain damage. Neural simulations will also be used to help interpret the findings. Preliminary evidence suggests that damage to connectors, but not to hubs, has pronounced impact on behavior across many different domains and network interactions in many different systems. We propose establishing this pattern in a large patient group with lesions to diverse locations to examine the generality of the preliminary findings and eliminate a number of potential alternative explanations for these effects.  By examining disruptions after lesions, this research will shed light on the mechanisms by which networks are maintained in the healthy human brain and how regions with different network properties may contribute to behavior. Furthermore, these findings will provide important new insight into behavioral and brain deficits caused by lesions, improving the ability of clinicians to make prognoses for lesion patients and revealing new avenues to target for rehabilitation.  The research aspects of this proposal will be complemented by a strong training regime for the applicant in (1) novel processing methods, (2) neuropsychological characterization of clinical populations, and (3) innovative network analysis techniques. These areas will allow the applicant to create a more sophisticated and multifaceted depiction of how brain networks contribute to function. The proposed research and training regime, in combination with the premier resources available in the Petersen lab at Washington University in St Louis, will position the applicant well for her future goal of becoming a independent investigator in the field, specializing in brain network physiology and it's connection to complex functions."

"9391451","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The family environments in which children are born and raised have a profound influence on their behavior, education, and health (Amato 2001; Cherlin 1999; McLanahan & Sandefur 2009). With the overlapping demographic and social trends of later age at marriage, greater acceptability of divorce and non-marital childbearing, and more cohabitation, the landscape of American families is diverse and dynamic. According to the recent Census, 29% of American children live with only one biological parent, and 3.5% reside with neither biological parent (Vespa et al. 2013). Such cross-sectional estimates, however, belie the true complexity and dynamism of family structures. Not only do children increasingly live in diverse family forms, but the childhood experience of family structure is dynamic, with children likely to live in a variety of families by the time they reach adulthood (Cavanagh & Huston 2006; Graefe & Lichter 1999; Heuveline et al. 2003).  Using nationally representative integrated demographic, social, contextual and biological data on children in the United States, the proposed study will trace the biological pathways through which childhood family instability influences adult health. The Investigator hypothesizes that family instability creates intense and chronic stress that will be evident in measures of adult stress reactivity and that have negative long-term health consequences. The project will evaluate the importance of instability during sensitive developmental stages of early childhood and adolescence, and investigate gender, race and ethnic differences in stress response processes. This project contributes to the field by examining the enduring health consequences of childhood exposure to dynamic family structures, a common life experience for today's children. Findings will further our understanding of the ways in which the social environment gets under the skin to influence physiological functioning and biological processes that have consequences for health. Knowledge gained from this project will help more effectively target child welfare policies to crucial developmental periods, and to better understand and reduce health disparities.  An interdisciplinary team of dedicated and highly skilled mentors developed a personalized training plan to support the Investigator in pursuit of her research and career goals. To accomplish the proposed research, the Investigator requires additional substantive and technical training in biology to be achieved through coursework, guided reading, seminars and workshops. The Investigator's professional development will be supported by strengthening her publication record, as well as her grant writing and communication skills. These activities will provide the Investigator with the training necessary to develop expertise in biosocial research and engage in productive interdisciplinary research at the intersection of social and biomedical sciences. The training will also facilitate the Investigator's transition to independent research, and enable her  to attain her career goal of securing a faculty position at a leading research university."
"9396176","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amyloid-beta (A?) plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. A number of studies suggest that A? works upstream of tau to promote neurological dysfunction and neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease. Most importantly, A?-induced neurotoxicity and cognition deficits are significantly ameliorated by reductions in tau in several in vivo models. However, the mechanism by which A? promotes tau neurotoxicity remains a major unanswered question in the field of Alzheimer's disease research. To address this important question using an unbiased forward genetic approach, we have developed a model of A?-controlled tau neurotoxicity in the simple model organism Drosophila. We have used a genetic screen to identify candidate genes that when decreased in expression substantially alter A?-induced tau toxicity. I will now build on these preliminary results to validate and examine mechanistically the influence of candidate proteins and pathways on A?-induced neurotoxicity. Since A? toxicity in flies, as in mammalian systems, is transduced substantially through endogenous tau, I will use state-of-the-art genome editing with CRISPR/CAS to produce a null mutation in the fly tau gene. A null mutation in tau will allow us to assay the dependence of our modifier pathways unequivocally on tau. Further, given the reduced redundancy of the Drosophila genome, analysis of tau null flies may provide important insights into the normal role of tau, an important and understudied area of cell biology and disease pathobiology. I will use a variety of experimental approaches in my studies, including genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, neuropathology and biochemistry. Collectively, my studies will define novel connections between A? and tau, and thereby significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms regulating interactions of these two hallmark Alzheimer's disease related proteins. In concert with these important scientific goals, the research plan will provide me with strong training in a complementary group of disciplines critical for my long-term success as an independent investigator."
"9192620","Dementia is a devastating clinical syndrome that affects millions of elderly individuals worldwide. Treating patients with dementia is challenging because of the myriad number of pathologies underlying its clinical manifestation and progression. Therefore, it is imperative to better understand the various mechanisms of dementia-inducing diseases in order to correctly diagnose and treat dementia patients. The focus of my proposed project is to study a common, but relatively underappreciated and under-studied, mechanism of dementia characterized by vascular abnormalities, hippocampal shrinkage, and abnormal protein accumulation (TDP-43) in the brain. Our lab has published several studies on two dementia-associated pathologies: hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) and brain arteriolosclerosis (B-ASC). HS-Aging is a common neurodegenerative pathology seen in up to 25% of individuals < 85 years at autopsy. B- ASC is a cerebrovascular pathology that increases in frequency and severity with advanced age. We have identified a common genetic risk variant in the ABCC9 gene with a polymorphism that changes risk for both B-ASC and HS-Aging pathologies. This phenomenon is exciting because it may point the way to a novel future therapeutic intervention related to ABCC9-modulating drugs. As a key step to better understanding the pathogenetic mechanism, new experiments are required. My overall hypothesis is that genetic and pharmacological perturbations in ABCC9 or its gene product lead to B-ASC pathology, which in turn, lead to HS-Aging/TDP-43 resulting in the clinical presentation of dementia. We will address this hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that a SNP, ABCC9.rs704180, is associated with altered vascular structure in aged individuals and 2) Test the hypothesis that chronic pharmacologic inhibition of ABCC9 gene product will cause B-ASC, thus in turn, exacerbating HS-Aging/TDP-43 pathology. In Aim 1, we will use human tissue samples from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center brain bio-bank to quantify vascular structures in individuals with varying ABCC9 SNP status. In Aim 2, we will treat mice with clinical and pathological HS-Aging characteristics (age-related TDP-43 pathology) to determine the effects of ABCC9 modifying drug treatment in these animals. Successful completion of this project will provide insight into a novel mechanism of dementia. In addition, it will provide opportunities for me to diversify my skillset as I prepare for a future career as a physician-scientist in the field of translational neuroscience research."
"9195751","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI), is especially progressive in the 20-25% of post-MI patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR). IMR drives a vicious cycle of left ventricular (LV) dilatation and MR caused by leaflet tethering to the LV walls. Ongoing remodeling drive leads to frequent failure of standard annuloplasty ring therapy, indicating the need to treat the ventricle as well as the valve. Our prior work has shown that post-MI LV remodeling is exacerbated by the added MR-induced volume overload, with downregulation of SERCA2a, a key calcium cycling pump, and increased fibrosis. Upregulating SERCA2a with intracoronary adeno associated virus (AAV) reduces remodeling when given early and also with late MR repair. Fibrosis can be reduced by AAV.CCN5, which reverses functional deterioration in HF induced by pressure overload. This proposal considers two clinical scenarios: acute MI, with potential to limit early remodeling as stimulus for progressive remodeling and IMR; and later remodeling, to improve long- term results from surgical repair of IMR by addressing myocardial remodeling as well. The central hypothesis is that LV remodeling in an IMI-induced model of progressive heart failure with IMR can be reduced at both early and late stages through a synergistic approach improving both myocardial and interstitial components of heart failure. We will test the following hypotheses: 1) Early administration of SERCA2a, CCN5 or both at the time of ischemia-reperfusion injury can prevent the remodeling that occurs despite revascularization. This is supported by recent evidence for transgene uptake in this context, and by our preliminary evidence that early preventive therapy with the combined vectors safely reduces both local infarct deformation and the ensuing cycle of MR and global remodeling. This aim simulates the scenario of patients with acute MI undergoing primary percutaneous intervention (PCI). 2) Upregulating SERCA2a, CCN5 or both can prevent or reverse remodeling in an established inferior MI model that produces important MR, simulating the clinical situation of treatment after remodeling has occurred, either early or late relative to compensatory pathway activation or exhaustion. 3) SERCA2a, CCN5 or both can prevent ongoing remodeling leading to recurrent MR when given during annuloplasty repair in an inferior MI model. LV remodeling and MR will be compared for ring alone, myocardial therapy alone (Aim 2), and the combination. In these aims we will address mechanistic hypotheses regarding CCN5 inhibition of fibrosis by decreasing post-MI endothelial-to-mesenchymal cell transformation and pro- fibrotic myofibroblast formation; SERCA2a reduction of remodeling by increasing contractility and decreasing apoptosis; and reduction of localized infarct deformation by early therapy in addition to reduced progression of global remodeling. The collaborative team combines strengths in surgical physiologic modeling, imaging and pathology of fibrosis, and myocardial biology with gene therapy. Results can support clinical studies of these strategies in patients undergoing mitral valve repair for ischemic MR and primary PCI for acute MI."
"9197936","Abstract A key determinant of geriatric frailty is sarcopenia, the age-associated loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength. Although the etiology of sarcopenia remains to be determined, studies in humans and rodents have reported a strong correlation between the loss and/or dysfunction of satellite cells and sarcopenia. Despite the correlation between declining satellite cell-dependent regenerative capacity and age, no studies to date have directly tested this relationship to determine if the loss of satellite cells causes sarcopenia. To test this idea, we depleted (>85%) satellite cells in five month old mice to a level dramatically lower than that observed with normal aging. A detailed analysis of multiple muscles through 24 months of age revealed that, despite significantly reduced regenerative capacity, the life-long depletion of satellite cells did not accelerate nor exacerbate sarcopenia; however, the depletion of satellite cells at a young age was associated with a significant increase in fibrosis in old mice. These highly provocative findings, together with our data on the fiber-type specific role of satellite cells in response to exercise, reveal our limited understanding of how aging affects the function of satellite cells in skeletal muscle maintenance, the development of fibrosis and in response to a growth stimulus; addressing these fundamental gaps in our knowledge clearly requires new tools. Towards this end, we will utilize a novel mouse strain (Pax7-H2B-GFP) that will allow us to track satellite cell dynamics for the first time in adult skeletal muscle aging. To better understand how aging and exercise affects satellite cell dynamics and the regulation of fibrosis, the following aims will be pursued: 1) determine how age and life-long exercise affects satellite cell dynamics in the maintenance of skeletal muscle, 2) determine how age and life-long exercise affects satellite cell regulation of fibrosis and 3) determine how age affects satellite cell dynamics in response to a growth stimulus. The approaches described herein use powerful, new genetic tools to determine how aging and life-long exercise alters the function of satellite cells in skeletal muscle homeostasis, regulation of fibrosis and adaptability. The development of the Pax7-H2B-GFP mouse represents a long sought-after method for tracking satellite cells, especially following fusion into the myofiber. This novel mouse strain will allow us to address formally intractable questions regarding how satellite cell dynamics are affected by age and life-long exercise. Such fundamental knowledge is necessary to critically evaluate the therapeutic value of satellite cells for the treatment of muscle mass loss and function associated with aging."
"9214421","ABSTRACT  Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is an enzyme that is involved in multiple signal transduction pathways and is highly abundant in brain tissues. GSK-3 is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and inhibition of this kinase can modulate the level of tau phosphorylation and prevent the subsequent formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Despite substantial progress in AD biomarker development, particularly with amyloid plaques, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracers for AD only show weak correlation with cognitive impairment and new approaches for imaging AD are needed. The central role of GSK-3 has led to the proposed ?GSK-3 hypothesis of AD?. To date, there are two major obstacles for molecular imaging of GSK-3 in the central nervous system with PET: 1) the discovery of potent and highly selective small molecules over other central nervous system targets and closely related kinases; and 2) achievement of reasonable brain penetration. We have discovered a highly promising brain-penetrating inhibitor of GSK-3 bearing a novel scaffold. Our lead compound known as PF-367 is highly potent and represents the most selective inhibitor of GSK-3 that has been reported to date. PF-367 showed good uptake in rodents and rapid decrease in pTau by inhibiting the GSK-3 pathway. This inhibitor demonstrated efficacy in modulation of tau phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo with excellent bioavailability and represents an outstanding lead diagnostic neuroimaging agent for GSK-3.  The P.I. reported the first PET radiotracer for GSK-3 in 2005 and we have now synthesized a 11C- isotopologue of PF-367. Our preliminary PET imaging studies in non-human primates confirm high brain permeability of [11C]PF-367 and specificity for GSK-3 in vivo. By completion of this 4-year R01 proposal, we plan to develop this highly promising first generation GSK-3 PET radiotracer, along with closely related analogs, to be well situated for first in human PET imaging studies of GSK-3. Systematic derivatization of the PF-367 scaffold to discover 11C- and 18F-radiotracers will involve new approaches including: 1) fluorination of the non-activated arene using our new iodonium(III) ylide radiofluorination strategy; and 2) High throughput 11C-amidation via using our [11C]CO2 fixation strategy. Lead radiotracers will be evaluated by in vitro binding and autoradiography studies, in vivo PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies in rodents and in vivo PET imaging in non-human primates to establish the optimal GSK-3 PET radiotracer for clinical translation."
"9214478","Invasive aspergillosis due to Aspergillus fumigatus is a leading killer in immunocompromised patients. A significant barrier to developing effective antifungal therapeutics is the lack of understanding of the regulation of A. fumigatus hyphal growth and disease. We have established that calcineurin is required for A. fumigatus growth and virulence. We also showed that calcineurin is dynamically localized at active points of growth, the hyphal tip and septum, and that calcineurin phosphatase activity is required at these active points to regulate hyphal growth and virulence. Calcineurin (CnaA) functions as a phosphatase to dephosphorylate substrates and through the transcription factor, CrzA. However, in contrast to our CnaA deletion strain, our ?crzA strain exhibited a minimal hyphal growth defect and, surprisingly, CrzA did not localize at the active points of growth. An extensive targeted mutagenesis screen revealed that the calcineurin substrate binding PxIxIT motif, and a novel FxDxF motif, are indispensable for CnaA localization. These new findings indicate that the major effects on calcineurin-mediated growth and virulence are likely due to calcineurin interactions with as yet undefined key effectors at these critical growth points. As a logical next step, we now seek to define calcineurin?s main function as a phosphatase to orchestrate growth and virulence via its interaction with these unknown effectors.  Our overall goal is to identify the calcineurin downstream effectors that control A. fumigatus hyphal growth and virulence. Our hypothesis is that calcineurin, as a critical phosphatase, interacts with phosphorylated effectors to dephosphorylate them to control growth and virulence. To define these interactions and the mechanism of regulation of effectors facilitating hyphal growth and virulence, we will utilize holistic ultra- sensitive proteomic strategies to define the complete CnaA phosphoproteome.  In Aim 1, we will define the A. fumigatus native proteome and calcineurin-dependent phosphoproteome using two independent quantitative global phosphoproteomic approaches paired with quantitative analysis of the native proteome. This will define downstream effector substrates dephosphorylated in the wild-type strain, due to phosphatase activity, but still phosphorylated in the calcineurin phosphatase-deficient mutant. We will then employ Multiple Reaction Monitoring to measure protein expression trends as well as validate effectors from the phosphoproteome. In Aim 2, we will prioritize the identified CnaA effectors to validate their role in calcineurin-mediated downstream effects in growth and disease via an iterative approach. We will use genetic deletion (single, multiple), in vitro growth screening, targeted mutations, and a murine model validation for virulence defects. This multi-faceted approach will identify key phosphorylation-dependent downstream effectors of calcineurin and develop a model for fungal-specific control of hyphal growth and virulence. We will generate a map of previously undescribed downstream effectors regulated by calcineurin in a pathogen, which will have important biologic ramifications for broader calcineurin, fungal growth, and pathogenesis studies."
"9216986","The oral microbiome is an important component of systemic health. Many oral bacterial species are associated with oral, as well as systemic diseases. Periodontal disease (PD) is a common condition characterized by a chronic inflammatory response to certain types of bacteria that destroys the supporting structures of the teeth. PD has been associated with other systemic diseases, particularly diabetes. Adults with diabetes are at higher risk of PD and, in turn, PD disease exacerbates glycemic control and diabetic complications. Both periodontal disease and diabetes have been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Previous work using the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) cohort at the University of Colorado demonstrated that self-reported PD duration was significantly associated with progression of coronary artery calcification in subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but not in subjects without diabetes. These results suggest that the simultaneous presence of PD and T1D may accelerate CVD processes. The central hypothesis of this project is that oral pathogens are significantly associated with both T1D and subclinical CVD and act to modify the association between these diseases. As such, the objective of this project is to characterize the subgingival microbiome in T1D and to investigate longitudinal relationships between the subgingival microbiome, inflammation, T1D, and subclinical CVD. The long-term goal is to elucidate the biological mechanisms that are involved in the relationships between oral and systemic health. The rationale for this project is that increasing understanding of these relationships and mechanisms could lead to therapies targeted at the oral cavity that would have systemic benefits. We will test our central hypothesis with three specific aims: 1) Identify taxonomic and functional profiles of the subgingival microbiome associated with T1D and PD; 2) Determine the associations between the subgingival microbiome and subclinical CVD in those with and without T1D; 3) Determine whether inflammation acts as a mediator between the subgingival microbiome and subclinical CVD. We will utilize passive drool samples and subgingival plaque collected from CACTI participants to perform 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing of the subgingival microbiome and to measure salivary inflammatory cytokines. The approach is innovative because we are able to comprehensively examine correlates, mediators, and diabetes-specific effects of the relationship between the subgingival microbiome and subclinical CVD. Despite studies showing associations between PD, T1D, and CVD, no work to date has described the subginigval microbiome associated with T1D or has focused on the relationships between these three diseases at the level of the subgingival microbiome. This research is significant because these diseases afflict a large proportion of the population and increased understanding could lead to improved therapies."

We will formulate and implement Solutions tied to scientific scenarios and tasks and deliver them to our users through a new interactive, guided user interface.  Aim 2. Enhance GenePattern's interactivity, flexibility, and overall user experience. We will provide closer connectivity between visualization and analysis, add support for mobile devices, and further lower the barrier for other resources to leverage GenePattern's capabilities.  Aim 3. Support and grow the GenePattern user community. Importantly, we will place greater emphasis on open source development and address the high performance computing demands of current analysis approaches through a strategic alliance with Indiana University's (IU) National Center for Genome Analysis Support (NCGAS). Finally we will continue to provide and enhance our outreach activities, user support, training, and documentation. Our progress over our previous funding period, close involvement in genomic research, extensive software engineering experience, and significant user base make us well poised to carry out the aims of this proposal."
"9224260","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Central nervous system (CNS) infections, including meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis cause significant long-term morbidity, mortality and health care costs, with an increased incidence in children. Rapid identification of an infectious agent in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential to guiding the targeted use of effective antimicrobials in children with suspected CNS infection. Currently utilized diagnostic techniques are low-yield, slow, and expensive leading to widespread use of unnecessary empiric antimicrobial therapies and increased health care costs. Newly developed multiplex PCR panels allow for rapid identification of the most common organisms to cause CNS infections within one hour. However, optimal implementation strategies to translate these more rapid test results into more rapid, appropriate clinical action are unknown. This project seeks to optimize implementation of new rapid molecular CSF diagnostic technology in a tertiary care children?s hospital in conjunction with real-time antimicrobial stewardship decision support using RE-AIM methodology for implementation and evaluation. The research detailed in this proposal meets the critical unmet need for clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness data for new rapid diagnostic technologies. This research aims to develop reproducible and sustainable strategies for implementing rapid diagnostics to optimally impact the clinical care of children through the following specific aims: (1) To optimize a reproducible implementation strategy for rapid cerebrospinal fluid diagnostics in children with suspected central nervous system infection, (2)To measure the impact of a rapid cerebrospinal fluid diagnostics program on the clinical care and health care costs of children with suspected central nervous system infection. This project is the culmination of the candidate?s interest and experience in CNS infections and rapid molecular diagnostic technologies. The overall objective of this career development award is to develop the candidate into an independent principal investigator in clinical research with expertise in the implementation and evaluation of infectious disease diagnostics to facilitate timely and efficient clinical care of children. Through experiential mentored research training and didactic coursework in a doctoral clinical sciences program, essential skills in clinical research, implementation and dissemination science, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness analysis will be developed. The candidate has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors and advisors with extensive clinical research experience and topical expertise in the above realms to ensure his success in achieving the stated specific aims and career goals."

"9223783","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) primarily caused by autoreactive CD4 T cells. It is well documented that myelin-specific T cells, especially Th1 cells and Th17 cells, are important in the initiation of tissue inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS. A subset of CD4 T cells called CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) that express Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) can control autoimmune responses. During EAE development, Tregs enter the inflammation site in the CNS but are unable to suppress autoreactive CD4 T cells. It remains elusive, however, how Tregs are regulated during CNS inflammation. Our laboratory preliminary results indicate Tregs in the absence of STAT3 are capable of infiltrating CNS more effectively and therefore reduce chronic inflammation and EAE symptoms better than Tregs in the presence of STAT3. The following specific aims are proposed to elucidate the pathological role of STAT3 in the regulation of Tregs? function and the underlying mechanisms, and to understand the regulatory molecules of STAT3 activation in Tregs during CNS inflammation. Aim 1: To determine the impact of STAT3 expression on regulatory T cell function during CNS inflammation. Aim 2: To define the mechanism by which STAT3 expression in Tregs prevents CNS accumulation of Tregs during inflammation. Aim 3: To determine the environmental cues mediating STAT3 activation for Tregs during CNS inflammation. Collectively, these studies are designed to provide new information regarding the cellular mediators of CNS inflammation during EAE and will help to define the properties and molecular regulators that control the development of Tregs during CNS inflammation. Our overarching goal is to understand the regulatory network of inflammatory molecules and Tregs in promoting chronic inflammatory disorders, such as MS. Such data will help to identify molecular targets that can be used for potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of autoimmune disease."
"9227651","PROJECT SUMMARY Infection of humans with Plasmodium falciparum parasites results in significant morbidity and mortality. In the face of drug-resistance, it is imperative to identify new antimalarial lead compounds to ensure the success of control and eradication efforts. Screening parasites in vitro against large numbers of small molecules has led to the identification of several antimalarials that are now at an advanced stage of development, with forward chemical genomic approaches being powerfully employed to identify putative molecular targets. We have developed conditional protein expression approaches that allow us to identify essential genes in the asexual cycle of Plasmodium parasites in red blood cells. In particular, we have recently identified the PfCRK4 gene as an essential regulator of DNA replication during asexual schizogony. Here, we propose to establish a new approach to identify small molecule inhibitors of essential genes, using parasite lines with conditional knockdown in specific target proteins. We will carry out small molecule inhibitor screens to identify compounds that synergize with PfCRK4 knockdown to inhibit parasite growth. We will perform drug screens with kinase inhibitor libraries biased to directly target PfCRK4, and structurally diverse bioactive libraries. We hypothesize that these screens will simultaneously reveal both specific inhibitors of the PfCRK4 enzyme, and secondary inhibitors that target molecules in pathways closely related to PfCRK4 that are synergistic with the PfCRK4-specific inhibitors. The specificity of the compounds will be further established by a combination of reverse chemical genetics and forward chemogenomic approaches. Of great value will be lead compounds against the essential putative drug target PfCRK4 that may inform drug development. We believe that the chemical genetic platform described here will simultaneously identify direct as well as secondary inhibitors of target pathways, important for the design of optimal drug combinations that might impede the emergence of drug-resistance."

The Exacerbation Substudy contributes to the two primary aims of SPIROMICS the identification of 1) homogeneous subgroups of COPD and 2) intermediate biological and clinical outcome measures for use as clinical trial endpoints. Exacerbations are considered sentinel events in the natural history of COPD. Their frequency and severity have been associated with multiple negative implications including worsening health status, worsening pulmonary function, increasing cost of care, and increased mortality. A better understanding of the nature of these events and their symptomatic manifestations has the potential of leading to an improved understanding of the biological genesis of exacerbations and provide novel therapeutic approaches.    Participants who consented to being contacted about participating in additional substudies will be approached during Baseline or clinic Visit 2 to determine interest in the Exacerbation Substudy. Interested participants will then be screened and consented for the substudy. A total of 400 participants will be enrolled in Wave 1 and 2. While each contractor is expected to enroll approximately 67 subjects, the underlining goal is to enroll 400 participants. Negotiations are based on each site recruiting 67 participants. Recruitment adjustments may occur in subsequent periods if it is determined that one site is able to exceed the recruitment goal of 67 while other sites are not.    Participants enrolled into the Exacerbation Substudy will fall into one of two substrata:    1) Sub-stratum one (COPD patients at risk for acute exacerbation) ?

"9231814","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma is increasing worldwide. These diseases often occur together in the same individual, suggesting the presence of common underlying immunopathogenic factors. The long-term objective of this project is to investigate the fundamental immunological mechanisms involved in the development of allergic diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that cytokines produced by epithelial cells at the barrier surface, including thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-25, and IL-33, play an important role in shaping type 2 immunity and in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases in humans. However, major gaps still remain in our knowledge concerning the molecular and cellular control of production and secretion of these cytokines. The objective of this application is to address these gaps by focusing on IL-33.  IL-33 is generally stored in the nucleus of non-hematologic cells. We found recently that exposure of human airway epithelial cells to a fungal allergen, Alternaria alternata, evokes a rapid extracellular release of ATP, which triggers sustained increases in intracellular calcium concentration and IL-33 secretion into the extracellular milieu. We also found that both ATP release and IL-33 secretion are abolished when levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are reduced by ROS scavengers and small molecule activators of Nrf2, which increases the expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. Secreted IL-33 had been processed to a 19 kDa form from the full-length 31 kDa form. Therefore, we hypothesize that, upon exposure to airborne allergens, the oxidative stress response in airway epithelium triggers extracellular release of ATP, resulting in proteolytic processing and secretion of highly active IL-33.  The proposed study is designed to investigate the key steps of this process in detail. In Aim 1, we will determine how oxidative stress initiates and sustains the release of ATP from airway epithelial cells, a critical step that triggers IL-33 secretion. In Aim 2, we will investigate how airborne allergen exposure induces oxidative stress in airway epithelium by studying roles for the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE). In Aim 3, we will examine the cellular mechanisms involved in the processing and secretion of IL-33 by studying the roles for the epithelium's endogenous protease. We will employ a combination of complementary molecular, cell biological, pharmacological and immunological expertise in the laboratories of Dr. O'Grady and Dr. Kita. Novel and robust in vitro and in vivo models have been developed for this project. These studies will provide a better understanding of how the epithelium responds to environmental allergens and will define the key immunopathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for secretion of IL-33. Ultimately, these studies will provide an important characterization of key molecule(s) involved in allergen-induced immune responses, allowing for identification of novel therapeutic target(s) to treat and ideally to prevent immune-mediated diseases, such as asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and allergic disorders."
"9232031","PROJECT SUMMARY Recently, we have made the novel discovery of necroptosis in mature, anucleate erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) in response to CD59-specific pore-forming toxins (PFTs) and complement. Even though eryptosis, a programmed cell death (PCD) exclusive to RBCs, occurs these cells have been thought to lack the machinery necessary for PCD that occur in nucleated cells. Our findings show that RBC necroptosis shares molecular features with nucleated cell necroptosis, challenging views on PCD and RBC biology. Phosphorylation of the kinases central to necroptosis in nucleated cells, RIP1 and RIP3, is driven by CD59 signaling in RBCs, leading to Syk kinase-dependent phosphorylation of integral membrane protein Band 3, vesiculation, and release of Fas ligand (FasL). RIP1/RIP3 phosphorylation depends on FasL in RBCs and necroptotic death requires membrane pore formation in addition to this. Death by RBC necroptosis is driven by glycolytic formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). RBC necroptosis is induced by complement and CD59 ligation suggesting relevance to complement-mediated transfusion reactions and clearance. Key events in RBC necroptosis include echinocyte formation (vesiculation) and in vivo clearance post-transfusion. We will analyze the mechanism of RBC necroptosis in vitro and in vivo specifically exploring the role of lipid rafts in the RBC necroptosis events of vesicle formation, RBC clearance, and cellular demise (Aim 1). In addition to exploring the mechanistic control of RBC necroptosis, we will address potential outcomes of this PCD (Aim 2). This will include determining the role of necroptotic vesicles in bystander cell death (Aim 2A) and bystander inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo (Aim 2B).

"9379245","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability. We and others recently showed that the most common micronutrient deficiency of pregnancy, maternal iron deficiency (ID), substantially heightens the offspring's vulnerability to alcohol's damage, including neurobehavioral and neuroanatomical outcomes. This proposal investigates the mechanism underlying this alcohol-iron interaction. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that prenatal ethanol exposure (PAE) impedes the flow of iron from mother to fetus to fetal brain, through ethanol's dysregulation of hepcidin. This hepcidin dysregulation impedes fetal iron uptake and thus PAE worsens fetal iron status and especially in fetal brain. Using a rat model of PAE, we will document PAE's impact upon fetal and maternal iron content, key iron-dependent activities, and the expression and activity of proteins and regulatory signals that control iron uptake and utilization. We will furthr test whether iron supplements can normalize fetal brain iron content and brain activities with known sensitivity to iron-alcohol interactions, using iron supplement forms that are used clinically for conditions where hepcidin is dysregulated. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis and show that PAE significantly disrupts iron flow from mother to fetus to fetal brain. We find that under PAE, fetal liver retains iron at the expense of fetal brain, and fetal brain becomes iron-deficient (ID) even though the mother is iron-sufficient (IS). If the mother is ID, ethanol worsens this liver-brain disconnect and prevents adaptations that would otherwise enhance fetal iron uptake. Because iron is essential for healthy brain development, ethanol's disruption of fetal iron metabolism may explain why ID magnifies ethanol's neurodevelopmental damage. Little is known about how PAE affects fetal and maternal nutrient utilization, and how such changes impact gestational outcome. Given that a clinical intervention is already underway to test if micronutrient supplements including iron will reduce vulnerability to FASD, it is essential to understand the basic biochemistry underlying micronutrient utilization by PAE and, thus, how PAE might change nutrient requirements. This fundamental research is crucial to develop effective, evidence-based dietary interventions that reduce fetal vulnerability to FASD."
"9383373","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goals of this project are: 1) to investigate a novel framework for biomarkers of early stages of osteoarthritis based the temporomandibular joint condyles subchondral bone texture computed from high-resolution Cone- Beam Computed Tomography; 2) to develop a novel computational algorithm, the Bone texture tool, that extends the capabilities of 3D Slicer image analysis open-source software; and 3) oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the dental research community. Our preliminary work has allowed us to precisely localize and quantify the extent of subchondral bone degenerative changes in the mandibular condyles. The novel bone texture methodology included in this proposal will provide specific analytical tools for the detection, pathology characterization and treatment monitoring of diseases of arthritic origin. Building from this, the proposed mapping of the subchondral architecture of the osteoarthritic condyles using imaging criteria (such as entropy, energy, contrast, homogeneity and gray-level run-lengths) is an excellent model to facilitate detection of early stages of osteoarthritic changes, to monitor treatment outcomes, and to provide the foundation for the development of joint deterioration prevention strategies. This proposed research benefits from the combined efforts of a team of clinicians, and computer scientist and statistical modeling expert. This research team brings special resources to enable the broader objective of developing an infrastructure for image analysis to be used in leading-edge dental clinical research and practice."

"9173453","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brucella melitensis are intracellular bacteria that invade and replicate within macrophages and dendritic cells. With over 500,000 new infections per year, brucellosis is the most prevalent zoonosis worldwide and incurs significant human morbidity and economic loss. The intracellular location of Brucella renders the organism resistant to antibiotics. A safe and effective human vaccine does not exist. Thus, better understanding of the host-pathogen interactions supporting establishment of the intracellular replicative niche is critical. B. melitensis is a stealthy bacterium that expresses atypical smooth lipopolysaccharides and enters macrophages via lipid rafts rather than traditional phagocytosis. These Brucella-containing vacuoles (BCV) avoid degradation by end stage lysomsomes and fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Reorganization of the host ER occurs within 48 hours of BCV fusion. The UPR is a conserved, cellular stress response comprised of three pathways that maintains ER homeostasis. ER perturbations such as calcium depletion, increased polypeptide load, and viral infection initiate the UPR. We recently published that infection of macrophages with Brucella induces all three arms of the UPR both in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of infection. Furthermore, our data suggest that intracellular replication is supported by the host UPR. Here, our goal is to better refine the host-pathogen interactions promoting chronic infection by interrogating the role of individual UPR pathways during Brucella intracellular infection (Aim 1) and by investigating the role of the IRE1? pathway in supporting nutrient acquisition (Aim 2). The UPR enhances amino acid transport and induces authophagy, a process of organelle recycling. These attributes of the UPR might contribute to the survival of B. melitensis in macrophages. We hypothesize that by inducing the UPR, and specifically the IRE1? pathway, B. melitensis promotes its infectious success. Achievement of these aims will lead to a more complete understanding of how a conserved, host response supports intracellular replication of Brucella. This will allow for an informed approach for the development of novel therapeutics that target the UPR to prevent and treat brucellosis. Achieving the scientific goals of this proposal is the first of many steps in developing into an independent academic research scientist. The mentorship of my sponsor and co-sponsor will help me grow in the areas of critical thinking, communication, and responsible conduct of research. This fellowship will aid in my development as a future academic research professor so I may establish my own research group investigation host-pathogen interactions and to train future scientists."
"9181455","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are psychiatric disorders highlighted by social and communicative dysfunction. These complex behavioral changes are caused by altered synaptic functioning in select brain regions. Studies have previously focused on altered neuronal development and maturation. In addition to these neuronal changes, more recent studies have implicated astrocytes, the major glial cell in the brain, as major contributors to the pathogenesis of ASDs. Astrocytes are integral components of the tripartite synapse. In this model astrocyte processes surround and/or associate with pre- and post-synaptic components and regulate neurotransmitter homeostasis and recycling, provide basic substrates for neuronal metabolism, sequester Ca2+ ions and promote synaptogenesis and synaptic remodeling. Astrocytes have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of animal models of inherited human ASDs; these include mice lacking methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) or the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. While astrocyte diversity has been recognized for over a century, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning this diversity in vivo and the consequences for psychiatric disorders remain poorly understood. The purpose of this proposal is to characterize astrocyte diversity in subpopulations of gray matter astrocytes in two mouse models of ASDs. Our experiments are facilitated by two technical advances that permit the identification and molecular characterization of astrocytes in animal models of ASDs. First, we have produced a novel transgenic mouse line (BT4-mEGFP) in which astrocyte surface membranes are fluorescently tagged from embryonic development onward. Breeding of these fluorescently tagged astrocytes into genetic models of ASDs will permit astrocyte isolation by fluorescent activated cell sorting and subsequent gene profiling. We will establish how these gene defects alter the development of astrocytes, the association of astrocytes with synapses and the expression of astrocyte proteins identified in the gene profiling studies. These data will be extended by determining the three dimensional associations between astrocytes and synapses using automated serial electron microscopy. Our studies are based upon the overall hypotheses that astrocytes play two key roles in ASDs. First, they have abnormal associations with synapses, which results in altered neurotransmitter homeostasis and abnormal neuronal electrical activity. Second they have altered mitochondrial functions, deficient ATP production and Ca2+ buffering, which reduces their ability to provide basic nutrition to neurons. These studies will elucidate previousl unidentified roles of astrocytes in ASDs and will provide a critical genetic and ultrastructural framework for the development of future therapeutic strategies that target astrocyte function in treating or preventing ASDs."
"9187452","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Augmented intrarenal angiotensinogen (AGT) is a critical contributor to the activation of intrarenal renin- angiotensin system (RAS) which leads to the development of hypertension and associated tissue injury. Therefore, elucidating mechanisms underlying AGT upregulation is essential for the development of strategies to treat these diseases. Chronic Ang II elevation induces increased immune cell infiltration in the kidneys contributing to increase in intrarenal cytokine levels specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6). Notably, IL-6 is required for Ang II-induced AGT augmentation in renal proximal tubular cells (PTC). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these complex interactions leading to AGT augmentation have not been delineated. Renal cortical AGT levels are lower in female rodents than in males under normal conditions; however, plasma and liver AGT levels do not exhibit this gender disparity, suggesting that kidneys have a unique mechanism inherent to establishing basal AGT levels. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) levels are higher in the kidneys of female rats than those of male rats and that HDAC9 inhibitions by siRNA and an inhibitor resulted in augmentation of AGT levels in PTC. These results indicate that HDAC9 is a suppressor of intrarenal AGT expression. Since HDACs suppress gene transcription by histone-deacetylation, changes in HDAC levels alter accessibility of activated transcription factors to their binding sites on gene promoters. The preliminary study showed that HDAC9 levels are decreased by Ang II in PTC. Accordingly, we hypothesize that downregulation of HDAC9 by Ang II reduces the suppressive effects of HDAC9 on AGT expression. This allows other transcription factors activated by pathological stimuli, in particula IL-6, to augment AGT expression, thus leading to the progression of hypertension and associated tissue injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. To address this hypothesis, we will establish that Ang II suppresses intrarenal HDAC9 levels during the development of Ang II-dependent hypertension using unique PTC and Ang II- dependent hypertensive animal models (Specific Aim 1). In addition, the proposed studies will demonstrate that Ang II-induced intrarenal HDAC9 downregulation is required for intrarenal AGT augmentation by synergistic effects of Ang II and IL-6 and consequent development of hypertension (Specific Aim 2). In these experiments, HDAC9 knockdown by siRNA and overexpression via AAV2 infection will be used to show that the HDAC9 knockdown and IL-6 synergistically augment AGT expression in PTC and that kidney-specific HDAC9 overexpression attenuates intrarenal AGT elevation facilitating consequent the development of kidney injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. Gender differences of intrarenal HDAC9 regulation and its contribution to AGT regulation in hypertension will also be investigated in the projects. The results will establish the cardinal rol of intrarenal HDAC9 in the regulation of intrarenal AGT in Ang II-dependent hypertension and provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting HDAC9 to treat hypertension and RAS associated tissue injury."
"9343081","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests a career development award for an academic neuro-ophthalmologist with a scientific interest in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), a potentially blinding condition that most commonly affects young women. This award will provide the candidate with the necessary mentorship, training and experience to propel her to the level of independent patient oriented researcher focused on advancing diagnosis, clinical care and outcomes of IIH.  The candidate is an accomplished early career physician-scientist. In the short term she seeks research career development in the areas of clinical research & epidemiology, visual psychophysics & electrophysiology and neuro-ophthalmic imaging. She will develop her knowledge and capabilities in these areas through coursework, guided study, practical experience and mentored research. This will form the foundation upon which she will build an independent research program in IIH. From this vantage point she will pursue her long term goal of improving clinical care for IIH and other neuro-ophthalmic conditions both as an independent researcher with a strong translational research program and as an expert clinician caring directly for patients.  The environment created by the Department, Medical School and Institution is characterized by clinical and research expertise and productivity. There is a proven track record of effectively nurturing early career physician scientists in the fields of ophthalmology and vision research. Departmental and Medical School leadership are committed to providing material, financial and intellectual support to ensure the candidate's development and success.  There is a significant clinical need for non-invasive biomarkers that will improve diagnosis and management of IIH. The objective of the research project is to establish physiologically based markers of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) function and retinal vasculature as markers of IIH that detect abnormalities, monitor treatment and distinguish peripheral vision outcomes. This objective will be accomplished with two specific aims: 1. To test the hypothesis that RGC function is impaired and retinal vascular diameters are enlarged in IIH subjects as compared to visually normal control subjects: Electrophysiological and pupil light response based measures of RGC function and image based measures of retinal blood vessel diameter will be compared between IIH subjects with elevated intracranial pressure and control subjects. This will establish that these markers are abnormal in the IIH population. 2. To test the hypothesis that RGC function impairment and retinal vascular dilation recover in IIH subjects with short and long term treatment: Electrophysiological and pupil light response based measures of RGC function and image based measures of retinal blood vessel diameter will be compared within IIH subjects when intracranial pressure is elevated, immediately following short term intracranial pressure lowering by lumbar puncture and following long term intracranial pressure lowering by standard clinical therapy. This will establish that these markers change with treatment of IIH. The results of the proposed study will lay the scientific and technical foundation for the development of these markers as clinical tools and clinical trial outcome measures of IIH. Furthermore, the results will advance scientific understanding of the pathophysiology underlying optic nerve dysfunction and injury in IIH. The project has broader significance because the knowledge gained and technical capabilities developed will have applications to other diseases at the intersection of neurology and ophthalmology such as glaucoma and cerebrovascular disease. The research career development and mentoring plan will transform the candidate into an independent researcher who will make long-lasting contributions to vision science."
"9214994","Summary. Red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunization remains a significant clinical problem in transfusion medicine, particularly among those patients who require chronic transfusions. For those who are unfortunate enough to generate multiple alloantibodies, provision of compatible antigen negative RBCs can be both time and resource intensive. In rare cases, this can result in an inability to locate an otherwise life-saving therapy. RBC alloantibodies are also responsible for hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs), causing substantial morbidity and occasional mortality. HTRs result from two important immunological phenomena. The first is the uniquely evanescent nature of RBC antibodies, whose rapid disappearance leads to false negative screens in alloimmunized patients. The second is the recall antibody response elicited by re-exposure to antigen via subsequent transfusion, where the rapid and robust increase in circulating antibodies drive HTRs. Despite the significant clinical consequences of these phenomena, our understanding of the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating anti-RBC antibody generation, maintenance and recall is remarkably limited. Accordingly, there are no effective therapeutic interventions available to alloimmunized patients other than antigen avoidance. Our previous work has identified IL-6 as a key cytokine signal that regulates both the initial alloimmunization response to RBCs as well as early T follicular helper cell (TFH) differentiation. We are now interested in extending our findings to investigate the role of IL-6 signals in controlling RBC alloantibody evanescence and recall responses. Given the pleomorphic nature of IL-6 signaling, we are interested in determining both the cellular targets (B vs. T cell), downstream signaling molecules (STAT3), and cellular consequences (short-lived plasma cell, long-lived plasma cell, memory B cell and memory TFH cell differentiation) regulated by IL-6 and required for RBC alloimmunization. Accordingly, we will employ cutting-edge conditional genetic mouse mutants of IL-6R, STAT3, and BCL6 to directly compare antibody and cellular responses to two different mouse models of RBC alloimmunization as well as standard vaccination approaches. In so doing, we will better understand how the fundamental cellular and molecular immune regulators of RBC alloimmunization vary for different RBC antigen systems, and also how they compare to traditional immune stimulation. Furthermore, we will develop a pre-clinical mouse model system to determine the therapeutic efficacy of targeting the IL-6/IL-6R signaling pathway for the prevention and/or treatment of RBC alloimmunization, serving as key data for the subsequent consideration of IL-6R antibody blocking therapies (such as Tocilizumab) in select, high-risk alloimmunized patients."
"9216394","Myalgic encephalomyelitis/Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) are chronic multi-symptom disorders, which are frequently comorbid. The primary goal of this study is to identify unique genetic mutations seen in ME/CFS and/or FM but not in depression or other functional disorders like migraine. Identifying such variants would provide specific biomarkers for diagnosis of ME/CFS and FM and for identifying causes and targets for treatment. Both ME/CFS and FM have been proposed to involve mitochondrial dysfunction. Recently, we employed RNA-Seq and VarScan2 to examine mutations in leukocytes (not whole blood) for the full human transcriptome. In a pilot sample, 94% of the 17 ME/CFS patients had High or Moderate Impact variants in mitochondrial genes affecting NADH dehdrogenase 4, and the 17th had mitochondrial variants affecting cytochrome B. Both are proteins in the respiratory chain complexes that have critical roles in production of ATP, the cell's major energy source. Known mitochondrial disorders are associated with other mutations affecting these same complexes. Like ME/CFS, these mitochondrial disorders involve symptoms of muscle weakness, fatigue, neuropathies and exercise intolerance. Most of our 17 patients also had a second mitochondrial variant affecting ATP production and also a chromosomal DNA variant affecting either mitochondrial replication or autoimmune function. Thus, we hypothesize that mutations in mitochondrial genes (especially in combination with other mutations) increase risk or contribute causally to the development of ME/CFS and/or FM, and may be specific biomarkers of these disorders. Specific aims of the study are: First, to use RNA-Seq and VarScan2 to compare the frequency of leukocyte mitochondrial mutations of 150 patients with ME/CFS and/or FM versus 150 healthy controls, patients with migraines or depression (total sample= 300). Second, to examine the relationship between greater heteroplasmy of these mutations and severity of physical fatigue, mental fog and widespread pain in all 150 CFS/ME and FM patients. Third, in mothers of 40 ME/CFS or FM patients with mitochondrial mutations, to assess whether they share their child's mutation, indicating what proportion of patients have maternally inherited vs. acquired somatic mutations."
"9198737","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      PROJECT SUMMARY Our aim with this proposal is to better understand how in-shoe foot orthoses achieve improvements in foot and ankle function for people with ankle osteoarthritis (OA) and/or adult acquired flatfoot resulting from posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD). We also aim to be able to predict what the optimal, personalized orthotic device is for each patient is. These are common, painful, and often highly debilitating conditions, with ankle OA estimated to affect around 6% of the adult population and adult acquired flat foot around 3.3% percent of females. It has been shown that foot orthoses can be an effective conservative intervention for these conditions, and can help to postpone or negate surgery. However, for a significant proportion of patients foot orthoses are unsuccessful, and there is evidence that this may be a result of significant inter-individual variability in joint movement and loading response to the intervention. This may be due to a number of factors, including foot bone shape, muscle strength, and/or joint range of motion. In addition, the design of foot orthoses is often inconsistent between suppliers, largely because of the manual approach that is used to design and manufacture them. A further complicating factor is that prescriptions for foot orthoses are often vaguely written. Improving our understanding of different foot and ankle responses to variation in foot orthotic design is essential if we are to improve how these devices function at the level of the individual patient. To measure how the individual bones of the foot move using traditional techniques is, however, very difficult. Such methods rely on skin-mounted markers that are tracked in space to determine foot and ankle kinematics. However the size and position of the foot and ankle bones means that it is not possible to measure them all of them individually. Moreover, the movement between the skin and the underlying bones, known as soft tissue artifact, introduces significant errors into the measurements. This is further complicated by the need to wear shoes for orthoses to function properly. Our group has developed a biplane fluoroscopy system that is tailored to address the unique issues of measuring foot kinematics. This system has the additional advantage of being able to measure the effects of foot orthotics in unmodified shoes. To achieve our objective of understanding and being able to predict the effects of orthoses, our specific aims are: [1]: To collect, via biplane fluoroscopy, kinematic dat describing the effect of varying the angle of hindfoot posting in foot orthotics. These data will b obtained from 90 participants: 30 with ankle OA; 30 with symptomatic PTTD; and 30 healthy controls. [2]: Using the data from SA1, carry out a regression analysis to identify factors obtained from biplane fluoroscopy and clinical exam that significantly influence an individual's response (i.e., hindfoot kinematics) to the orthotic intervention. These factors include: foot type bone geometry, static foot posture, joint axis location, range of motion, and muscle strength. [3]:  Using the data from SA1, generate a musculoskeletal model of the foot that allows detailed analysis of the muscles and ligaments controlling ankle movement. This will be developed in the OpenSim modeling platform and made freely available upon project completion. [4]: To compare the kinematic responses to orthotic devices prescribed using standard methods and those prescribed using algorithms and insight from SA2 and SA3 in a separate group of participants. Biplane fluoroscopy will be used to collect kinematic data from 10 patients with ankle OA and 10 with PTTD to compare the performance of the three pairs (one traditional, one from SA2 and one from SA3) of orthotics. This data will also be used to validate the predictions resulting from SA2 and SA3. This proposed research project will improve our understanding of how foot orthotics work and will help us to prescribe more effective devices to patients. This will benefit the large number of people in the population with ankle osteoarthritis and adult acquired flat foot."
"9215361","Transplant-associated arteriopathy (TAA) constitutes the major cause of graft failure and death in recipients who survive more than one year after cardiac transplantation, despite advances in immunosuppression. One of the early events leading to TAA is infiltration and activation of peri-adventitial inflammatory cells, including T cells and macrophages, which is followed by the formation of a diffuse, concentric neointima in which smooth muscle cells and leukocytes accumulate. Both T cell effectors and T regulatory cells play key roles in regulating the balance of allograft inflammation. Interestingly, age-related diminution of T cell responsiveness to mitogen signals have been linked to improved allograft survival. Indeed, epidemiological studies indicate that older recipients have reduced allograft rejection rates than younger recipients. As such, identification of factors that reduce activation of T cells could potentially impact both acute and chronic cardiac allograft rejection. Kruppel-like factors are transcriptional regulators of cell growth, differentiation, and activation. We identified a member of this family, KLF10, whose expression is highly expressed in T cells and increases with age. We identified that the TGF-b1-responsive factor, KLF10, regulates key aspects of both T cell effector and T regulatory cell function. Our preliminary studies uncover a novel role for KLF10 in age-related diminution of T cell activation in TAA. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)-mismatched cardiac allografts showed similar TAA and survival when transplanted into young recipients of either wild-type (WT) or KLF10-/- mice. In contrast, allografts in older KLF10-/- recipients developed accelerated TAA with increased accumulation of peri- adventitial T cells and macrophages, increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers (e.g. IFN-?, TNF-a, IL-6, and MCP-1), and reduced survival. Older KLF10-/- CD4+ T cells exhibited enhanced Th1 and decreased T regulatory cell (Treg) function with reduced expression of CTLA-4, an immunosuppressive molecule implicated in T cell responsiveness with aging. Finally, cardiac allografts transplanted into younger KLF10-/- hosts receiving older KLF10-/- T cells (vs. younger KLF10-/- T cells) showed increased TAA. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that KLF10 is targeted by a microRNA, miR-340, that is inversely expressed with KLF10 with increasing age to regulate TGF-b1/CTLA-4 signaling. These observations provide the foundation for our central hypothesis that KLF10 serves as a critical regulator of T cell responsiveness with aging and TAA. In Aim1, we will explore the upstream mechanisms regulating KLF10 expression in old and young T cell effectors. In Aim2, we will determine the molecular basis for impaired Th1 and Treg cell function in older CD4-KLF10-deficient mice critical for TAA. In Aim3, we will explore the effect of altered KLF10 expression on T cell responsiveness and experimental TAA using young and old, T cell-specific KLF10-KO mice and anti-miR-340 therapeutics. The results of these studies will provide considerable insights regarding KLF10 function in T cell biology, aging, and may serve as the basis for novel therapeutic strategies to modulate T cell responsiveness and TAA."
"9217955","Little is known about the epigenetic bases of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Our recent large cross-sectional study revealed many monocyte transcriptome and epigenome signatures associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. Some of these genomic features appeared to partially mediate the relationship between traditional CVD risk factors (e.g. age, obesity, and smoking) and measures of atherosclerosis. The transcriptome signatures included an H3K9me2 demethylase transcription coactivator, ARID5B, which is known to promote adipogenesis and smooth muscle development. Methylation of ARID5B enhancer was inversely associated with both ARID5B expression and atherosclerosis. Our experimental in vitro study further showed that ARID5B promotes expression of genes involved in atherosclerosis-related pro-inflammatory and lipid metabolism pathways after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. These results support a pivotal epigenetic checkpoint for controlling immunometabolic homeostasis and promoting chronic inflammatory reactions, which may contribute to atherosclerosis. These data set a compelling stage for prospective studies of the candidate genomic features and mechanistic dissection of the role of ARID5B in atherogenesis. The goals of our proposed study are to identify atherosclerosis associated ?promising? genomic features that are predictive of atherogenesis and its progression, to characterize their associations with plaque vulnerability, to determine their genetic and non-genetic predictors, and to elucidate their mechanistic linkage to atherogenesis. We will study 1,892 randomly selected subjects from four Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) field centers that have planned genomic, DNA methylomic, and transcriptomic data from purified CD14+ monocytes, as well as concurrent assessment of CVD risk factors and ultrasonographic carotid plaque burden from MESA Exam 5. We will repeat ultrasound imaging to quantify and characterize carotid plaques, and re-evaluate DNA methylomic and transcriptomic profiles of monocytes at MESA Exam 6, and we will perform in vivo and in vitro functional studies to achieve the following specific aims: Aim 1. To validate predictive effects of atherosclerosis-associated genomic features identified at Exam 5 on initiation and progression of atherosclerosis in a prospective study with 6-years of follow-up. Aim 2. To characterize the associations of the ?promising? genomic features with carotid plaque vulnerability. Aim 3. To identify potential temporal and causal relationships between known genetic and non-genetic CVD risk factors, the ?promising? genomic features, and plaque burden. Aim 4. To determine the functional consequences of alterations of most the ?promising? genomic features. If successful, the identified ?promising? genomic features will provide mechanistic insights into the etiology of atherosclerosis and potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9217960","This R01 application proposes to continue work funded for the past five years by a Transformative R01 (?Vaccination to generate tissue resident memory T cells?) from the Office of the NIH Director (TR01?s cannot be renewed as such). The previous funding period allowed Drs. Kupper and Clark to make fundamental insights into immunobiology of TRM in skin and other tissues, in both mouse models and humans. Taken together, the body of work published by both co-PI?s over the past five years validates the importance of TRM in protective immunity, is summarized in commissioned reviews published in 2015 by Dr. Clark (in Science Translational Medicine) and Dr. Kupper (in Nature Medicine). The present application builds on exciting preliminary data showing that tissue specific imprinting occurs very early after T cell activation, and that the gene expression profile of T cells activated in skin draining and lung draining lymph nodes (LN) is surprisingly similar (but very different from gut draining LN). This may explain why immunization with a replication deficient poxvirus (MVA) vector through epidermal disruption (formerly ?skin scarification?, or ed/ss) generates not only skin TRM but also lung TRM with very high efficiency. This suggests that ed/ss skin immunization may be a highly effective way of generating protective immunity in the lung to pulmonary pathogens like influenza. This hypothesis will be tested in Aim 1. Conventional vaccination routes (intradermal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular) were much less efficient at generating TRM in both skin and lung. Remarkably, the gene expression profile of T cells responding to the same antigen delivered by these different routes was very different, with ep/ss and i.m. being the most different. These differences in gene expression were maintained even 30 days later in splenic TEM, and were manifested by a strikingly different capacity to generate TRM. Some of the greatest differences in gene expression between TRM and TCM are in genes relevant to lipid metabolism (fatty acid binding proteins/FABP, lipases, and CD36/LDL receptor); TRM?s generated from T cells deficient in FABP4 and 5 did not persist in skin. The hypothesis that the ep/ss mode of immunization most efficiently generates TRM that are dependent on fatty acid metabolism for survival in peripheral tissues will be tested in Aim 2. Finally, in Aim 3, related hypotheses will be tested in translational studies using human tissue, with blood, skin, and lung tissue being obtained from thoracic surgery patients undergoing lobectomies. We predict, and will test for, overlap (at the level of CDR3 sequence) in the T cell repertoire of skin and lung by high throughput sequencing of the TCRB gene, and will directly compare human skin and lung TRM by gene expression, cell surface phenotype, and function. The previously unappreciated commonalities in skin and lung homing T cells may explain phenomena from the tuberculin skin test to the ?atopic march?, where atopic dermatitis is followed by asthma, and has important implications for human vaccine development against pathogens that enter the host through lung or skin."
"9218489","Project summary Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Adult heart is largely dormant, designed primarily to perform pump function and responding to pathological challenge by limited myocyte turnover with development of scar tissue at the site of injury. Incredibly, cardiac tissue during developmental stages consists of actively diving cardiomyocytes and is able to resolve injury by formation of new tissue. The fundamental question is whether adult heart can be somehow driven into a developmental signaling state restoring cellular replacement without compromising pump function. Cardiac progenitor cell- based (CPC) applications have been widely used to resurrect myocardial repair processes and have moved into clinic but are limited due to underperformance of the donated cells. In most cases, CPCs are harvested from elderly patients with an adverse cardiac tissue morphology including host of clinical features reducing therapeutic efficacy of the cells and their cell-free agents such as exosomes. Interestingly, CPCs are known to possess incredible growth and repair properties during fetal and neonatal cardiac stages and understanding unique signaling hubs regulating CPC performance during development may open up a novel avenue for enhancement of CPC therapy. Ideally changing cardiac microenvironment to resemble a developmental cardiac tissue may offer a powerful way to restore lost cardiac repair ability. Our preliminary data indicates miR-294 signaling axis enhances cardiac performance including core CPC function mediated by its downstream target Lin28a. Therefore, we hypothesize that reintroduction of developmental miR-294-Lin28a signaling axis in CPCs will promote CPC properties reminiscent of more primitive developmental stage where the heart can better repair itself. Our goal is to enhance CPC therapy including the potency of cell-free agents such as exosomes by induction of developmental signaling to repair the heart after myocardial damage. We will extend these studies to develop a therapeutic strategy on miR294-Lin28a based modification of human heart derived CPCs and their exosomes that enhances cardiac structure and function after injury. Enhancement of cardiac cell therapy by reintroduction of developmental signaling provides a new direction for CPC based cell therapeutics and treatment of heart failure."
"9218766","Arthralgia broadly impacts quality of life because of joint dysfunction and associated pain. Current therapeutics improve management of the arthritic joint but may not satisfactorily address the associated pain. The K/BxN serum transfer model of arthritis produces a long lasting, but reversible inflammation of the joint in mice accompanied by an early onset allodynia that surprisingly persists long after the resolution of inflammatory indices. In the early phase of the model, pain behavior responds to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and agents that block spinal sensitization (e.g. Gabapentin), while in the post-inflammatory late phase, pain only responds to the latter agents. This behavioral profile is accompanied by a persistent activation of dorsal horn microglia and the appearance of activation transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a marker of afferent injury in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), in males and females, suggesting a transition in both sexes from an inflammatory to a neuropathic phenotype. Unexpectedly, the female, despite evidence of nerve injury, does not display a comparable late phase pain state. Pharmacological studies and studies with mutant mice have revealed several issues. 1) Transition to a neuropathic phenotype is modulated by spinal Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and T and/or B cells evidenced by resolution of pain in relevant knock out strains. In females that lack T and B cells, resolution of allodynia is largely unaffected. 2) Our work indicates that TLR4 signaling, largely through MyD88 is associated with concurrent activation of proinflammatory (TNF) signaling in males leading to a persistent post inflammatory neuropathic pain state. 3) TLR4 also signals though TRIF and interferon (IFN), which we found to attenuate the algesic effects of TLR4-MyD88 signaling. We speculate that this component accounts for the lack of a late phase allodynia in the female. 4) Based on current evidence, we argue that with persistent, but reversible inflammation, sprouting and neuroma like structures in primary afferents and postganglionic sympathetic efferents occur at the peripheral terminals of the joint and the dorsal root ganglion of the K/BxN male and female. This sprouting is driven by TLR4, which activates inflammatory cells and DRG satellite cells to release growth factors, which trigger/sustain sprouting and promote migration of nerve fibers into the DRG and spinal cord. 5) Involvement of spinal TLR4 in pain processing was suggested to be male specific, and females to preferentially use adaptive immune cells (T/B lymphocytes). We believe however, that both sexes use adaptive immune cells and TLR4 signaling, but to varying degrees. The effects of sex on this transition and the underlying sprouting have not hitherto been characterized. Specifically, these studies using the K/BxN model in males and females will characterize time dependent changes in pain, sprouting (afferent and sympathetic in DRG and ankle), inflammatory cell migration into DRG and spinal cord, glial activation and the role played by sex, TLR4 signaling and T/B cells in these endpoints."

"9239352","ABSTRACT Precision medicine promises to revolutionize oncology by targeting drugs to specific mutations. However, targeted drugs have failed to produce durable clinical responses when used as single agents in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary brain tumor. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are essential for functional validation of such mutations, but technical limitations have prevented their widespread use in preclinical cancer drug development. The Miller Lab has developed non- germline GEM (nGEM) models. The Berens Lab has performed comprehensive genomic and chemovulnerability profiling in a genetically diverse and faithful panel of patient-derived human xenograft (PDX) models. The Johnson Lab has developed a novel chemical proteomics method, multiplex inhibitor beads coupled with mass spectrometry (MIB-MS), to assess the activation state of the cellular kinome en masse and has shown that dynamic kinome reprogramming contributes to targeted drug resistance. In this Multi-PI project, we will combine our expertise to address the following Aims: (1) To credential PDX models against human GBM by kinome proteomics; (2) To develop genetically-matched nGEM models from distinct cells of origin; and (3) To credential PDX and nGEM models by dynamic kinome profiling. We will develop a genetically diverse panel of nGEM models with defined driver mutations and cellular origins that will be useful adjunct to PDX for preclinical drug development. We will then credential both PDX and nGEM models against resected GBM specimens using cross-species genome, transcriptome, and kinome, and drug response profiling. Models will be genomically matched to their human counterparts and used to develop rational combination therapies that combat single agent resistance mechanisms in genomically- defined tumor subtypes. This work will therefore help realize the promise of precision medicine in neuro- oncology."

"9238927","Cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in endothelial barrier function. Various tetraspanins are expressed in endothelium, form tetraspanin-enriched microdomains with cell adhesion proteins such as integrins, and regulate endothelial cell adhesion and vascular permeability. Our early study revealed that tetraspanins are required for maintaining proper endothelial adhesiveness, endothelial barrier, and vascular permeability. We have demonstrated that, to sustain vascular stability, tetraspanin-enriched microdomains tune the balance of Rac1 and RhoA small GTPase activities or the balance of cortical actin meshwork and stress fibers to sustain endothelial cell-cell and cell matrix adhesions. But the in-depth mechanisms by which tetraspanins regulate endothelial barrier function still remain elusive.  We will use tetraspanin CD151 as example in this study to elucidate the mechanisms by which tetraspanin-enriched microdomains regulate endothelial barrier function and vascular permeability. The overarching hypotheses of this project include that, at the cellular level, CD151 promotes endothelial barrier function by primarily increasing endothelial cell-matrix interactions, which subsequently elevates endothelial cell-cell adhesion. Meanwhile, CD151 can also directly reinforce endothelial cell-cell interaction. At the molecular level, CD151 reinforces cell adhesions by enhancing the functional accessibility and nanoscale organization of cell adhesion proteins at endothelial cell surface.  Specifically, we will first unravel the mechanism by which CD151 reinforces endothelial cell- matrix adhesion. We will assess both in vitro and in vivo mechanistic roles of CD151 in integrin activation and accessibility at the basal surface of endothelial cells. Secondly, we will reveal the mechanism by which CD151 reinforces endothelial cell-cell adhesion. We will assess both in vitro and in vivo mechanistic roles of CD151 in maintaining structural and functional integrity of endothelial cell-cell contacts, which directly prevents endothelial hyper-permeability. Finally, we will delineate the signaling mechanisms by which CD151 reinforces endothelial barrier and reduces vascular hyper-permeability.  Hence, the general goal of this project is to understand how CD151 sustains the endothelium barrier function by assessing both in vitro and in vivo mechanistic roles of CD151 in stabilizing the structural and functional interactions of endothelium with the underlying basement membrane and in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of endothelial cell-cell contacts and junctions.  From these studies, we will understand why and how tetraspanin-enriched microdomains are important for endothelial barrier function, establish a novel paradigm between vascular permeability and membrane organization of cell adhesion molecules, and delineate the signaling axis that governs the fine balance of small GTPases in endothelium. From the in-depth mechanistic study, we will develop an integrated understanding of the unique features of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, which will ultimately lead to the development of therapeutic mean against vascular diseases."
"9239481","ABSTRACT Proper regulation of histone biosynthesis during the cell cycle is critical for the appropriate coordination of chromatin assembly and DNA replication. Overproduction or underproduction of histone protein results in replication stress and genome instability that contributes to the development of cancer. In this proposal we undertake a comprehensive analysis of replication-dependent (RD) histone mRNA biosynthesis and how this process is coordinated with the cell cycle. Animal RD-histone mRNAs are the only eukaryotic mRNAs that lack a polyA tail, ending instead in a conserved stem loop structure. In contrast, mRNAs for histone variants such as H3.3 and H2A.Z are encoded by polyadenylated mRNAs. Generation of the unique RD-histone mRNA 3' end results from the activity of an evolutionary conserved set of pre-RNA processing factors. The genes encoding all five RD-histone proteins are clustered in metazoan genomes, and transcription and pre-mRNA processing factors required for histone mRNA biosynthesis are organized into a nuclear body (the histone locus body or HLB) that assembles at these gene clusters. We will determine the requirements for the coordinate synthesis of the RD-histone mRNAs using both biochemical and genetic approaches in Drosophila, with a particular focus on the role that the HLB plays in histone transcription and pre- mRNA processing. Histone gene clusters provide a system in which one can readily study the expression of a tightly regulated set of genes at all levels of mRNA biosynthesis, from the organization of genes within the nucleus through activation of transcription, pre-mRNA processing and transcription termination. Our Drosophila experimental paradigm permits the in vivo interrogation of these fundamental processes in gene expression in ways that are unavailable to other systems."
"9240130","STRESS SIGNALING PATHWAYS LINKING ENDOTHELIAL INJURY TO GRAFT ARTERIOSCLEROSIS Abstract: The overall hypothesis of this application is that graft arteriosclerosis (GA), the major cause of late cardiac allograft failure, results from a chronic host T cell response to allogeneic graft endothelial cells (ECs) that takes the form of delayed-type hypersensitivity DTH within the vessel wall, locally generating IFN-? which is responsible for driving vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and intimal hyperplasia. The clinical correlations and evidence from other experimental systems have suggested that non-immune factors, especially peri-operative stress-induced alterations in the graft, are important contributors to GA pathogenesis. It is proposed and demonstrated experimentally that signals in the graft, primarily from ECs, generated as a result of peri-operative stress can produce mediators that influence T cell activation and differentiation. However, how the peri-operative stresses such as hypoxia couple intracellular signaling pathway to alter ECs alloimmunity and GA is not understood. We have identified SENP1 is a critical mediator of peri-operative stresses. We hypothesize that SENP1 mediates the responses to non-immune peri-operative injuries of graft ECs, increasing T cell-mediated alloimmunity and GA. We propose to explore this hypothesis in the following specific aims: 1) Characterize SENP1-enhanced cytosolic NOX2 activity that mediates peri-operative stress- induced EC immunogenicity and GA progression. We will elucidate the mechanisms by which SENP1 activates NOX2-dependent ROS generation in ECs, define the role of SENP1-NOX2 axis in peri-operative stress-exacerbated GA progression in vivo using EC-specific SENP1 knockout mice and NOX2-deficient as graft donors, and determine how SENP1 couples NOX2 deSUMOylation to EC phenotypic changes. 2) Characterize SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation and disruption of mitochondrial Trx2 activity that augments peri-operative stress-induced EC immunogenicity and GA progression. We will elucidate the mechanisms by which SENP1 attenuates Trx2-dependent mitochondrial function in EC, define the role of mitochondrial SENP1-Trx2 axis in peri-operative stress-exacerbated GA progression in vivo using EC-specific Trx2- transgenic mice expressing WT, SUMO-defective KR mutant and Trx2-SUMO fusion forms as graft donors, and determine how SENP1 couples Trx2 deSUMOylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production to EC phenotypic changes that modulate T cell responses. 3) Characterize SENP1-ROS-ASK1 signaling pathway that mediates peri-operative stress-induced EC immunogenicity and GA progression. We will determine if cytosolic SENP1-NOX2 and mitochondrial SENP1-Trx2 converge on ASK1 in regulating EC function and GA progression, determine how SENP1-NOX2 and SENP1-Trx2 couple ASK1 to EC phenotypic changes that modulate T cell responses, and test if pharmacological inhibitors of SENP1, NOX2, TRX2 and SENP1 could prevent/ameliorate GA. If successful, this study will provide therapeutic strategies by modulating these two molecules in ECs to reduce GA incidence or delay GA progression."

"9245154","PROJECT SUMMARY  The gastrointestinal tract is colonized by a diverse collection of commensal microbiota that occupy a symbiotic niche with the host. It is therefore in the best interest of the immune system to tolerate these microbes while still remaining vigilant against other pathogenic species of microbes. Indeed, failure of the immune system to accomplish this critical function is presumed to be a major underlying cause of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). While much has been learned about the mechanisms establishing immune tolerance to self antigens, very little is known about how tolerance towards gut commensal microbial antigens is mediated, if at all. Accumulating evidence implicates a major role for regulatory T cells (Treg) as a dominant form of tolerance within the gastrointestinal environment. However, a dearth of relevant experimental tools has limited investigation into how Tregs and other CD4+ T cells may contribute to immune tolerance to gut commensal antigens. We have recently developed powerful experimental systems involving peptide:MHC tetramer-based cell enrichment techniques that allow us to directly characterize rare populations of commensal microbial antigen-specific T cells in the natural endogenous repertoires of mice. These tools will enable us to investigate T cell tolerance to commensal microbes at an unprecedented level of physiological significance. Our long term goal is to determine the role that CD4+ T cells play in maintaining immune tolerance to commensal microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract, and how they may be manipulated for therapeutic benefit. We hypothesize that T cell tolerance to gut commensal microbial antigens is peripherally induced and restricted to the gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). We believe that the mechanisms of tolerance are reversible, providing the adaptive immune system with a high level of flexibility that is needed to fine-tune immune responsiveness to the complex and dynamic antigen environment of the gut. We will test this hypothesis in this exploratory study by 1) characterizing commensal antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) versus systemic lymphoid environments, 2) characterizing commensal antigen-specific CD4+ T cells during colitis, and 3) developing new tools to study commensal antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. The achievement of our aims will greatly improve our understanding of how T cell tolerance is maintained to commensal microbiota in the gut, and how we may ultimately exploit this information for therapeutic purposes."
"9246836","US Hispanics/Latinos are the largest US minority group, constituting over 15% of the US population and growing to one-third of the US population by 2050. Hispanics match or exceed any other race-ethnicity group in having a high burden of diabetes and pre-diabetes. Especially given the relatively young age of US Hispanics, the group with prediabetes (e.g.,fasting plasma glucose 100-125 mg/dl) are of immense public health importance because 15-30% of people with prediabetes will develop diabetes within five years. Physical activity (PA) is an effective preventive behavior in the battle to prevent diabetes as suggested by the Diabetes Prevention Program. In this context, the Hispanic population presents a paradox. Particularly among males, Hispanics have higher moderate-to-vigorous activity levels than non-Hispanics and light intensity PA is higher and sedentary behavior (SB) is lower among Hispanics than other groups. There is also an apparent contradiction (Hispanic paradox) between a high risk of prediabetes/diabetes among Hispanics, while at the same time Hispanics have favorable mortality rates vs. others and may also have lower incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The present application will leverage the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latino Hispanics as well as the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Third Generation and Omni Gen 2 (FHS Gen3/Omni2) cohorts of multiple race/ethnic groups. This approach not only increases generalizability of our findings to the US mainstream population, but also helps us understand what is unique about Hispanics. In all, 5500 individuals with confirmed prediabetes will be studied, all of whom had 7-day baseline Actical accelerometry measurements (2008-2011) which will be repeated during 2017-2020. This approach will allow us to understand the relationship among PA, SB, onset of diabetes and CVD in a large, representative population study of prediabetics."
"9221920","Project Description. Trypanosomatid parasites are the causative agents of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, all of which are listed by the WHO as Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Collectively 18-20 million people are infected with one of these parasites, yet drug therapies remain inadequate for all three diseases. Discovery of a drug-target that could be exploited against all three parasites, while not showing toxicity against the host, would provide a robust new approach to combat these diseases. Eukaryotes universally require a translation factor called eIF5A for cell growth. To be active eIF5A must be post-translationally modified on a conserved lysine reside to generate a novel amino acid called hypusine. The hypusine modification of eIF5A is catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) using spermidine as a substrate. DHS is an essential enzyme in all eukaryotes including the trypanosomatids. We previously demonstrated that DHS from trypanosomatids and Entamoeba have uniquely evolved to require heterotetramer formation between two paralogous gene products to generate the active enzyme. This unusual configuration of these parasite DHSs suggests that it may be feasible to identify selective inhibitors of the parasite enzymes that don't inhibit human DHS. The goal of this proposal is to determine if drug-like inhibitors of DHS that are selective for the trypanosomatid enzymes can be identified and if so to advance them during a lead optimization program for the treatment of HAT. In the R21 phase of this proposal we plan to develop a high throughput screen (HTS) compatible assay for T. brucei DHS and to use this assay to screen the UT Southwestern 200,000 compound library for T. brucei DHS inhibitors. We will perform hit validation on identified inhibitors and determine if the identified inhibitors show good selectivity versus human DHS. If trypanosomatid specific DHS inhibitors with good drug like properties can be identified than in the R33 phase of the proposal we plan a hit to lead optimization of at least one series with appropriate properties to be advanced for the treatment of HAT. Identified DHS inhibitors will also be tested at various stages during hit validation and lead optimization against T. cruzi and Leishmania to determine if they have the potential to be developed as a broad-spectrum treatment for all three trypanosomatid-based diseases."

"9239442","The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays important roles in development and in cancer. The Hh ligand, which activates the pathway, is derived from the autoprocessing of the Hh precursor protein. Hh autoprocessing is at the very beginning of the Hh signaling pathway and likely plays crucial roles in both physiology and disease. However, the basic mechanisms of Hh autoprocessing and its role in diseases are poorly understood. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we will define the catalytic mechanism of Hh autoprocessing with atomic resolution and study two novel roles for Hh autoprocessing in prostate cancer. We will first define the catalytic mechanism of Hh autoprocessing with solution NMR; we will then study a new mechanism of tumorigenesis involving zinc deficiency and Hh activation in prostate cancer; lastly we will establish Hh autoprocessing of cancer drugs as a novel means of drug resistance in prostate cancer."

"9227004","Through bioinformatics analyses of a comprehensive database of gene expression (Body Index of Gene Expression (BIGE)), we sought to identify novel/uncharacterized genes associated with the immune system. We identified a poorly characterized secreted protein expressed by activated macrophages encoded by a gene currently identified as ?meteorin-like? (metrnl). This gene is strongly expressed in barrier tissues (skin, mucosa) and by activated macrophages. Metrnl encodes a small secreted protein of 311 aminoacids with a 45 aminoacid signal peptide, predicting a mature protein of 266 aminoacids, with an estimated molecular weight of ~29KDa. It is expressed in human peripheral blood monocytes or mouse peritoneal macrophages following activation and its expression is modulated (positively or negatively) by various cytokines. We have produced a Metrnl/IL-39-/- mouse which is viable and breeds well, but exhibits various immune system defects. Taken together, we conclude that Metrnl represents a novel cytokine for which we recommend the name interleukin 39 (IL-39). Metrnl/IL-39 is overexpressed in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a role in human inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. Metrnl/IL-39 expression is also induced in the peritoneum of mice injected with thioglycollate, consistent with a role in inflammation. The immune system abnormalities we have detected in the Metrnl/Il-39-/- mouse, include lower serum IgG levels, which are due to very low levels of IgG2b and IgG3. Furthermore, its splenocytes exhibit altered cytokine production, including inability to produce some chemokines (CCL3) as well as significantly lower levels of IFN?. These observations strongly support our conclusion that Metrnl/IL-39 represents a novel cytokine involved in immunoregulation. Metrnl/IL-39 has been reported to induce the expression of the nuclear receptor PPAR? in adipocytes, but its effects on cells of the immune system are unknown. In Specific Aim 1, we will identify cells of the immune system that express the Metrnl/IL-39 receptor based on the ability of Metrnl/IL-39 to induce the expression of PPAR?, or to bind biotinylated Metrnl/IL-39 (detected by FACS). We will also explore whether the B cell defects observed in the Metrnl/IL-39-/- mouse (very low IgG2b and IgG3) are due to defective class switching in B cells, and will explore a potential role for Metrnl/IL-39 in the polarization of nave T cells to the Th1, Th2, Th17 and iTreg stages. We have also observed that the Metrnl/IL-39-/- mouse is highly susceptible to Toxoplasma gondii. In Specific Aim 2, we will explore several immune mechanisms that may account for this increased susceptibility to T. gondii. We will study the ability of Toxoplasma to grow in monocytes from Metrnl/IL-39 or wild type (WT) mice, and will also monitor Th1, Th2 or Th17 cytokine levels in Metrnl/IL-39-/- or WT mice during infection. We will finally determine whether administration of Metrnl/IL-39 can reverse the susceptibility observed in the Metrnl/IL-39-/- mouse to T. gondii. Through these studies we will validate the hypothesis that Metrnl/IL-39 represents a novel cytokine associated with the immune system and inflammation and will open a new field of research."
"9237922","SUMMARY Breast cancer is a global healthcare burden, not only for the patients diagnosed with this disease, but also their families and friends. The surgical treatment of breast cancer, while successful, has significant limitations that increase patient anxiety, increase costs, and can increase the risk for local recurrence and lifelong post-operative complications. A primary limitation stems from the lack of an intraoperative microscopic assessment of surgical tumor margins. Our cohesive and productive team with academic, clinical, and industrial representation has successfully developed and demonstrated for the first time the use of intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) for in vivo human imaging of tumor margins during breast cancer surgery using a novel handheld surgical imaging probe. Additionally, the development and use of interferometric synthetic aperture microscopy (ISAM) for in vivo imaging has shown an important improvement in resolution and depth-of-field. Despite these advances, challenges remain for identifying tissue microstructure, particularly between normal fibrous stroma and dense tumor tissue, which are both highly scattering structures. To address these challenges, we propose the novel and innovative application of polarization-sensitive OCT (PS-OCT) and PS-ISAM for intraoperative in vivo imaging in human breast cancer surgery, and hypothesize that these will improve the detection sensitivity and specificity of positive breast tumor margins over standard OCT/ISAM. Realizing that the presence and progression of cancer significantly alters the collagen-based tissue microenvironment, the use of PS-OCT to sensitively detect and quantify birefringence of tissue collagen offers the potential for earlier detection of cancer and the altered microenvironment. By leveraging ISAM and other computational optical image segmentation algorithms, we can more fully characterize the tissue/tumor microenvironment. Through four specific aims, we will implement hardware and innovative software contributions to construct an intraoperative multi-mode system capable of real-time OCT/ISAM and PS-OCT/PS-ISAM, then use this system to investigate the performance of these imaging modes in clinical human studies to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ex vivo and in vivo PS-OCT/PS-ISAM over standard OCT/ISAM, and against the standard-of-care assessments which include post-operative histopathology and intraoperative visual/tactile cues. The successful completion of this project is expected to establish the clinical intraoperative use of these new optical imaging techniques, with the goal of reducing the current unacceptably high reoperation rates in the surgical treatment of breast cancer."
"9238126","Summary A common theme in bacterial evolution is how the acquisition of antibiotic resistance can rapidly change the epidemiologic landscape of major human pathogens. Carbapenem Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp), first documented in 1996, is now epidemic in New York City (NYC) hospitals and is reported globally. CRKp infections often result in poor therapeutic indices; thus curbing the incidence of CRKp infections is now a national priority. Currently, three overlapping CRKp epidemics with three different classes of carbapenemases are spreading in different continents. Accelerating these epidemics is the ability of carbapenemase genes, harbored on conjugative plasmids, to spread across the Enterobacteriaceae family. A critical, poorly understood aspect of the CRKp epidemic is the relative contribution of plasmid-mediated transfer and clonal dissemination to driving the regional and global epidemiology. Previously, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to dissect the molecular epidemiology and evolution of the main US epidemic CRKp sequence type (ST) 258. Interrogating strains and resistance harboring plasmids within our network of NYC hospitals we found that the majority of ST258 CRKp strains harbor one of three common plasmids carrying a particular class of carbapenemase enzyme, KPC. These data suggest the spread of CRKp is likely the consequence of plasmid-mediated gene transfer and subsequent clonal spread. We therefore hypothesize that this epidemic is primarily due to transmission of resistance harboring plasmids uniquely adapted to specific host genetic backgrounds. In Aim 1, we expand our NYC network to include a large US consortium and to examine the genomic epidemiology of CRKp strains and plasmids across the US. Aim 2 builds on the insights and techniques developed in our previous studies to interrogate the global epidemiology of CRKp via a large clinical isolate collection from over 62 countries, with the goal of constructing a phylogeographic map of strains, plasmids and carbapenemase genes. In this Aim we will also directly test the basis of CRKp strain-plasmid association by comparative transmission efficiency studies of different carbapenemase gene-harboring plasmids into diverse strain backgrounds. Using robust CRKp genomic data obtained in Aims 1 and 2, we will develop a rapid molecular detection assay to identify and track CRKp strains and plasmids in clinical settings. Aim 3 will characterize non-carbapenemase factors that contribute to high-level carbapenemase resistance in CRKp isolates, such as mutations in outer membrane proteins, which result in very poor clinical outcomes. Based on this characterization, some of these highly carbapenemase resistant strains will be selected to build a new, well-curated panel of strains for testing novel antibiotic agents. Taken together, ours is an innovative approach with the potential to make a substantial impact in the field of CRKp epidemiology, develop critically needed diagnostic platforms, and explore efficacy of novel antibiotics against these organisms."

"9254246","Scarab Genomics? goal is to commercialize carrier proteins for conjugate vaccine manufacture. This proposal focuses on two bacterial carrier proteins that have been approved by the FDA and that are in use in pre-clinical and clinical studies: Exoprotein A (EPA) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Protein D (PD) from non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae. These proteins are difficult to make by the conventional E. coli fermentation processes and are in very short and unreliable supply commercially (EPA), or presently unavailable (PD). Scarab?s Clean Genome E. coli fermentation technology has not only enabled continuous flow fermentation for at least 30 days to become reality, but has proved to be very efficient at producing the carriers we have tested, with reliable production and good yields. Scarab strains provide much greater safety and productivity than conventional bacterial fermentation strains.  Conjugate vaccines have been enormously successful in preventing pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases, both in the developed and the developing world. Pfizer?s pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13 made USD 4 billion last year. There is still a huge unmet demand for pneumococcal vaccines in many parts of the world, estimated by the vaccine alliance Gavi as two billion doses over the next decade. Although the carrier protein CRM197 is used in many pneumococcal vaccines, problems such as carrier-induced epitope suppression (CIES) contributed to the decision by GlaxoSmithKline to use PD as a carrier for 8 of the 10 pneumococcal serotypes targeted in Synflorix ($550 million in sales in 2012). Interest in conjugate vaccine research is expanding to other infectious diseases (such as HIV and malaria) and also chronic conditions and addictions. The need for multiple carrier proteins is driven by (i) CIES, a reduction in immunogenicity of vaccines that use the same carrier protein (particularly relevant as the desire to combine vaccines and improve coverage increases); (ii) the need to explore multiple carrier proteins when developing conjugate vaccines against specific antigens; (iii) the emergence of rare serotypes that require new vaccination with a different carriers. This field of study is clearly relevant to the NIH mission both for research and the commercial availability of carriers for preclinical and clinical studies, as well as the production of approved vaccines.  The Phase I specific aims of this Fast-Track proposal will demonstrate that EPA and PD express well in Scarab?s Clean Genome strains and that they can be produced in a continuous flow process. This will establish feasibility of commercialization. New Scarab technologies will be tested that (i) avoid use of antibiotics in the fermentation process and (ii) enable cleaner and more efficient recovery of the product. In Phase II, for each carrier, the fermentation system will be fully optimized and a downstream process devised, including purification procedure, thorough analysis of the product and preparation for sale as research grade reagents."
"9247385","Summary  Endothelial cells play a critical role in multiple aspects of lung development and homeostasis, yet the precise mechanisms that regulate vasculogenesis and how endothelial cells signal to other cell types to orchestrate lung development have not been well defined. Accurate regulation of these processes is critical to ensure proper lung development and prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a lung disease of premature infants that often results in life-long complications. Hallmarks of BPD are impaired vasculature and arrested lung development. We created three-dimensional (3D) co-culture systems in which lung endothelial cells (LuMECs) drive the putative lung stem cells, BASCs, to produce bronchiolar or alveolar organoids. These organoid cultures provide an opportunity to model interactions that occur between endothelial cells and alveolar cells during lung development. Using this system, we discovered a novel BMP4-NFATc1- Thrombospondin (TSP1) pathway in endothelial and epithelial cells in the adult lung. We showed that TSP1, known as an anti-angiogenic factor, is required for the development of alveolar organoids. We also identified R-spondin2 (Rspo2), which regulates Wnt signaling in other systems, as a BMP4-regulated protein that may be downstream of TSP1 in endothelial cells. The mechanisms underlying TSP1 regulation of lung vascular development and alveolarization are unknown. We hypothesize that endothelial-derived TSP1 induced by BMP4-NFATc1 signaling inhibits pulmonary vascular development and is required for proper lung development. Further, we posit that vascular lung injury, such as that seen with hyperoxia exposure, impairs TSP1 signaling, thereby altering vasculogensis and blocking alveolar development. In Aim 1, we will determine how TSP1- CD47 interactions regulate vasculogenesis and lung development. Defective lung endothelial cells from mice exposed to hyperoxia will be used in lung organoid co-cultures to test the impact of impaired endothelial cell signals on alveolarization. Similarly, cells from knockout mice will be used in neonatal lung organoid cultures to determine the effect of CD47 deficiency on alveolar development. CD47-knockout mice and endothelial- specific TSP1-knockout mice will be used to test the role of TSP1-CD47 interactions in the response to neonatal hyperoxia-mediated lung vascular injury in vivo. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms by which TSP1-dependent Rspo2 mediates pulmonary vascular development by evaluating ligand response in vitro and after neonatal hyperoxic injury in vivo. Recombinant Rspo2 will be used in neonatal lung organoid cultures and in assays for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. We will determine if lung endothelial cell secreted factors, and more specifically, Rspo2, is sufficient for prevention of neonatal hyperoxia-mediated lung injury. These studies will elucidate mechanisms by which lung endothelial cells drive critical outcomes in development. This work will determine if defective TSP1-dependent signaling is a mechanism of interrupted lung development in premature infants with BPD, leading to new ways to direct therapy for BPD."
"9253076","The proposed study aims to determine whether there are differences in health measures particularly of  cardio-metabolic risk(1) between children conceived by infertility treatment and children conceived  naturally. Children conceived by infertility treatment include those born by assisted reproductive  technologies (ART) and after non-ART treatments such as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) or  ovulation induction (OI). The timing of puberty is also of interest, as some pubertal markers appear  altered after IVF conception(2) and early adrenarche may confer additional CVD risks.(3) Treatment  effects could arise either from the process of ovulation stimulation (which may be shared by both ART  and non-ART treatments) or in vitro culture (which only occurs in ART).

"9324025","Poor prognosis of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is attributable to the absence of efficacious, molecularly-targeted, neoadjuvant therapies. Micrometastases contribute to poor prognosis by increasing recurrence rate. Consequently, an effective treatment option that is capable of targeting and sterilizing micrometastatic disease in patients with TNBC is warranted. I-125-CLR1404 is proposed as a neoadjuvant therapy option for TNBC patients. In the first aim of this proposal, I-125 will conjugated to a tumor-targeting moiety, CLR1404. Subsequently, the physico-chemical properties of I-125-CLR1404 will be characterized and the chemical reactions to maximize chemical yield and minimize the amount of chemical impurities will be optimized. I-125-CLR1404 will be synthesized reliably with a radiochemical yield > 60%, a radiochemical purity (final product) > 95%, and chemical purity (final product) >90.0%. In the second aim, I-125-CLR1404 will be characterized biologically in murine TNBC models. This will include the assessment of pharmacokinetics, radiation dosimetry, and the investigation of normal tissue toxicities. Hematological toxicity will most likely be dose-limiting. In the final aim, efficacy studies of I-125-CLR1404 in an appropriate murine model of TNBC will be conducted.

Six thousand eight hundred and fourteen (6,814) participants were recruited from six Field Centers during 2000-2002 and examined for evidence of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, using computed tomography, cardiac MRI, carotid ultrasound, flow-mediated brachial artery dilation, radial artery tomometry, ankle-brachial index measurement, and retinal photography and, in subsets, abdominal aortic CT, carotid MRI, cardiac MRI tagging for measures of regional myocardial function; established and putative laboratory risk markers; socioeconomic, psychological, behavioral, nutritional and environmental characteristics; and genetic factors. Selected components were repeated over three subsequent examinations through 2007. The cohort has been followed for clinical events since baseline to ascertain and characterize new clinical events and other changes in health status, including changes in medications. The four scientific objectives for the period 2008 through 2015 are (1) identify factors related to progression of subclinical to clinical CVD; (2) identify predictors of decline in ventricular function; (3) further understanding of the basis for racial/ethnic difference in CVD; and (4) provide a platform for in-depth ancillary studies of CVD and other areas.

To date, 79 healthy volunteers were accrued and signed informed consent as active granulocyte donors and donated a total of 242 filgrastim- and dexamethasone-stimulated or  filgrastim-alone stimulated  granulocyte apheresis components since protocol started. 67 components were collected since last report.  Up to 8/29/16 this year , these products were administered to 11 patients with severe neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction and life-threatening infections; 4 recipients had severe aplastic anemia,  3 had chronic granulomatous disease and 4 were patients transplanted for leukemia or lymphoma . In total, 21  of 39 recipients had fungus or mold (an additional one could not be confirmed, and one of the patients had polymicrobial bacteremia in addition to fungus) and 17 had life-threatening bacterial infections, including two with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia.

"9352011","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Of the many potential predisposing factors, sepsis and pneumonia represent the two main causes of ARDS. In spite of an increase in survival in recent years mortality in patients with ARDS is still estimated around 30 to 40%. In this context, development of effective preventive strategies in patients at high risk of development of ARDS is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, the results of studies evaluating prophylactic regimens for ARDS have been mostly disappointing. The gaseous molecule carbon monoxide (CO) has been traditionally viewed as a toxic metabolic and industrial waste. However, recent studies have demonstrated an important physiologic role of CO in many biological systems. Specifically, strong anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-thrombotic effects of CO gas administration and heme oxygenase activation (the enzyme that generates endogenous CO gas) have been demonstrated in several animal models. Previous studies conducted in our department have demonstrated that bronchoscopic instillation of endotoxin (LPS) in healthy volunteers elicits a compartmentalized pulmonary inflammatory response, serving as an excellent model to evaluate interventions directed towards suppression of lung inflammation at its earliest stages.  In the current single blinded, randomized, placebo controlled study, we evaluated the effects of inhaled carbon monoxide on local pulmonary inflammatory responses following endotoxin administration. Twenty healthy subjects, male or female, age 18 to 40 underwent local endotoxin instillation, breathed CO or room air through a mask for 6 hours, and then a repeat bronchoscopy with lavage was done at 6 hours to assess the ability of CO to suppress local inflammation in the lung.  We began enrolling subjects in May 2005 into the pilot study and completed the pilot study in October 2005. The pilot study enrolled 4 males and 4 females.  We analyzed the data from the pilot and found the CO inhalation was well tolerated and did not result in any adverse events.  In addition, at this low dose, no significant anti-inflammatory effects of CO inhalation were demonstrated.  We then enrolled 12 males and 12 females in the main study.  Our results from the main study demonstrate that endotoxin instillation and carbon monoxide inhalation were well tolerated and did not result in any adverse events.  However, no significant anti-inflammatory effects of carbon monoxide on endotoxin induced inflammation were demonstrated.    We have recently begun to explore the effects of CO inhalation on microRNA secretion by lung parenchymal cells using archived samples of bronchoalveolar lavage. The design of the current study allows us to assess the effects of short term CO exposure on normal lung airways and its interaction with local inflammation induced by endotoxin. Pilot studies show that microRNA species can be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage from normal and local airway inflammation. In addition, to further explore mechanisms, we are studying the differential expression of microRNA species in human bronchial epithelial cells grown in vitro in an air-liquid interface in order to assess mechanism associated with microRNA secretion.  The project is now closed to enrollment and open for data and sample analysis only. During this year we transferred the samples and data to another open protocol where we will continue our data analysis and publication of the results."
"9352018","We observed that dexamethasone, a glucocorticosteroid, leads to an unanticipated enhancement of endothelial inflammatory mediator production by extracellular ATP. These effects are mediated in part by a direct effect on the purinergic receptor (P2Y2R) promoter, enhancing transcription of P2Y2R mRNA and protein expression. Inflammation promoting effects include enhanced release of IL-8 and increased transcription of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and SELE). This positive feedback loop of glucocorticoids and ATP-induced endothelial inflammation highlights the observation that glucocorticoids are not uniformly immunosuppressive and has implications for understanding the interactions that occur between the purinergic receptors and ATP in the pathogenesis of vascular inflammation in shock syndromes or atherosclerosis. (J Phasmacol Exp Ther 2010;335:693)  Dual specific phosphatases negatively regulate the effects of mitogen activated protein kinases. We show that dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid agonist and deoxycorticosterone, a mineralocorticoid agonist have novel effects on DUSP1 and DUSP5 expression and function. While qualitatively different, both dexamethasone and deoxycorticosterone induce DUSP1 and DUSP5 mRNA in endothelium.  The enhanced expression of both DUSP1 and DUSP5 by these corticosteroids suppressed the responses of endothelial cells to TNF alpha. Notably, the induction of DUSP1 mRNA by either dexamethasone or deoxycorticosterone was suppressed by TNFalpha stimulation whereas induction of DUSP5 mRNA by either corticosteroid was not. The suppression of glucocorticoid induction of DUSP1 may be a mechanism by which TNFa amplifies endothelial inflammatory responses.    COUP-TF-II is an orphan nuclear receptor that has essential roles in cardiovascular development and metabolic homeostasis. We investigated the effect of COUP-TF II on endothelial cell inflammatory responses. COUP-TFII mRNA expression is down-regulated by TNF alpha, while COUP-TFI is not affected. The down-regulation of COUP-TFII by TNF alpha is independent of MAPK pathways.  COUP-TFII silencing increases TNF alpha-induced IL-6 mRNA expression and decreases TNF alpha-induced E-selectin. COUP TF II may represent a novel therapeutic target in conditions characterized by endovascular injury and inflammation such as acute lung injury or septic shock.

"9353636","Bacteria that produce carbapenemases, such as the K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (blaKPC), are increasingly common multidrug resistant pathogens causing nosocomial infections and outbreaks, with high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Horizontal transfer of carbapenemase-producing plasmids is believed to play a significant role in the spread of multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae and other Gram-negative bacteria. Our experiments are aimed at defining the parameters regulating the spread of carbapenem resistance. Patients can be colonized by KPC+ K. pneumoniae for extended periods of time; however, only some of these patients have evidence of blaKPC containing plasmids transferring to bacteria other than Klebsiella species based on our extensive surveillance system. Understanding any differences between in vitro potential to spread and in vivo evidence of spread will aid our attempts to prevent dissemination of the resistance phenotype.  We found that investigators using in vitro models of conjugation should incorporate several parameters before drawing conclusions about a plasmids conjugative ability. Studies utilizing conjugation assays overwhelmingly use only a single assay condition. In vitro and in vivo studies of the same plasmid are often discrepant. Thus, we sought to use an even more accurate system, comparing in vitro data to in situ data, by using environmental and clinical epidemiology. Although this has been attempted previously, other studies typically use a single donor that is representative of an outbreak to a single recipient. In this study, we leverage four donor strains each with a unique molecular epidemiology, and leverage 16 patient isolate recipients not previously available for study. We generated a unique set of reagents through transformation into a plasmid-cured strain that allow for easy separation and testing of donor strain, plasmid, and recipient strain influences.  Our systematic analysis showed that conjugation is heavily context-specific, and is dependent on the donor, recipient, plasmid, and the environment.  The environment as a location for horizontal gene transfer has been examined and discussed, but the full extent and impact from this source of additional resistant strains is not yet known. We also sought to correlate our in vitro data to the epidemiology of blaKPC+ patients from two medical centers. We note that, surprisingly, in vitro conjugation efficiency does not correlate with observed promiscuous interspecies spread.  This is in contract to conclusion of some outbreak papers that suggest horizontal transfer may be of high efficiency between different species of Enterobacteriaceae. Next, we analyzed efficient and refractory recipients by single-molecule, real-time sequencing.

"9354070","The primary objective of this study remains the same: to link the capabilities of people with physical impairments to his or her ability to perform activities of daily living. Many of the methodologies remain the same as well, the core of which is 3D movement analysis. However, the assessment of impairments has been expanded to include assessments of muscle strength, spasticity and muscle size. Balance assessment has also been added.  The tasks to be examined have also expanded to include the use of exercise devices and clinical interventions such as electrical simulation as a functional orthoses to improve gait function. We have also reduced the age to birth to allow us to study infant muscles and motor abilities. Data are collected on both healthy volunteers and the target patient groups for some of the interventions.     We have collected gait data on different patient groups as well as healthy volunteers, specifically those with cerebral palsy, brachial plexus palsy and adults with dystonia.  One paper on muscle strength in individuals with brachial plexus palsy compared to age matched controls was published this year and we are working on another on arm kinematic differences during functional movements across groups."
"9354080","The dramatic increase in the use of interventional spine procedures and the rising health care costs over the past decade have raised lots of questions about the utilization and outcomes of treatments for back and neck pain. Several articles have addressed some concerning scenarios related to spinal surgeries and catastrophic adverse events after epidural steroid injections have been reported, related to steroid use.    The purpose of this study is to describe and characterize the treatment of back and neck pain, while examining temporal and geographical trends, physician specialty, and setting variations. We will characterize treatment trajectories in newly diagnosed back and neck pain patients, and identify efficient treatment paths and potential gateways to high cost and utilization. The characterization of patients treatment paths will include tracking of manual and percutaneous treatments, use of opioids, imaging utilization, surgical procedures, and safety events. We will examine the outcomes and adverse events following interventional spinal procedures by tracking patients for at least one year after their procedures.  Identifying efficient and safe treatment paths for back pain will lead to better guidelines for back pain management. A characterization of the outcomes and side effects of interventional spinal procedures will help patients and physicians make more informed decisions about treatment options.  Data  This project currently focuses on Medicare administrative health records for patients diagnosed with back pain between 2000-2013. A contract to access this data has been established between NIH and CMS.  Since the previous annual report, we have achieved the following:  Renewed our seat for access to a CMS virtual research data center (VRDC) that allows the analysis of CMS data in SAS, on CMS servers.   Produced preliminary results based on a subset of the data of interest and evaluated the feasibility of future work. Presented preliminary results at academic conferences and meetings.   Submitted a data addendum request to CMS, who approved the proposal.  Obtained access to CMS Carrier, Inpatient, Outpatient, and Part D files for the years 2000-2013 for almost 47 million patients with diagnoses of back pain.  Continued collaborations with academic partners.   Identified codes of diagnoses, procedures, drugs, complications, and outcomes relevant to our projects.  Additional data runs have been conducted on the updated dataset and cohort that focus on patient demographics and numbers of injections over the period under study. Differential complication rates by steroid type and injection approach are being examined.

"9354084","Traditional identification of molds is challenging, cumbersome, and time-consuming, relying on non-specific phenotypic characteristics from culture or expensive and specialized DNA sequencing methods. MALDI-TOF MS has revolutionized clinical microbiology laboratories worldwide, enabling rapid identification of bacteria and yeast. This technology, however, has not been readily applied to mold identification due to technical challenges in developing an efficient protein extraction method and the limited availability of clinically comprehensive databases.  Recently, we developed and optimized a simple protein extraction procedure for molds and constructed a highly stringent database comprising 410 individual isolates representing 90 genera and 220 species for the rapid identification of molds by MALDI-TOF MS. The NIH Mold Database is the most comprehensive database developed to date for mold identification and has filled a huge diagnostic gap in the field of clinical microbiology. The NIH Mold Database has now been shared with >100 clinical microbiology laboratories worldwide in an effort to improve the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections by providing faster identification (within 30 minutes of growth detection as opposed to weeks) that in turn can guide optimal antifungal therapy.  During this fiscal year, an eight-center national controlled study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical performance and accuracy of two fungal databases (the NIH Mold Database and the Bruker Fungi Database) against 80 clinical mold isolates. In addition, a collaborative project was undertaken with another US institution to investigate the effects of different culture conditions (media, time of incubation, solid vs. liquid media) against both fungal databases. Both studies are ongoing and it is envisaged that the findings will highlight important (previously undetermined) factors required for the uniform implementation of MALDI-TOF MS for the routine mold identification in clinical microbiology laboratories worldwide. This in turn will enable faster diagnosis and targeted therapeutic strategies for invasive fungal infections."

"9369159","The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) aims to reduce the risk, incidence, and deaths from cancer as well as enhance the quality of life through research in epidemiology, behavioral sciences, health services, surveillance, and cancer survivorship.  Cancer surveillance provides a quantitative portrait of cancer and its determinants in a defined population. The core functions of cancer surveillance are the measurement of cancer incidence, morbidity, survival, and mortality for persons with cancer. It also includes the assessment of genetic predisposition, environmental and behavioral risk factors, screening practices, and the quality of care from prevention through palliation. Cancer surveillance tells us where we are in the effort to reduce the cancer burden and also generates the observations that form the basis for cancer research and interventions for cancer prevention and control. This surveillance infrastructure benefits the public, policymakers, and scientists in understanding changes in cancer incidence and outcomes in all segments of the US population over time.    Surveillance Research Program (SRP) of the Division of Cancer Control and population Sciences at the National Cancer Institute provides national leadership in the science of cancer surveillance as well as analytical tools and methodological expertise in collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating reliable population-based cancer statistics. Surveillance Research Program is a home of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program - a system of population-based cancer registries that collects data on diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of cancer in approximately 30 percent of the U.S. population for public health reporting and to provide a national infrastructure to support cancer research. SEER Cancer registries report > 450,000 incident cases annually.   Data is collected by central cancer registries from a variety of facilities including hospitals, pathology laboratories, radiology facilities and doctors? offices.  Data is obtained electronically or in paper form or is collected by registry staff.  Data collected includes demographic information including age, sex and race/ethnicity; diagnostic information including date of diagnosis and stage at diagnosis; characteristics of the cancer including site, histology/morphology, size of tumor, grade and first course of treatment.  SRP produces and disseminates the following cancer statistics:  Incidence, Mortality, Prevalence, and Survival rates. Other geographically based information includes: Cancer Screening, Risk Factors, Demographics, and Cancer Knowledge. Most of these data are produced at the County and State levels of geography. The SEER Program is the only source of population based survival data in the US and produces statistics on cancer survival by stage at diagnosis.  Follow-up data, crucial for generating survival statistics, is obtained by both passive and active follow-up activities.   The SEER Program is known as the ?Gold Standard? for cancer data.  SEER central cancer registries submit a complete data file every November containing data on all cases reported by the registry during its participation in the SEER Program.  There are quality standards that are contractually required for each SEER registry.  Examination of data quality on a yearly basis, as well as feedback from registry staff, may reveal issues that require examination in order to maintain or enhance data quality.  Structured Quality Control and Quality Improvement (QC/QI) activities include but are not limited to case finding, recoding, reliability analysis, generation of Data Quality Profiles, and data correction.  QC/QI studies typically result in recommendations about the best sources of specific data items and recommendations on how to code specific data items. In addition, there are continual efforts to expand the data fields that are routinely collected and are available for cancer. More information about these activities can be found at: www.seer.cancer.gov.    In addition to quality control and quality improvement of cancer data, Surveillance Research Program provides optimal statistical methods for the collection, analysis, and presentation of essential measures related to the cancer control, surveillance, and epidemiology programs of the National Cancer Institute and the broader cancer control and research community http://seer.cancer.gov/statistics/summaries.html. These methods are pertinent to cancer outcomes, risk and behavioral factors, spatial and temporal factors, genetic factors, and health care delivery factors.   SRP has also been active in the development of geospatial and geo-statistical methods and tools for the development, analysis, dissemination, and visualization of geographically based cancer data, screening, and risk factors for cancer.  State Cancer Profiles http://seer.cancer.gov/statistics/scp.html , GIS Portal http://seer.cancer.gov/statistics/gis.html , and Small Area Estimates http://sae.cancer.gov/ are the most comprehensive geo-spatial and geo-statistical resources at NCI respectively. These resources are important for cancer control planning as well as population based cancer research.   Furthermore, SRP supports research on informatics technology to optimize and enhance the acquisition, storage, retrieval, de-identification, analyses, reporting, and visualization of cancer surveillance systems http://surveillance.cancer.gov/branches/sib/.   In SRP, maintaining extremely high quality data, methods, and tools for dissemination of cancer statistics is accomplished through recruitment of highly qualified registry staff and a broad spectrum of activities that are central to the technical requirements described below."

"9200967","Accession of Clinically Annotated Pathology Specimens for Molecular Marker Research - Large numbers of clinically annotated specimens are required for the evaluation of markers and assays for clinical decision-making, but it is generally not possible to anticipate the specific needs of the research community. It is very costly to set up specimen banks for all the different possible needs. The Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) seeks to test a peer-to-peer informatics system to locate and retrieve specimens and pertinent clinical and outcome data on an as needed (just-in-time) basis from community health care settings. A system exists that has been shown to work in an academic setting, but much larger numbers of specimens are housed in the community setting. In addition Health Maintenance Organizations generally have both inpatient and outpatient records, and this can provide more complete treatment and recurrence information than that contained in tumor registries. CDP is supporting a program to develop and test an open-source, peer-to-peer computer program to identify pathologic specimens and associated clinical and outcome data in clinic and hospital settings. This program will be tested in 2-3 sites selected by CDP from members of the Cancer Research Network (funded by the NCI), in sites showing good quality, archived pathologic specimens suitable for molecular marker studies; and to have computerized medical record systems that are linked to the specimens. This program will initially test and adapt their previously developed de-identification protocol at the local sites, evaluating its performance on ever larger numbers of cases. Test retrieval queries will be constructed to include the identification of specimens from pathology reports and linkage to local clinical and outcome databases. Successive queries will be increasingly complex, including as many such databases as possible. Evaluation of the query results will be by manual inspection of data and pathology blocks using study and local personnel as appropriate.  Tissue Microarrays - The Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) supports construction of statistically designed Tissue Microarrays (TMAs) using breast cancer tissue and clinical data. The TMAs will be used by breast cancer investigators to develop and validate prognostic and predictive diagnostic biomarkers. Archival, well annotated invasive breast carcinoma and DCIS pathology cases from the patient population in diverse geographic areas with 5-10 years of clinical follow data will be used for designing prognostic and progression TMAs with built in statistical significance. Clinical and outcome data fields associated with each case (patient) include: histological diagnosis, demographic data, extent of disease, treatment, follow-up, recurrence, survival and vital status. Each TMA requires several hundred breast cancer cases and needs to be selected from a much larger collection to avoid biases. Board certified pathologists need to select pathology blocks, cut slides from the blocks, perform QA/QC and mark the appropriate areas on the slides for coring and construction of the TMAs. Significant QA/QC also needs to be performed to assure that the clinical data associated with the specimens used in the TMAs is complete and accurate. The end results of this effort will be the delivery of quality assured tumor blocks with marked slides and complete and accurate data.  Calibration of the BCR-ABL Assay for CML - The Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) supports the development and evaluation of molecular diagnostics for clinical practice. Acceptance by clinicians of the BCR-ABL assay for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is limited by the lack of standardization among the American laboratories that perform the assay. The assay uses quantitative RT-PCR, and despite being performed in CLIA-certified laboratories, one laboratory's results cannot be directly compared to anothers. Currently many American laboratories perform this assay using different protocols and different control genes. There are no commonly used calibrators to standardize the assay. The CDP is supporting this project to assess whether use of a uniform RNA calibrator improves standardization of this assay. The study sites must have a CLIA-certified laboratory that routinely performs the BCR-ABL assay according to their CLIA certified laboratory procedures and protocols, and the NCI will provide specially prepared samples including some duplicates and will provide calibrators."

"9201077","The cBio web-based portal significantly lowers the barriers between complex genomic data and cancer researchers who want rapid, intuitive, and high-quality access to molecular profiles and clinical attributes from large-scale cancer genomics projects. The proposed work is built on the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal infrastructure supported by NCI for TCGA to enable all researchers to make discoveries and test hypotheses. The NCI already invested into development of a cBio portal for the data generated from 5 ?initial? TARGET projects. This contract will expand the scope of data at cBio by additional data types, additional TARGET projects as well as inclusion of a 2nd OCG initiative CGCI.  1. NCI supported the development of cBio for TARGET through a Leidos subcontract and this proposal will expand the data (projects as well as data types) that will be available for TARGET and CGCI projects which were recently initiated. It will be a very cost-effective use of the Institute?s investment that will facilitate the work of many other researchers  2. Integration of complex data types is difficult and so most R01 investigators have to rely on others to help them mine large genomic data sets. The users of cBio analytical methods find them very intuitive and thereby useful  3. The TARGET and CGCI initiatives do not have an alternative systematic approach to integrate the various data types to mine it for systems biology trends and results which can be applied to all the tumors being characterized. Therefore cBio will be a much needed tool."

"9201174","Public policies that affect alcohol consumption and related behaviors can influence a range of health and social outcomes. Advances in scientific research on the effects of various alcohol-related policies depend on well-measured indicators of these policies. Research in this important area has been constrained by limitations on the availability and quality of policy information. Initiatives to provide reliable information on public policies relating to alcohol must contend with the extraordinary complexity of alcohol policy in the United States. Laws, regulations, and jurisprudence address myriad aspects of alcoholic beverage production, packaging, transportation, marketing, taxation, sales, and consumption, as well as the financing and delivery of alcohol-related treatment and preventive services. Many of these policies are established by governments at all levels (Federal, State, county, and municipal). The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) developed the Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS) to provide authoritative, detailed, and comparable information on alcohol-related public policies in the United States at both the State and Federal levels. The APIS web site (http://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov) is an online resource that provides public access to this detailed information on a wide variety of alcohol-related public policies. Intended primarily as a tool for researchers, APIS features compilations and analyses of alcohol-related statutes and regulations. APIS is designed to simplify the process of ascertaining the state of the law for studies of the effects and effectiveness of alcohol-related policies."

"9354085","Traditional microbiological work up is slow and sometimes inaccurate, relying on phenotypic culture identification followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Newer technologies, such as matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and real-time molecular detection (antimicrobial resistance genes microarrays) have advanced the diagnostic capabilities of clinical microbiology laboratories and have created an exciting field for research and development. Given the in-depth and highly accurate (sometimes complex) results that are produced by such platforms, careful detailed analyses are required to better understand the clinical significance of the organisms identified and the resistance mechanisms detected.  During this fiscal year, we have undertaken a multi-center collaborative study to investigate the role of Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and to evaluate the performance of two different MALDI-TOF MS systems for the identification of microorganisms to the subspecies level. We are also investigating the performance of a novel real-time PCR assay for the detection of four major carbapenmase genes direct from primary specimens, in parallel with selective culture. Methods to accurately detect extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and vancomycin resistant Enterococci (VREs) from surveillance specimens are also being evaluated in an effort to remove patients from unnecessary and costly infection control precautions, as well as improving the diagnostic specificity for microbiology laboratories. Finally, evaluation of rapid phenotypic methods to detect beta-lactamases from culture and the development of new approaches to detect these enzymes from primary specimens is underway."
"9354087","With the exception of the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, little is known about predictors of imatinib response in clinically-defined hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). In this study, we have stratified HES patients according to their FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutational status and criteria suggestive of a myeloid neoplasm. The peripheral blood and bone marrow specimens were evaluated for dysplastic eosinophils on peripheral smear (abnormal nuclear lobation, uneven granulation, hypogranulation, agranulation), serum B12 level 1000 pg/ml, serum tryptase level 12 ng/mL, anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, bone marrow cellularity >80% with left shift in maturation, dysplastic (spindle-shaped) mast cells on bone marrow biopsy, evidence of reticulin brosis 2+ on bone marrow biopsy, and dysplastic megakaryocytes on bone marrow biopsy. Subjects with FIP1L1-PDGFRA-myeloid neoplasm (FP; n =12), PDGFRA-negative HES with 4 criteria suggestive of a myeloid neoplasm (MHES; n =10), or steroid-refractory PDGFRA-negative HES with <4 myeloid criteria (SR; n = 5) were enrolled in a prospective study of imatinib therapy. The primary outcome was an eosinophil count <1.5  109/L at one month and improvement of clinical symptoms. Clinical, molecular, and bone marrow responses to imatinib were assessed. In addition, a retrospective cohort of 18 subjects with clinically-defined HES who received imatinib (300-400 mg daily  1 month) were classified according to the criteria used in the prospective study. Overall results showed that imatinib response rates were 100% in the FP group (n = 16), 54% in the MHES group (n = 13) and 0% in the SR group (n = 16). The presence of  4 myeloid features was the sole predictor of response. After  18 months in complete remission, imatinib was tapered and discontinued in 8 FP and 1 MHES subjects. Seven subjects (6 FP, 1 MHES) remained in remission off therapy for a median of 29 months (range 14-36). In conclusion, clinical features of MHES predict imatinib response in PDGFRA-negative HES."
"9354089","Rapid molecular methods for the strain-level identification and tracking of drug-resistant bacteria are essential to the diagnosis and treatment of infectious disease and to hospital infection control strategy. Our work aims to develop novel applications of mass spectrometry to these problems in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Our approach involves both the identification and characterization of new bacterial protein markers and development of mass spectrometry-based assays to detect there markers using LC-MS/MS, Q-TOF, QQQ, MALDI-TOF and MRM technologies. Previously published work involved identification of a peptide marker for tracking a carbapenemase-carrying resistance plasmid that could be detected by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Lau et al, 2014), followed by a clinical validation study demonstrating the method's utility in identifying KPC carbapenemase proteins in clinical isolates from NIH Clinical Center patients (Youn et al, 2016).   Work done during the current fiscal year in collaboration with Anthony Suffredini's group in CCMD, NIHCC included the development of a genoproteomics approach for identifying strain-specific peptide markers based on LC-MS/MS profiling of digested peptides (Wang et al, 2016). This work provides a general method for bacterial strain typing by mass spectrometry using an in silico computational approach to guide selection of informative, genome-specific tryptic peptides from LC-MS/MS experimental profiles. The method is generalizable to other bacterial species, and the peptides may be useful for rapid mass spectrometry strain tracking of isolates with broad application to infectious disease diagnosis. Work is in progress to apply this approach to the direct detection of bacteria in primary specimen matrices."
"9354092","In collaboration with Dr. Landgren's group, we have investigated proteasome changes in neoplastic plasma cells from bone marrows of multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Some of the hallmarks of cancer, such as rapid growth and aneuploidy, can result in non-oncogene addiction to the proteostasis network that can be exploited clinically. The defining example is the exquisite sensitivity of MM to 20S proteasome inhibitors, such as carfilzomib. However, MM patients invariably acquire resistance to these drugs. The mechanism is not well understood. We have devised a novel flow cytometric assay to monitor proteasome subunit (19S and 20S) levels pre and post carfilzomib therapy. Surprisingly, we have discovered paradoxical resistance of multiple myeloma to proteasome inhibitors by decreased levels of 19S proteasomal subunits. In MM patients, lower 19S levels predicted a diminished response to carfilzomib-based therapies while 20S levels had no predictive effect. To further understand this finding, we collaborated with Dr. Kampmann group from UCSF, who utilized a next-generation shRNA platform to show that different proteostasis factors, including chaperones and stress-response regulators, controll the response to carfilzomib. In in vitro experiments, 19S proteasome regulator knockdown induced resistance to carfilzomib in MM and non-MM cells. 19S subunit knockdown did not affect the activity of the 20S subunits targeted by carfilzomib nor their inhibition by the drug, suggesting an alternative mechanism, such as the selective accumulation of protective factors.  Together, our findings suggest that an understanding of network rewiring can inform development of new combination therapies to overcome drug resistance.  In a separate study, we have described a previously unrecognized disease entity that we have named Monoclonal gammopathy-associated pure red cell aplasia. Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare disorder characterized by absence of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow and severe normochromic, normocytic anaemia with reticulocytopenia. The cause of red cell aplasia is unknown in a subset of patients who are labeled idiopathic PRCA. We studied bone marrow changes in idiopathic PRCA patients and discovered that among 51 patients, 12 (24%) patients had increased clonal plasma cells and fulfilled criteria for either monoclonal gammopathy, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smouldering multiple myeloma, with presence of monoclonal protein or abnormal serum free light chains. The marrow biopsies showed atypical bone marrow features including hypercellularity, fibrosis and clonal plasmacytosis. Three of these patients have been treated so far with anti-myeloma based therapeutics and responded with reticulocyte recovery and clinical transfusion independence, suggesting plasma cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of this specific monoclonal gammopathy-associated PRCA.   The incidence and importance of bone marrow involvement and/or early bone lesions in multiple myeloma (MM) precursor diseases is largely unknown. We have conducted a study to prospectively compare the sensitivity of several imaging modalities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) and MM and compare to bone marrow morphological findings. Thirty patients (10 each with MGUS, SMM and MM) were evaluated with skeletal survey, 18FFDG-PET/CT, 18FNaF-PET/CT and morphologic dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI. An additional 16 SMM patients had skeletal surveys and FDG-PET/CT. Among MGUS patients diagnosed based on the WHO criteria, DCE-MRI found only one focal marrow abnormality; other evaluations were negative. Among 26 SMM patients, five (19%) were re-classified as MM based on lytic bone lesions on CT and six had unifocal or diffuse marrow abnormality. Among MM, marrow abnormalities were observed on FDG-PET/CT in 8/10 patients and on DCE-MRI in nine evaluable patients. Abnormal NaF uptake was observed only in MM patients with lytic lesions on CT, providing no additional clinical information.  In collaboration with Dr. Wiestner's group, we have investigated chronic lymphocytic leukemia tumor-microenvironment interactions in patients treated with Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells depend on microenvironmental interactions for proliferation and survival that are at least partially mediated through B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, disrupts BCR signaling and leads to the egress of tumor cells from the microenvironment. Although the on-target effects on CLL cells are well defined, the impact on the microenvironment is less well studied. We therefore sought to characterize the effects of ibrutinib on the tumor microenvironment. Patients received single-agent ibrutinib on an investigator-initiated phase II trial. Serial blood and tissue samples were collected pretreatment and during treatment. Changes in cytokine levels, cellular subsets, and microenvironmental interactions were assessed. Serum levels of key chemokines and inflammatory cytokines decreased significantly in patients on ibrutinib. Furthermore, ibrutinib treatment decreased circulating tumor cells and overall T-cell numbers. Most notably, a reduced frequency of the Th17 subset of CD4(+)T cells was observed concurrent with reduced expression of activation markers and PD-1 on T cells. Consistent with direct inhibition of T cells, ibrutinib inhibited Th17 differentiation of murine CD4(+)T cells in vitro. Finally, in the bone marrow microenvironment, we found that ibrutinib disaggregated the interactions of macrophages and CLL cells, inhibited secretion of CXCL13, and decreased the chemoattraction of CLL cells. We conclude that in conjunction with inhibition of BCR signaling, these changes in the tumor microenvironment likely contribute to the antitumor activity of ibrutinib and may impact the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies in patients with CLL."

"9356693","ABSTRACT. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) targeting of cancer is limited by slow blood clearance resulting in unwanted prolonged exposure of normal tissues to radioactive agents. Pre-targeted radioimmunotherapy or PRIT using bispecific agents has been shown to be superior over traditional direct conjugation in target-tonormal organ ratios. While the clinical potential for pretargeted therapy with bispecific agent formats is clear, progress has been hindered because they are often difficult to manufacture. Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc.is teaming up with Abzyme Therapeutics LLC and the Department of Radiology, University of Pittsburgh to develop bispecific nanobodies that can be used in both cancer diagnosis and pretargeted radioimmunotherapy. In phase I, bispecific recombinant nanobodies with one arm targeting cancer biomarker HER2 and another arm against Digoxigenin will be developed. Properties of the bispecific nanobody, including in vivo clearance, tumor accumulation, in-vivo stability and bioavailability and its ability to capture digoxigenylated fluorescence dyes and radionuclides will be investigated. In the Phase II, selected bispecific nanobodies will be produced in a large scale. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, immunogenic and toxicological characteristics of agents will be investigated in pre-targeted radioimmunotherapy using animal models to obtain data necessary for filing an Investigational New Drug application"
"9356736","The need to develop an effective method for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis is urgent.  even with identification of cancer DNA biomarkers, The low concentration and fragmentation of cfDNA presents a formidable challenge to the translation of DNA markers to clinic.  JBS Science Inc. has developed innovative solutions to these challenges by: (1) development of sensitive short-amplicon PCR assays, suitable for cfDNA, and (2) use of urine as the source for cfDNA that provides a high volume.  JBS innovations are suitable for developing cfDNA-based assays in general.  HCC is our first application.  We have developed the cfDNA-based assays for three validated HCC markers, TP53, CTNNB1, and TERT mutations.  The Phase I is to standardize assay parameters and specimen selection (urine or plasma), culminating in a standard operating procedure (SOP) with an analytic sensitivity of 10 copies with a specificity of 1:1000, a linearity of 4 logs, and a co-efficiency of variation (reproducibility) of 0.99-1.0, and to demonstrate at least 80% sensitivity for HCC.  In Phase II, we will deliver a CLIA-dertified cfDNA-based test that can be finished in one day for HCC diagnosis, so that 30% more HCC can be detected early to improve prognosis."
"9356879","Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Once diagnosed, the therapeutic options are far from optimal, particularly at late stages. Hence, early detection interventions have received great attention in recent years. The need for (1) effective chemopreventive interventions and (2) noninvasive methods of determining individual risk and measuring chemopreventive efficacy (biomarkers) are critical components of our efforts to reduce lung cancer mortality. This Task Order addresses these two issues.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (19-30 nucleotides in length) non-coding RNA molecules that inhibit gene expression by binding complementary regions of mRNA and inhibiting translation or causing degradation of the template mRNA. In this way, a single miRNA can repress expression from multiple genes that share sequences sufficiently complementary to the miRNA. While miRNA is a normal mechanism of gene regulation, aberrant miRNA expression is seen in malignant cells and in association with tumor progression. Several miRNAs (miR-21, miR-31, miR-130a, miR-146b, miR-377) were consistently upregulated and miR-1 and miR-143 were downregulated in chemically induced mouse lung tumors, supporting the use of miRNA signatures in tumor tissue from lung as biomarkers that could be used to establish risk of lung cancer, prognosis of existing lung cancer, and as putative surrogates of chemopreventive efficacy.   Exosomes are small (30-100 nm) membrane vesicles of endocytic origin that are released into the extracellular environment through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Exosomes, which are released from cells, including tumor cells, contain a variety of molecules, including mRNA and miRNA. Tumor-derived exosomes are detectable in the serum and plasma of cancer patients. The circulating levels of such exosomes as well as tumor-derived exosomal miRNA expression signatures differ between lung cancer patients and controls and may serve as noninvasive cancer diagnostic and prognostic markers. These circulating exosomal miRNA signatures might also serve as surrogate biomarkers of chemopreventive agent efficacy.   Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH)/Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) in sequence can be used to identify specific amplifications and deletions in lung tumor tissue. First, CGH is applied to discovery of chromosomal abnormalities that are characteristic of given tumor types, as for example lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Once repeatedly occurring chromosomal abnormalities are identified by CGH, FISH probe analysis of these amplifications and deletions in test tumor samples can be implemented. FISH labeling of specific chromosomal amplifications and deletions can serve as surrogate biomarkers of response to chemopreventive agents in material from bronchial washings in SCC-LC."

"9357185","The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a novel assay for mimicking the tumor microenvironment. Our proposed assay will accurately model the tumor microenvironment encompassing (a) circulation in the vessels, (b) transport across vessel walls, and (c) tumors cultured in a 3-dimensional environment. In Phase I, we successfully demonstrated our platform, including multi-cellular culture and drug screening. Detailed characterization of tumor cell growth, viability, migration and invasiveness was performed. Drug screening studies were performed to model the therapeutic responses. Quantitative differences between the tumor microenvironment parameters were demonstrated. In Phase II, assay parameters will be optimized to capture in vivo conditions including diffusion gradients, heterogeneity, and multi-cellular architecture. Assays for tumor progression and metastasis for organ specific tumors will be developed. The in vitro model will be validated against in vivo studies as well as available clinical data. The platform will be demonstrated for patient-derived samples. A multi-disciplinary approach comprising of industry-academic clinical team with substantial expertise in all facets of the proposed study has been assembled for successful execution. The developed product will be commercialized to pharmaceutical/biotech companies, research labs, universities and non-profit organizations."

"9357195","Improved viral screening assays and more intensive questioning of donors for high-risk behaviors have resulted in dramatic declines in the rates of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis and AIDS. Nonetheless, there is need for continued vigilance of the safety of blood supply. This study aims to enroll blood donors and prospectively followed blood recipients in order to establish active surveillance for a multiplicity of potential blood transmitted infectious agents and establish a repository of linked donor and recipient samples so that newly emerging infectious agent can be rapidly evaluated for their threat to the blood supply.    This study has thus far enrolled 1605 patients; 1005 from NIH and Suburban Hospital and 600 from Children's National Medical Center. We have complete serial sampling on 1028 (64%) patients and partial sampling on 176(11.0%) patients. 332(20.7%) patients have either died, or were lost to follow up and 69 patients are in active follow up. For the 2104 patients with at least partial sampling, there have been approximately 6000 blood exposures.  There has been no transmission of HCV, HBV, HIV or HTLV observed. There has been one definite transfusion-related transmission of parvovirus-B-19. Using unlinked donor samples we have  found the prevalence of antibody to EBV to be 88% for anti-EBVCA IgG, 47% for anti-EBVNA and 0% for anti-EBVCA IgM; the prevalence of anti-CMV IgG is 44% and is 2% for anti-CMV IgM. We have tested 500 donors for anti-HHV-8 against two HHV-8 epitopes. The average seroprevalence of anti-HHV-8 is approximately 15%. Using an unlicensed but well-validated EIA, the prevalence of antibody to the hepatitis E virus was 21.8% in 916 donor samples obtained in 2006, but fell to 16% in 1023 donor samples obtained in 2012. Only 0.4% of samples were positive for IgM anti-HEV in both time periods and none of the antibody positive samples were HEV RNA positive. In a prospective follow-up of 362 blood recipients, no HEV transmissions have been observed.    We continue to investigate the transfusion risk of CMV, HHV-8, HBV, HCV and HIV by molecular techniques. We found that 47(4.7%)of 1000 recipients tested HHV-8 DNA positive in their post-transfusion sample,but most were also positive in their pretransfusion sample; hence there were only 6(0.6%)molecular conversions and based on pre-transfusion serology, only one possible new HHV-8 infection that could not be confirmed subsequently. Similarly, there were 34(3.5%) molecular conversions for CMV DNA, but based on the presence of pre-transfusion antibody, all of these appeared to be CMV reactivations rather than new infections. Among 924 recipeints analyzed for parvo-virus B-19, there was one molecular conversion (0.1%)that represented one transfusion transmitted infection proven by phylogenetic analysis of the virus in both donor and recipient. This represents one of only four other documented cases of B19 virus transmission by single-donor blood components and the case was published in the journal Transfusion.  Thus far, the proportion of patients that develop new infections post-transfusion is small although reacttivation of CMV infection is relatively common. Also, even a single observed case, as for Parvo B-19, when extrapolated to the 15 million blood products transfused per year in the U.S., potentially represents thousands of transmissions nationwide. As expected, there were no identified transmissions of HBV, HCV or HIV. In light of epidemics of dengue, zika virus and chikungunya virus in South America and the Caribbean, we have begun a surveillance of blood donors who travelled to these areas and will closely follow any that test positive for these agents. We are also developing methods to test for all three agents simultaneously.       We have completed a study assessing the transfusion risk of the hepatitis E virus (HEV). This agent, previously  thought to cause only acute resolving hepatitis and  to be rare in industrialized countries, has now been shown to sometimes result in chronic liver disease and isolated cases of blood transmission have been reported in industrialized nations. Our testing of blood transfusion recipients revealed 2/362 (0.06%) possible antibody seroconversions.  Neither recipient was found  to be HEV RNA positive at any time point in the study.  Further investigation of linked donor samples, found that in one case, antibody positivity was caused by passive transfer of IgG from a donated unit with high titer anti-HEV. Overall, this study did not find any cases of transfusion-transmitted HEV infection despite the high prevalence of anti-HEV antibody in the donor population. These findings were  published in the journal Transfusion in October, 2013. We have completed our study of transfusion-associated microchimerism (TA-MC) in this TRIPS cohort and have now tested 431 adult and pediatric female blood product recipients for persistence of donor leukocytes as determine by detection of Y chromosome. We evaluated persistence of TA-MC in a non-trauma setting where all blood is leukoreduced and at least half the blood is irradiated.  Of the 431 recipients tested, 14.3% (12/84;5 adults and 7 children), demonstrated very low-level, but reproducible MC.  However, development of persistent high-level MC was not demonstrated in any of 431 adult and pediatric blood recipients.  The risk of TA-MC appears dependent on the clinical setting, being rare in routine transfusion and high in patients sustaining severe trauma.  The preliminary data was presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) and was published in the journal Transfusion, October 2011.    In addition, we collaborated with Dr. Philip J. Norris from Blood Systems Research Institute (BSRI) in San Francisco, California to evaluate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmunization in recipients of leukoreduced (LR) and non-leukoreduced (non-LR) blood using newer, more sensitive antibody detection assays.  Pre-transfusion and serial post-transfusion (4, 8, 12, & 24 wk) samples from 20 TRIPS recipients of LR blood were tested and compared to 29 recipients of non-LR blood provided by the Transfusion-Transmitted Viruses Study (TTVS).  A substantial proportion of subjects possessed pre-transfusion HLA Abs in both cohorts studied (20 of 29 in TTVS, 8 of 20 in TRIPS).  Applying a sensitive HLA Ab test revealed high levels of baseline alloimmunization in the TTVS and TRIPS cohorts and frequent alloimmunization even in recipients of LR blood.  An abstract detailing the results from this study was presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the AABB and a manuscript has been published in the journal Transfusion, June 2013."
"9357341","Prostate cancer health disparities studies have shown that African-American (AA) men are at higher risk for developing prostate cancer, as well as at higher risk of cancer specific death rates as compared to Caucasian American (CA) men. The causes of disparities have been attributed to socioeconomic differences, environmental exposures and biological factors. Most disparities studies have been population based, in part, due to the lack of relevant in vitro and in vivo models to support biological studies. In this Phase I proposal, we will develop an annotated AA prostate epithelial cancer cell line with donor matched normal prostate epithelial cells and bio-banked reference prostate tissues. To support the feasibility of establishing 50 prostate cancer cell lines from AA men in a subsequent Phase II application, we will prepare written protocols for tissue collection, processing, establishment of conditionally reprogrammed cells and the reagents necessary for performing studies with these cells. We will determine the commercial feasibility for cell distribution and reagent marketing through a private-public partnership."

"9358809","Checkpoint inhibitors yield a significant clinical benefit for a subset of cancer patients. Given the high cost of these therapies and the time required to determine whether a therapy is efficacious, tests that can identify patients who are most likely to benefit are urgently needed. Supported by a strong biological rationale, tumor mutational load has emerged as a robust determinant of clinical benefit for multiple checkpoint inhibitors in multiple cancer types. However, existing approaches for assessment of tumor mutational load are expensive and rely on tumor specimens that are not readily available or may yield insufficient material for mutational load analyses. Therefore, Personal Genome Diagnostics proposes to develop MutatorDetect, a non-invasive, cost effective method that can accurately identify late stage cancer patients whose tumors have high mutational load, regardless of the availability of tumor specimens. The specific aims include the design, development, preliminary analytical/clinical validation of MutatorDetect. If successful, MutatorDetect can accurately assess the mutational load of tumors non-invasively. Further studies are warranted to examine MutatorDetect for its clinical validity in large cohorts of late stage cancer patients to evaluate its predictive value for identification of patients that are likely to respond to checkpoint inhibitors."

"9360898","Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women in the United States. Approximately 1/3 of BCs are ER-negative (ERneg) and among these approximately 30,000 diagnoses of triple negative (TN: ER-negative, PR-negative, Her2-negative) BCs are made per year in the U.S.  Although ~50% of ER-positive (ERpos) BCs can be prevented by anti-estrogenic agents belonging to two classes: selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs), no drugs have been shown to prevent ERneg cancers, including TN BCs.   The need for such agents is evident in the more aggressive behavior of TN BCs, which grow faster, spread earlier and recur more often than other subtypes.  Furthermore, the incidence of TN BCs is higher in young African American and Hispanic/Latina women and in women with BRCA1 mutations.  Development of agents targeting non-ER-based oncogenic pathways offers a potential alternative approach for prevention of ERneg/TN BCs.  The drug HJC0152 targets glucose metabolism and associated energy production. The relevance of this mechanism to carcinogenesis was first described by Otto Warburg in the 1920s.  The ?Warburg effect? refers to the dysregulated energy metabolism in cancer cells, including BC cells, which exhibit increased glycolysis, with rates up to 200 times higher than in comparable normal cells.  Etiologically this increased glycolysis may be related to abnormalities of glucose transport or breakdown, aberrant glycolytic enzymes, or malfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.   In particular, BC stem cells depend on aberrant glycolysis and are sensitive to inhibition of glucose metabolism.  In contrast to normal cells which further catalyze the product of glycolysis, pyruvate, into carbon dioxide and water via the Krebs cycle (tricarboxylic acid/TCA cycle) and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to efficiently produce ATPs, aberrant glucose metabolism in cancer cells, involving upregulated glycolysis, results in increased cell growth and malignant transformation.   Although such metabolic remodeling is being studied in various cancer cell types, the role played by aberrant glucose metabolism and the mitochondrial respiratory chain in ERneg/TN BC carcinogenesis, particularly for the purpose of cancer prevention, has not been adequately explored.  Various anti-cancer therapies that target glycolysis and energy metabolism are being studied, but potency, specificity and toxicity have posed challenges to drug development.  None is approved for cancer prevention.  A newly developed group of glucose/energy metabolism modulators show promise for prevention.  Among these, HJC0152 gains support as a preventive agent for ERneg and TN BC from ERneg BC mouse model studies.  In MMTV-erbB2 transgenic mice studies, HJC0152 blocked mammary tumor development by 84-100% and reduced and reversed premalignant lesions.  This agent also inhibited glycolysis, differentially regulated glycolytic enzyme expression and the function of mitochondrial respiratory complexes in ERpos and TN BC cells.  A number of glycolytic enzymes are significantly induced after HJC0152 treatment.  HJC0152 also inhibits mitochondrial complexes IV and V (ATP synthase). Other mechanistic actions of HJC0152 also potentially contribute to its anti-cancer activity.  As a derivative of niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-tapeworm drug which inhibits activation of the pro-proliferative signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) pathway, HJC0152 likely also acts through this additional mechanism. Another target of niclosamide is the Wnt signaling pathway, also known to play a key role in carcinogenesis. As with its parent molecule, HC0152 potentially exerts anti-cancer effects via inhibition of the Wnt pathway.  Additional mechanisms of niclosamide action, meriting examination following HC0152 intervention, include inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-?B) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways.  Long-term administration of this agent shows that it has low toxicity, supporting its investigation for prevention of ERneg/TN mammary cancer."

"9364741","The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a Working Group (WG), in Bethesda, Maryland, to discuss Cardiovascular Diseases in the Inmate and Released Prison Population.  Background The large size of the prison population in the United States and the fact that many prisoners are at a health disadvantage even before they enter prison as a result of their social and economic circumstances make the health of this population an important priority for health care and public health systems.  Conditions specific to prisons may also increase risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a range of other diseases and conditions.  Although there has been some research on the health of incarcerated populations, the focus on chronic diseases, and in particular CVD, has been limited.  In addition, the prison population is at highest risk of adverse health outcome during times of transition from prison to the general population.   Data collected in our national databases help to develop public health policy and direct health programs and services in the U.S. (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , 2016).  However, the estimate of true prevalence of diseases in the U.S. is limited, since health information about prisoners is excluded from these national databases. Inaccurate representation of disease prevalence in both civilian and non-civilian populations may adversely affect funding, especially if decisions are based on an underrepresentation of the true need.  This has important implications for communities and the public healthcare system, since nearly 95% of prisoners are eventually released back to communities at a rate of 700,000 annually.  A disproportionately high number of prisoners suffer from infectious diseases, chronic diseases (including asthma, diabetes, and hypertension), and mental illness compared with the rest of the nation?s population (Gostin, 2007).  In addition, the U.S. prison population is older than the overall U.S. population, and their release will have an impact on health care resources in communities faced with integrating a growing number of older, former inmates (Williams, et al, 2012)."

"9365080","Over the last two decades world events have highlighted the growing threat of terrorism and its many forms that include radiological/nuclear weapons. Acts of radiological or nuclear terrorism could involve the use of stolen or improvised nuclear devices, attacks on nuclear power plants or reactors, the detonation of a dirty bomb, or the placement of radiation sources in public locations or in food or water supplies. Moreover, natural disasters like the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan further emphasize the need for methods to assess radiation exposure of individuals and stockpile medical countermeasures (MCMs) to administer in the event of a radiation incident. Because estimates of radiation exposure dose alone will not necessarily predict the extent of radiation injury to organs and tissues, there is a need for rapid, accurate and sensitive assays/techniques and diagnostic platforms that can confirm exposure and predict acute and delayed radiation injury to different organs and tissues in victims of radiation incidents."

"9365917","Cardiotoxicity is increasingly recognized as a significant challenge to many existing therapies and as a potential barrier to the development of new therapies.  For example, despite improved survival from cancer, chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity has emerged as a significant problem.  Cardiovascular complication, particularly heart failure, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors.  In small studies, cardioprotective strategies against cancer therapy-induced cardiac dysfunction are effective if implemented early at the subclinical phase.  However, detection of the frequency of subclinical disease and subsequent ability to protect against further functional decline are limited by inadequacy of current technologies to accurately assess and monitor changes in cardiac structure and function.  Novel non-invasive strategies that detect early subclinical changes in cardiac structure, function, and/or tissue are needed to improve detection and monitoring of cardiac injury in order to improve cardioprotection and effectiveness of cancer therapeutics or other toxic exposure.  Studies that demonstrate increased sensitivity and precision of existing or enhanced imaging technologies with respect to normal and altered cardiac structure, function, energetics, and metabolism are sought.  Pre-clinical or patient studies using molecular changes or biomarkers to enhance early detection of cardiac derangements are also responsive."

"9339112","Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) has become one of the most important therapies of clinical medicine in the modern era. RBC transfusion can be life-saving in some situations, such as massive blood loss due to trauma or during surgery. The development of RBCs storage has resulted in the transfusion of more than 15 million units of RBCs every year in the United States. The FDA requires that at least 75% of the cells remain in the circulation 24h after infusion and hemolysis be less than 1% at the end of the approved storage period. According to this standard, most RBCs can be stored for up to 6 weeks after filtration leukoreduction in plastic bags made of polyvinyl chloride. The current 6-week RBCs storage period has worked well, with 92% of all RBC units finding a recipient before expiration. Though 6 week old blood meets the current FDA criteria, it is not clear whether this old blood is as safe and effective as blood stored for shorter durations. Stored blood has been shown to result in storage lesions including metabolic effects, shape change, membrane loss, rheologic changes, losses of membrane carbohydrates, oxidative injury to lipids and proteins, changes in oxygen affinity and delivery, increased adhesion of RBCs to endothelial cells, and reduced RBC lifespan as well as the secondary risks of accumulating concentrations of potassium, shedding of active proteins, lipids and microvesicles, and bacterial contaminants. Though in a healthy individual it is not expected (though not clear) that these changes will have a detrimental effect, it has been shown in a study of cardiac surgery patients, all of which had at least one underlying pathology, that older blood (>14 days) resulted in a higher mortality and postoperative complications than fresher blood (<14 days). Despite increasing evidence in laboratory and clinical data demonstrating the deleterious effects of older blood, the conclusions drawn from these studies have been limited by design, ie, retrospective study data or have had confounding factors such as differences in transfusion volume, blood type, or patient history.  Thus, we intend to use a canine model of acute blood loss to determine if there is a deleterious effect associated with transfusing old blood compared to fresh blood. This study determined that removing 65% total blood volume for 2.5 h to simulate massive blood loss and a gap until treatment shows a differential survival effect between transfusion with old vs. fresh blood.

"9339121","Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) have shown significant promise in the treatment of disease, but their therapeutic efficacy is often limited by inefficient homing of systemically administered cells, which results in low number of cells accumulating at sites of pathology. BMSC home to areas of inflammation where local expression of cell adhesion molecules and chemokine gradients are present. Pulsed focused ultrasound (pFUS) employs non-continuous exposures, that lower the rate of energy deposition and allow cooling to occur between pulses, thereby minimizing thermal effects and emphasizing the effects created by non-thermal mechanisms of FUS (i.e. acoustic radiation forces and acoustic cavitation). We examined changes in muscle and kidney following pFUS has little effect on the histological integrity of the tissue and does not induce cell death. pFUS increased expression of several chemoattractants creating a transient molecular zip code on days 0 and 1 following pFUS that returns to baseline levels by day 3 post-pFUS. pFUS exposures induced up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules on muscle vasculature. The observed molecular changes in muscle following pFUS may be utilized to target cellular therapies, by increasing homing to areas of pathology.  We induce a mechanotransductive response that initiates a largely an anti-inflammatory M2-type macrophage environment. We demonstrated local upregulation of chemoattractants in pFUS-treated skeletal muscle and kidney leads to enhance homing, permeability, and retention of BMSC or human endothelial precursor cells (EPC). Furthermore, the magnitude of BMSC or EPC homing was increased when pFUS treatments and cell infusions were repeated daily in muscle. We also demonstrate that the induced molecular changes following pFUS to muscle and kidney can be block by ibuprofen, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, or TNF alpha receptor binding protein, etanercept, indicating that the mechanotransductive effects are acting through a NFkB and COX 2 pathway in the tissue.  Both ibuprofen or etanercept administered prior to pFUS and stem cell infusion block the homing of stem cells to targeted muscle which indicated that using this approach we can use pFUS to interrogate drug-host tissue interactions and their effect on homing.  We also demonstrated that pFUS exposures in combination with BMSC in an acute kidney injury model induce mechanotransductive effects in the murine kidney (AKI). To examine the efficacy of pFUS-enhanced cell homing in disease, we targeted pFUS to kidneys to enhance BMSC homing after cisplatin-induced AKI. We found that pFUS enhanced BMSC homing at 1 day post-cisplatin, prior to renal functional deficits, and that enhanced homing improved outcomes of renal function, tubular cell death, and regeneration at 5 days post-cisplatin compared to BMSCs alone. After observing improved homing and AKI outcomes during early AKI, we investigated whether pFUS+BMSC therapy could rescue established AKI. BMSC administration alone at 3 days post-cisplatin, after renal functional deficits become obvious, significantly improved 7-day survival of animals. Survival was further improved using pFUS+BMSC. BMSCs, alone or with pFUS, shifted the kidney macrophage phenotype from M1 to M2. This study shows that pFUS serves as a neoadjuvant treatment to improve MSC homing to diseased organs. We have also shown that pFUS increases interferon gamma in tissue that augments the local potency of the infused BMSC that home to the tissue.  pFUS coupled with BMSCs enhances cellular therapy to prevent AKI and allows rescue therapy in established AKI, which currently has no meaningful therapeutic options. We also have similar results in critical limb ischemia model in which we have been able to demonstrate that the combination of pFUS+BMSC resulted in greater reperfusion of the ischemic limb compared to animal receiving pFUS or BMSC alone.  Evaluation of the tissue demonstrated pFUS pretreatment followed by BMSC infusion of the ischemic muscle increased the amount of human vascular endothelia growth factor and interleukin 10 present in the microenvironment compared to animals only receiving BMSC injections.  These results indicate that pFUS preconditions the tissues that results in increased potency of the BMSC that homed to targeted tissues and has important implication for translation to clinical trials."
"9340945","To try to develop highly sensitive, non-invasive diagnostic methods, we have been evaluating polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers based on the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) genes of human Pneumocystis.  PCR using primers based on this gene is potentially a highly sensitive method since this is a multicopy gene (estimated at approximately equal to 50-100 copies/genome).  We have been evaluating the diagnostic potential using a conserved region of the gene family.  Our studies have shown that the sensitivity of MSG-based primers is greater than that of previously utilized primers.  As part of our collaboration with investigators at UCSF and Makerere University, we have been able to demonstrate that Pneumocystis is uncommon in HIV-infected patients in Uganda, which may be in part a result of the widespread use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis in Uganda.  We have developed and evaluated two typing techniques for human Pneumocystis.  The first uses tandem repeats that occur in an intron of the MSG gene.  By sequencing multiple MSG genes in a number of human Pneumocystis isolates, we have been able to demonstrate that recombination occurs in human Pneumocystis.  These results led to studies that demonstrated that the MSG repertoire in human Pneumocystis is very diverse, while the MSG repertoire in rat and mouse Pneumocystis is identical or very limited among different isolates.  Based on these studies, we have developed a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing assay for human Pneumocystis, and have been able to demonstrate substantial diversity among human isolates.  Using RFLP analysis, we have been able to demonstrate that all the isolates from an outbreak of PCP in renal transplant patients in Germany appear to be the same strain, indicating that recent infection is important, and that either host- to-host transmission has occurred or that all individuals ere infected from a common source.  We subsequently showed that the same isolate was responsible for an outbreak of PCP in renal transplant patients in Zurich, Switzerland, raising the possibility that this strain may be particularly virulent in renal transplant patients.  To address this further, we examined samples from an outbreak of PCP in Japan.  We found that while a single organism was responsible for the outbreak there as well, it was different from the European strain based on RFLP analysis.  We have subsequently analyzed samples from an outbreak in Denmark and were able to show that 3 unique strains were responsible for this outbreak.  Each strain was identified over a limited period of time, with 2 of the 3 strains overlapping in time.  We are currently analyzing samples from Brest, France, and Bern, Switzerland that are again from outbreaks in renal transplant recipients.  Preliminary results suggest that one strain is common to the outbreaks in Brest and Bern, though not all cases were caused by this strain.  In addition to RFLP, we are using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). MLST is the most commonly used method for typing Pneumocystis in other laboratories, and this will allow us to compare the results of these two typing methods.  We are also exploring sequencing larger regions of the Pneumocystis genome to be able to better examine the phylogenetic relationships among different isolates.  These studies should provide improved diagnostic methods for PCP, and help to better understand the epidemiology of Pneumocystis infection.  In collaboration with investigators at the Broad Institute and Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., we have undertaken a project to sequence the genome of Pneumocystis species from different hosts.  The major difficulty with this project was obtaining DNA of sufficient purity to allow next generation sequencing, sincethe organism cannot be cultured.    As a first step, we were able to completely sequence the mitochondrial genomes of P. carinii, P. murina, P. jirovecii, and to show that while there is a high level of synteny between the P. carinii and P. murina genomes, P. jirovecii has substantial levels of recombination compared to the other 2 species.  In an effort spearheaded by Liang Ma (staff scientist) we have subsequently been able to purify Pneumocystis DNA from infected rat, mouse, and human lungs sufficiently to allow NGS sequencing to generate high quality sequence data that has permitted development of nearly complete draft genomes of all 3 Pneumocystis species (P. carinii, P. murina, P. jirovecii).  RNA sequencing in parallel has allowed identification of P. murina and P. carinii transcripts and characterization of the genes encoded by this organism. Through analysis of these data, we have been able to demonstrate that all 3 Pneumocystis  species have a highly condensed genome compared to other fungi, and that Pneumocystis has developed mechanisms  to evade host innate immune responses, including inability to synthesize or degrade chitin, and inability to synthesize high mannose residues on proteins. Pneumocystis has also lost many other functions that highlight the probability that Pneumocystis lives almost exclusively in its hosts lung environment.     Availability of these genome should allow us to better understand the biology of this family of organisms, should potentially allow identification of metabolic pathways that need to be complemented to successfully culture the organism, and should facilitate the identification of important antigens and pathogenic factors."

Up to 100 male or female subjects age 12 and above who are already undergoing bronchoscopy for the collection of a BAL specimen and who will have respiratory virus PCR ordered on the BAL specimen as part of their ongoing care at the NIH Clinical Center will be eligible for inclusion in this study.  NP swab and wash specimens have been validated for testing using the FilmArray assay. Both the NP swab/wash and the BAL specimens will have the respiratory virus PCR (FilmArray) assay ordered in CRIS and the specimens will be processed and tested by the medical technologists in the Microbiology Service of the Department of Laboratory Medicine. Results from both specimens will be reported in CRIS. Instructions from the Centers for Disease Control on the proper technique for collecting NP swab specimens are presented in Appendix A. To resolve discrepant results, NP (swab or wash) and BAL specimens with conflicting results will be tested by a second multiplex PCR (Luminex Fast RVP) in the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Viral Pathogenesis and Evolution Branch, NIAID. These results will only be used for research purposes.  Demographic and clinical data (including but not limited to laboratory results, microbiologic data, and radiology results) on study participants will be abstracted from CRIS and correlated with results from the FilmArray assay. Excess NP swab/wash or BAL samples will be stored for potential future use by study investigators.  To date we have enrolled 35 subjects. The results thus far:  21 had negative results for respiratory virus PCR  14 had positive results for respiratory virus PCR  Of the 14 positive results:  11 had matching viral results from BAL and NP swab  1 showed positive results from BAL and NP swab identifying different pathogens  2 showed positive respiratory virus PCR on BAL only."
"9352019","Both LeTx and ETx toxins, contribute to shock with anthrax. Common to each toxin is a component called protective antigen (PA), which is necessary for cellular uptake of the toxic components; lethal factor (LF) for LeTx and edema factor (EF) for ETx. Both factors are capable of disrupting key steps in essential but very different intracellular signaling pathways. Lethal factor is a protease, which inhibits stress kinase pathways and has been shown to inhibit host defense and other responses necessary for the survival of the host. Emerging data also suggests that LF may have a direct depressant effect on mitochondrial function. Edema factor has adenyl cyclase activity and increases intracellular cAMP levels to very high levels. While edema factor is capable of depressing host defense, it may also have direct effects on myocardial and vascular function via its adenyl cyclase activity.   Findings from studies we have now conducted in toxin challenged rat and canine models have raised several questions regarding the effects of LeTx and ETx. First, does LeTx decrease heart rate or the strength with which the heart pumps. Second, does LeTx initiate reactions that lead to later reductions in heart strength despite cessation of toxin administration? Third, does ETx increase heart rate directly? Fourth, does ETx produce reductions in the strength of the heart that the canine model was insensitive to detecting? The present study is designed to further investigate the effects of LeTx and ETx on myocardial function employing a re-circulating Langendorff perfused rat heart model. This model directly measures myocardial function in excised hearts that are allowed to continue to beat in an ex vivo system.  The present study is being conducted in three parts. In the initial part procedures were developed to establish and determine the stability of the perfused rat heart model. The second part has assessed the direct effects of LeTx and ETx added alone or together to the perfusion circuit on the heart rate and contractility of hearts taken from normal animals. In the third part, now underway, we are assessing the heart rates and contractility of hearts taken from animals previously challenged with either LeTx or ETx alone or together. In this final part, prior to removal of hearts for perfusion, animals are undergoing in vivo cardiopulmonary measures performed including blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac echo and arterial blood gas measures. During perfused heart studies, in addition to cardiac functional measures, perfusate is collected at timed intervals to measure markers of cardiac injury (creatinine phosphokinase, myocardial troponin I, cardiac myosin light chain-1), nitric oxide, and cytokines. At the completion of perfusion, in some studies, hearts are fixed with gluteraldehyde for EM studies including assessment of mitochondrial number and structure or they are prepared for mitochondrial, MAPKK, cAMP, gene microarray, quantitative PCR, and apoptosis analysis.  Experiments have been completed for this part and a manuscript has been published."
"9352020","Goals and Objectives:  The research of the Molecular Biomedical Imaging Laboratory (MBIL) includes developing patient-based methods for detection and quantitative characterization of subclinical cardiovascular disease of the myocardium and blood vessels in both early phase clinical trials as well as in multi-center studies.  Areas of study include genetically determined disease, as well as acquired cardiovascular disease as a result of common risk factors.  Methods include advanced magnetic resonance techniques, cardiovascular computed tomography, and positron emission tomography.  The ongoing projects include:  1) Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) (10-CC-N010) The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) study is to provide data on the benefits and effects of treatments and glucose lowering levels on the systemic complications seen in the Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) population.  The NIDDK further expanded the study for an additional time to look at the cardiovascular disease, long-term microvascular, and neuropathic issues that are seen in the T1DM population.  MBIL and Johns Hopkins Hospital is working as the joined core CMR lab of this study.  MBIL is evaluating the relationship between cardiovascular disease and risk factors using CMR.  2) Non-invasive Assessment of Atherosclerosis in Patients with Disorders of the Immune System (10-I-0029, NCT01063309, PI: Dr. John Gallin) Atherosclerosis, the major cause of heart disease, is thought to relate to dysregulated inflammation in the cardiac blood vessels and possibly results from over production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  The rate of atherosclerosis in patients with disorders of the immune system has not been well characterized but is likely to be dramatically different than that seen in the general population.  Specifically, patients with Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) may be protected from developing atherosclerosis due to reduced superoxide and other ROS production by phagocytic cells.  We hypothesize that patients with CGD are at decreased risk of developing atherosclerosis.  The primary objective will be assessed using imaging techniques to measure coronary artery calcium scores and the presence of absence of soft plaque. Participants undergo prospective CT angiography, gadolinium enhanced cardiac MR and high resolution carotid MR imaging.     3) Cardiometabolic Assessment in HIV (NCT01089114, PI: Dr. Colleen Hadigan) HIV is now a chronic infection as patients with access to antiretroviral therapy have significantly improved life expectancies.  Patients with HIV also have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Thus, cardiovascular disease is an important potential co-morbidity for patients living with HIV.  The study will perform a detailed cardiovascular assessment using state-of-the-art imaging techniques to evaluate intramyocardial lipid as well as coronary artery disease and myocardial function in a cohort of 100 HIV infected patients and 30 healthy volunteers as controls.  The MBIL is collaborating with NIAID researchers quantify intramyocaridial, intrahepatic and intramyocellular triglyceride content with MRI spectroscopy and the anatomy and function of heart using Cardiac CT and MRI.  5) Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA, NCT00005487, PI: Dr. Bluemke)  The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is an NHLBI funded study of the characteristics of subclinical cardiovascular disease (disease detected non-invasively before it has produced clinical signs and symptoms) and risk factors that predict progression to clinically overt cardiovascular disease, and that predict progression of subclinical disease itself, in a diverse, population-based sample of 6,500 men and women aged 45-84.  MBIL and Johns Hopkins Hospital have been working as a joint core CMR lab for this study for MESA exam 5.  MBIL was actively involved in the protocol design, staff training, database design and implementation, and image analysis of MESA exam 5.  MBIL has finished reading of more than 3000 cases.  6) Evaluation and optimization of myocardial mechanics and tissue composition a) Cardiac MRI core lab of HCM Net Study; Cardiac MRI core lab of Vanish study (OHSR-CC-5125, PI: Dr. Carolyn Ho) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cardiovascular genetic disorder, marked by phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity.  The MBIL is the core cardiac MRI lab of the HCMNet study.  MBIL has finished the reading of all cases of the first phase of this study and will continue work on the second phase of this study, which would be a medical treatment study of HCM. The VANISH study is phase 2 of this project, with MBIL delivery core laboratory training and establishing the cardiac magnetic resonance protocol for this multi-center study.  c) Cardiac MRI core lab of Halt HCM Study (OHSR-CC-11322, NCT01537926, PI: Dr. Ali Marian) Regression of Hypertrophy with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HALT-HCM) is a NHLBI funded study.  Despite HCMs clinical impact, there is no effective pharmacological therapy for HCM. None of the current pharmacological therapies reverses or attenuates cardiac hypertrophy or reduces the risk of SCD in adults. Cardiac hypertrophy, the essential clinical feature of human HCM, is a major determinant of morbidity and the risk of SCD. The primary objective is to perform a pilot study in HCM patients with gene mutations to assess safety and gather the pre-requisite data for subsequent robust randomized placebo-controlled efficacy studies with NAC.  The MBIL is the core cardiac MRI lab of the Halt-HCM study.  The study has enrolled a limited number of subjects to date, and the cardiac magnetic resonance studies from these subjects will be evaluated by MBIL. d)   Cardiac MRI core lab of Genetics, mechanisms and clinical phenotypes of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy  (NCT:  pending.  PI:  Jeffrey Towbin) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people.  The specific aims include 1: To identify new genes causing ARVC, ALVC, and aDCM, 2A: To evaluate genotype-phenotype associations in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC);  MBIL is the core lab of this study which is currently in the start-up phase with establishment of the CMR protocol, forms and procedures to be submitted to field centers.  7) The Psoriasis, Atherosclerosis, and Cardiometabolic Disease Initiative (PACI) (PI Mehta, NCT NCT01778569) Psoriasis is an inflammation that mostly affects the skin but can affect the entire body. Another disorder, atherosclerosis, is a process in which cholesterol is gradually deposited on the wall of arteries. Many cells that cause psoriasis also cause atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study is to study the relationship between psoriasis and cardiometabolic diseases."
"9352027","While immune cells play a critical role in early innate immune responses and microbial clearance during infection, excessive immune cell activity and the inflammatory host responses this activation may elicit, can also lead to inadvertent host tissue injury. The host has therefore developed mechanisms to control and coordinate immune cell activity. The programed death 1 (PD-1) signaling pathway is one such mechanism. The development of PD-1 expression on lymphocytes and its stimulation by PD-1 ligand is associated with a suppressed immune phenotype. Although the suppressed state associated with PD-1 expression is the hosts attempt to keep an excessive immune response in check, if it occurs too early during infection or if it is too great during later infection, PD-1 signaling may actually impair host defense and microbial clearance and worsen outcome.  Studies have now suggested that the blockade of PD-1 ligand (PD-L1)/PD-1 signaling can restore lymphocyte host defense function and may be protective under some conditions. In one study, PD-1 knockout animals were resistant to cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced septic shock. In other studies, provision of an anti PD-1 or anti PD-L1 antibody both very early after the onset of infection (3 hours after induction of peritonitis) and much later (up to 5 days after induction of peritonitis) provided protection. One group has also shown that PD-1 blockade leads to a reduction in peritoneal lavage bacteria colony counts in conjunction with higher plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, controlling PD-1 expression holds promise in the treatment of infection and sepsis. However, understanding under which conditions such inhibition will have beneficial as opposed to harmful effects is important for determining how widely PD-1 inhibition might be applied during clinical infection. Because the severity of underlying infection is one condition that varies substantially in patients presenting with sepsis and has an important impact on the efficacy of other immune-modulators, determining whether PD-1 inhibition has beneficial effects with both mild and severe infection is a critical question. Also, because, PD-1 inhibition has been studied exclusively in peritoneal infection models, determining whether it is also beneficial in the context of pulmonary infection, the most common cause of sepsis clinically, is important. To test these questions, in the present study we plan to compare the effects of an anti-PD-1 mAb versus placebo in mice challenged with intratracheal (IT) doses of S. aureus (SA) bacteria (i.e. a pneumonia model) designed to produce either low or high mortality rates (25% mortality, mild infection vs. 75%, severe infection respectively). The study will be done in 2 parts. The first part (Part 1) will include experiments to determine the doses of bacteria that will produce the low or high mortality rates that we seek and to also confirm that IT infection alters PD-1 expression on circulating and tissue immune cells. The second part (Part 2) will include two groups of experiments. One group will compare the effects of anti-PD-1 mAb versus control on survival in mice challenged with IT SA low or high doses and observed for up to 168h. The other group will compare the effects of these two treatments on blood and lung bacteria counts, cytokine levels, PD-1/PD-L1 tissue expression, tissue injury scores and other measures."

"9353640","Overview: The laboratory has established research methodology and protocols, built an infrastructure of hardware and software, formed collaborative arrangements, trained a team of scientists and support personnel to utilize the methodology of RNA-Seq. We have performed over several hundreds of deep sequencing runs on Illumina HiSeq machines and obtained over 20 billion reads of transcriptome sequence information and are intensively involved in the analysis of the resulting datasets. We have sequenced the transcriptomes of physiologically or genetically labeled pain-sensing neurons after isolation by FACS, neurons in dorsal spinal cord during peripheral inflammation, models of rheumatoid arthritis, inflamed peripheral tissue, axotomized DRG, dorsal and ventral spinal cords and peripheral nerve. We have also begun investigations into transcriptional processes affected by general anesthesia in higher order brain regions. In many cases multiple time points are sampled to follow the evolution and resolution of the intervention with enough samples at each point to permit statistical comparison. Because we sorted for certain neuronal populations we know which genes are in pain-sensing neurons and which are in mainly non-pain-sensing neurons such as proprioceptive primary afferents, supporting cells or Schwann cells. The ability to form incisive hypotheses regarding pain physiology is greatly advanced by this type of tissue and neuron-specific information. We now have quantitative information on all the genes that mediate DRG and spinal cord sensory and motor functions and formation of the myelin sheath in the peripheral nervous system.   TRPV1 Transcriptome: One important focus for our group is the subpopulation of DRG neurons that express the thermo-, chemo-, pH-, and lipid-responsive ion channel called TRPV1. This ion channel is also gated by capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot pepper. Previous experiments demonstrated that the potent capsaicin analog resiniferatoxin (RTX) can control cancer pain in dogs and humans indicating a crucial role for these neurons in transmission of clinical pain.  Because of the efficacy of manipulations aimed at the TRPV1-expressing DRG neurons we want to know everything possible about them. We have performed deep sequencing of the mRNA content using next-gen RNA-Seq on various TRPV1  neuronal preparations. A genetic method expresses a fluorescent marker allowing the TRPV1 DRG neurons to be isolated by FACS.  To obtain the inverse population, the TRPV1 neurons were killed by making them express diphtheria toxin receptor.  Another strategy was to stimulate TRPV1 neurons with RTX and sort the neurons that display increases in calcium fluorescence. We are also killing the cells by microinjection of RTX in vivo. Our first paper outlines the transcriptome results from the genetically labeled TRPV1 neurons and ganglia in which the TRPV1 neurons had been deleted by expression of diphtheria toxin or microinjection of RTX. This has provided comprehensive, new transcriptomic information on genes expressed by a clinically important population of nociceptive neurons.  We are now making comparisons of DRGs obtained post-mortem from a cancer pain patient that had been treated with RTX to identify the pain relevant molecular transducers in humans.   Analgesia transcriptome: One of the most interesting aspects of the transcriptome analyses is quantitative insight provided by next-gen RNA-Seq. We now know the quantitative relationships between the exact genes that mediate the actions of known analgesic drugs such as morphine, clonidine, lidocaine, ibuprofen, and gabapentin and emerging targets such as nociceptor-neuron-specific sodium channels.  Frequently it is not clear which molecular paralogs of ion channels or drug binding receptors are expressed by different tissues in the pain pathway.  Our data show that when expression values for all the relevant genes are obtained quantitatively, at the same time, and with excellent reproducibility between animals and treatments a new, more informative picture emerges. The transcriptome experiments also point to new targets for potential analgesic drug development. We identified an orphan GPCR that is well expressed in the nociceptive population, and are currently exploring its analgesic properties.  Transcriptomics of Peripheral Sensitization: The RNA-Seq data provides a means for amplification of ongoing studies. The RNA-Seq results inform all of our hypothesis-driven studies and those of other groups. An example is our collaborative work with NIAAA.  We observe that certain lipids are TRPV1 agonists. Using the transcriptome databases, we have extracted the quantitative expression data for all the genes involved in lipid transport, generation, degradation, and the cognate receptors for the relevant lipids from sequencing of skin, DRG and dorsal spinal cord. Differential expression levels therein provided insight into new enzymes that generate particular lipids important for nociceptive sensitization. It is noteworthy that this molecular predictive approach has identified totally new groups of endogenous neuro-active lipids.   Canine Ganglionic Transcriptome: This year we completed the extraction and sequencing of canine ganglion and spinal cord tissue from controls and animals with osteosarcoma that were euthanized because of inadequate pain control. Tissues were obtained at autopsy. This study was undertaken to test for genes activated by nociceptive input from naturally occurring bone cancer.  Some animals also had their pain treated with RTX.  This will form a unique dataset that will provide new insight into the transcriptomics of cancer pain in a species that is very similar to humans and the therapeutic actions of RTX.  Anesthesia Transcriptome: Another project we are in the process of completing is an assessment of the effects of inhalation general anesthesia on cortical and hippocampal transcriptome.  This is the initial step to a larger study on the effects of general anesthesia on cognitive function in aged animals.  In humans, general anesthesia can have a deleterious impact on cognitive function and we hypothesize that we can gain mechanistic insight into the defect state by understanding the molecular level changes in gene expression induced by anesthesia and the capacity for recovery.  Our initial results indicate that communication between neuronal synaptic input and nuclear transcriptional control is altered by general anesthesia and that the alterations are more pronounced in cortex than hippocampus.  It is quite remarkable that we detect widespread modulation of genes that mediate plasticity of neuronal function and memory formation.   Summary: The datasets acquired over the past several years provide unprecedented and extremely fine-grained detail on gene expression in pain-sensing circuits. This may seem complicated but the basic goal is to understand how we sense pain and how we may control it when required. There are a wide variety of painful stimuli that can be encountered in our environment and different neurons exist to sense these different types of pain signals. We are determining exactly what molecules the different types of pain-sensing neurons make and how they work together to do their job. We will use this information to understand pain signaling and how to control it. Taken together these data provide a transformative new resource for the pain research community and will allow a much more precise assessment of experimental manipulations and verification of experimental results."
"9354075","The first step performed to achieve the goals stated above was to assess the technical capabilities of a commercially available stereophotogrammetry (SP) system. We performed a study to determine the reliability, stability, validity and precision of a SP system for use in quantifying the complex three-dimensional (3D) structure of the human torso. We performed assessments of the system using images of geometric solids and a human-form mannequin. Analysis of geometric solids revealed excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability of the system for linear, surface area and volume measurements (r > 0.99, P < 0.001). Overall, no significant difference was found between SP and manual measurements (F = 4.23, P > 0.06). The system exhibited excellent stability in images of the mannequin over time (r > 0.99). The limit of precision (error > 5%) of the system to detect objects on the surface of the mannequin was estimated at an object size of 23.5cm2 for surface area and 32mL for volume. After confirming the stability of the SP image acquisition system with human-form mannequin, a human subjects protocol was approved by the NIDCR IRB. A materials transfer agreement with the University of Alberta, Canada was completed in order to share MatLab image analysis software developed by investigators there  In this first phase of the clinical study, 102 healthy volunteers were imaged using the SP system, and these images were processed into transverse torso slices between 2.5 and 6 mm using the Matlab image analysis software. The coefficients of variation were calculated for each thickness for desired outcome measures such as pseudocobb angle or maximum difference in area between the right and left half of the torso. Preliminary analyses of data obtained in this phase of the study were presented in March 2013 at the Annual Meeting of the Association of Academic Physiatrists. It was found that all outcome measures had coefficients of variation that were at or below the 30% threshold for stability, with the exception of the pseudoCobb measure. This indicated that this SP system does have the potential to provide quantifiable, multi-planar information about spinal and chest wall deformities. A report of the results of this phase is currently in preparation for publication.  The phase one results have allowed us to move on to our second phase of the study and we are continuing to accrue subjects with scoliosis and/or rib deformities in order to assess the ability of the system to discriminate healthy subjects from those with scoliosis, and chest wall deformity. We will also be testing the system's sensitivity to detect changes in deformity over time. Subsequent to this accrual and analysis, the information gained will be applied to accrual and development of analyses of the distribution of adiposity in persons with truncal obesity."

"9355439","Acquisition and transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in healthcare facilities is a major patient safety problem, afflicting in particular the antibiotic-exposed and immunodeficient patient populations. MDRO-colonized patients require isolation to reduce the risk of transmission to other patients, and frequently develop infections from their colonizing organisms.  Most clinically relevant MDROs are carried in the gastrointestinal tract; thus perirectal cultures are frequently the surveillance method used to screen for these pathogens. Surveillance to identify MDRO colonization allows for anticipation and timely initiation of effective treatment of patients who develop infection.  The precise modes of transmission within hospitals are not known, but contamination of the hands of healthcare personnel, patient care equipment, and the healthcare environment are thought to play major roles in transmitting MDRO.  Suboptimal hand hygiene can lead to transmission on the hands of staff to other patients or colonization of their own gastrointestinal tract. Few studies have investigated intestinal colonization of healthcare professionals. Transmission of bacteria by healthcare personnel is thought to occur primarily via contaminated hands; we wonder whether gastrointestinal carriage by healthcare personnel also plays a role in nosocomial spread.   This study screened a self-referred convenience sample of 400 healthcare personnel who have contact with patients or patient culture specimens for fecal carriage of MDRO at one point in time. A control group of 400 NIH employees or contractors who do not have contact with patients or patient specimens were also screened. Samples were linked to questionnaires to assess the exposure of staff members to patients or culture specimens with known MDRO colonization or infection. We planned to use molecular typing techniques to link highly resistant healthcare personnel isolates to patient or environmental isolates, but results did not warrant this procedure. Finally, the study was conducted in such a way as to preserve to the greatest extent possible the anonymity of volunteers, using a system of alphanumeric identifiers and unmanned drop boxes for specimen collection.  The study was fully enrolled, completed, and the results analyzed, and is awaiting publication."

"9357194","As of August 31, 2016, 323 NIH-registry donors had undergone 340 filgrastim-assisted large-volume apheresis procedures to collect peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for unrelated NMDP recipients; 11 donors donated PBSC twice, and 9 donated subsequent unstimulated leukocytes. 305 of 323 (94 %) required only a single apheresis procedure to collect an adequate cell dose for transplantation. The mean volume processed per procedure was 19.6 liters, resulting in a procedure average duration of 4.6 hours. A central line was required for venous access in 32 (9.4%) of the 340 procedures. All donors experienced filgrastim-induced fatigue, insomnia, bone pain, or headache, although in only 5% were these effects considered severe. The peak mean leukocyte count after the standard 5-day filgrastim mobilization cycle was 37,000/uL, and the peak mean circulating blood stem cell count (CD34+ cell) following 5-day filgrastim administration was 56.9/uL. Platelet counts fell by a mean of 39 % during apheresis, and significant post-apheresis thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000/uL) occurred during 75 of 340 donations (22 %). The mean time to complete recovery from PBSC donation was 1 week, compared with 3 weeks for marrow harvest.   NMDP protocol dictates a vial-based dosing scheme for filgrastim administration, including a minimum dose of 600 and a maximum dose of 1200 micrograms per day, with intermediate doses based on weight (approximately 10 micrograms per kilogram), but rounds to the nearest vial content as supplied by the manufacturer. This scheme limits toxicity at the upper end of dosing, increases CD34 mobilization efficacy at the lower end of dosing, and prevents drug wastage while maximizing dose-response relationships in the intermediate dosing range. In an analysis of the effect of donor demographic factors on stem cell mobilization response to filgrastim, higher total filgrastim dose, greater donor weight, and higher pre-filgrastim platelet count are strongly associated with higher peak CD34 cell mobilization responses, whereas Caucasian ethnicity, female gender, and increasing age are associated with poorer CD34 responses. The ability to use these factors to predict CD34 cell mobilization outcomes has resulted in optimization of filgrastim dosing schedules and apheresis processing volumes, and increased the likelihood of obtaining robust CD34 cell apheresis components for transplant.  Analysis of NMDP recipient outcomes shows that PBSC transplants are associated with reduced times to engraftment, decreased rates of graft rejection, but higher rates of chronic extensive graft versus host disease compared with marrow transplants, such that there is no difference in overall survival, disease free surivival, or leukemia relapse at three years following transplant among the two types of unrelated transplants. Administrative and statistical support for this study is provided by the NMDP National Office. Filgrastim is provided under an IND agreement with Amgen (BB-IND #6821)."

"9360161","The goal of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic. Such early detection and treatment can have a profound impact on the clinical severity of the condition in the affected child. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the consequences of the targeted disorders can be dire, many causing irreversible neurological damage, intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities, and even death. In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 31 core conditions and that 26 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and by the Secretary of HHS. Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening. Currently, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening.  X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath, an insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. Women have two X chromosomes and are the carriers of the disease, but since men only have one X chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra X chromosome, they are more severely affected. People with X-ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex. The loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of X-ALD. While nearly all patients with X-ALD suffer from adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, the neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood. The childhood cerebral form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia. The milder adult-onset form is also known as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which typically begins between ages 21 and 35. Symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs, and ataxia. Although adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function. Almost half the women who are carriers of X-ALS will develop a milder form of X-ALD. Adrenal function must be tested periodically in all patients with ALD. Treatment with adrenal hormones can be lifesaving. Symptomatic and supportive treatments for ALD include physical therapy, psychological support, and special education. Prognosis for patients with childhood cerebral X-ALD is generally poor due to progressive neurological deterioration unless bone marrow transplantation is performed early. Death usually occurs within 1 to 10 years after the onset of symptoms. Adult-onset AMN will progress over decades."
"9360167","The Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) designs and conducts original epidemiological, behavioral, and biostatistical research encompassing several research domains such as human reproduction and development, pregnancy and related complications, pediatric and adolescent health and behaviors, and methodologic research relevant for our mission.  The Division comprises three intramural research branches Epidemiology, Biostatistics & Bioinformatics, and Health Behavior, and its mission is to design and implement original research with the potential for high impact findings for public health and its special populations. Accumulating evidence from animal and human studies suggests that adverse intrauterine exposures may lead to permanent fetal adaptions in anatomy and physiology, which may be beneficial for short term fetal survival, but result in an altered long-term risk of disease later in life.  Maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are exposures of particular interest given that a very high proportion of women (~25%) are obese when becoming pregnant.  Moreover, hyperglycemia in pregnancy as exemplified in GDM has long been regarded as a teratogen which affects fetal structure, function, and development and has long-term adverse impacts on the offspring.  Data from mechanistic studies indicates that fetal exposure to obesity and/or hyperglycemia may lead to long-term metabolic and vascular function alteration.   Thus, investigators at the NICHD have designed and will implement a cohort study of offspring of an existing cohort of mothers using both retrospective and prospective data collection to evaluate impacts of GDM and obesity on the metabolic, vascular, and reproductive health of the offspring, their determinants and the underlying molecular mechanisms"

"9360476","MicroRNA changes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in response to ibrutinib treatment.  In 2015-2016 we finalized and published our study reporting microRNA levels in lymph node and peripheral blood derived CLL cells from patients pre and post treatment with the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib.  This work was done in collaboration with Dr. Adrian Wiestner in NHLBI.  We reported 1) unique miR profiles in CLL cells in the lymph node related to B-cell activation that become down regulated upon release into the peripheral blood; 2) a subset of 4 miRNA related to BCR activation become significantly down regulated in circulating CLL cells after treatment with ibrutinib, 3) multiple predicted targets of the 4 miRNA include tumor suppressor transcripts that are significantly upregulated after ibrutinib treatment, and 4) functional studies demonstrating direct regulation of the tumor suppressors by the miRNA.  These findings suggest that response to Ibrutinib involves upregulation of tumor suppressors via downregulation of miRNAs, representing a novel mechanism of treatment response.  This work was the subject of a platform presentation at the Annual Society of Hematology meeting in December 2015 and was published in Leukemia in 2016 (Saleh L. et al.).    MicroRNA profiling of GATA2 deficiency associated myelodysplasia (MDS) / acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Somatic and inherited germline mutations in GATA2 have been identified in patients diagnosed with monocytopenia, B-cell and NK-cell lymphopenia, susceptibility to opportunistic infections (e.g. disseminated MAC), and a strong propensity to develop hypocellular MDS/AML or CMML.  We previously identified significantly increased levels of miR-181c in EBV transformed cell lines from patients with GATA2 deficiency. mRNA targets of miR-181c include MCL-1 transcripts involved in the regulation of apoptosis.  We performed functional studies validating the regulation of MCL-1 by miR-181c.  During 2015-2016 we additionally identified miRNA changes related to markedly increased FLT3 ligand expression in GATA2 and are performing functional studies to validate the relationship between miR-424 and FLT3L.  These findings suggest potential mechanisms for the progressive cytopenias in GATA2 deficiency involving down regulation of MCL-1 in stem cells and upregulation of FLT3L in the bone marrow microenvironment.   RAS-associated Autoimmune Leukoproliferative Disorder (RALD)  is a chronic indolent condition that typically presents in childhood with monocytosis, lymphocytosis, autoimmune phenomena, splenomegaly, and variable lymphadenopathy. RALD is characterized by somatic mutations in KRAS or NRAS in hematopoietic cells. Despite the indolent course of RALD, it shares some overlapping clinical features and similar genetic defects with Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML), which is characterized by canonical and non-canonical RAS-pathway mutations.  The nature of RALD is somewhat controversial as many pediatric hematologist/oncologists are concerned that RALD may represent a form of JMML or a precursor disease with the potential of transforming into JMML.  In 2015-2016, we performed targeted sequencing for 54 genes commonly associated with myeloid neoplasia.  Mutations in NRAS or KRAS were the only mutations identified suggesting that the most frequent additional cooperating mutations found in JMML, AML, CMML and MDS are not present in RALD.   Ongoing studies are in process.     Immunophenotypic and morphologic analyses of other rare diseases with bone marrow and peripheral blood pathology.  Multiple collaborative research studies continued in 2015-2016 involving immunophenotypic and morphologic characterization of PASLI disease and abnormal B-cell maturation related to mutations in PI3KCD, immunodeficiency and cytopenias related to mutations in CTLA4, B-cell deficiency in patients with mutations involving IKAROS, CANDLE syndrome, aplastic anemia, hypocellular MDS and AML.  Our manuscript detailing abnormal B-cell maturation in the bone marrow of patients with germline mutations in PIK3CD was accepted to the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and is currently in press."

"9362903","Antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces mortality and morbidity in HIV-infected individuals. With successful therapy HIV RNA becomes undetectable, but drug resistance may occur. Specific HIV mutations are associated with resistance and these mutations can be detected through standard genotypic resistance tests, which have the ability to detect mutations only when they are present in approximately 20% of the virus population within an individual. Importantly, it is now known that the presence of certain resistance mutations, even at very low concentrations within a patient?s virus population (1% or more), can contribute to virological failure. These drug resistant minor variants can reflect the early emergence of acquired resistance during therapy, and can also be transmitted to newly infected individuals. These minor variants are not detected by standard drug resistance assays and methods to detect minor variants that contribute to HIV virological failure are needed. These assays would need to detect mutations causing resistance to each of the antiretroviral drug classes (NRTI, NNRTI, PI and INI) in all HIV subtypes, and must be inexpensive, since large numbers of patients would need to be screened. The goal of this project is to develop an assay to detect minor populations of resistant variants in blood specimens from HIV-infected individuals with HIV RNA viral loads above 1000 copies/ml."

"9208685","Abstract- Mahendroo Preterm birth (PTB) affects 15 million children world-wide annually contributing significantly to infant mortality and the potential for lifelong health complications in survivors. An incomplete understanding of risk factors that lead to preterm birth has limited development of tools for early, accurate assessment of PTB risk as well as therapies for prevention. Our recent studies have highlighted the important role that the cervical epithelia play in providing barrier and immune protection during pregnancy and led to the identification of ?cervical epithelial dysfunction? as a new risk factor for preterm birth. Through pregnancy and parturition, the epithelia must proliferate, differentiate, and form a junctional and mucosal barrier to protect the reproductive tract from ascending infection and resulting risk of preterm birth. During pregnancy these epithelial responsibilities are regulated in part by extracellular matrix cues, specifically by the increased synthesis of the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA). Mice lacking HA synthesis in the cervix display abnormal epithelial differentiation, increased epithelial and mucosal permeability and increased PTB rates in response to ascending infection. The increase in cervical hyaluronan during late pregnancy is regulated by increased hyaluronan synthase 2 (Has2) gene expression. The focus of this study is thus to understand i) the mechanism by which HA participates in cervical epithelial competency, ii) identify downstream transcriptome targets of HA and iii) understand the transcriptional regulation of Has2 expression in the cervix. We will test the overall hypothesis that HA?s ability to maintain epithelial cervical barrier function and immune-protection requires interactions with HA-interacting proteins and mediates processes involved in epithelial differentiation, barrier function and response to toll-like receptor signaling."

"9228738","ABSTRACT Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer that develops in skin color cells (melanocytes). When melanomas progress to an advanced stage, treatment options are limited and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In this grant application, we propose to develop a combinatorial immunotherapy to treat metastatic melanoma. Several studies have revealed that the cytokine TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis- inducing ligand) induces apoptosis in a wide variety of tumor cells, but does not cause toxicity to most normal cells. Treating this disease with TRAIL holds great promise, but it is not simple, because the likely agent to treat the disease, recombinant TRAIL, does not last long enough in the body to be effective. We have found a way to have TRAIL reside in another cell such as the natural killer (NK) cell; that cell then secretes TRAIL on a long-term basis. Importantly, NK cells have an additional advantage--they seek out melanoma cells, so they bring TRAIL directly to tumor sites, where it can exert its profound tumor-killing effects. Recent clinical trials have shown that anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death-1) and anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death-ligand 1) agents have impressive antitumor effects in metastatic melanoma. Thus, we hypothesize that the combination of secretory TRAIL-armed NK cells with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents will effectively enhance the tumoricidal efficacy of NK cells. To test the hypothesis, (1) we will assess the biological effect of secretory TRAIL-armed NK cells and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents on metastatic melanoma cells, and (2) we will examine the preclinical efficacy of combinatorial immunotherapy with secretory TRAIL-armed NK cells and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents in a xenograft mouse model of metastatic melanoma. The proposed studies for the first aim will examine the cytotoxicity of melanoma cells during combined treatment with secretory TRAIL-armed NK cells and anti-PD- 1/PD-L1 agents. In the second aim, we will employ a mouse xenograft model to assess the effect of treatment with secretory TRAIL-armed NK cells in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents on growth and regression of metastatic melanoma. We believe that the successful outcome of this study will support the application of this combinatorial immunotherapy to patients with advanced malignant melanoma."

"9352026","Invasive B. anthracis infection is a relatively rare but highly lethal infection in humans. Production of lethal and edema toxin are believed to be central to the pathogenesis of B. anthracis infection. Due to the infrequency of invasive B. anthracis infection, but its potential use as a weapon of bioterror, the FDA permits the evaluation and approval of adjunctive therapy of this infection based on studies performed in at least two clinically relevant animal models. To what extent models that have been used to date to test anti-toxin agents have simulated the conditions encountered in patients presenting with invasive anthrax infection is unclear. Also, whether the effectiveness of anti-toxin agents is influenced when conditions do approach those encountered clinically (e.g. treatment after infection has manifested itself and in combination with other therapies) has not been investigated. To address these questions we are performing a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of all preclinical models employing live B. anthracis challenge and testing anthrax anti-toxin treatments with or without accompanying antibiotic support. With this analysis, we aim to establish how closely such anti-toxin therapies have been tested pre-clinically when compared to the use of such agents clinically and whether the effectiveness of these agents change when clinical conditions are closely simulated."
"9352028","Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis or anthrax) remains a health threat for the developed world. Both lethal and edema toxin (LT and ET respectively) contribute to the pathogenesis of organ injury and lethality during anthrax infection. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the toxins pathogenic effects will be important for improving the outcome with this lethal infection. In vitro findings do suggest that each toxin can produce endothelial injury and loss of vascular integrity and increased permeability. Although never tested in the lung, increased endothelial permeability with the toxins could result in extravasation of fluid, reductions in oxygen transfer and lung compliance, and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. To investigate these possibilities, the present study will employ an isolated perfused rat lung model to examine whether LT or ET does cause pulmonary endothelial injury and increased pulmonary vascular permeability. This ex vivo model will allow a direct measure of changing lung weight over time, which is required to calculate a lung permeability coefficient. Determining whether either toxin alters lung permeability will improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and management of anthrax associated lung injury clinically.    This study will be done in two parts. In the first part (Part 1), an isolated perfused rat lung model will be developed and the models ability to measure changes in endothelial permeability, oxygenation, compliance and vascular resistance tested with lungs isolated from healthy rats. As a positive control, Part 1 will include experiments in lungs challenged with thromboxane A2, a mediator known to increase lung endothelial permeability. In the second part (Part 2), lungs will be challenged with LT or ET introduced into the isolated lungs perfusion circuit and lung function will be measured. Some experiments in this part of the study will also include the use of Raxibacumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits host cell uptake of LT and ET, and adefovir, an intracellular inhibitor of ET, to further explore mechanisms underlying these toxins pathogenic effects. The functional parameters tested in Part 2 will include permeability, oxygenation, compliance and vascular resistance. Some lungs from Part 2 will be sent for histology and examination by electron microscopy."

"9200930","The Maternal and Pediatric Infection Disease (MPIDP) Branch of the Center for Research for Mothers and Children (CRMC) of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a need for a Data Coordinating Center to continue the current activities of development, implementation, and direction of a wide range of domestic and international research activities for the study of epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, transmission, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection and its infectious and noninfectious complications in infants, children, adolescents, and women (pregnant and non-pregnant). The Contractor will furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities needed to implement, maintain, coordinate, and manage a multi-site network of clinical centers to conduct current and future clinical trials of the preceding referenced research. The Data Coordinating Center will facilitate the research for the evaluation of investigational therapies, diagnostic techniques, prevention strategies, epidemiology and natural history of multiple aspects of HIV infection and disease and other high priority infections in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations, in addition to those tasks outlined elsewhere in the Statement of Work for the base contract and its separate options. This contract is for the Data Coordinating Center for domestic and international AID Network clinical trials for the Maternal and Pediatric Infectious Disease Branch (MPIDB) (formerly the Pediatric, Adolescent, and Maternal AIDS Branch). The NICHD Network conducts trials related to preventing and treating HIV infection and its complications in newborns, infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women. Since 1987, has funded the NICHD Network, currently composed of 25 domestic sites in 13 states and territories and 9 international sites in Latin America, plus a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The NICHD Network was established to conduct a single clinical trial evaluating the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prophylaxis for bacterial infections in 376 HIV-infected children. Over time, the NICHD Network has expanded with changes in the demographics of pediatric and maternal HIV infection. The number and type of clinical trial sites in the Network have changed, as well as the types of studies being done. In 1990, the NICHD Network began collaborating with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-funded Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) to expand clinical trial availability at NICHD clinical trials sites. This collaboration made it possible to conduct clinical trials further evaluating primary antiretroviral therapeutic agents, other therapies targeted at opportunistic infections, and interventions to prevent perinatal HIV transmission. This NIAID-NICHD Network collaboration continues today with the NIAID-funded International Pediatric Maternal Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Group. The NICHD Network expanded to include sites with more expertise in obstetrics/gynecology and adolescent medicine, as well as international trial sites in Latin America. As the HIV epidemic has evolved, so has the research addressed by the NICHD Network. In populations of women and children, research gaps related to HIV-associated co-infections  have emerged as HIV research has become increasingly global in nature. As a result, the NICHD Network and NIAID-funded IMPAACT Group broadened their focus to include HIV-associated co-infections, and investigation of vaccines to prevent HIV-related or other high-priority infectious diseases in children, adolescents, and pregnant women, in addition to treatment of HIV infection. In addition to its work with the IMPAACT Group described above, the NICHD Network collaborates with several other networks to design and conduct HIV-related trials. Funded by the NICHD, other NIH Institutes, and other agencies, these networks include (but are not limited to):  Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group ? Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions  Pediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA)  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuberculosis Trials Consortium The NICHD Network relies on flexible contract mechanisms to initiate timely, high-priority initiatives in response to unanticipated research needs and to conduct planned studies with established protocols. In addition to a DCC, the NICHD Network uses a centralized specimen repository to store coded biological specimens from NICHD Network studies. This repository serves as a resource for Network and external investigators who are interested in answering specific questions related to HIV/AIDS."

"9201220","ARIC is a prospective epidemiologic study conducted in four U.S. communities: Washington County, MD; Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; and Minneapolis, MN. The study is designed to monitor the trends in incidence and mortality of coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart failure in communities, and to investigate the etiology, natural history, and progression of subclinical and clinical cardiovascular disease such as CHD, heart failure, and stroke. Accordingly, ARIC includes a Community Surveillance Component and Cohort Study Component.    For the community surveillance, the four communities are investigated to determine the occurrence of hospitalized myocardial infarction and CHD deaths in approximately 800,000 men and women aged 35-84 years. Starting in 2006, surveillance of inpatient (ages 55 years and older) and outpatient heart failure (ages 65 years and older) is included for the events beginning in 2005. Under the new contract, community surveillance will continue to monitor long-term trends in hospitalized MI, CHD deaths, and heart failure (inpatient and outpatient).    For the cohort study, approximately 4,000 individuals aged 45-64 years were recruited by probability sampling from each of the four communities under surveillance. A total of 15,792 participants (11,478 whites, 4,266 African Americans, and 48 other) received an extensive baseline examination in 1987-1989. Three repeat examinations were conducted in 1990-92, 1993-95, and 1996-98. The examinations collected information on demographics, psycho-social and behavioral factors, dietary intakes, physical measurements, and biological and genetic markers. Under the new contract, the surviving cohort members will receive another clinic exam to characterize heart failure stages, identify genetic and environmental factors leading to ventricular dysfunction and vascular stiffness, and assess longitudinal changes in pulmonary function and identify determinants of its decline. Participants are also contacted twice a year by telephone to assess health status.    Under the new contract, the study will also be enhanced with cardiovascular outcomes research to assess quality and outcomes of medical care for heart failure risk factors and heart failure."

"9356798","Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising biomarker for noninvasive diagnostic, prognostic, and follow-up tests for cancer.  However, the relatively low quantity of ctDNA and the rare cancer mutations within large excess of wild-type DNAs have presented many challenges for its application in the clinic.  The goal of the research is to develop our magnetic nanobeads and highly fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles enabled automatic sample preparation and diagnostic assay technology for ctDNA diagnostics.  Our magnetic ctDNA extraction technology offers higher yield and quality of extracted ctDNA compared to maket standard; our magnetic DNA sizing beads ensure DNA library with higher yield and cleanness for better NGS data; the magnetic automation will improve assay throughput, consistency and save cost; and the HFMN gene mutation detection assay provides the opportunity for faster and more economic mutation detection for physician to make discrete treatment management.  The ctDNA diagnostics to be developed through this project can be applied for roughly 70% of breast cancer patients who were subtyped ER+/Her2- and treated with endocrine therapy, at time of relapse, for physicians to make personalized treatment decisions that can lead to more effective outcome.  Once successfully established, our ctDNA diagnostic platform can be expanded to multiple other cancer types, using circulating nucleic acids as reliable biomarkers for earlier cancer detection, patient stratification, and serial monitoring of cancer treatment, and improving treatment for millions of cancer patients."
"9358266","Health disparities related to the provision of, and access to, healthcare in the United States are well documented across racial and ethnic groups. One area of particular interest to health disparities researchers has been solid organ transplantation. Both provider and patient behaviors are implicated as contributing to ethnic variance of medical care in kidney transplantation. Research evidence suggests that an important target for improvement is the patient-provider relationship. Trust is central to this relationship, yet trust has been described as the scarcest of medical resources.    This pilot study explored the perceptions of trust among patients in the kidney transplant process at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center and the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC).Face-to-face interviews were conducted that included questions related to demographic variables, the Trust in Physician Scale, the Trust in Nurse Scale and the Patient Trust Scale. Study accrual was closed in 2006. Total accrual is 113 subjects; sixty-eight subjects were enrolled at the NIH site and forty-five subjects were enrolled at the WRAMC site.   Data analysis reveals the emergence of confidence as a sixth dimension of trust in addition to the following five dimensions previously described in the literature: competence, compassion, control, communication and confidentiality. Data analysis also reveals lower Physician Trust scores and lower Nurse Trust scores among females and individuals with less than a high school diploma. Data analysis is now complete.   The identification of confidence as a sixth dimension of trust contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of trust and the patient-provider relationship. This new information has the potential to facilitate the development of specific interventions designed to improve patient-provider relationships. Manuscript development is in progress."

"9360162","The goal of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic. Such early detection and treatment can have a profound impact on the clinical severity of the condition in the affected child. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the consequences of the targeted disorders can be dire, many causing irreversible neurological damage, intellectual, developmental and physical disabilities, and even death. In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 31 core conditions and that 26 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and by the Secretary of HHS. Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening. Currently, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening.  X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the leukodystrophies that cause damage to the myelin sheath, an insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells in the brain. Women have two X chromosomes and are the carriers of the disease, but since men only have one X chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra X chromosome, they are more severely affected. People with X-ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex. The loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of X-ALD. While nearly all patients with X-ALD suffer from adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, the neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood. The childhood cerebral form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia. The milder adult-onset form is also known as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which typically begins between ages 21 and 35. Symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs, and ataxia. Although adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function. Almost half the women who are carriers of X-ALS will develop a milder form of X-ALD. Adrenal function must be tested periodically in all patients with ALD. Treatment with adrenal hormones can be lifesaving. Symptomatic and supportive treatments for ALD include physical therapy, psychological support, and special education. Prognosis for patients with childhood cerebral X-ALD is generally poor due to progressive neurological deterioration unless bone marrow transplantation is performed early. Death usually occurs within 1 to 10 years after the onset of symptoms. Adult-onset AMN will progress over decades."

"9340941","We have an ongoing project to characterize the antigens of mouse, rat, and human Pneumocystis.  We have previously purified the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) of both rat and human pneumocystis using HPLC.  It is necessary to use Pneumocystis from both sources because the organisms are different species.  Subsequently, we identified a number of clones from a cDNA library of rat Pneumocystis that contain genes encoding for the MSG.  These clones were clearly related but not identical, demonstrating that multiple genes encode the MSG.  We have continued studies to characterize potential antigens of Pneumocystis.  We have cloned a number of human Pneumocystis MSG genes and have expressed a full-length MSG in two fragments.  We developed an ELISA to examine antibody responses to these antigens, and have utilized it to examine sera from patients with or without HIV infection, and with or without a history of PCP, as well as sera from a variety of healthy controls.  In about 15% of healthy patients followed serially we have been able to document changes in antibody titers, suggesting that these individuals have developed reinfection or reactivation of Pneumocystis infection.  We will continue these studies to better understand the epidemiology of Pneumocystis infection in humans.  We have also identified the unique expression site of MSG in human Pneumocystis, and can now identify the MSG variants that are expressed in a patient with PCP.  Within this expression site we have identified a region of tandem repeats that varies among different Pneumocystis isolates, and thus provides a method for typing human Pneumocystis.  We have sequenced MSG variants from a single human pneumocystis isolate and have shown that the isolates can be divided, into 2 subgroups that are genetically distinct.  We have cloned and sequenced MSG variants from additional patients from around the world to see if this will provide information about the distribution of different Pneumocystis strains.  To date we have found substantial variability in MSG variants from different parts of the world, but no clustering by geographic location.  To better examine the MSG repertoire and MSG variability, we have utilized next generation sequencing. By 454 sequencing, we were unable to reconstruct the original sequences using a mixture of plasmids, in large part because of the conserved regions in MSG variants. PacBio sequencing, which allows potentially longer reads, appears to be able to overcome the assembly problem.  We are continuing to evaluate results generated by PacBio sequencing using mouse and human isolates of Pneumocystis.  We are also trying to identify the Pneumocystis protein that is recognized by monoclonal antibody 4D7.  This is a protein present on the surface of Pneumocystis, based on immunofluorescence, and is found in all species of Pneumocystis studied to date.  We have had previously partially purified the antigen and by mass spectrometry analysis identified a number of Pneumocystis proteins that are potential candidates for the 4D7 protein.  We are currently attempting to express these proteins and determine if any of them are recognized by 4D7.  We have identified one protein that does appear to be an antigen in mice, although the recombinant protein does not react with 4D7 by Immunoblot.  We are also attempting to purify the 4D7 antigen to greater purity using the antibody covalently attached to affinity column.  We have also expressed a p57 protein of P. murina that is predicted to be a surface protein based on a predicted GPI-type anchor.  Based on western blot studies this is an antigen recognized by mouse serum from exposed or infected animals.  We are conducting studies to characterize expression of this protein by Pneumocystis. We have recently sequenced the genomes of 3 Pneumocystis species, and will be using the data from the genomes to identify potential surface proteins that may be antigens, based on the predicted amino acid sequence characteristics.   The goal of this study is to better understand the pathogenesis of Pneumocystis pneumonia with the hope that we can use this information to control or prevent this disease."

"9351769","Modern drug discovery methods require the use of automated liquid handling and dispensing systems for screening large numbers of candidate compounds to identify new drug candidates. The use of these high throughput methods has been made possible by the development of automated systems that can dispense extremely small volumes of reagent at high speed. However, many of the reagents used in testing these experiments contain salts or proteins which can clog the small dispensing nozzles after they crystallize or precipitate out of solution. At present, there is no way to dynamically monitor the dispensing process so clogged nozzles can contaminate a large portion of the run leading to significant waste in both cost and time."
"9354947","Persistent and chronic infections are maintained by a dynamic modulation of microbe - host cell interactions.  During this process, microorganisms evolve and adapt to the host by regulating the expression of different genes, in particular those involved in virulence.  At the bacterial population level, specific (possibly hypervirulent) clones may predominate at different times in individuals as well as groups of patients. The timely storage of microbial pathogens in the microbiology laboratory together with the availability of clinical data from the patients allows following virulence traits, host adaptation and changing epidemiology of the pathogens.  Two specific examples are summarized below: 1) Work on Mycobacterium abscessus revealed high relatedness between strains involved in global outbreaks in cystic fibrosis patients. Outbreak strains undergo adaptative changes potentially towards more virulent and/or transmissible populations. Interestingly, M. abscessus virulence and adaptative features share striking similarities to those in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 2) We have recently described a novel and emerging species of molds causing disease in immunocompromised patients. One example is the recovery of a recently described species of Mucor spp from several immunocompromised patients. Whole genome sequencing and comparative genomics of invasive and non invasive Mucor strains is underway."
"9356691","A peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) using 177Lu/90Y-labeled somatostatin analogs have been proven to induce objective response in 30-45% of patients with advanced/progressive neuroendocrine tumors. The complete response to beta-emitter PRRT is rare. This is due to the fact that NETs are diagnosed at late stage of disease; the NETs patients with remissions could develop resistance to beta-radiation therapy that could be overcome by alphaemitter-targeted-therapy (TAT). The commercial potential of TAT has been confirmed by recent introduction of Xofigo for therapy of bone metastasis in prostate cancer; and remissions of NETs in patients undergoing therapy with [213Bi]DOTATOC and [225Ac]DOTATATOC. The TAT has a potential to revolutionize treatment of NETs whether applied alone or supported by beta-emitter PRRT. It can significantly enhance therapeutic efficacy of PRRT without side effects on non-targeted normal tissues. In the proposed research, we will determine the commercial feasibility of [212Pb]-octreotate. The objective of this Phase I SBIR is to: 1) Determine the feasibility of radiosynthesis of [212Pb]octreotate produced using AREVA Med high purity 212Pb generator; (2) Evaluate the pharmacokinetic, efficacy and toxicity of [212Pb]octreotate therapy in AR42J-xenographs; With success in these aims, we expect to advance our compound toward initiation of clinical studies and submission of NDA."

"9357193","Approximately 15 percent of patients recover from hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection while 85 percent become persistently infected with various degrees of associated chronic liver disease. In this study, comparisons will be made between patients who rapidly recover, those who have delayed recovery, those with persistent infection and stable chronic disease and those with rapidly progressive, fatal infection. The parameters measured will be viral burden (initially and over time), HCV genotype, the number of viral quasi-species (extent of viral heterogeneity) at the time of infection and subsequently, neutralizing antibody responses and, T-cell helper, proliferative and cytotoxic responses. The goal is to determine if any of these parameters can predict outcome. Studies to date have shown no correlation with genotype since the population is fairly homogeneous for HCV genotype 1. However, there does appear to be a correlation between viral quasi-species and disease outcome. Using rare specimens obtained during the first 16 weeks of HCV infection, we have measured the mean Hamming distance that reflects the extent of viral diversity (the degree of sequence divergence within the viral quasi-species). We have found that the mean Hamming distance 12 to 16 weeks after the onset of acute infection predicts whether the patient will recover from HCV infection or develop persistent infection and chronic liver disease. Patients who recover have a declining Hamming distance as antibody to HCV develops, signifying immunologic containment and then clearance of the virus. In contrast, the majority of patients demonstrate an increased mean hamming distance as antibody appears. This suggests that if the immune response is not sufficient to clear the virus, it paradoxically exerts immune pressure that results in mutations (escape variants) that lead to persistent infection. Interestingly, patients with fulminant hepatitis have a very low degree of viral diversity because they succumb to the infection before the immune system can clear the virus or exert immune pressure. This study has been published (Science 288:339-344.2000). In ongoing studies, we are measuring the viral quasi-species throughout the long-term course of HCV infection and the relation of the quasispecies other parameters to the outcome of HCV infection.  Thus far, studies have shown that patients with chronic HCV infection have impaired CD4 and CD8 cell responses to all HCV antigens compared to patients who recover from acute HCV infection.We have also found that neutralizing antibodies do not correlate with recovery from acute HCV infection, but rather continue to increase in strength and breath of activity over the course of chronic infection. Despite these antibodies, escape mutants continue to evade the immune response. Most recently, we have compared patients who have severe, rapidly progressive hepatitis C to those who have a stable indolent course. We found that patients with rapid progression have  a delayed or impaired immunologic response to HCV, an inability to reduice viral load early in infection, a greater degree of viral diversity, a diminished interferon response and, importantly, an early and sustained elevation of the pro-fibrogenic cytokine, MCP-1. We are now testing in a larger cohort wheteher MCP-1 could serve as a predictive marker of severe fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Ongoing studies are looking for other cytokines or micro RNAs that might predict fibrosis progression. In this regard we have shown that the miRNA, Let-7, is a predictive marker of fibrosis progression."

"9215012","Project Summary/Abstract  Preventing the onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its recurrence, and reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with AMI, remain of significant public health and clinical concern. Monitoring contemporary trends in AMI incidence, treatment, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes is of considerable importance given periodic national updates of treatment guidelines, emphasis on reducing hospital readmissions, and revised definitions and classifications of AMI. Continuously supported by the NHLBI, we have conducted more than 35 years of population-based surveillance of AMI incidence and attack rates, hospital management practices, and the in-hospital and long-term prognosis associated with AMI among residents of central MA hospitalized at all central MA medical centers. We have a highly experienced team of cardiologists, epidemiologists, clinical informatics, and health services researchers who will build on multi- decade long trends (1975-2011) in our principal study endpoints examined previously in this study to the two new study years of patients hospitalized with AMI at all central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017.  To sustain our efforts into the era of electronic medical records (EMRs), and after implementation of the ICD-10 system in 2015, we will develop a new automated AMI surveillance system that efficiently utilizes EMRs by taking advantage of state-of-art natural language processing (NLP) methods that will be compatible with ICD-10 (Aim 1). We will use the new NLP method to streamline traditional chart review-based collection of socio-demographic, clinical, treatment, and hospital and post-discharge outcomes data in patients hospitalized with AMI at all 11 central MA medical centers in 2014 and 2017. The data extracted from NLP-streamlined chart reviews will be used to validate and refine the NLP system. Issues related to changes from ICD-9 to ICD- 10 will be carefully addressed. The new NLP-enriched EMR-based surveillance system will eventually be implemented in all participating central MA hospitals. Using the NLP-enriched and EMR-based surveillance data, we will monitor the contemporary clinical epidemiology of AMI, and out-of-hospital deaths due to coronary disease, and changing landscape, over a more than 40 year period (1975-2017) (Aim 2).  The new EMR-based and NLP-enriched system will enhance the population-based surveillance of acute coronary disease. This new system will be cost-effective, more efficient and near-real time, have greater accuracy and precision, and can be readily updated to accommodate changes in information technologies and broadly applicable to other hospital systems. It will support our continued efforts to provide unique community- based observational data on several populations that are often excluded from clinical trials, and that are increasing in numbers, namely the elderly and patients with multiple morbidities. Furthermore, it will generate critical data to inform more national clinical guidelines on the enhanced prevention and management of AMI. If successful, the system can serve as a model and be implemented statewide in MA and elsewhere in the US."
"9215035","SUMMARY Women with delayed menopause and those who give birth to children later in life show less cardiovascular disease and live longer than other women. Women with constitutively long leukocyte telomere length (LTL) have delayed menopause, show less cardiovascular disease and also live longer than other women. The central hypothesis of this proposal is a logical extension of these findings. It posits that women who bear children later in life without the use of assisted reproductive technologies might have a constitutively long LTL. A corollary of this hypothesis is that offspring of these women might have a long LTL as well, given that LTL is highly heritable. Moreover, children born to older women are typically conceived by older men. As the offspring's LTL is positively associated with paternal age at the time of conception of the offspring, LTL of offspring conceived by older women might be constitutively longer than average due to the joint effects of heritability of a longer LTL from the mothers and being conceived by older fathers. This central hypothesis and its corollary will be tested in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) ? a pregnancy and birth cohort with a Biobank of leukocyte DNA samples and a comprehensive dataset. The aims of the study are: 1) measure LTL in 1700 mothers who gave birth at ages 18 years or older, including 1000 mothers who gave birth at the age 35 years and older; 2) measure LTL in 300 mothers who gave birth at the age of 35 years and older with the aid of in-vitro fertilization; 3) measure LTL in the 2,000 fathers (the sexual partners) of the mothers in aims 1 and 2); and 4) measure LTL in newborns of these parentsand perform an instrumental variable analysis, further exploring the relationship between maternal LTL and fecundity. Learning about LTL using the mother-father-newborn study design will broaden our understanding of the familial framework of female fecundity and of having long (and short) LTL. This understanding is vital for public health, given that LTL is associated with a host of aging-related disorders and with longevity in contemporary humans. "

"9314996","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis affects more than 200 million people worldwide. Therapeutic approaches to osteoporotic bone loss have focused on either anabolic or antiresorptive agents. However, there is a pressing need to develop new agents that target both bone formation and resorption. NELL-1 is a potent pro-osteogenic protein most studied for its local bone forming effects. Preliminary studies have suggested that NELL-1 also exerts a systemic, protective function against osteoporotic bone loss via modulating both osteoblast and osteoclast activity. These cellular effects of NELL-1 appear to occur in large part via activation of Wnt/-catenin signaling. Excitingly, we have recently identified the presence of two NELL-1 isoforms (NELL-1570 and NELL-1810) - of which the former demonstrates significantly greater bone forming effects. This has led to our central hypothesis that NELL-1 is a promising systemic therapeutic agent for osteoporosis with ability to (1) effectively reverse osteoporotic bone loss, and (2) regulate bone homeostasis by regulating osteoblast (OB) and osteoclast (OC) differentiation and activity via Wnt/-catenin signaling. Furthermore, we anticipate that the shor isoform of NELL-1 (NELL-1570) will demonstrate more potent in vivo anabolic effects. We will test these hypotheses in two specific aims: AIM 1: Compare NELL-1570 and NELL-1810 for the systemic treatment of OVX-induced osteoporosis in mice. Our preliminary data show that systemic rNELL-1 (NELL-1810) reverses OVX-induced bone loss in mice. However, accumulating evidence suggests that NELL-1570 has significantly more potent effects on osteoprogenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. AIM 1 will directly compare systemic administration of NELL-1810 and NELL-1570. Through radiologic, histologic, histomorphometric and biomechanical analyses, we will examine bone density, formation, turnover and strength.  AIM 2: Compare the isolated cellular effects of NELL-1570 and NELL-1810 on OB/OC progenitor cells and OB/OC activity. In parallel, AIM 2 will evaluate systemic rNELL-1 effects on the number and activity of stem cells, OB and OC cells, as well as Wnt/-catenin signaling. Cells will be isolated from animals after systemic treatment with NELL-1570 or NELL-1810, and examined by flow cytometry, proliferation and differentiation assays.  Novel rNELL-1 based therapies can improve the current standard of care for the treatment of osteoporosis, and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures that cost $25 billion annually. As well, improved basic biological understanding of rNELL-1 regulation of Wnt signaling may lead to future therapies for other disease entities characterized by deregulated Wnt signaling."

"9387667","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract: The objective of the Health Disparities Research Scholars Training Program (HDRS) is to provide training at the postdoctoral level in interdisciplinary research that addresses disparities in health status and health outcomes among minority populations as well as to recruit underrepresented minorities into academic research careers. We believe that integrating biomedical sciences, public health sciences, and sociocultural and behavioral sciences are prerequisite to addressing the linkages of macro-societal levels of being with pathogenesis of disease so important in addressing health disparities. Thus, the HDRS Training Program provides interdisciplinary and multifaceted opportunities for research that includes not only biomedical and behavioral sciences, but also investigation into quality of care, including cost, access and satisfaction with services; the causes of and barriers to reducing health disparities; attitudes towards health, language spoken, educational level, community profile and socioeconomic status; identification of assessment measures for outcomes, quality and appropriateness of health care services. The NIH and IOM call for greater diversity in the research workforce as a means to address health disparities. Attracting minorities from various disciplines such as physicians, nurses, pharmacists, sociologists, social workers, and nutritionists, into academic research careers will help in this endeavor. To address not only the broad array of research areas outlined above but also the interdisciplinary nature of the possible candidates, the faculty is interdisciplinary and consists f physician scientists, perinatal researchers, sociologists, nurse scientists, nutritional scientists epidemiologists and economists. To promote interdisciplinary research and disciplinary cross training, we will provide two mentors for each Scholar, balancing the biomedical/basic science and behavioral/demography and epidemiology approaches to address health disparities. This will increase the likelihood that both the Scholars and mentors will be crossed trained. We also will train HDRS trainees in the techniques of Community Based Participatory Research. With funding from the NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award and the UW Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, we have an infrastructure in place to support the program. The HDRS Program will influence and redirect the enormous intellectual capacity that exists on the UW- Madison campus toward addressing health disparities. Since retention of minorities in academic careers is essential, we are committed to making the environment supportive, academically rewarding, culturally enriching and professionally satisfying."
"9185335","The centromere inheritance paradox is that although centromeres control genetic inheritance by directing chromosome segregation, centromeres themselves are not encoded by a particular DNA sequence. Instead, centromeres are defined epigenetically by the presence of nucleosomes containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A. That a protein is the mark poses a problem for maintaining centromere identity during oocyte development because oocytes arrest in prophase I for years or decades (in humans) before resuming the cell cycle to complete meiosis. In cycling somatic cells, CENP-A partitions between sister chromatids during DNA replication and reloads in early G1 phase, which maintains CENP-A levels between cell cycles. These mechanisms do not explain how centromere identity is maintained in the oocyte because there is no known mechanism to assemble new CENP-A nucleosomes according to the established paradigm for loading in G1. Oocytes are unique in that they arrest in prophase I, and then centromeres must be maintained until the cell cycle resumes in response to hormonal stimuli. In principle, two factors could contribute to maintain centromere identity: (1) the intrinsic stability of CENP-A nucleosomes and (2) a possible prophase I loading mechanism to replace CENP-A that is lost with age. Our preliminary data show that both make significant contributions. Aim 1 will define CENP-A stability over the reproductive lifespan of the animal, determine the mechanism of loading during prophase I, and determine the functional significance of this loading mechanism. Our previous biophysical and structural studies showed that CENP-A nucleosomes are ~10-fold more rigid than their canonical H3 counterparts. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that structural rigidity of CENP-A underlies its long-term stability and centromere inheritance in the oocyte. We will identify point mutations that compromise structural rigidity and stability but localize normally and support centromere function in cycling somatic cells. We will also generate knock-in animals of selected mutants to test the functional consequences of reduced stability for maintaining centromere identity and function in oocytes. Overall, our experiments will provide the first insight into mechanisms underlying centromere inheritance in the mammalian female germline, and connect atomic level structural insights to long-term maintenance of centromere identity and ultimately reproductive fitness. Our approach is highly interdisciplinary, combining structural biology and biophysics with in vivo reproductive biology, to gain insight into how oocytes maintain structures assembled during entry into meiotic prophase I that must then function years or decades later during oocyte maturation. Such understanding has clear health implications given the decline in fertility associated with increasing maternal age and women delaying the time of childbirth."
"9186519","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proto-oncogene c-Myc is frequently deregulated in human tumors and its overexpression associates with poor prognosis in patients. Particularly, 90% of Burkitt's lymphoma cases exhibit constitutive expression of c- Myc as a result of translocations. Considering the paradoxical role of c-Myc as an inducer of both proliferation and apoptosis, it is essential to understand how c-Myc dependent tumors disable the apoptosis arm of c-Myc while maintaining its pro-tumorigenic properties. Our group has shown that activation of the PERK-eiF2a-ATF4  arm of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a protein homeostasis mechanism is required for survival of c- Myc-induced  apoptosis  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo,  suggesting  this  pathway  is  utilized  by  c-Myc  overexpressing  cells  to  overcome  oncogenic  stress.  Moreover,  evidence  for  activation  of  the  PERK  arm  of  the  UPR  in  lymphoma patient samples compared to normal B cells bolsters the clinical relevance of this pathway during c- Myc  induced  lymphomagenesis.  However,  how  PERK  mediates  its  pro-survival  roles,  including  activation  of  cytoprotective autophagy, remains unexplored. Employing ATF4-/- MEFs, I have demonstrated that one of the  downstream  effector  of  PERK,  ATF4,  promotes  survival  and  mediates  activation  of  autophagy  during  c-Myc  induction.  ATF4-dependent  autophagy  in  the  context  of  hypoxia  eliminates  Reactive  Oxygen  Species  (ROS)  and  accumulated  proteins,  recycling  nutrients  to  fuel  growth.  Although ATF4 has been shown to promote survival in extrinsic stresses, it is not clear how it promotes survival during oncogene-induced, intrinsic stress.  Furthermore,  the  augmentation  of  protein  synthesis  and  unique  metabolism  of  c-Myc  driven  cancer  cells,  makes them prone to both ER and oxidative stress. Therefore, activation of stress coping mechanisms, such  as  those  that  promote  degradation  of  excess  proteins  as  well  as  damaged  organelles  and  promote  redox  homeostasis become vital to overcome oncogene induced stress. Thus, I hypothesize that ATF4 promotes survival of c-Myc overexpressing cells by inducing autophagy and suppressing oxidative stress. To  test  my  hypothesis,  I  will  employ  both  cell  culture  and  a  relevant  transgenic  mouse  model  system.  The transgenic mouse model will be the first to test the role of ATF4 during tumor initiation and progression in vivo.  Using  this  syste  I  can  deplete  ATF4  in  the  cell  of  origin  of  lymphomas,  B-cells,  in  an  established  model of  lymphoma,  E?-Myc.  Additionally,  I  will  perform  microarray  analysis  to  identify  ATF4-dependent  pathways  during c-Myc activation. Despite the observation that ATF4 is upregulated in lymphomas, its requirement in c- Myc induced tumorigenesis in vivo has not been well studied. My study will provide insights in to mechanisms that c-Myc overexpressing cells rely on for survival and may extend to other c-Myc dependent tumors."
"9188783","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Attention impairment is ubiquitous in TBI survivors. This is a devastating impairment because attention is the backbone of cognitive systems. Attention is requisite for other cognitive processes that are vital to everyday functioning such as memory, problem solving, language skills, and the cognitive control of behavior. Studies of attention training have shown improved attention on laboratory measures, but limited translation to real-world tasks2. Notably, these previously-tested rehabilitation approaches have not included training in the very cogni- tive processes needed for translation of training to everyday tasks which include internal verbalization and self- monitoring, also called metacognitive strategies 3, 4. One training method for metacognitive strategies has shown promise 5, 6, but is lacking in basic attention training. Rehabilitation specialists have recently argued for a rehabilitation approach wherein both basic foundational attention and metacognitive strategies should be synergistically combined 7. Consequently, we will test an innovative combination of direct-attention training and metacognitive training for which the other compensates disadvantages of each. Because of the promise of each type of training separately, and the potential additive effects of the combination, it is critical to test this combined attention and metacognitive training in Veteran survivors of chronic moderate-to-severe TBI (m/sTBI). We will address the following two specific aims: We propose to conduct a pilot study to examine CRT effects in a group of Veterans with chronic m/sTBI, focused on remediating attention-control impairments using both direct-attention and metacognitive-strategy training approaches in a AB/BA crossover design with 1- month follow-up to address the following two specific aims: 1) Test treatment response to combined direct- attention and metacognitive-strategy training in Veterans with chronic m/sTBI; and 2) identify mechanisms and biomarkers of rehabilitation-related neuroplasticity. Under the first aim we will test for effects of combined di- rect-attention and metacognitive-strategy trainig on measures of complex functional activities and neurocogni- tive tests of attention-control functions. Under the second aim, we will test effects of our CRT approach on be- havioral and brain activity while participants perform a well-validated attentional task that probes the functio of three dissociable attentional systems. The approach is innovative because it combines a theoretically motivat- ed and novel approach to address a significant source of disability in Veteran survivors of TBI. The proposed research is significant because findings will form the foundation for a larger-scale trial to enable us to deter- mine the durability of gains and the functional impact of treatment on Veteran's real world activities and to more positively shape healthcare for our Veterans who are suffering from TBI."

"9379719","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01), submitted by Dr. Sydney Schaefer, Assistant Professor at Utah State University. The purpose of this K01 application is to strategically enhance the candidate's career in the areas of neuropsychology, disability, and geriatric physical rehabilitation through targeted coursework, clinical exposure, and career products. The candidate's supportive and successful institutional environment ensures that the formal career development plan will add to her existing expertise in human movement. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent, tenured scientist with an externally funded research program that will impact the field of physical rehabilitation for older adults. Currently more than 40% of ll physical rehabilitation cases are adults age 65 or older. A commonly used treatment is task-specific training, in which patients repetitively practice a functional motor skill that underlies  meaningful activity of daily living. Current rehabilitative practice does not, however, provide older patients with enough time in therapy to address multiple skills; thus, older adults must be able to generalize the benefits of their rehabilitative treatment. The purpose of this four-year research plan is to test whether older adults can generalize learned information after task-specific training, and if generalization is influenced by cognitive status, as many older adults ar susceptible to cognitive decline. In this project, adults age 65 or older will train on one functioal motor task that simulates feeding, but will be tested on a different untrained functional motor task that simulates dressing. The central hypothesis is that the untrained task (simulated dressing) will become less difficult and less distractible after practicing the trained task (simulated feeding), but that these generalized benefits will be attenuated in adults with lower cognitive status. Results will be compared to control data from subjects with no motor training, and this hypothesis will be tested using cost-effective real-world tools. If the generalization of motor learning between functional motor tasks depends on cognitive status, then future research will identify which specific cognitive impairments best predict physical rehabilitative outcomes. Alternatively, if older adults can generalize motor learning between functional motor tasks regardless of cognitive status, then physically disabled adults with dementia may benefit equally from rehabilitation as adults without cognitive impairment. The candidate's additional training in cognitive assessment and disablement models will complement her research plan, preparing her for future R01 submissions that address physical rehabilitation in older adults and thereby maximize their quality of life."
"9380086","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excess dietary salt causes target organ damage and increases the risk for adverse cardiovascular (CV) events independent of blood pressure (BP). Recent data in salt-resistant, normotensive rodents suggest that high dietary salt enhances the excitability or gain of sympathetic circuits, exaggerates sympathetic and CV responses to various stimuli, and increases BP variability (BPV). There are limited data regarding the impact of dietary salt intake on sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and CV function in salt-resistant humans as well as the underlying mechanisms contributing to these adverse effects. Our long-term goal is to determine how dietary salt adversely affects BP regulation and CV health. The objective of this proposal is 2-fold: (1) to comprehensively evaluate the impact of dietary salt intake on SNA and CV reactivity and BPV in normotensive humans, and (2) to identify novel mechanisms underlying these adverse neurogenic effects of dietary salt using salt-resistant rodents. Our working hypothesis is that high dietary salt elevates plasma [Na+] to activate forebrain osmoreceptors via the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This subsequently sensitizes neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) through a local activation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and decrease in resting K+ conductance. In turn, both human subjects and animals have exaggerated SNA and BP responses to a variety of stimuli thereby leading to increased BPV and greater risk for adverse CV events. We will test this hypothesis through 4 specific aims: 1) Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that high dietary salt increases SNA and CV reactivity in normotensive adults, 2) Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that high dietary salt increases BPV in normotensive adults, 3) Aim 3 will determine the extent by which a high salt diet induces neuroplasticity and alterations in membrane properties of RVLM neurons via local activation of AT1R to exaggerate SNA reflexes and increase BPV, and 4) Aim 4 will determine the extent by which changes in plasma sodium concentration and ENaC alter RVLM neurons and exaggerate SNA reflexes and increase BPV. To address both objectives through these aims, we have established a unique multi-institutional, multi-PI collaboration that includes a human CV physiologist and an animal neurophysiologist. This combination uniquely positions the research team to readily translate findings in animal models to humans and impact CV health. The expected outcome is to definitively demonstrate that dietary salt loading increases CV reactivity and BPV through a sympathetic nervous system mechanism that originates in the brain. The proposed research is significant, as these studies will provide empirical evidence that dietary salt intake impacts neurohumoral control of the circulation in salt-resistant humans. In addition, the proposed studies in rodents will identify novel mechanisms underlying these adverse effects and thereby create a platform for new therapeutic targets. The proposed research is innovative because it will identify a novel neurogenic action of dietary salt in human CV regulation."
"9380359","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of novel routes to stereochemically and structurally complex targets of biological interest remains of paramount importance. New strategies, bond disconnections, and catalysts that exploit standard functional groups in innovative ways each contribute to the overall goal of increased scope and efficiency, and decreased time and cost. Catalysis, the use of substoichiometric amounts of reagent, without the need for covalent attachment or pretreatment, carries with it the promise of greener, more efficient, more selective methods for synthesis. This proposal seeks to develop novel methods to use traditional functional groups in non-traditional ways, accessing hitherto unavailable bond disconnection strategies in an effort to greatly expand our toolkit. In the context of this researc, we will apply these strategies to the formation of lactams, common structural features across many families of biologically active molecules. The specific goals of this research are as follows: 1) Develop general catalysts for the asymmetric intermolecular Stetter reaction; 2) Explore couplings of imminiums and enals via the homoenolate reactivity pathway; 3) Investigate oxidative pathways of enal activation; 4) Control oxidatively initiated [3+2]-type annulation of enals leading to cyclopentanone products. The long-term impact of this science is to enable chemists to rapidly assemble complex structures with high efficiency."
"9390572","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is often stated that the oral health problems facing our nation extend beyond primary disease or developmental pathologies, but are complex and multi-factorial to include genetic, social, cultural, behavioral and environmental factors. In order to effectively manage oral health problems we need to address the multi- factorial nature of these conditions.

Virtually all of our program graduates have maintained academic ties consistent with the Yale paradigm of teaching and practice."
"9089596","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile pathogen that causes a broad spectrum of acute and chronic infections. An important determinant of the chronic infections is the ability of S. aureus to develop a biofilm on host tissue or medical implant material. Biofilms are problematic for treatment due to their inherent resistance to antimicrobial therapies and host immune defenses, and these problems are compounded by the growing levels of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The long-term goal of my research program is to understand S. aureus biofilm development pathways in order to improve treatment approaches. Our studies have demonstrated that the quorum-sensing system, also called the accessory gene regulator or agr, is a key mediator of the biofilm lifestyle. For S. aureus to leave a biofilm and seed new sites, the agr system has to be reactivated to disassemble the biofilm structure, and once cells have dispersed, they regain susceptibility to antibiotic treatment. Recent studies in our group have identified a prominent role for agr-regulated extracellular proteases in this mechanism. Our central hypothesis is that S. aureus has an agr-regulated biofilm dispersal pathway that is mediated by cysteine proteases (called Staphopains). Our preliminary findings also demonstrate that biofilm inhibitory factors are produced by human neutrophils, leading us to hypothesize that host defenses can tap into the dispersal pathway and destroy biofilms. For Specific Aim 1, we hypothesize that agr and Rot regulation of Staphopain production controls biofilm dispersal. To evaluate this hypothesis and further define the dispersal mechanism, we will (i) investigate the contribution of Rot repressor to the agr-protease regulatory link through molecular approaches and biofilm assays; (ii) assess the role of Staphopains in biofilm maturation and dispersal; and (iii) test the conservation of the regulatory cascade in vivo using infection imaging in a murine catheter biofilm model. We developed a surface shaving proteomic method to identify Staphopain A cleavage targets. Using this method, we discovered that the Serine-Aspartate-Repeat (Sdr) proteins are removed by Staphopain A from the S. aureus surface in a biofilm state. We hypothesize that the Staphopains cleave the Sdr surface proteins to promote biofilm dispersal. To test this hypothesis, in Specific Aim 2 we will (i) perform an in-depth characterization of the function of Sdr proteins in biofilm development; (ii) biochemically define the mode of action of Staphopain A and B on the Sdr's; and (iii) determine the impact of glycosylation on Sdr protein processing and biofilm function. Finally, we discovered that S. aureus biofilms are hypersensitive to neutrophil granules (in collaboration with Dr. William Nauseef). Through purification, we identified the protease Cathepsin G as the primary anti-biofilm agent, and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) also showed activity. We hypothesize that neutrophil granule proteases inhibit biofilms by cleaving the Sdr proteins. To test this hypothesis, in Specific Aim 3 we will (i) perform neutrophil protease processing studies on the Sdr proteins; (ii) assess the impact of neutrophil pathway inhibition on anti-biofilm activities; ad (iii) identify and characterize Cathepsin G and HNE released proteins from the surface of biofilms. An improved understanding of biofilm dispersal mechanisms, and host modulation of these mechanisms, will aid the development of therapeutics that can provide innovative treatments for S. aureus chronic infections."
"9178623","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural killer (NK) cells and their receptors have been gaining prominence in the HIV field as more connections to HIV acquisition, progression, and viral evolution are being uncovered. One early finding in the field was that HIV-1-infected patients possessing the activating NK cell receptor KIR3DS1 and certain HLA class I alleles have a significantly slower progression to AIDS. Subsequent research has shown that KIR3DS1 triggers NK cell-mediated killing and cytokine production, and work from our group has demonstrated that KIR3DS1- expressing NK cells in co-culture with HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells have a superior ability to suppress viral replication when certain HLA class I alleles are present. However, no one has been able to show an isolated interaction between KIR3DS1 and HLA class I. This has hampered our mechanistic understanding of how KIR3DS1 confers protection in HIV-1 pathogenesis and leaves open many possibilities as to what is triggering and interacting with KIR3DS1. Thus, the present goal of this study is to discover the KIR3DS1 ligand. To this end, we will implement a battery of unbiased, innovative, and complementary molecular biological and cellular immunological approaches - including use of soluble fusion constructs, reporter cells, and immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry - to robustly identify the KIR3DS1 ligand. In addition, we aim to determine the cellular conditions that induce the expression of KIR3DS1 ligands in HIV-1 and other disease settings in which KIR3DS1 has been shown to be involved (e.g. other viral infections, cancer, autoimmunity, transplantation). This wil provide mechanistic insights as to how NK cell function is regulated through KIR3DS1:ligand interactions and, ultimately, elucidate how KIR3DS1 is able to slow HIV-1 disease progression, providing a new basis for NK cell-centered immunotherapeutic strategies that can help treat or control HIV/AIDS."
"9189050","Project Summary The work outlined in this application stems from our recent discovery that dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage- gated CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels form clusters that undergo dynamic allosteric interactions, which allow cooperative gating of these channels in cardiac myocytes. The significance of these findings is underscored by our demonstration that coupled activation of these channels modulates pace-making activity in sinoatrial node (SAN) cells (CaV1.2 and CaV1.3) and contraction in ventricular myocytes (CaV1.2) under physiological and pathological conditions. The experiments proposed in this application test a novel model for the regulation of CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channel activity in SAN and ventricular myocytes. In this model, CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels undergo reciprocal physical and functional interactions that are initiated by increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). During the action potential, channel-to-channel coupling is initiated when membrane depolarization opens CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels, allowing a small amount of Ca2+ to enter the cell. The incoming Ca2+ binds to calmodulin (CaM), thereby promoting physical coupling of adjacent channels via the pre-IQ domains located in the C-tails of the channels. Physical contact increases the activity of adjoined channels. As individual channels within a cluster inactivate and close, [Ca2+]i decreases and coupling fades, but persists longer than the current that evoked it, serving as a type of `molecular memory'. A new concept in our model is that the overall activity of CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels within a cluster depends on the number of channels that couple and the duration of these interactions. The project will test the physiological and pathological implications of this model in three specific aims. Specific aim 1 tests the hypothesis that coupling between CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels in SAN cells regulates pace-making activity. Specific aim 2 tests the hypothesis that persistent CaV1.2 channel coupling in ventricular myocytes induces long-term potentiation of Ca2+ currents and increases contractility. Specific aim 3 tests the hypothesis that long-QT syndrome CaM mutants increase the probability of arrhythmogenesis by altering functional coupling between CaV1.2 channels. Diverse, state-of-the-art methods, including patch-clamp electrophysiology, optical clamping, optogenetics and confocal, TIRF, and super-resolution microscopy, will be used to achieve these aims."

Through this program she will gain valuable research experience in the fields of islet cell biology, in vivo physiology, obesity, and metabolic pathways Dr. Dawn Belt Davis and Dr. Michael MacDonald will serve as the primary co- mentors for her career and scientific development. Dr. Davis is an emerging leader in the field of diabetes and obesity research. Dr. MacDonald is an established leader in diabetes and metabolism and has a proven track record of mentoring both basic and clinical scientists. Dr. Linnemann has also assembled a mentoring committee comprised of outstanding scientists to provide the full spectrum of career development and scientific guidance. Her mentoring committee includes Dr. Vincent Cryns, Dr. Molly Carnes, and Dr. Michelle Kimple. The research plan involves the study of pancreatic beta cell protection from apoptosis in an obese environment. Obesity is associated with generalized inflammation and an increase in circulating cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). However, there is conflicting evidence as to the specific role of IL-6 in an obese state. Preliminary data suggests that circulating IL-6 initiates a cascade of intra-islet production of classic gut hormones, namely GLP-1 and cholecystokinin (CCK), that modulate beta cell survival and thus islet mass. Taking this into account, the central hypothesis is that obesity driven IL-6 stimulates adaptive stress response that promotes beta cell function and mass regulation. The specific aims of this application include 1) To determine how a multicomponent IL-6 driven pathway regulates beta cell survival; and 2) To define the in vivo role of IL-6 in obesity driven beta cell mass regulation. Together, these aims will allow the identification of a novel pathway in the protection of beta cells from apoptosis that may serve as a therapeutic target to aid in beta cell mass expansion."
"9394188","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Disorders of sleep and associative learning co-occur in many diseases, including primary sleep disorders, plasticity disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders. These widespread connections between learning and sleep in human neurological disease indicate that there are neuronal circuits shared by sleep and learning in humans. Because these circuits are shared, therapeutic approaches designed for one system may also benefit the other, for example, treatments for sleep disturbance may also ameliorate symptoms of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, understanding the neural circuits connecting sleep and learning has the potential for significant scientific and translational impact. However, sleep and learning are both complex behaviors, and tracing a neuron-scale circuit for either is not currently possible in mammals. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has a simpler nervous system than a mammal (about 100,000 neurons), while still displaying robust learning and sleep behaviors. Furthermore, the circuits for associative memory and sleep have been well studied in fruit flies. We propose to study the connections between a pair of neurons known to be necessary for both memory and sleep, the Dorsal Paired Medial neurons (DPMs), and other memory and sleep associated neurons in the fruit fly brain. We hypothesize that DPMs increase in activity after learning, which has two main effects. First, increased DPM activity causes the flies to sleep more. Second, DPMs inhibit dopamine neurons that cause forgetting of recent experiences, thereby improving the formation of new memories. We will test this hypothesis by: 1. Measuring connections between DPMs, dopamine neurons, and an important fly memory system, the Mushroom Body, 2. Blocking the DPMs, and measuring if learning still has an effect on sleep, and 3. Blocking the effect of DPMs on dopamine neurons, and measuring if formation of new memories is affected. Testing this hypotheses will provide important new information. First, we will better understand how an experience is turned into a long term memory in a simple brain, giving us deeper insight into how out own minds work. Second, we will know if the effects that a memory-promoting neuron has on sleep and memory are independent or related to one another. Third, we will gain greater insight into how dopamine neurons that signal value can simultaneously promote learning new memories and forgetting old memories."

"9402748","Project Summary Health risks such as smoking, physical inactivity, heavy alcohol consumption, obesity, high blood pressure, and inflammation are important determinants of premature mortality among U.S. adults. Further, these risks are socially patterned. Research has shown that educational attainment, marital status, fertility patterns, and employment status are all associated with adult health behaviors and outcomes (Cutler & Lleras-Muney 2010; Pampel et al. 2010; Umberson et al. 2010; Waite & Gallagher 2002). Yet, we know relatively little about how the aforementioned health risks are patterned by combinations of these social statuses, even though they are interdependent. For example, entering the workforce is often a competing alternative to further education, or individuals may delay parenthood until after marriage. This project focuses on how the transition to adulthood, defined as the sequencing and combination of different markers of adulthood, influences the health risks of young adults. The overall objective of this research project is to understand the development of differential health risks of young adults aged 26 to 32 in the United States.  The specific aims of the project are to: (1) distinguish unique transition to adulthood profiles of U.S. young adults through examination of the timing, sequence, and grouping of adulthood markers; (2) identify health risk profiles among U.S. young adults through determining how health behaviors and outcomes are patterned across individuals; (3) identify relationships between transition profiles and health risk, and (4) estimate the moderating effects of race/ethnicity, nativity, sex, and class background on the transition-health risk relationships. To accomplish these aims, the project will use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Add Health is uniquely suited for this project because it: (1) is recent, (2) is longitudinal, (3) spans the transition to adulthood, (4) offers detail on health risks including biomarkers, (5) provides geographic information, and (6) offers genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. This project will use the most appropriate and contemporary quantitative methods to accomplish the aims. The results will provide a more comprehensive description of health risk patterns of U.S. young adults. The project will move forward our understanding of how combinations of individual, family, and social factors influence the health risks of young adults in the United States, an especially important topic in the context of today's widening health disparities and changing health risks.  The fellowship period includes a number of activities to support the proposed research and prepare the applicant for a productive career conducting interdisciplinary research that integrates biological and social approaches to health. The two years will include coursework, formal and informal mentoring, training in specific methodological and theoretical approaches, and support in professionalization, the ethical conduct of research, and networking."
"9195068","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult stem cells are required to maintain tissue homeostasis and decrease in stem cell function leads to the decline in health associated with aging. The causes of stem cell aging are poorly understood, and exploring basic mechanisms of stem cell regulation is vital to address this issue. The simple metazoan Hydra vulgaris is apparently immortal, while other members of the genus undergo reproduction-induced senescence. The ability to compare the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of stem cells from two closely related animals with starkly different aging strategies is a unique and attractive feature of Hydra for aging studies; other well-established model organisms do not have seemingly immortal relatives. Furthermore, Hydra stem cells have attractive features for experimentation including: 1) Stem cell populations are well-characterized, 2) Due to recent advances in transgenic methods, the stem cells can be easily collected in large numbers and can be tracked and manipulated in vivo, and 3) Hydra stem cells share a gene expression profile with stem cells found in more complex animals. This includes the Piwi proteins, which are required for germline and stem cell function in animals. Our preliminary data suggest that Hydra Piwi proteins operate in a stem cell-specific pathway for maintaining tissue homeostasis and epithelial integrity in response to nutritional status. Because nutritional status is a conserved regulator of lifespan, we hypothesize that the Piwi pathway is a key player in the aging pathway of stem cells and we aim to understand how it functions in this context. Piwi proteins associate with a distinct class of small RNAs, piRNAs, and in Drosophila and mouse these Piwi/piRNA complexes modulate gene expression at the epigenetic and post-transcriptional levels. Hydra vulgaris stem cells have two strictly cytoplasmic Piwi proteins, allowing us to focus on identifyin post-transcriptional targets of the pathway. We are using a transgenic approaches to knockdown Piwi protein expression and test the function of the Piwi/piRNA pathway in each Hydra stem cell type. To identify targets of the pathway, we are: 1) Mapping piRNAs to a Hydra transcriptome to identify putative targets, 2) Testing for increased transcript levels of putative targets in piwi knockdown animals, and 3) Testing for a physical interaction between the putative transcript and Piwi/piRNA complexes. Finally, we are testing the hypothesis that the Piwi/piRNA pathway responds to nutritional status through the insulin pathway to regulate stem cell proliferation and tissue homeostasis. We aim to understand both the upstream regulators of the pathway and the downstream targets. Ultimately, we hope to gain significant insights into the regulation of aging in stem cells that will translate to more complex organisms. My long-term goal is to establish Hydra as an important new model for dissecting the regulatory control of stem cell function and aging. Once I have established my own lab I will initiate collaborations in order to test the conservation of the Piwi/piRNA pathway in stem cell regulation in vertebrates."
"9364364","Current clinical magnetic resonance metabolic imaging techniques are severely hindered by poor sensitivity. Dynamic nuclear polarization solves this problem by transferring polarization from the highly-polarized electron spins of a polarization agent to the nuclear spins of the target MRI probe. The metabolite dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) has been shown to be an excellent hyperpolarized probe of cellular redox capacity providing a measure of the cells ability to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated hyperpolarized DHA's ability to measure increased reducing capacity in cancer and diabetes-induced renal oxidative stress and their response to therapy, and it?s anticipated to have broad applicability to a variety of diseases. With the successful clinical translation of 13C MRI of hyper polarized [1-13C] pyruvate, the use of HP [1-13C]DHA in patients is being actively pursued. However, the spatiotemporal resolution of HP [1-13C]DHA is severely hampered by the relatively poor polarization that is being obtained using the current trityl-based polarization radicals. Additionally, broad use of HP DHA is limited by the high cost of the trityl radicals. A Phase I effort will focus on increasing DHA?s polarization by 2-fold with Dynupol?s polarization agents, enabling higher resolution and sensitivity in cellular-redox imaging of a variety of diseases."

"9217202","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The recognition that inflammation has important roles in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) arises from evidence that autoimmune and infectious diseases are associated with the development of PAH; inflammation can generate experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH); and perivascular inflammation is present in the pathology of human PAH and animal models of PH. However, whether inflammation is causal, an amplifier of alternative triggering mechanisms, or an epiphenomenon remains unclear. Prior studies on the role of T cells in disease pathogenesis have generated data of unclear relevance to PAH: Th2 and Th17 cells are detrimental in Aspergillus-exposed and chronically hypoxic mice, respectively, while regulatory T cells (Tregs) are protective in rats treated with SU5416 or monocrotaline. The translational application of these data is hampered by limited inflammation in the chronic hypoxia model and unclear mechanisms linking inflammation to vascular remodeling. We propose to interrogate a model system with a relevant antigen that activates specific Type 2 immunity; a perivascular compartment in which there is antigen uptake and presentation, cell proliferation and recruitment; and molecular mechanisms involving TGF-?1 resulting in pulmonary artery remodeling. We employ a mouse model triggered by the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, which reproduces key phenotypes of likely the most common cause of PAH worldwide. Our proposal seeks to identify the precise role of antigen- specific CD4 T cells as the source of IL-4 and IL-13; how this population arises, expands, and is activated; and its impact on monocyte recruitment and TGF-? activation. We hypothesize that exposure to Schistosoma egg antigens results in clonogenic Th2 CD4 T cell activation and proliferation, leading to production of IL-4 and IL-13; this prototypic Th2 response recruits Ly6C+ monocytes causing TGF-?-driven PH. Our overall goals are to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Schistosoma-PH; identify approaches to develop immunotherapies, such as vaccination, against this parasitic disease; and to more broadly identify novel therapeutic targets in the inflammatory cascade, which may also be applicable to other inflammation-driven PAH etiologies. Specific Aim 1 is to determine that T cell IL-4 and IL-13-driven inflammation caused by Schistosoma leads to TGF-? activation and PH. In this Aim we will investigate the necessity and sufficiency of Th2-activated CD4 T cells in Schistosoma-PH using a systematic series of experiments with deficient mice and immune reconstitution, to precisely determine whether CD4-derived IL-4/IL- 13 is critical for Ly6C+ monocyte recruitment and the overproduction of active TGF-?1 which results in PH. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the Schistosoma antigen(s) taken up by antigen presenting cells that activate pathogenic, clonogenic IL-4/IL-13 producing CD4 T cells in Schistosoma-PH. In this Aim we will identify specific pathogenic Schistosoma antigens; the cells taking up, processing and presenting Schistosoma antigens to activate CD4 T cells; and the CD4 T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire indicative of clonal selection."
"9221735","Summary  Evidence of persistent viral genomes in humans after infection with acute RNA viruses is increasing as technological advances with enhanced sensitivity permit the detection of viral reservoirs. Such evidence challenges the dogma that acute viruses are completely cleared by the immune system. In parallel, evidence of a role for persistent viruses in promoting disease is growing. For example, persistent respiratory syncytial virus in humans is associated with asthma, persistent coxsackie virus causes cardiac disease, and persistent measles virus or West Nile virus cause encephalitis. Persistent viral genomes are also a major obstacle for eradicating virus from infected individual following antiviral therapies. Despite much speculation, the mechanisms driving the generation and maintenance of long-term viral reservoirs during infections with RNA viruses are completely unknown. Resolving these mechanisms is critical for limiting or eliminating persistent viral reservoirs and for reducing their impact in disease. Evidence suggests that defective viral genomes (DVGs) that are generated during viral replication are pivotal in the generation of persistent viral reservoirs. Specifically, we observed that while some cells become enriched in DVGs upon virus infection, others maintain a predominantly full-length viral genome content. Furthermore, despite showing initial potent antiviral responses, cells dominated by DVGs survive the infection and generate long-term viral reservoirs, while cells dominated by full-length viral genomes died. In this exploratory proposal we take advantage of powerful technology to differentiate full-length viral genomes from DVGs in infected cells to 1.Identify cellular mechanisms mediating the persistence of infected cells dominated by DVGs and 2. Identify and characterize in vivo viral genome reservoirs. Overall, we expect to establish the role of DVGs in the generation of long-term viral reservoirs, break ground in our understanding of the mechanisms promoting survival of cells destined to allow virus persistence, and determine if pathways driving persistently infected cells in vitro are also active in vivo."
"9228909","The objectives of the REDS-III program are to ensure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S. affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S. but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Data Coordinating Center (DCC), one Central Laboratory, four domestic hubs, and three international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers. The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas: donor targeted strategies; blood banking; transfusion practices in adult patients; and education and training. The goal of the International program is to address scientific questions to improve the safety and adequacy of the blood supply in selected low or middle income countries affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The REDS-III international sites shall conduct epidemiologic, laboratory, and survey research primarily on blood donors with a major research focus on reducing and preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS and other known and emerging infectious agents through transfusion. Studies in transfusion recipients may also be conducted.  The major objectives of the research in the international program are: 1) assess and monitor the prevalence and incidence of HIV-1, HIV-2 and other existing as well as newly discovered infectious agents that pose a threat to blood safety; 2) assess risks of transfusion-transmitted infections; 3) assess the impact of existing and new blood donor screening methodologies on blood safety and availability; 4) evaluate characteristics and behaviors of blood donors including risk factors for acquiring HIV and other blood-borne agents; and 5) evaluate the donation process for ways to improve the safety and adequacy of the blood supply. Some studies may also address transfusion recipient safety concerns such as evaluating non-infectious transfusion risks (e.g., alloimmunization) and ways to reduce their occurrence."

"9236985","Project Summary Cortisol is a regulator of maturation of fetal organs, including the heart. Maternal hypercortisolemia or stress appears to increase the risk of stillbirth at term and alter growth of the fetal heart. In an animal model with elevated maternal cortisol in late gestation, mimicking mild but chronic stress, we have found a striking increase in stillbirth and changes in gene expression in the fetal heart suggesting changes in glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function, and energy availability. The data support the hypothesis that there is downregulation of TCA cycle activity and mitochondrial number and function. The proposed studies will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in fetal cortisol alter cardiac metabolism, function and remodeling in late gestation, and ultimately lead to fetal cardiac dysfunction, including both structural and functional changes, that result in adverse events during labor and delivery or in the immediate postnatal period. We will test for progressive changes in pathophysiology in the fetal heart during controlled labor using radiotelemetric monitoring of fetal aortic pressure and ECG, ultrasound analysis of fetal heart dimensions and function, and transcriptomic, metabolomic, histopathologic, and biochemical approaches to investigate changes in cardiac structure and metabolism. We will test the hypothesis that there is disruption of normal pathways for glucose and lactate metabolism and loss of mitochondrial function that will be reflected in changes in mitochondrial respirometry, gene expression and metabolomics. We will test the hypothesis that there will be pathophysiologic changes in cardiac structure and function that will be reflected by changes in ventricular dimensions and function identified by echocardiography, as well as alterations in aortic pressure, and in ECG. We will also test for alterations in glucose utilization by the heart using 13C glucose flux and identification of 13C glucose isoptomers in plasma and in the heart tissue. We will further test the hypothesis that changes in cardiac metabolism and mitochondria underlie changes in cardiac metabolism and ECG changes using administration of dichloroacetate, a small molecule therapeutic that increases activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is required for TCA cycle activity. DCA will be administered acutely during labor, the time at which the abnormalities in ECG become evident in our model. DCA is used in humans with mitochondrial diseases, including children with lactic acidosis, and the data from this study would potentially provide a therapeutic method for acute rescue of neonates."

"9239831","Project Summary  Despite early detection and adjuvant therapy, breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality in women, largely due to distant, incurable recurrences arising years, or even decades, after treatment of the primary tumor. These recurrent, metastatic tumors arise from the pool of residual local and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) that survive primary treatment and remain in the host in a presumed dormant state. Indeed, the presence of bone marrow DTCs following treatment is independently associated with a substantially increased risk of recurrence. At present, however, the mechanisms enabling residual tumor cells to maintain dormancy and ultimately recur are poorly understood, and DTC-directed surveillance and treatment approaches are non-existent. Consequently, the ability to biologically characterize, accurately measure and therapeutically target dormant DTCs would be a transformational new approach to preventing recurrence.  We hypothesize that disabling the survival mechanisms employed by dormant DTCs will reduce tumor recurrence and thereby improve survival. Using genetically engineered mouse models that faithfully recapitulate tumor dormancy and recurrence, we have discovered that autophagy and mTOR signaling are each critical to the survival of DTCs, and that agents inhibiting these pathways deplete the reservoir of dormant residual tumor cells, thereby preventing tumor recurrence. The objective of this proposal is to translate these biological insights and preclinical therapeutic data to generate the interventional approach, requisite laboratory assays, and demonstration of feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy of targeting DTCs that will be required for large-scale, definitive clinical trials and surveillance studies.  The specific aims of this application are to: 1) Perform a proof-of-concept clinical trial of everolimus (EVE, targeting mTOR), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, targeting autophagy) in women with detectable DTCs after primary treatment; and 2) Employ preclinical mouse models to concurrently optimize therapeutic approaches and advance discoveries for the eradication of DTCs. The randomized, open-label pilot trial in Aim 1 will investigate the feasibility and safety of HCQ, EVE or the combination, and their effects on DTC burden. We will also refine and validate a novel flow cytometric assay to improve the sensitivity of detection, enumeration and molecular characterization of the DTC biomarker. In Aim 2, a co-clinical trial in mice will optimize the effects of HCQ, EVE, and their combination, investigate critical parameters of these effects necessary to inform clinical trials, and extend these models to more closely reflect clinical treatment. In addition, molecular phenotyping of residual tumor cells will uncover additional targets for future trials. Ultimately, the ability to identify, enumerate and therapeutically target DTCs has the potential to transform surveillance and treatment options for breast cancer survivors and prevent women from succumbing to this deadly disease."

"9239069","Summary Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine cancer of the lung with dismal survival rates. There are no therapies for SCLC directed towards tumors harboring specific driver mutations. Recent genomic analyses and our own preliminary data revealed that CREBBP mutation/deletion is frequent in human SCLC. CREBBP is an acetyltransferase that acetylates histones and other proteins. CREBBP is emerging as a frequently mutated gene in hematopoietic tumors as well as certain solid tumors, but functional evidence of CREBBP tumor suppressor activity in solid tumors is lacking. We have evidence that CREBBP functions as a critical tumor suppressor gene across multiple neuroendocrine tumor types including SCLC. Our aims are to identify the mechanisms through which CREBBP suppresses SCLC and to test a therapeutic approach directed towards CREBBP-mutant SCLC. Specific Aim 1: To characterize effects of CREBBP deletion in a mouse model of small cell lung cancer and in human cell lines. We will inactivate Crebbp using a sensitized mouse model of SCLC that is driven by lung specific deletions in Rb and p53. In this mouse model, tumors arise with long latency, providing an ideal system to test the ability of potential SCLC driver mutations to accelerate tumorigenesis. Specific Aim 2: To identify mechanisms through which CREBBP deletion collaborates with Rb and p53 loss to promote SCLC. We hypothesize that Crebbp loss collaborates with Rb and p53 loss to promote neuroendocrine tumor types through control of gene expression. By integrating transcriptional data from Crebbp wild-type vs. mutant murine neuroendocrine pituitary tumors, thyroid tumors and SCLC, we will identify a common group of Crebbp-controlled genes across multiple Rb/p53-deleted neuroendocrine tumors. Focusing on SCLC, we will also identify genomic sites with reduced histone acetylation and proteins with reduced acetylation upon CREBBP deletion. Functional experiments will interrogate candidate CREBBP effectors for tumor suppressive activity. Specific Aim 3: To determine whether Crebbp-mutant tumors exhibit sensitivity to HDAC inhibition. We hypothesize that CREBBP deficiency will result in sensitivity to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition as this could potentially restore lost histone acetylation. We will determine whether HDAC inhibition will lead to regression of Crebbp-mutant neuroendocrine tumors employing both genetically engineered and patient derived xenograft models. CREBBP is emerging as a frequently mutated gene in many solid tumors and is one of the most frequently mutated genes in SCLC, but there is a poor understanding of how CREBBP functions as a tumor suppressor. Through integrative analyses of genomic data we will identify Crebbp-controlled tumor suppressive signaling networks. We will also determine whether inactivation of Crebbp leads to sensitivity to the HDAC inhibitor romidepsin. As romidepsin is an FDA- approved drug, positive results could rapidly be translated to improving therapies for patients with CREBBP- mutated tumors."

"9246291","ABSTRACT We propose a study of functional interactions between nuclear receptors in breast cancer cells as a project under this USA-NFSC initiative, with great scientific and intellectual benefit, based on the efforts of two closely- collaborating investigators with shared research interests, but with disparate areas of expertise. Drs. Michael Rosenfeld and Wen Liu have an extensive history of effective collaborations, as evidenced in a number of fundamental discoveries over the past ten years, including nine co-authored papers. This project, involving a sustained, close scientific interaction and collaboration is based on their complementary expertise, focus and resources. We propose to establish an unappreciated, but critical, molecular strategy that serves as the basis for large enhancer-dependent programs of coding target gene transcriptional repression important in breast cancer. This program depends on the fact that ER? is recruited in trans to the basally active enhancers that mediate the repressive transcriptional program, with trans-bound ER? receptor recruiting a demethylase, based on the availability of its DNA binding domain, which in turn recruits machinery leading to dismissal of Pol II from these basally highly active enhancers, causing their repression. This mechanism therefore represents a previously unappreciated type of repressive strategy, and involves a gene set that serves as a powerful prognostic indicator of a ten-year metastasis-free survival. This would uncover a set of largely overlooked prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer patients, perhaps ultimately providing a potential target for treatment or prevention of aggressive breast cancers. A strategy is proposed to underlie the ability of liganded glucocorticoid receptor to inhibit the ER?-activated regulatory enhancers in breast cancer cells, based on competition between different members of the nuclear receptor family."

"9262440","Abstract  In mammals, fetal cardiac myocytes (CMs) proliferate robustly, contributing to the growth of the heart in utero. Postnatally, cell cycle genes are dramatically down-regulated and the ability of CMs to enter the cell cycle is lost after postnatal day 7. The lack of cell cycle gene expression in adult CMs (ACMs) suggests these genes are stably silenced and no longer able to respond to growth stimuli. As a result of this very limited proliferative potential, the mammalian heart has long been thought of as a non-regenerative organ. This has been challenged by increasing evidence demonstrating that postnatal CMs do proliferate and contribute to myocardial renewal but at a very low rate. The lack of cell cycle gene expression in ACMs is reminiscent of other biologic processes such as senescence or cell cycle checkpoints where epigenetic mechanisms stably silence gene transcription through the formation of heterochromatin. This proposal hypothesizes that cell cycle genes are stably silenced in ACMs through a highly regulated process that involves trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3), which then recruits the epigenetic machinery at cell cycle promoters leading to stable gene silencing.

"9367579","Opioids are useful in managing pain, but opioid dependence is a major problem in U.S and globally with severe consequences for people and society. Estimates of the total overall costs of substance abuse in the United States exceed $600 billion annually, of which $181 billion is for illicit drugs. Non-pharmaceutical approaches to fighting pain are vital, and would be especially useful as a highly portable intervention that can be taken to patient's homes. Virtual Reality (VR) for pain management is a new area with significant potential, as seen in the pioneering work of Hunter Hoffman of the University of Washington Human Interface Technology laboratory, who cooriginated the new technique of using immersive VR for pain control in 1996. However, these early systems did not have a high degree of portability, requiring a room full of equipment. Very recent developments in VR technology allow a high level of immersion with equipment as small as a laptop with a headset and controller, and in some cases just a headset and controller.  This portability is a breakthrough that could bring the pain reduction of VR to patient's homes, with a health provider like a nurse or nurse practitioner travelling to the patient's home for each session. More interestingly, the health practitioner could possibly visit the patients once to leave the VR headset and after that work with the patient remotely via Virtual Reality telemedicine. If virtual reality experiences could be developed that could be shown to assist with pain management, that would constitute a major advance. Further, if the systems could be made portable enough to be taken to patients in their homes, that would be a greater advance. And if patients found them engaging, wearable, and acceptable overall, this would predict practical feasibility of implementation and utilization in real world treatment settings."

"9369106","Tamoxifen (TAM) has been proven to reduce risk of both local recurrence and new primary breast cancer in women with DCIS, providing both preventive and therapeutic benefit. Oral TAM also has proven risk reduction value for women at increased risk for breast cancer, numbering over a million women in the United States alone. However, tamoxifen acceptance by DCIS and high-risk patients has been lower than expected, mainly because of toxicity concerns. A potential solution is the development of delivery methods that preserve efficacy through targeted local delivery to the breast, but minimize toxicity because of low systemic exposure. A potential alternative to oral tamoxifen is suggested by studies going back to the 1980s, which showed that 4-OHT, the monohydroxy metabolite of oral tamoxifen, has a far greater affinity for the estrogen receptor ? (ER) and is more effective than TAM in suppressing breast cancer cell growth. Pre-surgical studies indicate that the anti-proliferative activity of 4-OHT gel at 1, 2, and 4 mg/day in invasive breast tumors and DCIS is similar to that of oral TAM at 20 mg/day. 4-OHT is a potent antiestrogenic metabolite of oral TAM, an agent with an unparalleled record of therapeutic and preventive breast cancer efficacy.  This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled neoadjuvant trial of 0.228% 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) gel vs. oral tamoxifen (TAM) 20 mg daily will enroll 100 women with a core needle biopsy diagnosis of ER positive DCIS, regardless of grade, with 1:1 randomization to oral TAM and 4-OHT gel. The 4-OHT group will apply active gel 2 mg daily to each breast for a minimum of 24 and a maximum of 28 weeks and take oral placebo. The TAM group will take 20 mg TAM orally daily and apply gel placebo.

"9369168","The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program is one of the premier cancer surveillance programs in the world being currently composed of population-based cancer registries covering 30% of the total US population reporting on over 450,000 cancer cases annually. The information collected on each and every cancer patient in SEER include demographics, a description of their cancer (e.g. cancer morphology, grade, and extent of disease such tumor size, number of nodes, etc), limited initial treatment information, and patient follow-up including cause of death for deceased patients.   SEER registries collect information on first-course treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy. However, the SEER program does not release data on chemotherapy/hormone therapy because SEER believes information on chemotherapy/hormone therapy to be incomplete. Activities are ongoing to investigate the opportunity to supplement SEER chemotherapy data with other data sources. For example, recently SEER chemotherapy data was augmented for older cancer patients (age 65+) with Medicare claims (Noone AM, Medicare Care 2014) from inpatient hospitalizations, out-patient facilities, physician claims but not including Medicare Part D. Augmenting SEER data with Medicare Part D is important since this data source contains valuable information on prescription drug use for elderly cancer patients. Since a growing number of cancer patients are taking oral chemotherapy (i.e., prescription drugs), supplementing SEER chemotherapy variable with Medicare Part D data will provide the most accurate and complete treatment information for SEER cancer patients. However, approximately 50% of Medicare beneficiaries have Part D coverage, therefore, there is a need to develop imputation strategies based on available patient, area-level socio-demographic, and medicare coverage (e.g., most patients will have Part A and part B coverage) information to inform usage about prescription drug to the Medicare population without Part D coverage.    Additionally, data collection on several clinical and molecular factors such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu (HER2) for breast cancer began in 2010.  It will be even more important to be able to develop and distribute imputed data sets, as the initial years of data collection on important biomarkers such as HER2 status will probably include many missing observations. With the aid of these imputed data sets, we can provide researchers with tools to better understand the molecular and genetic alterations in breast cancer incidence and report trends in the most accurate manner."

Purpose of Contract:     The purpose of this contract is to provide logistical and administrative support for activities associated with convening the ?Translational Stroke Research: Vision and Opportunities? at the Masur Auditorium, Building 10, NIH Campus, Bethesda MD, 20892 on November 1-2, 2016 from 7:30 a.m. ? 6:00 p.m. on November 1, 2016 and 7:30 a.m. ? 2:00 p.m. on November 2, 2016 . This contract is Fixed Priced with the exception of travel related task (outlined in Task 1.3), which will be billed as Time and Materials.   7.  Background:  The overall goal of this workshop is to bring together key stakeholders, including stroke basic scientists and clinicians, members of editorial boards of stroke journals, and representative from industry, FDA, and other public and private funding agencies to identify the steps that need to be taken to improve animal models, experimental design, existing infrastructure and bridging between preclinical and clinical studies in order to improve the success in the development of new therapies for stroke. The tentative agenda is attached.  Although stroke risk and mortality have been steadily decreasing over past two decades, thanks to improved prevention strategies and increased and faster access to reperfusion therapies, such as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and endovascular thrombectomy, the attempt to develop new pharmacological treatments for acute stroke has been costly and overall unsuccessful. Current drug treatments are problematic because of the narrow therapeutic window and the risk of hemorrhage, and there is no approved treatment for stroke patients after the acute phase.  No pharmacological treatment is currently available for hemorrhagic stroke. Accelerating the translation of stroke research in preclinical animal models into clinical studies of highly promising treatments was identified as a crosscutting priority at the NINDS Stroke Planning Meeting in 2012.   8.

"9325902","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction - nanoMAG LLC, an engineered biomaterials manufacturer, is developing and commercializing next generation, magnesium (Mg) biocompatible materials with applications in craniofacial and orthopaedic medicine. The overall goal of this SBIR Fast Track project is to develop a bioabsorbable Mg implant for mechanical fixation in craniofacial surgical procedures. This will include confirming function and biocompability, followed by large animal studies required both by FDA and OEM device manufacturers to advance the commercialization of these devices. Significance - Commercial bioabsorbable polymer alloys exist; but they are not strong enough for load bearing and rigid fixation applications (they are FDA approved for only non-load bearing applications). Non- bioabsorbable titanium (Ti) and stainless steel are also used in craniofacial procedures; but complications can occur that necessitate a secondary surgery to remove the devices. Surgical removal is advocated in 60% of cases involving young patients (1). Removal of Ti implants can be extremely difficult, threatened by screw- head fracture, nerve damage, infection and bone refracture (1,2,3,4,5,6). There is a critical need for stronger bioabsorbable materials for craniofacial devices. Long Term Goal and Relevance to NIDCR mission - BioMg(R) 250 will enable rigid craniofacial fixations while obviating the pain, cost, stress and infection risk of secondary operations. The Product - nanoMAG's products are bone fixation devices (plates, screws, tubing) produced from bioabsorbable Mg based alloy, BioMg 250, for use in craniofacial devices.  Phase I Hypothesis and Specific Aims - An experimental methodology and protocol for functional evaluation of BioMg 250 can be developed based on a pilot animal study.

"9397821","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck cancers (HNC) impose a significant biomedical burden by accounting for over 8000 deaths and 50,000 new cases each year. HNC patients often require multimodality treatment with surgery, radiation (XRT), and chemotherapy. Although XRT has increased survival it also results in damage to adjacent normal tissues leading to significant morbidity. The corrosive impact of these XRT-induced side effects can be unrelenting and their complex management is rarely remedial. Severely problematic wound healing issues impact the reconstructive efforts to replace the bone and soft tissue removed by tumor extirpation and the options to treat XRT-induced pathologic fractures and osteoradionecrosis. Standard of care currently dictates complex mandibular reconstruction utilizing free tissue transfer from other parts of the body requiring extended hospitalizations. Attendant complications often lead to delays in initiation of therapy jeopardizing prognosis as well as quality of life. Advances in biotechnology have afforded a unique opportunity to innovate new remedies for XRT-induced side effects by bringing novel and more effective therapeutic strategies into the actual operating theater. Distraction Osteogenesis (DO), the creation of new bone by the gradual separation of two osteogenic fronts, generates an anatomical and functional replacement of deficient tissue from local substrate and could have immense potential for reconstruction after oncologic resection. XRT drastically impairs fracture healing, however, precluding the utilization of DO as a durable reconstructive method for HNC. The central hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that the deleterious effects of XRT on bone formation can be mitigated to allow successful regeneration of the mandible and restore the capacity for normal bone healing. We further posit that new treatment strategies can be designed to combine tissue engineering techniques and pharmacological optimization in order to develop applications that can be utilized synchronously with operative reconstruction, to fundamentally transform current surgical paradigms. Our laboratory recently demonstrated specific metrics of diminished bone quality at the healing interface of irradiated mandibles. We then employed a series of pharmacologic and tissue engineering strategies to assuage the adverse impact of XRT induced injury. Each of our therapies demonstrated remediation of the XRT-induced degradation of bone healing. The consequential finding of these experiments was the ability to generate new bone formation and a bony union in scenarios where this was not previously possible. Although, the key metrics of bone healing were successfully enhanced, they were not completely restored and candidate cell lines and cell-based remedies that could benefit from therapeutic synergies and potentially be isolated and manipulated directly in the operating room still require innovative solutions in order to be fully optimized for translation to the clinical aena. The current proposal entails developing those synergies and innovative solutions in order to translate our findings from the bench to the operative suite to improve the treatment for this severely compromised patient population."
"9305299","The Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) conducts research on a variety of topics pertaining to human reproduction and development, child and adolescent health and behaviors, and care of pregnant women among other topics. Both observational and interventional research is designed and implemented by Division scientists, and most research includes multi-faceted collection of data and biospecimens. This includes subgroups of the population such as infants and children, who are likely to have even lower concentrations than adults. All biospecimens are collected using approved protocols and are de-identified prior banking in NICHD-supported repositories. A wide range of biospecimen  types are collected including whole blood, plasma, serum, peritoneal fluid, urine, saliva, tissue (e.g. omental fat), organs (e.g., placenta), hair, nails, follicular and seminal fluids, semen, and newborn blood spots. The Division conducts research focusing on the relationship between environmental exposures and human reproduction and development, as broadly defined. The Division defines environment as non-genetic, including environmental chemicals, diet, and lifestyle. Within the scope of environmental chemicals, both persistent (e.g., metals and trace elements, organochlorine pesticides, perfluorochemicals, polybrominated biphenyls, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers) and non-persistent (e.g. parabens, phenols, phthalates) chemicals are of interest. Of note is the Division?s research focusing on emerging classes of chemicals as well as biomarkers of lifestyle exposures and diet. Moreover, ophisticated aliquoting schemes are typically required for much of the Division?s research to enable additional biomedical laboratory analyses to compliment the environmental analyses. For example, a plasma sample may be used for the quantification of persistent chemicals and for metabolomic analyses, while a urine sample may be analyzed for both short-lived chemicals, such as phthalates, and for reproductive hormones."
"9379985","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): The overall hypotheses of the Cardiovascular Complications and Diabetes Program Project are that (i) dysfunctional HDL increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, and (ii) the increased glucose, triglycerides and systemic inflammation that characterize diabetes and the metabolic syndrome reduce HDL's cardio protective properties. We propose that the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with these disorders can be understood, prevented, and treated only by increasing our knowledge of the factors that regulate HDL function and macrophage and adipocyte inflammatory phenotypes. HDL's contribution to CVD associated with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome has been largely overlooked, and we believe that a highly interactive and interdisciplinary group of investigators with extensive expertise in this area, such as ours, i needed to answer this question.

"9270203","Project Summary Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), a contraceptive, has been associated with increased female acquisition of HIV through unknown mechanisms. We hypothesize that DMPA use increases vaginal species diversity, changing the vaginal microbiota in ways that promote genital inflammation and female HIV acquisition. We will use previously-collected vaginal swab samples from a prospective cohort of 81 postpartum Kenyan women who initiated DMPA and a control cohort of 25 women using non-hormonal contraception. Collaborating with the Fredricks laboratory at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, where these laboratory methods were pioneered, we will determine longitudinal changes in the vaginal microbiome using broad-range PCR with high-throughput sequencing. We will use taxon-specific quantitative PCR to determine quantities of the 12 most common vaginal bacteria and track their change over time. We will then correlate vaginal microbiota changes with peak DMPA levels, and assess the impact of DMPA on specific populations of vaginal anaerobes linked to HIV acquisition. The work proposed here leverages existing specimens collected specifically to assess biological consequences of DMPA use, and will use extensive socio-demographic and clinical metadata to perform multivariate statistical analyses comparing dynamic changes in microbiota species, richness and diversity with appropriate adjustment for confounding factors. Should this research reveal significant DMPA-related microbiota changes, our results would be applicable to ongoing efforts to create safer multi-purpose HIV prevention technologies and efforts to improve vaginal health in sub-Saharan Africa."

"9392248","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of this project is to improve the quality of epidermal stem cells (EpiSCs) for therapeutic transplantation, stem cell (SC)-directed gene therapy and for the treatment of degenerative skin disorders by elucidating both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms regulating EpiSC proliferative potential. We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor p63 is essential for the proliferative potential of EpiSCs. However, dual promoters in the p63 gene drive expression of TA isoforms with growth suppressive functions as well as ?N dominant negative isoforms with oncogenic properties. Both isoforms undergo alternative splicing to generate multiple C-terminus variants, complicating molecular analysis of p63 function. Notably, ?-type C- terminus (C?) uniquely harbors a sterile ?-motif (SAM) protein-protein interaction domain and a transcription inhibitory (TI) domain. Their mutations and deletions in ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate (AEC) syndrome, a unique form of p63-associated ectodermal dysplasia, highlight their functional importance. To further dissect the role of the C? domains, we have generated mice deficient in C? (p63C-/- mice). Notably, p63C-/- mice exhibit severe epidermal hypoplasia and fragility due to premature run down of the proliferative potential of EpiSCs. As we hypothesized that p63SAM interacting proteins were at least partially responsible for these effects, we screened for p63SAM interacting proteins and found that many of the identified proteins were involved in transcriptional and posttranscriptional activities. In Aim 1, we will further characterize p63SAM binding proteins by assessing their role in controlling the proliferative potential of EpiSCs and determine how deletion and AEC mutations in the individual C? domains impact their interactions. We will also interrogate the role of each C? domain in TA- and ?Np63? isoforms by reconstituting p63C-/- epidermal cells with wild type or C? domain mutant p63 isoforms. Finally, our preliminary data utilizing genome-wide array analysis coupled with clonogenic cultures suggest that the synergistic effects of Hgf and Igf2, regulated by the Wnt signaling mediator Dact1, are directly involved in EpiSC maintenance. In Aim 2, we will further assess the synergistic role of Hgf/Igf2 in regulating EpiSC self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation boh in vitro and in animal models and will determine if these growth factors regulate p63 levels to maintain the proliferative potential of EpiSCs. To further characterize the EpiSC niche, we have generated novel reporter mice to identify cells in which the Dact1 gene promoter is active, thereby allowing us to determine if they contribute to niche function in vivo. Together, these studies will provide unique insight into the intrinsic and extrinsic control of EpiSCs and will sere as a basis for development of novel strategies to improve the quality of EpiSCs for therapeutic transplantation and SC-directed gene therapy and for the treatment of wounds, burns and other degenerative epidermal disorders including cancer."
"9305808","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial pneumonia and sepsis are leading preventable causes of death in the intensive care unit and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) is a major etiology. Current therapies are mostly focused on the use of antibiotics and have led to the rapid emergence of drug resistance and hypervirulent strains. A fundamental aspect of successful pathogen-host interactions is the ability to keep harmful, tissue-damaging inflammatory immune responses in check while successfully clearing the pathogen. The exaggerated morbidity and mortality seen with bacterial infection can be the result of dysregulated inflammation. There are currently no viable therapeutic modalities to augment host defense while reducing unnecessary inflammation. Further, it is poorly understood how signaling cascades converge to control host defenses while minimizing inflammatory tissue injury. With this in mind, we have identified Chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3l1), a prototypic Chitinase-like protein of 18- glycosyl hydrolase family, to be important in this process. We find that Chi3l1 is a potent innate immune regulator elevated in patients with diseases characterized by inflammation and tissue repair. Chi3l1, along with its newly discovered receptor IL13RD2, is induced during Sp infection and is critical in antibacterial responses. The Chi3l1-IL13RD2 axis is important as a therapeutic target for controlling potentially harmful innate immune activation during bacterial infection. Our data show that the Chi3l1-IL13RD2 interaction critically dampens potentially harmful type I interferon (IFN-1) responses during infection. The absence of Chi3l1 or IL13RD2 results in heightened IFN-1s during infection associated with increased co-localization of endosomal Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). Our overall hypothesis is that the Chi3l1-IL13RD2 dampens excessive inflammation and tissue injury by regulating IFN-1 pathway. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Characterize the mechanisms by which Chi3l1 and its receptor IL13RD2 regulate IFN-1 production and signaling in a murine model of bacterial infection. Specific Aim 2. Examine the role of Chi3l1 and IL13RD2 in the regulation of endosomal trafficking of TLR9 during bacterial infection in vitro and in a mouse model. Specific Aim 3. Determine which cells are critically required for Chi3l1 and IFN-1 production during infection, and determine the clinical significance of Chi3l1 and IFN-1 in bacterial infection. This project aims to understand the mechanisms of pathogen-related immunopathology during bacterial infection, including the mechanisms by which Chi3l1 modulates the IFN-1 response to control immunopathology. We will also explore the role of Chi3l1 in endosomal trafficking of TLRs during infection and assess the use of Chi3l1 as a prognostic biomarker in infected patients. The data generated from this application are expected to provide novel insights that promote the development of new therapies for bacterial infection."
"9376977","Transplant arteriosclerosis (TA) is a highly-prevalent complication of heart transplantation where diffuse, irreversible stenoses form in graft coronary arteries. Donor specific antibody (DSA) binding MHC on graft endothelial cells (EC) is a strong risk factor for TA, but the mechanism(s) of how DSA causes TA are not well understood. To study this problem, DSA was modeled on EC using high panel reactive antibody (PRA) sera taken from sensitized transplant candidates. PRA sera deposited DSA on EC and activated complement, a system of immune-related proteins that when activated forms pore-like structures called membrane attack complexes (MAC) on cell surfaces. PRA caused MAC assembly on EC which elicited EC activation and enhanced EC immunogenicity of alloimmune CD4+ T cells. These processes had an overall effect of exacerbating TA lesions in human coronary arteries in a humanized mouse model. MAC mediated these effects through a novel effector pathway involving NF-?B-inducing kinase (NIK), a critical mediator of non-canonical NF-?B signaling. This proposal defines mechanisms of how MAC activates NIK in EC, explores how these mechanisms operate in a humanized mouse model for TA, and uses NIK in patient EC as a platform to develop novel diagnostic tests for TA. The Specific Aims proposed herein are unchanged from the original application. Aim 1A and Aim1C, subaims of Specific Aim 1, where endocytosis of MAC was explored as a mechanism for NIK stabilization in vitro and in vivo, were successfully completed during the K99 phase. In the R00 phase, Aim1B of Specific Aim 1, where MAC+Rab5+ subcellular compartments will be isolated to identify how Akt mediates NIK, will be completed. Additionally, in the R00 phase, Aim 2, which explores clinical correlations between NIK and TA in patient biopsy specimens, will be completed. The positive predictive value of NIK expression in two microvessel EC compartments will be assessed in patient samples, and novel markers correlating with TA will be identified using laser capture and RNA profiling of NIK."
"9385379","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the last decade, the Reducing Health Disparities Through Informatics (RHeaDI) research training program has prepared a diverse cadre of 15 nurse scientists at the predoctoral and postdoctoral levels to take on the major science, health, and technology challenges and opportunities that face our nation for the foreseeable future. RHeaDI trainees have produced award-winning scholarship at premier scientific conferences for informatics; translated their findings into clinical, public health, and policy journals; and advanced the science of informatics application in underserved populations. Former RHeaDI trainees are now positioned as nursing and biomedical informatics faculty in leading research-intensive organizations. The RHeaDI core concepts of interdisciplinarity, informatics, health disparities, evidence-based practice, and underserved populations are even more central to federal and other national strategic initiatives now than in the past. However, health disparities continue to exist despite significant initiative aimed at improving health equity and creating a national health information network or cyberinfrastructure that improves health care, promotes health, and advances biomedical discoveries. It is nurse scientists, such as those educated in the RHeaDI training program, who are eminently prepared to bridge the scientific domains of nursing, health, biomedical informatics, and dissemination and implementation to reduce health disparities and facilitate evidence-based practice in underserved populations through application of rigorous interdisciplinary theories and methods. Thus, the specific aims of this competitive renewal application are to: 1) Maintain an administrative structure to support interdisciplinary research training for nurses focused on the use of informatics to reduce health disparities and facilitate evidence-based practice in underserved populations; 2) Recruit and train a qualified diverse cadre of nurses (predoctoral and postdoctoral) to conduct interdisciplinary research using informatics to reduce health disparities and facilitate evidence-based practice in underserved populations; 3) Enhance the knowledge and skills of predoctoral and postdoctoral nurse trainees in the integration of theories and methods from informatics and from dissemination and implementation science to reduce health disparities and facilitate evidence-based practice in underserved populations; and 4) Evaluate the training program structures, processes, and outcomes on an ongoing and annual basis. RHeaDI trainees will include 3 predoctoral (2-4 years of T32 support) and 2 postdoctoral trainees (2-3 years of T32 support) for an anticipated total of 5 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees during the project period. There is no doubt that the need for RHeaDI is critical and its relevance to the 2011-2016 National Institute of Nursing Research Strategic Plan is strong. Moreover, the outstanding interdisciplinary research environment of Columbia University offers unique resources for achievement of study aims."
"9390072","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of the proposed research is to characterize the effects of early family structure on behavior, expression of genes encoding nonapeptides and their receptors, and epigenetic modifications of these genes. The nonapeptides vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) are important modulators of behavior, including aggression, anxiety, social behavior, and parental care. Early life experiences are known to alter behavior and gene expression by genomic and epigenomic means, and may also alter the function and anatomy of VP and OT circuitries. Most of what is known about the relationship between early life experience and the neural and genetic mechanisms regulating adult social behavior comes from uni-parental species. To understand the significant factors that may shape human health, one must consider the influence of fathers on offspring and mothers. This can be achieved by using a bi-parental model, such as the socially monogamous and bi-parental prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). Few studies have examined the impact of paternal influence on offspring development or the extent to which paternal care influences the development and epigenetic modification of nonapeptide systems. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that paternal deprivation for offspring and loss of a co-parent for mothers will induce social deficits, increase anxiety and aggression, and alter the nonapeptide systems regulating these behaviors. To address this hypothesis, Aim 1 examines behavior, nonapeptide and receptor gene expression, and epigenetic modifications of these genes from prairie vole offspring raised by a mother and father, a mother and poor father, or only a mother. Variation in paternal quality will be induced by administering antisense oligonucleotides targeting vasopressin 1a receptors in the lateral septum, where VP is known to promote paternal care. Using the same experimental breeding group design in Aim 1, Aim 2 investigates the plasticity of epigenetic modifications to nonapeptide genes by observing DNA methylation in offspring at various points throughout development. Finally, in Aim 3 the behavioral, neuroendocrine, and epigenetic impacts of having a co-parent on the mothers serving in Aim 1 will be examined. Aim 1 will reveal the relative impact of paternal deprivation on the development of the brain and behavior in offspring. Most studies of epigenetics characterize the influence of experience at a single point in life; Aim 2 will be the first effort to examine the plasticity of epigenetic modifications to nonapeptide genes throughout postnatal development. Aim 3 will represent the first attempt to examine the behavioral and physiological impacts of being a single mother on maternal health in a non-human animal. The results from these studies will create a foundation of basic knowledge about the social and developmental consequences on nonapeptide-mediated mental health disorders characterized by social deficits, anxiety, and aggressive tendencies. The experiments will also serve to develop a non-human model for single-parent families and are designed to improve both mental and physical health in the process of human development."
