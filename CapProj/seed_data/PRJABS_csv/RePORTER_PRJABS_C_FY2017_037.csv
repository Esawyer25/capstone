"9276654","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the program of research of which this proposal is part is the development of tobacco cessation programs targeted at light smokers at greatest risk for progressing to daily smoking. Recent evidence suggests the prevalence of light and intermittent smoking (LITS) has increased dramatically. LITS increases morbidity and mortality, and many intermittent smokers progress to riskier daily smoking. Little is known about factors that are associated with LITS, or that confers risk for transition to daily smoking, or promotes transition to non-smoking. With LITS, smoking behavior may be based on reinforcement rather than alleviation of withdrawal. Most cessation programs are based on a physical dependence model, and may therefore be less effective for non-daily smokers. LITS, as well as use of other nicotine and tobacco products, is most common in younger populations. This proposal is conceptually based in Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), which posits that behavioral decisions are determined by cognitive factors such as self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and behavioral intentions; these are influenced by the social environment. We hypothesize that changes in smoking patterns will be associated with these constructs and how they change over time. The purpose of the proposed research is to: (1) longitudinally examine LITS stability versus transitions to daily and non-smoking; (2) to test whether the SCT model predicts the probability of smoking stage transitions, (3) to evaluate whether SCT effects are moderated by personality and environmental factors, and (4) to test the hypothesis that use of other nicotine and tobacco products potentiates the risk of progression from LITS to daily smoking. Our goal is to analyze which variables play a role in longitudinal smoking outcomes and to assess mechanisms that explain these effects. The proposed research will lead to a better understanding of mechanisms by which intermittent smokers become daily and non-smokers, and is consistent with President Obama's emphasis on prevention of negative health outcomes. These data may have important implications for prevention and treatment. By identifying risk and protective factors that promote transition to daily and non-smoking, we hope to lay the groundwork for the development of interventions that explicitly target intermittent smokers and their smoking motives."
"9344571","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cocaine addiction (CA) is a common chronic brain disorder with markedly increased morbidity and mortality (Degenhardt et al, 2011). ~ 1,500,000 adults in the US reported using cocaine in the past month (SAMSHA, 2013). Although twin studies are consistent with a moderate inherited component, it has been difficult to identify risk-increasing alleles by studying peripheral DNA. It is proposed to study neuronal DNA from post-mortem brain of CA patients, to find somatic neuronal mutation associated with CA.  One common somatic mutation in the CNS is mediated by LINE1 (L1) retrotransposons (RTPs), which constitute 17% of the human genome (Beck et al, 2010). L1s are 6 kb in length. They encode a reverse transcriptase and an endonuclease, which function in a copy and paste mechanism, in transcriptionally active genomic regions, to spread in the human genome (Richardson et al, 2014). While most of these somatic de novo L1s will have little effect on neuronal function, some may interfere with neuronal activity because they have inserted into a gene needed by that particular neuron for normal function. If functional L1s occur early in CNS development, all the daughter neurons that derive from that neuronal precursor will also carry the L1 insertion, perhaps leading to a dysfunctional population of neurons destined to increase risk for CA. It is also possible that repeated use of cocaine results in waves of CNS neuronal transcriptional activity, creating windows of opportunity for L1s to spread, leading to progressive disruption of neuronal genes by those L1s.  Preliminary results in mPFC of CA patients indicate that de novo L1s may disrupt kinase/phosphorylation pathways (Bonferroni corrected p = 10-6-10-7), pathways which are not significantly impacted among controls. This proposal will employ mPFC from 90 CA patients and 90 matched controls. DNA extracted from mPFC neuronal nuclei will be used in hemidegenerate PCR to enrich the DNA for L1 sequences. DNA will be sequenced and aligned to the reference genome to detect de novo L1 RTP insertions into neuronally-expressed genes. In this manner, it is expected that de novo L1 RTPs, associated with CA, will be discovered. These de novo L1s may be a consequence of repeated cocaine use or they may be antecedent to cocaine use, acting as risk factors for CA. If the de novo L1s are a consequence of repeated cocaine use, this would be a paradigm-shifting discovery that a drug of abuse disrupts neuronal genomes. If the de novo L1s are antecedent to cocaine use, and function as CA risk factors, they would identify novel genes and pathways related to CA, which may create targets for drug development and genetic research. Confirmed de novo L1s from CA tissue will be studied for functional impact by re-creation of the L1 insertion in a neuronal precursor cell line, using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. In this manner neuronal DNA variation associated with CA will be defined."
"9495225","DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): For 46 years, the Birth Defects Research Laboratory (BDRL) has been the major NIH-funded site for collection and distribution of conceptal tissues. The availability of viable conceptal organs and tissues has made the Laboratory a unique and critical non-profit resource for biomedical research. This application seeks to continue and further develop the core fundamental goal of the laboratory: the systematic collection, staging, identification, and processing of normal specimens and distribution of their tissues to recipients. In this renewal application, we will build upon this central aim to extend the biomedical research resource further by making available samples for DNA/RNA extraction and epigenetic assays. In addition, the investigator will develop the resource by 1) extending the systematic collection, identification, and distribution to abnormal fetuses; 2) correlating prenatal data with the post-termination findings from examination/postmortem; 3) exploiting the virtual histological and phenotyping capabilities of tissue imaging platforms after performing proof-of-principle studies in genitourinary tract and cardiovascular tissues; 4) capitalizing on the expected enrichment of genetic defects underlying fetal congenital anomalies by generating copy number variant data through array-based comparative genomic hybridization studies; 5) systematically making accessible tissues and their data for investigators; and 6) engaging and working with key collaborators to improve services and increase recipient numbers in their respective fields. This application builds upon ARRA support, evaluating the utility of novel tissue imaging systems to enhance BDRL services, and stimulating and supporting research based in part on this resource into the bases of birth defects and normal development. Systematically characterizing abnormal fetuses and distributing tissues from these fetuses will exploit the unique positioning of the BDRL to develop this as a significant research resource and service to researchers who seek to understand the underlying developmental biology of normal and abnormal human development."
"9269196","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for the Southern California College of Optometry (SCCO) to serve as a clinical center for the Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial - Attention & Reading Trial (CITT-ART), a multicenter  randomized, placebo controlled, clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic  convergence insufficiency (CI) on reading performance and attention in children. In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic CI will be randomly assigned to: 1) office-based vergence/accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy with home reinforcement. After 16 weeks of treatment, examiners masked to treatment group assignment will administer the primary outcome measures for: 1) reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III]) reading comprehension subtest and 2) attention (Strengths & Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]). The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Other secondary outcome measures include: a test of reading fluency (WIATT III), the SNAP test of attention, the CI Symptom Survey, clinical measures of CI (i.e., near point of convergence and positive fusional vergence at near), and assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension (pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension).  Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention will be assessed 1-year post treatment. This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and to retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. We document that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other clinical centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center.  Symptomatic CI is a common childhood vision disorder frequently associated with symptoms while reading (e.g., loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of CI treatment on reading and attention is unknown. Results from the proposed trial will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, eye professionals, and other health care providers who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9281850","PROJECT 2 ABSTRACT PI: Daniel J. Rader, M.D. Recent evidence supports the potential of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated liver-directed gene therapy as an effective therapeutic intervention for a variety of metabolic disorders. Monogenic lipid disorders are excellent models for the development of liver-directed gene therapy. Based on previous work funded by this P01 we are now poised to use a first-generation AAV8 clinical candidate to launch a clinical trial (Project 1) for one such disorder, Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (hoFH). This lipid disorder is caused by loss- of-function mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLR) and is associated with severe hypercholesterolemia and markedly premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In this Project 2, we propose to expand on our preclinical proof-of-concept studies for the treatment of hoFH by developing a second-generation AAV clinical candidate vector expressing an engineered LDLR transgene of superior efficacy for the correction of hoFH. Another serious lipid disorder is Familial LCAT Deficiency (FLD), which results in accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and chronic kidney disease progressing to end-stage renal failure. In contrast to the LDL receptor, LCAT is a secreted protein and restoration of a small fraction of the normal levels in blood would be expected to ameliorate the disease and prevent progressive renal disease. In this Project 2, we will develop an optimized clinical candidate vector for the treatment of FLD. Our goal is to optimize the hLDLR and hLCAT transgenes and work closely with Project 3 to optimize AAV-based vectors for correction of hoFH and FLD, such that the minimum efficacious dose of the clinical candidate vector is as low as possible. The overall intent of Project 2 is to lay the preclinical groundwork for conducting Phase 1 clinical trials using a second generation AAV-hLDLR for treatment of hoFH and the first AAV8-hLCAT for the treatment of FLD."
"9282527","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) has established a pediatric biorepository with over 60,000 children consented for access to electronic health records (EHRs) with regular updates, re-contact, and high-density genome-wide association (GWA) array data. For this project, we have proposed five specific aims reflecting the workgroup mechanism of the eMERGE consortium. These will build upon substantive Preliminary Data derived during eMERGE II, where a series of GWA, sequencing, pharmacogenomics (PGx), EHR integration, and return-of-results (RoR) projects helped establish a platform for translational and eMERGE III efforts. In the first of these aims, we propose to continue to expand the eMERGE phenotype library and we propose four lead phenotypes: obesity, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism, in which we have a strong record in discovery, integration, and translation. Under specific aim 2, we propose to leverage CAG's position as a world-leader in genomics research to characterize rare variants in 2,000 CAG patients, where we have already catalogued several hundred rare variants in the accompanying Appendix. Leveraging this resource and expertise at CAG and eMERGE, we propose to return actionable findings to a minimum of ~160 parents (Specific Aim 3). This effort will build upon our existing RoR platform established during eMERGE II that returned results to parents of 160 CHOP children with autism, and to several hundred individuals with PGx risk profiles. Our fourth aim is to evaluate the health impact, cost-effectiveness and ELSI implications of RoR, and we aim to longitudinally track all families to whom results are returned at four time-points, leveraging existing resources and surveys developed with pediatric eMERGE partners. Finally, we propose a massive expansion of our EHR integration, established under eMERGE II, which also provide and integrate education resources for patients and medical professionals across the eMERGE network. Ultimately, we anticipate that the immediate outcome of these efforts will be improved healthcare for patients at CHOP and expanding to the entire eMERGE network. Further, with our eMERGE partners, we aim to establish a blueprint for integrating genomics and EHR data on such a scale that it will have real potential to fundamentally change medical practice in the US."
"9325552","Abstract: Advances in antiretroviral therapy have led to dramatic increases in survival of perinatally HIV- infected children into adulthood. The transition to adult HIV care, however, is replete with challenges due to the increased responsibility placed on adolescents as they enter adulthood, as well as other complex, potentially HIV-related concerns such as cognitive de?cits, depression, and stigma. Guidelines to support clinics in developing formal transition plans have been published. Nonetheless, approaches to transition vary widely across the US. Understanding the factors that impact the ability to move to adult care is critical to supporting HIV-infected youth as they transition and, hence, retaining them in care. To accomplish this, and to maintain their interest in long-term research, we must consider research methods that accommodate the lifestyles of young adults while maintaining valid data collection. Few empirical studies have systematically assessed the efficacy of current HIV healthcare transition practices, especially with regards to clinically important outcomes. Existing literature is largely qualitative, providing insights into the barriers and concerns that patients, caregivers and providers perceive as salient. This study will expand upon this research to explore the barriers and facilitators that directly affect objective clinical outcomes so as to determine which practices are effective and should be disseminated more widely. Specifically, we will determine whether individual level?factors such as age at transition, ability to manage health care, and participant involvement in transition decisions, and clinic-level structures and practices, including co- located psychological support services, written transition plans, adult care delivery models, and early presence of a transition liaison/case manager are associated with long-term retention in adult health care and viral load suppression post-transition. Subject recruitment through surveillance data and web-based data collection strategies will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of these methods as an alternative to time- and resource-intensive clinic-based research studies."
"9333448","Patients with inherited peripheral neuropathies, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), are provided life-long supportive care, but there are currently no treatments or cures. Progress toward such treatments is slow due, in part, to the fact that there are too few animal models available to conduct research that could lead to new treatments. The rate at which new CMT disease genes/mutations are identified currently exceeds the rate at which appropriate models can be developed. There are now ~80 human CMT disease loci, including at least 60 genes, and most of these do not yet have an associated clinically-relevant animal model. To remedy this problem we propose the creation of The Resource for Research of Peripheral Neuropathy (RRPN) at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX). The JAX-RRPN (www.jax.org/rrpn) is a coordinated, community-driven effort that leverages a world-leading knowledge of mouse genetics, state-of-the-art genome editing capability, decades of experience in disease model development and experience with effective disease model repositories, to accelerate the creation, distribution and proper use of high-priority mouse models for CMT research."
"9291520","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic determinants of gene expression are fundamentally important to innumerable pathophysiologic processes including oncogenesis. CpG island DNA methylation is a common epigenetic modification of particular interest. In glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive adult brain tumor, hundreds of genes are subjected to DNA hypermethylation at promoter CpG islands; and tumor methylation status has been found to define distinct GBM tumor subsets and predict clinical behavior. Therefore, dissecting the transcriptional consequences of CpG island methylation is critically important to understanding cancer biology and translating epigenetic mechanisms to clinical advantage. The classical dogma states that promoter CpG island methylation influences cancer biology by silencing tumor suppressor genes through sequence- independent manner. However, this dogma is challenged by our recent studies, which indicate that some transcription factors (TFs), including kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), preferentially bind to methyl CpG (mCpG)- containing motifs, thereby transactivating gene expression. The zinc finger TF KLF4 is a cancer driver gene shown to be up-regulated in GBMs. Using a site-specific KLF4 mutant lacking the ability to bind to methylated DNAs, we found that mCpG-dependent KLF4 binding promotes GBM cell migration via the transactivation of genes in cell motility signaling pathways, including the small GTPase RhoC and calpain small subunit 1 (CAPNS1). We further demonstrate that histone modifications are involved in KLF4-mCpG-mediated gene transactivation. In this proposal, we will test our hypothesis that promoter mCpG plays an active role in gene regulation by directing TF binding, histone modifications and gene activation, thereby influencing cancer cell phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will determine if KLF4-mCpG interactions regulate GBM stem cell migration and self- renewal in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will use complementary approaches to rigorously validate this new mechanism by which KLF4 activates cell motility genes and promotes GBM cell migration via its ability to bind to mCpG-containing promoters. We will perturb KLF4-mCpG interactions in GBM cells using genome editing methodology to act upon both the cis- and trans-regulatory elements. In Aim 3, we will use unbiased approaches (ChIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing) to identify the global transcriptional networks directly regulated by KLF4-mCpG interactions in GBM stem cells. This will be the first comprehensive study to assess how DNA methylation and TF interactions transactivate gene expression and influence tumor cell behaviors. Positive results will be paradigm shifting and substantially expand current knowledge regarding how DNA modification regulates gene expression and influences oncogenesis. Dissecting the biological consequences of KLF4-mCpG interactions in GBMs and ultimately extending to other TFs and other cancer subtypes will revolutionize our understanding of how epigenetic modifications contribute to oncogenesis."
"9294000","?    DESCRIPTION:  Since initial funding of this grant in May 2000, research literature cited by PubMed on cannabinoid and endocannabinoid physiology and pharmacology has expanded by two orders of magnitude, reflecting the expansion of basic science in this field. Findings have potential clinical applications in drug abuse and addictions, metabolic disorders, mental health and neurodegenerative diseases, and pathologies in other organ systems of the body. The International Cannabinoid Research Society's (ICRS) annual Symposia on the Cannabinoids is the single comprehensive meeting in which leading international laboratories disclose critical research findings on cannabinoid and endocannabinoid physiology and pharmacology well in advance of publication of the data. Participation of trainees as well as established research investigators ensures future progress. The goal of this grant is to facilitate trainee attendance a the symposia and their retention in the field by providing travel awards, student presentation awards and career development programs. In addition, the ICRS proposes to host an annual translational symposium with invited speakers. Symposia abstracts are archived on the ICRS website and as a citable document available to the public."
"9270067","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease with significant morbidity and mortality. At present there is no effective treatment other than lung transplantation. The IPF lung displays distinct patterns of mRNA and microRNA expression patterns and global changes in DNA methylation. Recent observations, mainly in animal models of lung fibrosis, suggest a role for aberrations in multiple pathways such as coagulation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, shifts in epithelial cell phenotypes, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and developmental pathways. The hypothesis underlying this grant is that the unique histopathologic features of IPF-temporal heterogeneity, alveolar cell hyperplasia, abundance of myofibroblast foci and aberrant remodeling-represent a molecular disease mechanism specific to IPF. Therefore, understanding the molecular networks that underlie these characteristics will lead to better understanding of IPF and eventually more rational, disease mechanism based therapeutic interventions. For this purpose we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of experts in lung fibrosis, genomics, computational biology, computer science, cell and molecular biology, statistics, high-throughput screening and bioinformatics.  The study will undertake the following specific aims: 1) Identification of the unique genomic and transcriptomics characteristics of histologically defined lung microenvironments. This aim will include generation of mRNA, microRNA and epigenomic profiles of histologically distinct, differentially affected regions of the lung using microCT guidd microdissection, next generation sequencing and laser capture microdissection-reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (LCM-RRBS). 2) Determination of the cellular contribution to the genomic and epigenomic changes in the IPF lung by a combination of LCM guided sampling of distinct cell populations in the IPF lung (myofibroblasts, hyperplastic epithelial cells), transcriptomic profiling of primary cells (alveolar type II and fibroblasts) isolated from patients with and without IPF at baseline and in response to fibrosis relevant perturbations. Cellular signatures will be validated, localized and quantified in IPF lungs by quantitative immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization. 3) Generate a dynamic regulatory model of IPF based on genomic data and perform preliminary experimental validation of model predictions. This aim includes generation of an integrated IPF genomic and epigenomic data compendium, application of novel analytic approaches to identify key regulators and performance of preliminary validation of predictions by testing effect of perturbations of potential  The data and analyses will be incorporated into a simple, intuitive, web-based interface, IPFmap, that will allow investigators to interactively mine the data, use analytical tools, integrate their own data into these analyses, and provide seamless access to complementary databases enabling development of therapies."
"9364378","ABSTRACT: Problem: The battle field against cancer is constantly in flux. Cancers metastasize and then require systemic therapy. They frequently become resistant to hormone therapies, biologicals, and small molecules - eventually depleting the arsenal of drugs that can be used against them. They are able to readily defeat therapeutics because initial treatments have side effects that limit dose and efficacy and also because they do not kill non-proliferating cells, such as cancer stem cells. This allows remaining tumor cells to ac- quire resistance and to regenerate tumors. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for treatments that can kill proliferating, non-proliferating, and drug resistant cancer cells, giving cancer patients a new paradigm to beat cancer. Solution: We have identified an agent with exactly these attributes: the clinical iron oxide nanoparti- cle Feraheme (FH). Many aggressive cancers have decreased levels of ferroportin, the sole known cellular exporter of iron, and subsequently higher intracellular iron. This cancer cell signature enables cell growth and proliferation. Yet, the increased redox-active iron in cells also generates deleterious hydroxyl radicals, making cancer cells susceptible to agents that further exhaust their antioxidant capacity. Feraheme is un- precedented in its ability to exploit this vulnerability. First, it increases redox-active intracellular iron and iron- catalyzed hydroxyl radicals in susceptible cancer cells with low ferroportin, leading to cell death. Second, it provides for an even higher tumor-specific effect, since normal cells are not only less susceptible in the first place, but also have the ability to detoxify introduced iron by using ferroportin to export it. Preliminary Data: This approach fulfills all the criteria for a pharmacologically highly promising target: We show that iron ho- meostasis is only perturbed in cancer to promote growth while normal cells have higher ferroportin and keep their iron homeostasis balanced. We demosntrate that Feraheme decompensates cancer cell?s antioxidant capacity, and we show we can use MRI to detect high iron levels, which could serving as a predictive bi- omarker of response. Lastly, we show that FH works synergistically with clinically used cancer drugs that increase oxidative stress, thereby significantly increasing tumor specificity while reducing side effects. Hy- pothesis: Given our preliminary data, we hypothesize that FH will kill even challenging cancers and that we will be able to predict efficacy with MRI based on the cancer cells? unique molecular signature of low ferroportin with high iron. By focusing initially on prostate cancer, our objective is to provide data for physi- cians how to best exploit Feraheme for hormone refractory prostate cancer, either off-label or through fo- cused clinical trials. Specific Aims:To test our hypotheses, we will (1) Explore the therapeutic index of Feraheme in vitro and in vivo, using xenografts and patient-derived prostate cancer organoids (2) evaluate sensitivity of noninvasive MR T2* imaging to predict the tumor response; and (3) evaluate use of Feraheme in combination with other anti-cancer agents."
"9335993","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The failure of axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) prevents treatment of a wide range of CNS afflictions, including spinal cord injury, stroke, and diseases like Parkinson's. One major reason that regeneration fails is that many CNS undergo a developmental loss in their intrinsic capacity for axon growth. To restore function after CNS injury or disease it is essential that we devise means to enhance the intrinsic growth state of CNS neurons. We recently identified the Kr?ppel-like family of transcription factors (KLFs) as key regulators of intrinsic regenerative capacity in CNS neurons. Critically, a transcriptionally active mutant, VP16-KLF7, promotes axon regeneration by injured corticospinal tract (CST) neurons, an important therapeutic target. Robust regenerative responses were achieved using viral delivery to adult wild-type animals, raising potential clinical relevance for this novel pro-regenerative tool. To further explore the potential of KLF7 activity t promote CNS regeneration, three key questions must be addressed, corresponding to our aims. First because recovery from SCI depends on multiple functional modalities carried by diverse fiber tracts, we will use viral-mediated gene delivery to test the ability of VP16-KLF7 to promote regeneration in additional neuronal populations. Targeting additional neuronal subtypes has the potential to broaden the range of behavioral improvement after SCI. Second, we will examine the expression of pro-regenerative genes in neurons stimulated by VP16-KLF7 in order to determine the potential relationship between with known pro-regenerative (e.g. mTOR, CNTF) or anti-regenerative (e.g. chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG)) pathways and signals. Based on this information we will rationally combine VP16/KLF7 with viral particles that target complementary pathways, potentially inducing additive or synergistic improvements in axon regeneration. Finally, we will examine the extent to which KLF7-stimulated axons succeed in forming functional synapses on appropriate target cells and ultimately contribute to functional recovery. Using viral gene delivery we will co-express VP16- KLF7 with optogenetic constructs that enable the treated neurons to be reversibly activated or silenced. This technique will allow us to determine the specific contribution of the treated neurons to electrophysiological and behavioral output as regeneration proceeds. Taken together, these experiments have a strong potential to extend the use of a promising new pro-regenerative tool and lead to the development of novel combinatorial methods to promote axon regeneration and functional recovery in the injured CNS, leading to novel treatment options for people suffering from CNS afflictions."
"9279199","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The tubulin homolog FtsZ is the major cytoskeletal protein in bacterial cytokinesis. Our recent work has shown that FtsZ can reconstitute Z rings in liposomes, and these can generate a constriction force without any other proteins. FtsZ thus acts as cytoskeleton and motor all in one. Our work suggests that the constriction force is generated by a curved conformation of the FtsZ protofilaments (pfs) bending the membrane. We now propose to address three of the most important and immediate questions. (1) What is the structure of the Z ring in bacteria? There are two competing models. The ribbon model proposes that pfs are laterally associated to make a ribbon, and the scattered model proposes that the pfs are more widely scattered on the membrane and not in contact. We propose three imaging techniques to resolve this controversy: super-resolution light microscopy and two newly-developed EM probes. Resolving these models is essential to explore the physics of the constriction force. (2) What is the mechanism of pf dynamics? We have shown that FtsZ pfs are rapidly exchanging subunits, with a half time of 5-10 s. The mechanism could involve dynamic instability, treadmilling or fragmentation/annealing. We propose to image single pfs by super-resolution light microscopy and by cryo and negative stain EM to resolve the mechanism. (3) What is the structure of curved pfs? We have strong evidence that the constriction force is generated by pfs adopting a curved conformation that exerts a bending force on the membrane. However, there are structural contradictions that need to be resolved, especially regarding the orientation - is the C terminus on the inside or the outside of the curvature? To determine this orientation, we propose to develop FtsZ subunits with a large C-terminal tag visible by EM. Importantly, we now know that there are two curved conformations, the highly curved miniring, which is an analog of tubulin rings, and an intermediate curved form. We suspect these may have opposite orientations, and our tagged FtsZ should resolve this."
"9273895","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major barrier to development of disease-modifying therapy for knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the nature of disease progression, a downward spiral involving many tissues. The potential for changing disease course may be highest before this process is in motion. The literature documents cartilage, bone, and meniscal lesions by MRI in knees of some older individuals without radiographic OA, but does not reveal whether they represent early OA. We propose a long-term, longitudinal study to evaluate the clinical significance of such lesions in persons at higher risk for knee OA but without OA in either knee by x-ray at baseline, to advance knowledge of early OA and to help to identify an earlier (than x-ray affords) OA onset window. We have a highly unique opportunity to carry out this study. The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a study of 4796 individuals with or at higher risk for knee OA, ens follow-up at 96 months. 1244 participants had no x-ray findings of knee OA in either knee at baseline. We propose an additional visit of this subcohort (1226 living) at 120 months to collect data (some not collected after baseline and some not after the 48 month visit) that would enable comprehensive evaluation of clinical definitions of OA at the furthest feasible time point while the OAI clinical sites are still constituted, as well as assessment of MR images being collected at 96 months. The proposed aims are unique, time-sensitive, and could not be completed within the OAI's scope of work. We propose 3 aims in OAI participants in this subcohort: 1) evaluate the association between each lesion - cartilage damage, bone marrow lesion, meniscal tear, meniscal extrusion - by MRI at baseline and risk of incident knee OA by the historic (and current) radiographic criterion by 120 months and by recently proposed MRI criteria by 96 months; 2) evaluate the association between each lesion by MRI at baseline and risk of incident clinical features of knee OA, including ACR criteria, flexion contracture, and persistent knee symptoms by 120 months; and 3) explore the association between each lesion by MRI at baseline and baseline-to-120-month physical function decline by performance and self-report measures of function. Proposed study findings will enable future identification of risk factors for clinically important early lesions and prevention strategies that could be introduced earlier in th lifespan. Ultimately, clinically significant lesions might become a target of disease-modifying intervention at a point when success may be more realizable, before the whole-organ progression spiral."
"9493957","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Channing Division of Network Medicine Training Program in Systems Approaches to the Epidemiology, Genetics, and Genomics of Lung Diseases This training program is a competing continuation of a program funded by Institutional Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award T32 HL007427. The program, which has operated continuously for the past 41 years, focuses on chronic respiratory diseases that are major public health problems, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Asthma and COPD are linked with early childhood factors, including gender, diet, allergen exposure, and cigarette smoke exposure, as well as with genetic susceptibility; these factors influence disease expression throughout life. Based on our current knowledge of complex traits, there is a critical need for individuals trained in the application of systems approaches to epidemiology, genetics, and genomics to perform quantitative research in respiratory biology. This program is instrumental in meeting this need, successfully training independent research investigators who go on to lead their own research programs across the U.S. and Canada. The program provides research training in seven areas: systems genetics; systems biology and network modeling; transcriptomics; functional genetics; emerging Omics; epigenomics; and systems epidemiology. Six postdoctoral and two predoctoral training positions are requested in this proposal, with a typical appointment duration of three years. The trainees interact with a pool of 33 faculty members in the seven interrelated research areas. Each trainee will have the opportunity to become involved in the design, execution, and analysis of ongoing federally funded research projects as well as develop an independent career path. Trainees' research is conducted at the Channing Division of Network Medicine, a research division of the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Predoctoral trainees work toward a Ph.D. in network science or biostatistics or an Sc.D. in epidemiology. Postdoctoral trainees undertake didactic classroom work leading to a master of science (M.S.) in epidemiology or a master of public health (M.P.H.) degree at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) or a Master of Science (M.M.Sc.) degree in bioinformatics at Harvard Medical School. After completing our program, trainees will be eligible to assume faculty positions in systems biology/biostatistics or genetics/genomics.

"9301536","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), or the reversed flow of urine from the bladder back up into the kidney, is a common pediatric condition, which is present in up to 10% of all children in the United States. In the setting of urinary tract infectio, VUR can be present in up to 50% of otherwise healthy children. In these children, VUR increases the risk of renal scarring, hypertension, proteinuria, and, in extreme cases, end-stage renal disease. Although it is clear that VUR-related, long-term renal problems have a significant impact on affected children, there are children who suffer no VUR-related consequences whatsoever. Unfortunately, VUR research has to date been unable to identify which children are most at risk of VUR-related renal damage. This lack of risk stratification has led to tremendous variation in VUR management: some physicians treat VUR with surgery, others with endoscopy, and others with long-term antibiotics. It remains unclear which of these approaches works best for which children.  My long-term career goal is to improve the health of children with VUR and other urological conditions by the application of health services research methods. As a pediatric urologist and a health services researcher, I am in the process of establishing an independent research career in a field where health services research has not yet reached its full potential. Pediatric urology is a subspecialty in the midst of a fundamental shift in its approach to clinical research. My predecessors laid the foundations for urologic research based primarily on their personal clinical and surgical experience; my peers have begun to shift to research based on large-scale observational studies and randomized trials. I plan to contribute to this transformation by introducing comparative effectiveness methodology to the field.  My short-term goals are: (1) To further develop my knowledge of techniques and methodologies for comparative-effectiveness research using tools such as observational and administrative databases; (2) to learn and apply the techniques of decision analysis in order to guide clinical decision-making in children with VUR and to support guideline development for VUR treatments; and (3) to develop the foundation for future clinical research of VUR and for future independent funding proposals for this research.  To facilitate these goals, I will use the strengths of comparative-effectiveness research to determine which children with VUR will benefit most from which treatment. In Aim 1a, we will use a national database to define the incidence of critical clinical outcomes, such as the incidence of urinary infections after VUR treatment. In Aim 1b, we will validate those findings in a second national database to ensure that our findings are broadly applicable to children with varying disease severity and socioeconomic backgrounds. In Aim 2, we will survey community members to determine patient- and community-based VUR treatment preferences.  In the long term, these projects will form the basis for a subsequent R01 application focused on VUR. In the next 5 years I will develop the research expertise and infrastructure to support an active clinical and health services research program, and I will focus that expertise and infrastructure on the most common and most clinically significant conditions in pediatric urology."
"9293379","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It has become clear that expression of voltage-operated Ca++ channels (VOCCs) is highly regulated in the oligodendroglial lineage and is essential for proper OPC development. Understanding the mechanisms of the voltage-dependent Ca++ influx is important as changes in intracellular Ca++ are central to many cellular activities.  For example, in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) voltage-dependent Ca++ influx plays a key role in multiple  important mechanisms such as process extension and cell migration (Paez et al., 2009a; b). Despite these relevant findings, next to nothing is known about the role of VOCCs in OPC differentiation and myelination. We will test the hypothesis that voltage-gated Ca++ entry promotes OPC maturation and myelination in the postnatal brain and we will determine if oligodendroglial VOCCs play a key role in a model of myelin repair. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) To examine the role of VOCCs on oligodendrocyte development in vitro. Using pharmacological tools and VOCC specific siRNAs we will test if VOCCs are centrally involved in triggering oligodendrocyte maturation through voltage-gated Ca++ uptake. We propose to knock down the in vitro expression of VOCCs in oligodendrocytes and measure cell death, proliferation and OPC differentiation. We will also test whether these Ca++ channels facilitate axo-glial signaling during the first steps of myelin formation in an in vitro co-culture system of OPCs and cortical neurons. 2) Test if voltage-gated Ca++ entry promotes OPC maturation and myelination in vivo by specifically deleting the L-type VOCC isoform in OPCs. Viral vectors expressing siRNAs for L-type VOCCs will be injected into the corpus callosum and the subventricular zone of newborn pups to analyze the in vivo migration and myelination capabilities of VOCC deficient OPCs. Additionally, a conditional knockout mouse for L-type VOCC in OPCs will be generated by crossing the floxed mutant CaV1.2 mice with the NG2CreERTM transgenic mice which express a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse NG2 promoter. Injecting tamoxifen in newborn pups of the crossbred mice will result in the L-type VOCC isoform CaV1.2 being postnatally deleted specifically in NG2 positive OPCs. 3) To examine the effects of VOCC ablation in myelin loss and recovery. Our preliminary findings indicate a role for VOCCs as a potential modulator of OPC development in adult mouse brain in acute demyelination. Using the Cre-lox system to silence Ca++ channel expression specifically in OPCs, we will test if voltage-dependent Ca++ entry promotes OPC survival and maturation in the remyelinating adult brain. For that purpose, we will use the cuprizone model of demyelination which has proven to be a useful tool for the analysis of myelin loss and remyelination in the adult brain. Successful completion of these studies will define by which mechanisms VOCCs control OPC development and myelination, and the role of these Ca++ channels in myelin pathology. These findings could lead to novel approaches to intervene in neurodegenerative diseases in which myelin is lost or damaged."

"9276778","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), a common autosomal recessive motor neuron disorder that is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by the loss of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). SMN2, a nearly identical copy gene, is present in all SMA patients but differs by a critical nucleotide that alters exon 7 splicing efficiency. This results in low SMN levels which are not enough to sustain motor neurons and results in a varying clinical presentation. Our previous work focused on defining the dosage requirements of SMN for normal health and restorative therapies for the severe form of the disease. Here, using newly generated mouse models we will focus on the intermediate and mild forms of SMA that have been understudied due to a lack of appropriate mouse models. We will address therapy development questions and disease mechanism in terms of SMN's cellular site of action that contributes to motor neuron dysfunction and disease pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will determine the timing requirements of SMN inductive therapies in intermediate and mild inducible SMA mice. This will address the potential of SMN-directed therapies to be of benefit after measureable loss has occurred and at advancing points of disease which has yet to be addressed. Here we will use a whole body Smn inductive approach to account for non-neuronal cell types that might impact disease severity. In Aim 2, we will refine the whole body approach to focus on neuronal inductive SMN therapies using our mild SMA mouse. Specifically we will directly determine the therapeutic benefit of splice-switching anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) that correct SMN2 splicing. It will address whether this type of drug-candidate, when delivered after disease onset, is capable of maintaining or improving function. Importantly, this study meets an unmet milestone in the clinical development of this drug as well as other SMN inductive therapies which require CNS delivery to patients. In Aim 3 we will compare the intrinsic electrical and synaptic properties of control and age matched SMA motor neurons from intermediate and mild SMA mice throughout their life. We postulate that altered electrical properties contribute to the cellular mechanisms underlying motor neuron dysfunction as a consequence of Smn deficiency. These studies will be performed using neonatal slice and in vitro sacral cord preparations. The in vitro preparation which we have recently developed for use in adult mice, allows intrinsic and synaptic motor neuron hyperexcitability to be assessed through intracellular recordings at time points from neonatal stages throughout adulthood. This will provide unique insights to the physiological state of SMA motor neurons throughout the course of disease. Overall, the research presented in this application will provide important information that is critical towards the development of SMN-dependent as well as independent treatment strategies for intermediate and mild forms of SMA. It also addresses an unmet need in therapy development and provides insight to the underlying cellular mechanism of disease."
"9282661","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the galactosylceramidase gene (GALC), leading to galactolipid accumulation, abnormal central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS) myelination, oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell death, and the infiltration of multinucleated macrophages (globoid cells). Cognitive decline and motor deterioration develop in affected infants with death commonly occurring before the age of five. Newborn screening for Krabbe disease is currently performed in many states, thereby allowing for treatment of presymptomatic babies with hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HPCT), the current standard of care. However, while HPCT results in some cognitive improvement, motor deficits persist. There is no cure for Krabbe disease. Recent studies in the Twitcher mouse, a murine model of Krabbe disease, have shown that a combination of intracranial injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector carrying a wild type copy of murine GALC cDNA synergizes with HPCT to significantly improve motor deficits, survival time, and CNS pathology. Although clearly promising at a therapeutic level, the mechanisms responsible for the synergy of combination therapy observed in the Twitcher mouse are not understood. We hypothesize that the synergy observed with combination therapy results from HPCT-driven effects in the CNS effects and AAV-mediated gene therapy effects in the PNS. Differences in disease phenotype between murine and human Krabbe disease and the small size of the mouse limit the translational utility of this model. In contrast, naturally-occurring Krabbe disease in dogs recapitulates the clinical, pathological, and biochemical abnormalities of human disease. Additionally, the dog, similar in size to that of an infant, allows for the evaluation of HPCT and CNS gene transfer methods identical to those that can be used in infants, and for the identification and validation of clinicl, biochemical, and imaging markers of nervous system disease severity and therapeutic efficacy using methods that are used in pediatric clinics. The proposed studies will help determine the mechanism of the synergy seen with combination therapy, and will provide insight into disease pathogenesis, potentially identifying new pathways for future design of additional therapeutic strategies. Our lab is uniquely suited to evaluating the mechanistic effects of experimental therapies in large animal models of human nervous system disease."
"9480204","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project focuses on the development of fumagillin analogs to combat failures of standard care antigiardiasis and antiamebiasis drugs. Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica are highly infective parasites that cause severe diarrheal diseases, leading to much suffering in poverty stricken regions worldwide. All standard care drugs have undesirable side effect, giardiasis treatment fails at a frequency of ~20% cases, and there are only a few drugs available to treat amebiasis for patients that do not tolerate the side effects. Giardia drug resistance has become a concern, and G. lamblia and E. histolytica drug-resistant strains can be readily raised in the laboratory. The arsenal of drugs available for treating giardiasis and amebiasis belong to only a few chemical classes, primarily nitroimidazoles and thiazolides. Because G. lamblia drug resistance already exists for these classes of compounds, it is likely to progress rapidly to new class members. Thus, new drug development projects should focus on identifying new chemical scaffolds. Using compound screening of an approved drug library, we discovered that fumagillin, an orphan drug used in the European Union to treat intestinal microsporidiosis in immune compromised patients, kills Giardia trophozoites in vitro with high potency and exhibits superior efficacy in infected mice compared with the standard care drug, metronidazole. Moreover, 60 years ago, fumagillin was reported to effectively cure human intestinal amebiasis. Fumagillin is a methionine aminopeptidase 2 inhibitor, an enzyme that has not been targeted yet for antigiardiasis and antiamebiasis drug development. While fumagillin is expected to be effective in curing both giardiasis and amebiasis it has two liabilities, potential toxicity and heat and humidity instabiliy. To optimize drug properties, we will synthesize fumagillin derivatives that are less liable to chemical instability on storage and metabolic degradation, and concomitantly have reduced permeability through the intestinal epithelial barrier to prevent potential toxic effects. New methionine aminopeptidase 2 inhibitors that will show good potency in metronidazole-responsive and metronidazole-resistant G. lamblia and/or E. histolytica strains as well as provide increased stability and reduced permeability across Caco-2 monolayers will be investigated in vivo in giardiasis and amebiasis mouse models. The pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles of the most efficacious compounds will be determined in mice to confirm that the reduced in vitro permeability leads to reduced host bioavailability and toxicity in vivo. The outcome of the project will be 1-2 compounds efficacious against giardiasis and/or amebiasis with superior toxicity and stability properties compared with the parent drug, fumagillin. These compounds will be ready for IND-enabling studies."
"9251326","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are critical for maintaining spermatogenesis throughout adult life. While considerable progress has been made in our understanding of SSCs, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that initially establish these cells in mammals. In this application, we propose to fill this gap through study of a homeobox gene-Rhox10-that we find is essential for the normal initial establishment of SSCs in the mouse testis. Rhox10 is a member of a large X-linked homeobox gene cluster that my laboratory discovered some years ago. The genes in this Rhox gene cluster are preferentially expressed in the reproductive tract, raising the possibility that they encode transcription factors critical for reproduction, but there has been little direct evidence for this As one means to test their role, we recently generated whole Rhox cluster knockout (KO) mice that lack all 33 homeobox genes in the Rhox cluster. These mice have a progressive spermatogenic decline phenotype that strongly resembles well-established mouse models harboring SSC defects. Conditional KO of the single Rhox gene that we regarded as most likely to be responsible - Rhox10 - yielded essentially the same phenotype as KO of the entire Rhox cluster. In-depth analysis of Rhox10-KO mice revealed they have a strong defect in the ability to generate SSCs during the postnatal period when SSCs are normally first established. This deficit likely results from a differentiation defect in the precursor cells that give rise to SCCs-Pro- spermatogonia (ProSG)-based on several lines of evidence, including single-cell (SC)-RNAseq analysis. Aim 1 of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which RHOX10 promotes ProSG differentiation and SSC establishment. We will first precisely define the cell subsets and developmental pathways operating during the SSC establishment period using SC-RNAseq analysis and other methods. We will then perform the same analyses on Rhox10-KO mice to define the specific roles of the RHOX10 transcription factor in ProSG differentiation and SSC establishment. As part of this analysis, we will verify candidate ProSG marker genes we have recently identified, and screen for new ones. This is critical for the field, as, to our knowledge, no well- established ProSG marker genes have previously been identified. Aim 2 of this proposal is to delineate the molecular mode of action of RHOX10 in germ cells. Our preliminary SC-RNAseq experiments have already identified candidate RHOX10-regulated genes in germ cell subsets. We will verify these candidate targets and expand our analysis to the specific germ cell subsets that we show RHOX10 acts in in vivo. RHOX10 direct targets will be identified by a battery of approaches, including ChIP-seq analysis. Functional studies will be performed to screen for target genes important for RHOX10's function in ProSG and SSC establishment. Given that little is known about this critical period of gametogenesis, these experiments will fill a large gap in the field and will provide an unprecedented view of the role o a transcription factor in vivo."
"9471682","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angiogenesis is upregulated in solid tumors, but the microvasculature that forms is more tortuous and permeable than typical vasculature. Traditional cancer therapies have focused on inhibiting angiogenesis to starve tumors. However, more recent evidence suggests that this approach may have deleterious effects because minimizing angiogenesis increases hypoxia in the tumor which is associated with decreased efficacy of chemotherapeutic and radiation treatment. Moreover, incomplete or leaky vessels can facilitate the intravasation of metastatic cells into the vasculature. As such, stabilizing vasculature may be a promising therapeutic approach to minimizing metastasis, increasing chemotherapeutic efficacy and improving drug delivery to the tumor. Significant emphasis has been placed on targeting VEGF, as it is known to play a key role in promoting angiogenesis and causing increased vascular permeability. However, anti-VEGF therapeutics has met with limited success in several cancer types, including metastatic breast cancer. The researchers' exciting, new data indicates that matrix stiffness, mimicking the stiffening that occurs during breast tumor progression, causes increased angiogenic outgrowth and increased endothelial monolayer permeability- notably, these are the same endothelial phenotypes that are attributed primarily to the action of VEGF. Moreover, these data indicate that matrix stiffness augments endothelial permeability response to VEGF, suggesting a crosstalk between VEGF and matrix stiffness-mediated signaling. Given these findings, this project will investigate the hypothesis that matrix stiffening contributes to impaired microvascular integrity in tumors by disrupting endothelial cell-cell adhesion, and correspondingly, inhibition of stiffening and/or endothelial cell response to stiffening can minimize impaired vascular integrity. Here, 3D in vitro models of matrix stiffness, in vivo models of tumor stiffening, advanced in vivo imaging techniques and RNA-seq will be used to investigate the mechanism by which matrix stiffness alters microvascular permeability in the tumor microenvironment. In Aim 1, the synergies between matrix stiffness and VEGF-mediated permeability will be defined. In Aim 2, the effects of mechanical heterogeneities in the matrix on vessel outgrowth and integrity will be investigated. In Aim 3, approaches to inhibit stiffness-induced vascular barrier disruption will be explored. Together, this work will lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets to normalize tumor vasculature."
"9276694","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Detailed structural information is essential for understanding biological processes and for providing the basis for the development of therapeutic strategies against a variety of diseases. Experimental methods allow the accurate determination of high-resolution structures, but they are encumbered by significant effort and experimental constraints. As an alternative, modern computational methods can predict protein structures to a good degree of accuracy. However, computational models often do not reach experimental accuracy. Computational structure refinement aims at improving initial models towards experimental quality. Successful protein structure refinement requires sampling methods that can generate native-like conformations and scoring methods that are able to identify the most native structures from a set of candidates without knowledge of the true experimental structure. Building on past progress with the development of structure refinement methods, new methods are developed to further improve the quality and efficiency of sampling and the selection of native-like structures. A key component is the use of the intermediate resolution model PRIMO in conjunction with fully atomistic models. These methods will be applied to the refinement of both soluble and membrane-bound proteins. The development of a practical protocol that can be made available to the community via a web service is a central goal of this proposal."
"9272023","A valid assessment of memory is perhaps the most important component of an endeavor to develop a novel treatment for Alzheimer's disease. However, memory is only one of the behavioral impairments that Alzheimer's patients exhibit. They also have affective and sensorimotor deficits, and problems with social behavior. Unlike other APP-overexpressing mice, the 5xFAD transgenics exhibit robust neurodegeneration by 9 months of age. Like other Alzheimer models, they exhibit profound cognitive deficits on tests of spatial learning and memory. However, the 5xFAD mice show a host of other behavioral anomalies. For example, they exhibit much more social behavior toward their cage-mates as do wild-type mice, but do not exhibit the barbering phenomenon characteristic of some strains of laboratory mice, including wild-types of the same strain. Although published reports show that 5xFAD mice spend more time on open arms of a plus maze, indicative of decreased anxiety, we have shown that this is attributable to impaired habituation and degeneration of inhibitory interneurons in layer IV whisker barrels (i.e., making closed arms aversive). We have shown previously that a mutant, non-erythropoietic erythropoietin (Epo) is neuroprotective in models of glaucoma, macular degeneration, and MPTP neurotoxicity, without raising hematocrit. This modified Epo, EpoR76E, is generated indefinitely by a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector injected into the gastrocnemius (leg) muscle. Our preliminary data show that amyloid plaque is nearly completely cleared 2 months after a single intramuscular injection of rAAV.EpoR76E, in 12-month-old 5xFAD transgenics that started with extensive plaque in the cortex and hippocampus. The objective of this application is to determine whether rAAV.EpoR76E is neuroprotective and able to prevent or reverse the cognitive deficits and abnormal social behaviors exhibited by 5xFAD mice. The general hypothesis of the proposed research is that the Epo variant will successfully reduce plaque formation and prevent neurodegeneration and memory impairments in the mutant mice. We also expect the social behavior phenotype to be normalized in 5xFAD mice receiving rAAV.EpoR76E, on the expectation that it is an effect of neurodegeneration. In the proposed experiments, mice will be injected at 4 or 13 months of age with EpoR76E or rAAV.eGFP control construct. Social behavior and memory will be assessed, as well as control tests for anxiety and sensorimotor function. Post-mortem analyses will assess Alzheimer-related neuropathology and cell death. Finally, we will examine factors known to be involved in the production and clearance of A?, such as BACE1, IDE, and neprilysin, to determine the reason why A? is being cleared from 5xFAD brain by rAAV.EpoR76E. Cell culture work in primary neurons from 5xFAD and wild-type mice will determine how the mutant Epo construct affects APP processing. Successfully reducing amyloid burden, cell death, and memory impairments in the transgenic mice may provide insight into new treatment strategies that could reduce or prevent dementia in Alzheimer patients."
"9334323","Inflammatory Mechanisms of Brain-Lymphatic Signaling in Stroke After stroke, the peripheral immune system becomes activated, and these systemic inflammatory responses are known to amplify brain injury and worsen outcomes. But a major gap in knowledge remains. It is unclear how the stroke-damaged brain sends signals to the periphery. Recently, it has been suggested that some type of specialized lymphatic drainage system may exist in the CNS. Back in 1995, we had used CT imaging to show that tracers injected into rabbit brain can directly drain into the cervical lymph nodes in vivo (Hunter et al, Neuropath Appl Neurobiol 1995). We now propose that this brain-to-cervical-lymph node connection may provide a potential pathway for inflammatory crosstalk between brain and systemic responses after stroke. Based on our pilot data, we propose the hypothesis that after stroke, the injured neurovascular unit releases signals that drain into the cervical lymph node and activate macrophages thus worsening neuroinflammation and stroke outcomes: (i) after focal ischemia, brain astrocytes/pericytes/endothelial cells secrete VEGF-C into CSF; (ii) VEGF-C travels into cervical lymph nodes, enhances pro-inflammatory signals in lymphatic endothelium, and induces M1-like macrophage polarization and recruitment; (iii) M1-like macrophages then contribute to further neuroinflammation and brain injury in both gray and white matter. We will test this hypothesis in three integrated aims, using a combination of molecular tools, cell culture, and in vivo models. In Aim 1, we assess and compare mechanisms for how astrocytes, pericytes and brain endothelial cells release VEGF-C after oxygen-glucose deprivation. In Aim 2, we investigate mechanisms that underlie the ability of VEGF-C to induce inflammation in lymphatic endothelium and activate macrophages. In Aim 3, we will use mouse models of focal cerebral ischemia to confirm these brain-to-lymphatic signals in vivo, and examine therapeutic approaches that may interrupt this pathway to improve stroke outcomes. To assess causality in our pathways, we will conduct gain and loss-of-function experiments using a combination of cell culture, in vivo mouse models, pharmacologic inhibitors, molecular techniques including siRNA and transgenics, long-term neurological outcomes, and imaging. This project should define a novel mechanism wherein the damaged neurovascular unit communicates with peripheral lymphatics after stroke. Our findings may provide a new conceptual framework for seeking potential stroke targets and biomarkers in the lymphatic system. Finally, this project may also help open up new collaborative crosstalk between stroke biology and the well established field of lymphatic vascular biology."
"9267358","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating neurologic insult that can disrupt ascending and descending neural circuits necessary for walking, somatosensation, urination and other vital autonomic functions. The majority of SCI patients suffer from anatomically and functionally incomplete spinal cord injury (I-SCI) that results in varying degrees of neurological dysfunction. Although long-distance regeneration of central nervous system (CNS) axons does not occur in mammals, clinical and experimental studies demonstrate considerable spontaneous recovery of neurological function after I-SCI. Experimental studies in rodents and non-human primates indicate that synaptic reorganization between supraspinal motor tracts and spared intraspinal relay circuits that bypass a spinal lesion can re-establish brain-cord communication, and give rise to remarkable motor recovery after I-SCI. Corresponding relay circuit formation may also play a role in motor recovery in hemipalegic stroke patients. Unfortunately, a limited understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing this functionally meaningful intraspinal circuit plasticity has precluded development of therapeutics to augment this spontaneously occurring recovery process. Astrocytes are critical regulators of synaptogenesis and circuit development during development, and moderate synaptic strength and structural synaptic plasticity following changes in neural activity. In response to diverse CNS injuries, astrocytes undergo graded and regionally distinct changes in structure and function collectively referred to as reactive astrogliosis. After SCI, scar-forming, reactive astrocytes surrounding lesions are indispensible regulators of inflammation. The functions of non-scar-forming, reactive perineuronal astrocytes in spinal cord regions undergoing functionally meaningful circuit remodeling after SCI are not clear, but potential roles include regulation of synapse recovery and neuroprotection. The objective of the current study is to delineate fundamental molecular mechanisms through which astrocytes modulate intraspinal synaptic reorganization and spontaneous locomotor recovery after SCI. In Aim 1, I will use an in vivo, astrocyte-specific transcriptomics approach to delineat key changes in perineuronal astrocyte gene expression that underlie spontaneous locomotor recovery in a mouse model of I-SCI. In Aim 2, I will use neuroanatomical tract tracing, electromyography and in vivo astrocyte-specific genetic manipulations to assess the functional relevance of perineuronal astrocyte reactivity for supraspinal- intraspinal synaptic remodeling and locomotor recovery after I-SCI. Together, these studies will serve as a critical first step towards identifying astrocyte molecular pathways that may be therapeutically targeted to enhance functionally relevant plasticity and promote recovery of neurological function after I-SCI. Such findings are also relevant to patients with traumatic brain injury, stroke or neurodegenerative disease such as multiple sclerosis, in which therapeutically harnessing synaptic plasticity of neural circuitry in spared tissue may be a key to promoting recovery of neurological function."
"9387834","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Chlamydia infections are the most commonly reported infectious disease in the U.S. Chlamydia causes respiratory infections and genital infections, which disproportionally harm women because they can lead to infertility and ectopic pregnancy. Chlamydia is known to affect motile cilia, which are cell surface projections that play a critical role in transport of an ovum from the ovaries through the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. However, it is not known how the Chlamydia infection affects motile cilia. To study effects of Chlamydia on motile cilia, we are developing a novel, physiologically-relevant Chlamydia infection model that utilizes primary human epithelial cells. These cells differentiate into highly-ciliated cells by growth at the air-liquid interface, which mimics the natural environment of the respiratory and genital tracts. With this novel infection model, we have detected Chlamydia-induced motile cilia loss. This host pathogen interaction has not been apparent in standard Chlamydia cell culture infections, which use cells that do not have motile cilia. In Aim 1, we will first optimize this novel infection model to improve the infection efficiency. We will then use confocal microscopy, to measure the extent and time course of cilia loss in Chlamydia-infected cells, and high- speed video microscopy to quantify defects in cilia activity and number. In addition, we will test effects of different chlamydial strains on motile cilia. Our preliminary studies have used multiciliated primary epithelial cells from the trachea, but we will extend these studies to fallopian tube epithelial cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanism of Chlamydia-induced motile cilia loss. We will use confocal and electron microscopy to look for alterations to basal bodies as a sign of a cilia formation defect. To test if there is a defect in cilia disassembly, we will use CRISPR/Cas 9 and inhibitor approaches to test if the AurA-HDAC6 cilia disassembly pathway is necessary for Chlamydia-induced motile cilia loss. Successful completion of these studies will lead to a new infection model of multiciliated epithelial cells, which are present at natural sites of infection but not in conventional Chlamydia cell culture infection models. We will also define a novel mechanism in which an infectious agent causes motile cilia loss. Inhibitors that prevent Chlamydia-induced cilia loss by targeting the AurA pathway may form the basis for a novel therapeutic strategy to treat chlamydial infections and preserve fertility."

The primary objective of the KL2 program is to recruit, train and nurture a new cadre of professionals with defined knowledge and expertise in CTS. An additional objective, via the ITMAT, is to attain centralized organization and supervision of all clinical and translational training programs at Penn and its partner institutions under a single leadership structure. We will work to achieve this objective across the spectrum of potential and existing postdoctoral trainees transitioning to junior faculty in the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, Engineering and Veterinary Medicine.

"9276056","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In biology, understanding the past can give us insights to better understand the present. The goal of the work proposed in this grant application is to develop integrated sequence, function, and structure approaches to study evolution of all three aspects of individual proteins and the networks they form. Unique tools for protein structure alignment and comparison developed in our group allow us not only to identify common structural elements of pairs and groups of structures, but also to describe and classify differences in the structures. Such analyses can provide us with insights not only into the function-related structural rearrangements, but also into evolutionary changes in the sequence caused by evolutionary drift or function-driven changes. At the same time, analysis of the evolution of protein networks can give us synergistic insights into evolution of functions of the same proteins. In this grant we propose to expand such analyses and integrate them across all three aspects with the help and new tools for such analyses we are planning to develop. Understanding of molecular details of the evolution of protein families, such as identification of regions that are strongly conserved in evolution versus malleable regions undergoing extensive changes with no effect on the function or identification of new functional regions emerging at specific moments in evolution, can give us insights into evolution of various cellular processes. At the same time, such analyses can help us answer practical questions such as effects of disease mutations or responses to drugs."
"9366597","Prostate cancer is a significant global health concern for which new treatments are needed. The long-range goal of our research for nearly two decades has been to develop active immunotherapies, and tumor vaccines in particular, as treatments for prostate cancer. We have focused on DNA vaccines as a simple method, and one specifically aimed at generating tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells. A major effort in our laboratory over the last several years has been to evaluate the tumor response to immunization and identify mechanisms of resistance to immunization. We have found that PD-1 or LAG-3 are upregulated after T cell activation with vaccination, and that even the transient expression of PD-1 or LAG-3 following antigen-specific T-cell activation is sufficient to allow them to be regulated in the immunosuppressive tumor environment, and this can be abrogated using concurrent blockade of PD-1 or LAG-3. We have recently demonstrated that this is true in humans as well, as delivery of a PD-1 blocking antibody (pembrolizumab) at the time of immunization with a DNA vaccine, rather than beginning weeks after immunization, elicited objective anti-prostate tumor responses. This forms the basis of the hypothesis underlying this proposal, namely that given the dynamic nature of the expression of PD-1 or LAG-3 following anti-tumor immunization, blockade of the transient upregulation of regulatory T cell markers (including PD-1 and/or LAG-3) using either antibody blockade or using TLR agonists that reduce expression of these regulatory receptors at the time of T-cell activation via anti-tumor immunization will lead to greater effector CD8 T cells and greater anti-tumor efficacy."
"9380515","PROJECT SUMMARY  Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor of children. MB development often results from the dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways, such as sonic hedgehog and wingless. Recently, epigenetic aberrations, which represent heritable aberrations in gene expression or cellular phenotypes without changes in DNA sequences, have emerged as a major driving force for tumorigenic events. Histone lysine methylation, a type of histone modification, is a hallmark of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of gene expression and is modulated by histone methylation modifiers. In contrast to great advances in our understanding of cellular signaling pathways in MB genesis, the pathogenic role of altered histone methylation modifiers in MB development remains largely unknown. Of histone methylations, methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) occupies most human gene promoters and is associated with active or poised genes. We previously showed that the H3K4 methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 4 (MLL4; also called MLL2, ALR, and KMT2D) is indispensable for retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation of the model human stem cell line NT2/D1. Consistent with this, we also demonstrated that MLL4 activates the expression of several differentiation-specific genes by depositing methylated H3K4. Our additional results showed that Mll4 brain-specific knockout (BSKO) mice developed spontaneous MBs. These findings are consistent with recent massive sequencing studies of human MBs showing that the MLL4 gene often undergoes somatic mutations and deletions. Our long-term goal is to define the tumor-suppressive role of MLL4 in medulloblastoma pathogenesis. Our analysis of expression data suggests that Mll4-loss-induced MBs are close to the most malignant and metastatic MB subtype Group 3. Based on these definitive findings, our central hypothesis is that MLL4 acts as a tumor-suppressor against MB by activating the expression of tumor suppressor genes via regulation of epigenetic signatures. Here, we propose to study to 1) Assess the role of MLL4 in MB development using genetically engineered mouse models; 2) Determine the molecular mechanism underlying the genesis of Mll4-loss-driven MB; 3) Characterize the effect of Mll4 loss on epigenetic signatures during MB genesis. These studies will reveal the previously unknown epigenetic mechanism underlying MB pathogenesis and provide beneficial information for the development of MB therapies."
"9290963","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health and health behavior depend crucially on social networks. Both the spread of communicable diseases, such as HIV, and the diffusion of beliefs and practices that shape health behavior, such as dietary risk behavior, can be understood as network-generated health processes, operating over (sometimes very complex and dynamic) social networks. This recognition is evidenced by the dramatic growth in social network and health studies in the last 15 years. Despite the clear demand and growing recognition of health importance, network methods are rarely covered in the standard social-science methods sequences characteristics of health and health-policy scholars. Since the methodological scope of network science is so broad, we use a pragmatic approach that draws on the depth of local expertise among triangle universities. We start with a core set of foundational courses that branch out to workshops specifically designed around skills needed for in-hand projects the students are working on. This novel trunk-and-branch training structure will simultaneously create broad understanding and literacy in social network and health research while providing program fellows (triangle-area NIH pre-and post-docs) with the skills and resources needed to move research from inchoate ideas to practical, well-reasoned and generative social networks and health research."
"9252586","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychotic spectrum disorders (PSD) are difficult to differentially diagnose and treat, typically leaving their victims with lifetime disability. It is increasingly becoming recognized that traditionally distinct disorders such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder with psychotic features share overlapping symptoms. For example, in addition to positive symptoms, PSD patients also experience deficits in cognitive control/executive functioning, which likely result from dysregulation of the mesocortical and mesostriatal pathways. Importantly, cognitive deficits contribute to deficits in interpersonal and occupational functioning, more traditional clinical symptoms (e.g., disorganized thinking) and are currently refractory to treatment. The current application will use novel recruiting strategies and novel multivariate analytic techniques to establish empirical, neuronally-based cluster metrics (i.e., circuit-level pathologies) that are associated with impairments in cognitive control (primary outcome) and everyday functioning (secondary outcome) in PSD regardless of traditional diagnoses (DSM-V). Other potential mediating variables evaluated in the current model include negative symptoms and disorganized thinking. We investigate potential causal mechanisms for these circuit- level pathologies by examining the aggregation of specific genetic mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) within three neurotransmitter (dopamine, glutamate and GABA) signaling pathways, axonal guidance pathway, and synaptic long-term potentiation pathways based on our preliminary data. Finally, an exploratory aim evaluates whether the expression of cognitive control deficits across multiple psychiatric illnesses is mediated by each individual's total number of rare deletions in DNA (copy number variations; CNVs). To evaluate these hypotheses, 175 continuously recruited PSD patients will complete an extensive clinical battery and undergo multimodal neuroimaging. Evoked and intrinsic hemodynamic activity will be used in conjunction with white matter assays (diffusion tensor imaging) to investigate the integrity and connectivity of the cognitive control circuit (dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) during a multisensory cognitive control task with real-world validity. PSD patients will be classified into meaningful entities based on univariate and multivariate indices of grey/white matter pathology in the cognitive control network using a K-means algorithm. We will then determine the predictive validity of these clusters for describing deficits in cognitive control and everyday functioning, using the leave-one-out methodology to verify the model. Thus, the current application utilizes multiple units of analyses (genes, circuits, self-report, behavior, and paradigms) from the NIMH Research Domain Criteria to develop a novel classification system based on neurophysiological and genetic biomarkers of impaired cognitive control that spans traditional diagnostic categories. We are confident that moving beyond traditional nosologies will result in more meaningful diagnoses and ultimately more successful treatments for refractory symptoms, leading to substantial improvements in mental health care."
"9279202","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein folding is a process of supramolecular assembly that suffers unavoidable competition from alternative processes including misfolding to dead-end products and intermolecular association that may lead to aggregation. Yet, in order to perform their normal functions most proteins must fold correctly in challenging and complex cellular environments. In vivo, the processes that compete with folding can cause major physiological problems both because a protein cannot function if it does not adopt its native fold and also because the side-products of misfolding are potentially toxic to cells. Protein misfolding and its attendant consequences are implicated in a growing number of diseases, including cystic fibrosis, serpinopathies, and a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's. Cells commit substantial resources to facilitate protein folding in complex in vivo environments and to minimize risks of misfolding. Central to how cells cope with the challenges of protein folding are the molecular chaperones and degradation enzymes that together comprise a protein homeostasis network. However, the ability of protein homeostasis networks to cope with proteins that are prone to misfolding (due either to their intrinsic properties, or mutations, or aberrant production) can be exceeded, and it is this situation that underlies many pathologies. The research in this MIRA application seeks to elucidate the interplay between biophysical properties of protein folding and the mechanisms of protein homeostasis networks through two overarching projects: 1) a combined computational modeling and experimental interrogation of protein homeostasis networks in E. coli and in eukaryotic cellular compartments, and 2) structure-function studies of the Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones, which play central roles in protein homeostasis networks in all kingdoms of life. The knowledge and insights gained from this research will shed light on how in-cell protein folding energy landscapes are remodeled by protein homeostasis networks. The understanding and insights provided by this research will help guide future efforts to develop therapeutic strategies to treat protein misfolding-associated diseases."
"9308812","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is designed to examine brain properties for placebo responses in chronic back pain patients. We have preliminary data indicating that, in blinded clinical trial studies with neutral instructions regarding treatment, chronic back pain (CBP) and osteoarthritis patients can be subdivided into placebo responders and non- responders and these differences are PREDICTABLE a priori by brain activity. The results imply that CBP placebo response may have clinical utility and that its properties can be studied by human brain imaging techniques. We address these issues in three specific aims, where CBP placebo response properties are studied in a double blind clinical trial (RCT) setting. In Aim 1, we will examine the reproducibility and predictability of the propensity to placebo response in CBP patients. Brain anatomy and function are assessed prior to the start of the RCTs and at different time points during the trial. Additionally, pain and quality of life profilesare collected throughout the trial, using smart phone technology monitoring to acquire these parameters in a naturalistic setting. Brain biomarker outcomes and predictions are contrasted between CBP placebo responders and non- responders, and compared to no treatment. Washout periods are used to test for reversibility of placebo responses. In Aim 2, we study the interaction between placebo and medication treatment, and validate the predictability of placebo propensity in CBP. In Aim 3, we develop a self-report measure to predict placebo propensity based on correlations with neuro-imaging biomarkers. Overall, these studies are designed to critically assess the neurobiology of placebo analgesia for chronic pain within the setting of clinical trials, and creating a readily available clinically useful instrument to identify placebo responders. If successful, the completion of the outlined studies has the potential to dramatically alter health care in chronic pain."
"9352696","PROJECT SUMMARY  Advanced data collection methods create the means for science to progress. Unfortunately, important findings in the nascent field of survey methodology, which dedicates itself to improving the science of survey data collection, have been largely isolated from many substantive fields, including the social, behavioral, and health sciences. Even though these disciplines stand to prosper from important advances in the field of survey methodology, researchers collecting survey data in these fields generally do not have any exposure to these advances. This knowledge gap can be decreased by providing researchers in many areas of scientific inquiry with exposure to the recent methodological advances in survey methodology so that their scientific data collections can benefit from improved efficiency and data quality. Especially important are new survey methodologies that have been labeled ?responsive survey design,? which were developed in response to growing uncertainty about the impacts of various survey design features on survey costs and errors. Responsive survey designs allow investigators to dynamically respond to rapidly evolving field data collections, maximizing the scientific gain possible within fixed budget constraints.  The proposed research education program aims to break down barriers between researchers in the health, behavioral, and social sciences and survey methodology by exposing these researchers to the newest literature on state-of-the-art survey data collection techniques and engaging them with hands-on examples of easy-to-use methods. The proposed research education program has the following four specific aims:  1. Provide survey researchers worldwide in the health, behavioral, and social sciences with rigorous  training in novel scientific approaches to continuously improving the survey data collection process.  2. Provide participants with online networking tools to continuously exchange ideas, stay aware of state-  of-the-art developments, and report both successes and implementation difficulties.  3. Organically measure and adapt to the research education needs of researchers collecting survey data.  4. Expand the offering of short courses from the program to other locales and online formats that will  appeal to an even broader international audience of researchers applying survey research methods."
"9293129","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motility enables sperm to reach the egg for fertilization, and normal sperm motility is largely dependent on formation and function of the flagella. An elongating spermatid-specific, the manchette, has been proposed to play a central role in sperm flagella formation. Meiosis expressed protein 1 (MEIG1) is a key protein that regulates manchette stability and sperm flagella formation. The protein was identified as a binding partner of Sperm Associated-Antigen 16L (SPAG16L), a sperm tail axoneme protein; it also binds the protein product (PACRG) of the Parkin co-regulated gene. The reproductive phenotype of Pacrg-deficient mice mirrors that of the Meig1 mutant mice. PACRG is expressed post-meiotically and is localized to the manchette. MEIG1 and SPAG16L are present in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes. However, both proteins migrate to the manchette in elongating spermatids. MEIG1 loses its manchette localization in the Pacrg-deficient elongating spermatids. In Meig1-deficient mice, SPAG16L loses its manchette localization. These observations suggest a role for MEIG1 in protein escort/targeting. MEIG1 consists of only 88 amino acids, and no functional domains were identified with bioinformatic tools. It is phosphorylated in vivo, and phosphorylation might modulate MEIG1 function, although this has not been established. Our preliminary studies using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed that MEIG1 forms an unique structure that provides a large surface area for interaction with other proteins, and several amino acids, including several potential sites for phosphorylation in the aromatic and charged regions, may form protein-protein interaction surfaces. The long-term objective of this research is to investigate the role of MEIG1 complexes in mammalian sperm flagellogenesis. We propose three aims: 1) To dissect the SPAG16L/MEIG1/PACRG complex in vivo and in vitro; 2) To identify domains of MEIG1 that mediate interactions with PACRG and SPAG16L; 3). To determine the role of post-translational modification in MEIG1 function. We hypothesize that MEIG1 functions as a chaperone that associates with multiple proteins, maintains the integrity of the manchette, and plays a role in assembly of the sperm flagella. PACRG recruits MEIG1 to the manchette through binding to a specific domain of MEIG1, and MEIG1 binds other proteins such as SPAG16L through a different domain. Mutations/deletions of the domains will reduce or abolish MEIG1 interaction with these proteins. MEIG1 binds to PACRG and SPAG16L with differential binding affinities to facilitate docking of MEIG1 to PACRG associated with the manchette and off-loading of its cargo (e.g., SPAG16L). We anticipate that MEIG1 has several phosphorylated amino acids in vivo, and phosphorylation controls its affinity to cargo proteins. Little is known about the mechanisms that lead to the proper targeting and assembly of these molecules into the sperm flagellum. The research proposed in this application will, for the first time, reveal the molecular basis of the escort of proteins to the site of flagellum assembly, and the structure/function relationships of a unique chaperone that is essential for normal spermiogenesis."
"9272002","Acute lung injury (ALI) and chronic lung disease are together the third leading cause of death in the United  States, in part due to our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that govern injury responses in the  lung. Extracellular adenosine is generated following hypoxia, and serves to orchestrate tissue responses to  injury by engaging adenosine receptors. This pathway is known as the hypoxic adenosine response. Our  findings suggest that adenosine serves beneficial functions on features of ALI such as the maintenance of  barrier function and the dampening of inflammation. In contrast, adenosine contributes to chronic lung injury  by promoting fibrosis and the development of pulmonary hypertension secondary to fibrosis. Furthermore,  our findings suggest that the AD0RA2B adenosine receptor regulates both the beneficial and detrimental  aspects of adenosine in the lung. The goal of this Project is to better understand the mechanisms involved  in adenosine-mediated protection during ALI and its role in disease progression in order to advance  adenosine-based therapies for the treatment of lung disease. We have recently gained insight into two  pathways that provide information on the differential roles of adenosine in lung disease. First, we show that  the equilabrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2) is down regulated during both acute and chronic lung  injury. ENTs are critical regulators of extracellular adenosine and we hypothesize that their regulation is  involved in adenosine's protective effects during ALI and it's harmful effects during chronic disease stages.  Secondly, we show the emergence of AD0RA2B-dependent responses on alternately activated  macrophages (AAMs) during chronic disease stages. These specialized macrophages contribute to chronic  disease progression, and we hypothesize that AAMs contribute to the stage selective responses to  adenosine that promote pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. Four specific aims are designed to  address these hypotheses and determine their significance towards human lung disease: Aim 1. Examine  the beneficial roles of adenosine in ALI, Aim 2. Examine alterations in the hypoxic adenosine response  during disease progression; Aim 3. Examine detrimental roles of adenosine in pulmonary hypertension  secondary to fibrosis, and Aim 4. Examine the hypoxic adenosine response in patients with acute and  chronic lung disease. Successful completion of this study will help promote the use of adenosine-based  therapies for the treatment of lung disease."
"9276804","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a group of inherited disorders that specifically affect the peripheral nerves system and is characterized by progressive muscle atrophy, sensory loss and bone deformities. This genetic disease, for which there is no effective therapy, is one of the most commonly inherited neurological disorders affecting approximately 1 in 2,500 people equating to approximately 125,000 people in the United States. Multiple mutations in four different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes are causally linked to CMT. Thus tRNA synthetases are one of the largest gene families associated with CMT. This underscores the importance of tRNA synthetase in the etiology of the disease. Understanding the connection between CMT and tRNA synthetases is a challenge. Because tRNA synthetases are essential players in protein synthesis, the dogma has been that the CMT-causing mutations in tRNA synthetases must affect protein synthesis in some way. Intriguingly, CMT-causing mutations do not necessarily affect the aminoacylation function of the enzyme; and almost all tRNA synthetase mutations that are CMT-associated have autosomal dominant trait, suggesting a gain-of-function disease mechanism. Lastly, as protein synthesis is essential for all tissue types, the extreme tissue specificity associated with the CMT phenotypes has complicated the biological understanding of the role of tRNA synthetases in CMT disease. The goal of this project is to determine the disease-causing mechanism for DI-CMTC, a subtype of CMT caused by dominant mutations in tyrosine tRNA synthetase (TyrRS or YARS). Through international collaborations and a cross-disciplinary approach that combines methods of Drosophila genetics, biochemistry and cell and molecular biology, we will define the mechanism through which YARS mutations are linked to DI-CMTC. Broadly speaking, the tRNA synthetase family represents one class of DNA/RNA binding proteins that, as a whole, have emerged as an important player in neurodegenerative processes and as potential targets for therapeutic development. Thus, the mechanistic understanding we will obtain from the current study would certainly shed light on the etiology of other neurological disorders beyond CMT."
"9324638","Project Summary  Sulfur dioxide (SO2) has been recognized as a potential signaling molecule in cardiovascular systems. Although SO2's exact mechanisms of action are still under investigation, the production of endogenous SO2 and the exogenous administration of SO2 have been demonstrated to exert protective effects in models of certain cardiovascular diseases. These results strongly suggest that modulation of SO2 levels could have potential therapeutic values. In this field, suitable SO2 releasing agents (i.e. donors) are important research tools for better understanding the roles of SO2 in cardiovascular systems. The donors are also potential therapeutic agents. Unfortunately, only very few SO2 donors are currently known. Moreover, these compounds are not ideal for biological studies due to their bio-incompatible SO2 release mechanisms. This represents a significant limitation for fundamental SO2 studies, as well as for the use of SO2 therapy in chronic cardiovascular and other disease states. Our recent study revealed that benzothiazole sulfinate (BTS) is a suitable template for the design of novel SO2 donors. In this project, our goal is to develop and optimize long-lasting and controllable SO2 donor based on BTS and related structures. We will also explore cardioprotective actions of the donors in cell models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury. We expect promising candidates will be identified for future evaluations in animal models of MI/R and heart failure."
"9274343","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electrochemical Impedance to Assess Metabolically Active Plaque Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease; however, its manifestations tend to be focal and eccentric, and rupture of individual plaques is the primary underlying mechanism for myocardial infarction and stroke. Plaques prone to rupture contain high levels of inflammatory activity, due to oxidized lipids and foam cells. Fluid shear stress, in addition to its mechanical effects on vascular endothelial cells, promotes oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in plaque. However, real-time detection of the atherosclerotic lesions prone to rupture remains an unmet clinical challenge. Encouraging results from our previous exploratory R21 funding period demonstrated that integration of intravascular shear stress (ISS) and endoluminal electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) distinguishes pre-atherogenic lesions associated with oxidative stress in fat-fed New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. Specifically, vessel walls harboring oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) exhibit distinct electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) magnitude, and that monocytes and oxLDL together destabilize calcific vascular nodules via induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). In this context, we seek to develop an electrochemical strategy to identify culprit (albeit non-obstructive) lesions containing oxLDL-laden monocyte- macrophages (foam cells), during diagnostic angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention. We hypothesize that oxLDL-rich lesions harbor distinct electrochemical properties in the vessel wall that can be measured by frequency-dependent electrochemical impedance to identify metabolically active atherosclerotic lesions. Our hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Determine the mechanism by which oxLDL-rich lesions increase electrochemical impedance. EIS will be obtained in plaque from LDL receptor-knockout (LDLR-/-) mice. We hypothesize that it is the oxidant stress in the lesions that increases EIS magnitude. Aim 2: Determine in vivo sensitivity and specificity of EIS for oxLDL-laden, foam cell-rich lesions in fat-fed NZW rabbits as an established model of atherosclerosis with plaques accessible to catheter interrogation. We will also integrate three intravascular sensing modalities, shear stress (ISS), ultrasound (IVUS), and electrochemical impedance (EIS), for early detection of metabolically unstable lesions. Aim 3: Determine in vivo risk of rupture in high EIS plaque in a swine model. We will test whether high EIS lesions are prone to rupture and embolization, and we will assess whether the combination of high impedance and high shear predict lesion predisposition to embolization. Overall, our cross-disciplinary efforts aim to integrate electrochemical properties of active lipid-laden lesions with three animal models and three sensing modalities to establish early detection of unstable lesions for patient-specific intervention."
"9369313","PROJECT SUMMARY Since 1976, there have been nearly 20 confirmed outbreaks of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), all originating in sub-Saharan Africa. The most recent outbreak in West Africa was by far the largest, leading to nearly 30,000 suspected and confirmed cases of EVD and 12,000 deaths. Although Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone accounted for the vast majority of cases, infections imported from these countries were identified in seven additional countries, including the United States. The magnitude and geographic breadth of the recent epidemic, coupled with its high overall mortality, highlights the global health dangers posed by future EVD outbreaks and the associated need for better management strategies in order to improve disease survival. However, there remains a lack of high-quality data on the efficacy of various clinical interventions for EVD, and to date no multisite studies exist evaluating the impacts of commonly utilized supportive care and treatment modalities on patient-centered outcomes. Between September 2014 and December 2015, the humanitarian organization International Medical Corps (IMC) managed five Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) in Liberia and Sierra Leone, which cared for over 2,500 patients, including 470 with confirmed EVD. From these sites, IMC collected over 25,000 pages of clinical, laboratory, and operational data. Prior to the closure of the ETUs, IMC underwent the painstaking work of extracting, digitizing, aggregating, and quality checking this data. This extensive process yielded a unique database that can now be used to evaluate the impacts of specific clinical interventions on patient-centered outcomes among EVD infected individuals. Using advanced statistical methodologies, the impacts of various supportive care interventions, including rehydration therapies, micronutrient supplementation, and antimicrobials, on mortality and duration of symptoms in EVD-infected patients will be evaluated. This research has the potential to improve the evidence-base for international EVD guidelines, identify potentially high-yield interventions for future study in controlled trials, and improve the quality of the overall response to future EVD epidemics."
"9306192","SUMMARY The overall objective of the Basic Science Core I (BSCI) is to provide in vitro shared resources and training to basic and clinical researchers studying HIV-1 induced neurological disorders at the molecular and cellular levels, and initiate translational research toward better understanding of disease mechanisms and discovery of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and development of intelligent therapies toward cure. It is now clear that the current antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively controls viremia in virtually all HIV-1 patients, but fails to eliminate HIV-1 from latently infected cells including T-cells, macrophages, brain microglial cells, and cells in other sites of latency throughout the body. As such, patients remain at risk for rapid viral rebound upon interruption of ART. New strategies are needed to ablate the virus from latently infected cells and/or identify and destroy latently infected cells. The BSCI is designed to provide investigators with intellectual and technical expertise along with cellular and molecular tools to initiate research for understanding mechanisms of HIV- 1/CNS disease and the development of cell and virus based strategies toward control and elimination of HIV-1 infection in the CNS. The cell culture facility of BSCI provides investigators with well characterized highly purified cells prepared from brain including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells, as well as cultured peripheral blood cells for performing molecular, cellular, and virological studies toward virus-host interaction, assessing efficiency of the methodologies for elimination of latently infected cells and virus, and high throughput approaches toward identification of biomarkers. The BSCI also provides state-of- the-art services for discovering the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of AIDS-associated CNS dysfunction through proteomics/metabolomics and data analysis. Novel methods for discovering biomarkers, innovative differential expression profiling and bioinformatics, along with interactomics and phosphoproteomics are among the services that will be reliably and efficiently offered to investigators. The core's unique expertise in gene editing and gene delivery will be used to guide investigators in the development and implementation of effective strategies for introducing mutations in viral genes and host genes and implementing various techniques for assessing the efficacy and specificity of editing strategies and utilizing the most effective viral vectors including lentivirus, AAV, and adenovirus for delivery. Our core will work closely with the other cores to promote a comprehensive multidisciplinary collaborative center program. This synergistic approach will ensure the success of CNAC developmental award recipients and CNAC users in conducting productive high impact research in neuroAIDS."

"9272916","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Efforts to address the disparities between low-income and more affluent children in school readiness and academic achievement through early childhood education (ECE) programs have yielded mixed results. Such findings have led to a broader consideration of what competencies are essential in supporting children's transition to formal schooling and their long-term academic success. There has been a growing recognition of school readiness as multidimensional, encompassing not just pre-academic skills, but behavioral, emotional, and social competencies as well. This perspective also emphasizes that children are embedded in a network of relationships with their parents, teachers, and peers, and that interventions aimed at enhancing school outcomes must seek to improve the quality of those relationships. Thus, there has been a growing interest in interventions that aim to promote a more attuned parent-child relationship, wherein parents learn to give greater consideration to their child's internal experiences, to respond less reflexively and more reflectively to these experiences. Such interventions may be especially valuable for vulnerable families facing a multitude of adversities that may compromise caregiving. This study aims to implement and evaluate the Reflective Parenting Program (RPP) with families receiving ECE services in a community agency. RPP is a center-based, time-limited intervention designed to enhance parents' capacity to better understand and respond to their child's affective experiences, setting the stage enhanced behavioral and emotional regulation in the child. This project entails a randomized control trial of RPP with 240 English and Spanish-speaking parents of children enrolled in ECE services at Children's Institute Incorporated (CII). Parents will be randomized to either an English-language (n=60) or Spanish-language RPP intervention group (n=60) or an English-language (n=60) or Spanish-language (n=60) Control Group. Parents assigned to the Control Group and their children will continue to participate in any other services they are receiving through CII (i.e., standard of care) during their participation in the study. All familie will be assessed at pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2), and at a 9 month follow-up (T3). In comparison to the Control Group, we hypothesize that: 1) children of parents participating in RPP will show significantly greater improvements in emotional and behavioral regulation in comparison to children of parents in the Control Group; 2) parents participating in RPP will report significantly greater improvements in parental reflective functioning, and decreases in parenting stress than parents in the Control Group; 3) parents participating in RPP will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in behavioral and emotional responsiveness and parental communication during parent-child interactions; 4) improvements in child, parent, and parent-child outcomes will be maintained over the 9 month follow-up period; 5) parents participating in RPP and therapists trained in RPP will report high levels of satisfaction."
"9268011","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common pediatric movement disorder, affecting 3.6/1000 children in the US, with 11,000 new diagnoses every year. Motor and sensory dysfunction in CP often worsen over time, leading to costly lifelong physical, social and emotional disabilities. However, interventions that take advantage of activity-dependent brain plasticity can result in lasting improvements of movement execution and extremity use that optimize motor and social function into adulthood. Among the greatest challenges in the rehabilitation of children with CP is overcoming developmental disregard (DD). This form of neglect starts in infancy impairs the ability to infer new and effective movements and contributes to neurodevelopmental trajectories that rarely equal those of typically developing children. The sooner a therapy can overcome DD, the greater its impact on later neurodevelopment, especially if it can start before 3 years old, when neural plasticity is greatest Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), well-studied in adults, improves upper extremity function through forced-use and sensory exposure of a neglected extremity. The short-term objective of this proposal is to show that CIMT at or before 2 years old can improve upper extremity sensory and motor function and thereby mitigate DD. To accomplish this, the study uses a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with a wait- list control, in children 12-24 months with asymmetric CP. The CIMT intervention includes 1 month of soft constraint wear on the less affected arm (1/2 day sessions, electronically-monitored) combined with a validated parent-implemented home-based program of reach training and sensory exposures for the more affected extremity, in addition to routine therapy sessions (current standard CP treatment). Children with CP will be assessed at baseline, and at 1 and 7 months. Children assigned to the control group will receive CIMT after the RCT is finished and be assessed again. Typically developing (TD) age-matched children will also be tested. The RCT phase of the trial will demonstrate that CIMT improves the sensory and motor function of an affected upper extremity. The comparison of TD children and CP children before treatment will answer mechanistic questions about how the relationship between sensory and motor function contributes to impairments. Finally, referencing all CP children to TD children will provide new information on how the severity of CP and the timing of CIMT may change the neurodevelopmental trajectories of treated children. This will inform the evidence-based design of future trials of rehabilitation n developing children with disabilities. Importantly, the CIMT intervention itself does not involve extensive material and intellectual resources and focuses instead on implementing a carefully monitored home-based program, allowing an application to settings with limited access to resources. The overarching goals of this proposal are therefore to address gaps in the continuum of translational research in the field of pediatric cerebral palsy in order to increase the clinical and societal relevance of this type of rehabilitation research."
"9281049","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diet, exercise, stress and sleep are receiving attention as important environmental modifiers of chronic inflammatory diseases. Accumulating evidence indicates that psychosocial stress and a diet high in fat and cholesterol aggravate, whereas regular physical activity and healthy sleeping habits help to prevent atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that clinically relevant environmental inputs affect specific biological immune pathways that can be targeted to reverse the atherosclerosis disease trajectory. Hematopoiesis, the process by which monocytes and their descendant macrophages develop from multipotent progenitors, is essential to disease development and progression. Hematopoiesis adjusts to environmental stimuli, its configuration aligning with disease severity. As atherosclerosis worsens, control of cell production in the bone marrow deteriorates. Through mechanisms we do not fully understand, protective medullary niches expel hematopoietic progenitors, which then seed secondary lymphoid organs where they give rise to inflammatory cells through extramedullary hematopoiesis. At advanced stages of disease, even mature, fully-differentiated leukocytes undergo limited hematopoiesis in the vessel wall. Here, we will test the hypothesis that real-life modifiers of disease, such as diet, exercise, stress and sleep, influence the leukocyte supply chain. We will test, using mouse models, how lifestyle changes hematopoiesis' molecular and cellular machinery during atherosclerosis. We propose that negative modification (high fat diet, lack of exercise, chronic stress, and sleep deprivation) rearranges hematopoietic geography, diverting production from the bone marrow to the periphery, thus propagating a quantitative and qualitative drift of the macrophage supply chain. We will examine the microenvironment that governs macrophage production, including growth factors, cytokines and adhesion molecules that regulate hematopoiesis (proliferation, retention, migration patterns of progenitors from bone marrow to spleen). Apoe-/- and Ldlr-/- mice will be exposed to various lifestyle changes and microenvironmental factors will be studied using double knock out mice and functional genomics approaches which rely on nanoparticle-enabled in vivo RNAi. We will further study how lifestyle alters cell-intrinsic factors that influence proliferation, migraton and phenotype of macrophages and their progenitors. Specifically, we will target transcription factors which give rise to myeloid biased hematopoietic stem cells. Our motivation is to understand how lifestyle transforms hematopoiesis and how these transformations influence the course of disease. In conjunction with improvements in public health policy, future therapeutics may involve nudging the hematopoietic tree towards reversal of risk. The work will substantially improve understanding of how leukocytes are (over)supplied in the setting of cardiovascular disease. These new insights into how the hematopoietic system is perturbed after exposure to real-life risk factors will provide a foundation for new therapeutic strategies aiming at reduction of inflammation in blood vessels, in the heart and in the brain."
"9269122","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Throughout human pregnancy, the placenta is indispensable for embryonic development, fetal growth and tissue differentiation. The placenta also protects the fetus against diverse insults, while preserving maternal health. Placental dysfunction is commonly implicated in complications of pregnancy that challenge maternal physiology (e.g., preeclampsia) and fetal development (e.g., fetal death or fetal growth restriction) or that leads to preterm birth. Within the placenta, the trophoblast constitutes the outermost layer, which is directly bathed in maternal blood and therefore positioned to regulate maternal-fetal gas exchange, nutrient delivery, waste removal and the production of hormones, faithfully balancing fetal needs and maternal supply. Trophoblast damage, which is common in dysfunctional placentas, may interrupt the delicate maternal-fetal balance, cause clinical disease, and leave a lifelong mark on health. A fundamental challenge in perinatal medicine arises from our limited ability to diagnose placental disorders in real time and throughout pregnancy. However, the recent discovery, by ourselves and others, that (a) placental trophoblasts release distinctive micro- and nanovesicles into the maternal circulation and (b) these vesicles contain trophoblast-specific non-coding RNA cargo, created a new opportunity for assessing trophoblast health. These vesicles are actively released by trophoblasts throughout pregnancy, and thus serve as a venipuncture-accessible natural biopsy of trophoblasts, which can furnish information on trophoblast health in real time. Our established perinatal biology group at Magee- Womens Research Institute includes expertise in perinatal medicine and placental pathology, developmental and molecular biology, and bioinformatics. Inspired by these recent advances, we have partnered with an experienced group of bioengineers that includes experts from Carnegie Mellon University, MIT, and Penn State University, with unique skills in biophysics-based vesicle analytics, including microfluidics, nanomechanics, micro/nano fabrication and vesicle sorting using acoustic tweezers. Together, our new transdisciplinary group will use integrated molecular and biophysical methodologies to directly assess the use of trophoblast-derived extracellular vesicles from maternal plasma as revelatory of trophoblast health in real time and as a technique that may be employed throughout pregnancy. Our approach is comprehensive, centering on miRNAs as well as lncRNAs and circRNAs, analyzed in exosome nanovesicles, as well as microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. As each vesicle features a unique bimolecular and biophysical signature, we will deploy our machine learning- based training and testing pipeline to informatively integrate these distinct signals into an innovative diagnostic tool. Lastly, our deployment of affordable acoustic tweezers technology to sort trophoblastic vesicles will facilitate the translation of our advances into a new lab on a chip placental diagnostic technology, suitable for small blood volumes. This technology may not only denote trophoblast pathology, but has potential to identify those who may benefit from intervention and to monitor therapeutic success."
"9318613","Project Summary BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common form of primary adult brain cancer and remains a deadly disease. The standard of care for glioblastoma involves surgical resection followed by radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy (TMZ). While Progression Free Survival (PFS) studies have revealed that nearly 80% of treated patients are responsive to TMZ at 6 months, only approximately 10% of these patients remain responsive by 24 months. We investigated whether altered microRNA (miRNA) expression during TMZ treatment contributes to acquired TMZ resistance. To this end, we profiled miRNAs in matched pre- and post- TMZ treated glioblastoma cell lines and clinical specimens. We identified one miRNA, miR-181d, which is down-regulated in response to TMZ treatment in both of these settings and profoundly influenced cellular TMZ sensitivity. miR-181d normally suppresses the expression of multiple DNA repair genes critical for TMZ resistance, including Methyl-Guanine Methyl-Transferase (MGMT) and homologous recombination (HR) genes. TMZ-induced miR-181d degradation up-regulates both processes and contributes to TMZ resistance. This proposal will characterize miRNA degradation as an acquired resistance mechanism and develop a therapy that targets this resistance. AIM 1 proposes experiments to characterize a) the molecular mechanisms by which the DNA damage response triggers miRNA degradation and b) the relevance of this process to acquired TMZ resistance. AIM 2 proposes experiments to a) characterize the genetic context in which miR- 181d degradation contributes to acquired TMZ resistance and b) determine the miR-181d regulated processes that contribute to this resistance. AIM 3 is built on the premise that over-expression of miR-181d beyond cellular capacity for degradation will suppress acquired TMZ resistance; to that end, we propose a miRNA based gene therapeutic approach to address the issue of acquired TMZ resistance. INNOVATION: The proposed study to characterize TMZ-induced miRNA degradation as a novel mechanism of acquired TMZ resistance is an innovative and heretofore unexplored approach. Moreover, this proposal develops an original framework that miRNA degradation simultaneously up-regulates multiple DNA repair processes that, in turn, contribute to TMZ resistance. Finally, we propose an innovative therapeutic strategy for addressing this form of resistance. LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE: We seek to meaningfully impact the care of glioblastoma patients through the application of principles developed in the fields of DNA repair, microRNAs, and retroviral gene therapy."

"9362124","PROJECT SUMMARY Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that is currently spreading throughout the Americas at such a rate that the World Health Organization has declared this a public health emergency of international concern. ZIKV is particularly dangerous among women since infection during pregnancy has been associated with fetal abnormalities including microcephaly and severe neurological disorders. Although a handful of vaccine candidates are under different stages of evaluation, there is no licensed vaccine available to combat this epidemic. Previously, we have developed inactivated vaccines that have shown efficacy in a number of preclinical models and in particular, protection against other flavivirus-associated diseases such as West Nile virus encephalitis and viscerotropic yellow fever. Here, we provide preliminary data on an advanced ZIKV vaccine candidate that induces strong neutralizing antibody responses against geographically distinct strains of ZIKV and protects against lethal disease in an immunodeficient mouse model. Based on these promising results, we have assembled a team of investigators with the expertise and resources necessary to prepare clinical-grade ZIKV vaccine suitable for Phase I trials. This project incorporates many of the essential vaccine development goals listed in RFA-AI-16-034 including evaluation of safety, toxicity, and immunogenicity; evaluation of efficacy in appropriate challenge models; optimization of production methods/process development; quality assurance/quality controls for analysis and characterization of vaccine components including purification, identity, and stability at optimal and elevated storage temperatures; and cGMP-compliant manufacturing of vaccine material suitable for completing all applicable IND-enabling preclinical studies. Upon completion of these objectives, we will have cGMP-grade vaccine material suitable for initiation of Phase I clinical trials and an opportunity to reduce the burden of ZIKV-associated disease and infant microcephaly."
"9281832","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to continue support for the Program to Increase Diversity in Cardiovascular Health-Related Research (PRIDE-CVD) at the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York. The goal of the PRIDE-CVD is to instruct scientists/clinicians in multidisciplinary approaches to research in cardiovascular health disparities using Brooklyn as a living laboratory. The PRIDE-CVD has been in existence for 8 years and has trained 52 scholars. More than a half of the scholars have secured funding from NIH after 2 years of their summer training and 30% were promoted from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor. To continue to build on this success and years of experience, the renewed Program has the following Specific aims:  1: To select qualified underrepresented scientists and clinicians who have potential to contribute to the state of current knowledge in cardiovascular disease research;  2: To train a diverse group of scientists in multidisciplinary research methods to address cardiovascular health disparities;  3: To mentor program participants with the goal of helping them submit a research grant application;  4: To provide underrepresented scientists with intensive individualized training and guidance in grant writing and peer review in order to enhance their capacity for success in their research careers;  5: To evaluate long-term effectiveness of PRIDE-CVD. The PRIDE-CVD at Downstate is characterized by: 1) its partnership with minority-led community-based organizations with expertise on health disparities; 2) the living laboratory of Brooklyn, New York, an urban setting in which to conduct health disparities and CVD research; 3) a well renown faculty roster with a high number of minority members; 4) a historical context providing eight years of experience in training and supporting minority scholars. It is expected that the PRIDE-CVD will continue to contribute significantly to improving the pool of highly-capable minority professionals in cardiovascular health research."
"9278218","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by high absolute rates of HIV/AIDS infection and high rates of new infections. There are approximately 16.6 million AIDS orphans (children who have lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS), 14.8 million of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa1. These orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) are the focus of the proposed work. Specifically, we intend to work in Zambia, a sub-Saharan country with high rates of infection and as many as 600,000 children orphaned by HIV/AIDS and another 150,000 (ages 0-14) living with HIV/AIDS. Rather than focusing on specific OVC interventions, we will focus on all interventions administered within a 25km radius of a well-established regional hospital, Macha Mission Hospital (MMH), to assess their effects on the OVC in the area. We will do this in two steps. First, we will construct a representative sample of ~1,000 OVC, ages 7-17, and characterize them using an array of well-defined indicators that focus on their health, well-being, and cognitive, academic, and adaptive functioning. This characterization will be longitudinal, with at least 3 time points for each individual. Second, we will identify and characterize all interventions that are delivered to these OVC, first via information from the OVC themselves and their caregivers, then by surveying the providing organizations. Using a mixed-method design, we will assemble qualitative and quantitative evidence, describing key components of the existing programs to differentiate, at least preliminarily, the effectiveness of the present interventions. We hypothesize that interventions with a strong component aimed at safeguarding OVC access to continuous schooling of adequate quality will stand out as most promising with respect to ensuring OVC's developmental potential."
"9324379","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) in Ghana. Despite the availability of effective treatment, TB is the leading cause of death in PLHIV. Over 50% of all HIV deaths in Ghana are attributed to TB. Consequently, TB in PLHIV is a key priority for both the National TB Control Programme (NTP) and National AIDS Control Programme (NACP). The gaps in TB and HIV research in Ghana cross several disciplines including epidemiology, basic, clinical, social, behavioral, and implementation sciences, as well public health including health systems and health services research. Thus, a multidisciplinary research program is necessary to address yet unanswered and emerging questions that could transform TB prevention and care programs. At a planning meeting in Ghana to develop this application, academics, program managers and community stakeholders identified limited human and institutional research capacity as key barriers to address challenges in areas such as: TB prevention, case detection (including multi-drug resistant TB), integration of TB and HIV services, programmatic rollout of new diagnostics and interventions, as well as health services strengthening including financing. This proposal builds on 10 years of collaborative research between Brown and University of Ghana that led to NIH and USAID grant funding, as well as important publications in the field. The long-term goal of this application is to strengthen institutional capacity at the University of Ghana for multidisciplinary research with a focus on addressing TB/HIV research priorities. This goal will be achieved through a mix of research training programs in key disciplines. The specific objectives of the program are: (1) To implement a long-term research training program that will lead to a critical mass of researchers in the focus area of TB/HIV coinfection. Degree and post-doctoral training depending on the needs of the trainee will be undertaken at University of Ghana, Brown or at selected Universities in South Africa. (2) To promote and implement mentored research in basic, clinical, social, and implementation sciences, as well as health services research with a focus on TB/HIV priorities in Ghana. (3) Implement medium-term training to gain key technical expertise, as well as in-country short-term research training workshops in partnership with NTP and NACP leading to enhanced care of persons with TB/HIV coinfection. At the end of the 5-year training period, we expect to train PhD and Masters Degree candidates, postdoctoral fellow and short-term trainees with complimentary expertise who will develop and implement independent high-quality research relevant to TB and HIV control in Ghana. Ultimately, the work of trainees and their research collaborators will establish a center of excellence for TB/HIV research at the University of Ghana."
"9230784","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The goal of this research is to evaluate a comprehensive test battery of new wide-bandwidth, i.e., wideband (WB), acoustical tests of auditory function in the differential diagnosis of middle ear, cochlear and neural pathologies in a population of Veterans. WB tests refer to ear canal tests using sound responses measured from 0.2 kHz to frequencies as high as 8 kHz, a bandwidth that is critical for speech perception. There will be tests in the battery for middle-ear assessment using power absorption, cochlear assessment using otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and the acoustic stapedius reflex (ASR) using middle ear power absorption. Results will be compared with a standard single-frequency clinical immittance test battery routinely used in the assessment of auditory function in Veterans. Aim 1 seeks to evaluate the accuracy of the WB test battery in the differential diagnosis of middle-ear pathology and related conductive hearing loss by comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the WB battery to the traditional immittance battery for the following disorders common in Veterans: tympanic membrane perforation, serous otitis media, cholesteatoma, and otosclerosis. Aim 2 seeks to modify a WB ASR test to provide automatic detection of the ASR threshold for comparison with the traditional single-frequency ASR threshold. Aim 3 seeks to validate the use of TEOAE and SSOAE tests in Veterans to assess cochlear status, and evaluate their test performance in classifying ears with normal hearing and sensorineural hearing loss. Finally, Aim 4 seeks to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the full WB test battery with the full single-frequency admittance test battery to detect any type of hearing loss including sensorineural, conductive and mixed. The hypothesis is that the WB test battery is more accurate than the traditional immittance test battery in identifying ears with normal auditory status and ears with a range of risks for auditory pathology. Plan: This will be a multi-site research project with data collection at two VA sites: the Portland VA Medical Center, National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Function (NCRAR) and the Mountain Home VA Medical Center. WB tests will be developed in collaboration with Dr. Douglas Keefe of the Boys Town National Research Hospital. Methods: Human subjects will be recruited for this study who have had a hearing evaluation from the VA Audiology Clinics at the Portland VAMC and Mountain Home, VAMC. These subjects will respond to flyers or be part of a human subject volunteer registry established at each site. Since the focus on the proposal is to evaluate the use of a WB test battery in comparison with the traditional battery in evaluating patients seen at VA Audiology clinics, the recruitment of subjects from clinic populations is critical. Across the 4 years of the study we will recruit a total 640 subjects, 320 from each site. This number of subjects will be required to obtain sufficient numbers of subjects with a variety of hearing disorders and pathologies to allow a comparison of results for traditional and wideband tests. All subjects will receive the same clinical and WB test battery. The clinical immittance tes battery will consist of 226 Hz tympanometry, and ASR threshold testing. The WB battery will consist of ambient pressure and tympanometric absorbance tests, an automated ASR threshold test, and finally a transient OAE test and a synchronous-spontaneous OAE test that will be developed in the first year of the study. Data will be analyzed to compare the utility of the WB and single-frequency tests in the differential diagnosis of conductive, mixed, and sensorineural hearing loss in Veterans. Any improvements found in the diagnostic performance of the WB test battery compared to current clinical procedures would provide an integrated set of auditory tests to more effectively and efficiently evaluate auditory function in Veterans."
"9320981","Project Summary/Abstract  Rapidly evolving genomic technologies are providing unprecedented amounts of data with the potential to yield new insights into the processes driving lung disease, including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). These data have already allowed us to develop a more unified understanding of how multiple biological mechanisms work together to influence COPD. We now appreciate that in most cases a single gene or pathway does not fully characterize the disease or alterations in disease-state. Rather, disease-related changes often involve simultaneous alterations to the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome of the cell and can be represented by complex networks whose structures are altered as the disease develops. Importantly, many of these changes are associated with complex shifts in the regulatory networks from the normal to a diseased state. Modeling these changes can inform us about the processes that drive COPD and suggest potential targeted therapies.  In this proposal we develop and expand methods for integrating emerging multi-omic data to reconstruct comprehensive regulatory networks in COPD. We then develop approaches for analyzing these networks and for effectively linking regulatory alterations with disease mechanisms within different observed COPD phenotypes. We begin by developing quantitative approaches for inferring, analyzing, decomposing and comparing networks. These methods will allow us to discover new features about the nature of lung disease, to understand the complex regulatory processes at work across patients, and ultimately have the power suggest ways to more effectively treat COPD.  Executing on this plan will require a unique set of skills that span biology, network science, computer science, translational medicine and lung disease. Dr. Glass? background is in physics, complex systems and genomic data analysis. Although her previous experiences have prepared her well for the proposed research, she recognizes that there are new challenges that need to be overcome when applying networks and genomics approaches to study COPD. Therefore, Dr. Glass has selected a mentored research environment and crafted a training program that will allow her to obtain the interdisciplinary skills necessary to accomplish the goals of this project.  In support of her proposed research, Dr. Glass will make use of the many high-quality computational resources available to her through the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) at Brigham and Women?s Hospital (BWH), the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, and the Harvard School of Public Health and well as additional resources directly provided by her mentors and advisory board members. Along these lines, Dr. Glass has assembled a diverse and well-qualified mentoring team to oversee and advise her research efforts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Quackenbush, and advisory board member Dr. Yuan both have extensive and complementary experience in analyzing and interpreting many types of genomic data. Advisory board member Dr. Kepner has deep knowledge of scalable computer architecture and will support Dr. Glass by providing computational resources such as access to the MIT SuperCloud. After constructing regulatory networks in COPD, interpreting them in the context of relevant biological questions will be essential. Advisory board member Dr. Onnela is an expert in developing methods for network quantification and will play an important role in helping Dr. Glass to create objective measures of network structural differences. Finally, co-mentor Dr. Silverman is a leading expert in COPD and network medicine, and will provide important guidance to Dr. Glass as she determines how to relate network measures to patient data, including relevant clinical features of COPD.  Dr. Glass will supplement her hands-on training with formal coursework and specific mentored exploration focused in three main areas: 1) Lung disease, translational medicine and clinical applications, with training through courses offered through the Harvard Catalyst and Harvard School of Public Health, attending the annual American Thoracic Society meeting, and working closely with Dr. Silverman and the Respiratory Medicine faculty at the CDNM/BWH; 2) Biomedical data analysis and computation, with training from taking online classes offered by the University of Washington and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, attending local workshops and working closely with Drs. Quackenbush, Yuan and Kepner; and 3) Statistics and network analysis methods development, with training from taking courses offered by the Harvard School of Public Health, attending national conferences, and working closely with Drs. Quackenbush and Onnela. Finally, Dr. Glass will actively participate in and receive training on the grant writing process throughout the award period, so as to be well-prepared to apply for independent funding at the conclusion of the project.  Dr. Glass?s career goal is to become an independent investigator studying non-neoplastic lung disease at an academic institution. Through the proposed research and training plan, she will be able to hone the computational abilities she has already developed and collect a variety of additional skills that will be essential to becoming an independent investigator capable of leveraging biomedical data to perform computational research and network analysis that has translational applications in COPD and lung disease."
"9353221","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) has collected data on the same families and their descendants for 39 waves over 47 years (as of 2015). In the 1990s, PSID began collecting rich and detailed data on children born into these families and, starting in the mid-2000s, has closely followed these children's transition into adulthood. Young adults in PSID families become members of the Core PSID themselves and receive the full interview when they form their own economically-independent households-and are followed by the study for the rest of their lives. This Program Project will draw on, and contribute to, PSID data on the transition into adulthood within its life course and intergenerational family context through three projects and one core. The Program Project has three overarching aims. First, we will collect two waves of the PSID Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS) in 2017 and 2019. We will undertake a major expansion of the TAS study sample and will substantially revise the TAS questionnaire, adding new and revised content on topics such as childhood health, fertility-related behavior and pregnancy intentions, and computer skills. These new data will yield a life course panel of children from birth and preschool through primary and secondary school and then through entry into the world of work or higher education in conjunction with early family formation. The data are vital for our understanding of the contemporary transition from adolescence into adulthood in the U.S. within its inter- generational family context. Second, we will use these data to advance research on two topics of considerable scientific and policy significance: (a) the key factors shaping family formation processes in recent cohorts, and the effects of family background and childhood trajectories on these family formation processes; and (b) how childhood health trajectories, from birth through childhood and adolescence, affect socioeconomic status transitions in early adulthood, including educational attainment, employment, and residential and financial independence from parents. Our research findings will provide valuable new information about how and why lifecourse disparities in demographic, health, and socioeconomic status outcomes emerge during early adult- hood; will reveal how these outcomes are transmitted across generations; and will uncover mechanisms that link family background and childhood lifecourse experiences with young adult outcomes. Third, we will document and distribute the new TAS data through the publicly available and free PSID Online Data Center and promote the use of the TAS data archive."
"9406405","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of our interdisciplinary Institutional Training Program, based at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and The University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), is to train MD and PhD post- doctoral fellows in research focused on Neurodevelopmental Disabilities. The rationale for this program is three-fold. First, ~10% of households in the United States live with an individual with a neurodevelopmental disability; thus these disorders are a significant financial and emotional burden in our society. Second, the causes of neurodevelopmental disability range from genetic to acquired insults; this necessitates an interdisciplinary approach. Finally, there is substantial overlap of symptoms amongst the various neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting overlapping mechanisms. Trainees and their mentors involved in this program use a range of modern approaches, including genetic, cellular/molecular, behavioral, and imaging to pursue basic and translational research related to these disorders. Thirty mentors help support the careers of our trainees. There is a high degree of collaboration among the mentors. In addition to mentored research training, our curriculum emphasizes: 1) a clinical practicum requirement for both MDs and PhDs, 2) formal course work through UPenn Graduate Studies Program, 3) training in responsible conduct of research, 4) training in biostatistics and 5) workshops that cover a variety of important survival skills, including scientific writing, public presentations, grant writing workshops, laboratory management, and career advancement skills. During the first 14 years of our program, we have accepted 33 trainees; 5 are MDs, 27 are PhDs, and 2 are MD/PhDs. 19 of these trainees was female and 7 of these trainees were under-represented minorities. Twenty-eight different mentors have supervised trainees, and no mentor has supervised more than two trainees. Of the 21 who have completed training, 10 are in faculty positions, 4 are in instructor positions (2 of these instructors recently obtained K awards), 2 are senior research scientists at pharmaceutical companies, 1 is a scientific administrator, 1 is Director of a Clinica Genomics Laboratory, 2 are in private practice, and 1 is a senior scientist still in academia. We request continued support for 6 postdoctoral fellows and year. This number of trainees allows us to maintain a critical mass to support a diverse trainee pool than can learn from one another, and is easily justified by the large number of outstanding trainees who seek admission. Our goal remains focused on providing a training program unlike any other here at the CHOP or UPenn that is focused on acquired and genetic causes of developmental disability. The program benefits from being in an outstanding environment that commits substantial resources.  For research in this area, there are training in general (and specifically to this training program), ad to developing a true 'bench to bedside' approach to translational research."
"9291515","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost all neurons in the vertebrate brain are foreign born - that is, they are born at or near the ventricular surface and then migrate to another location where they make their connections and carry out their specialized functions. Neuronal migrations can be radial, parallel to the api- co-basal axis of the neuroepithelium, or they can be tangential: orthogonal to the apical-basal axis - i.e., in the plane of the neuroepithelium. With te goal of discovering genetic mechanisms regulating directed neuronal migration, we have established the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs; cranial nerve VII), which undergo a stereotyped and evolutionarily conserved tangen- tial migration from hindbrain rhombomere (r)4 to r6, as a model system in our lab. Forward ge- netic screens in our lab and others have identified multiple core components of the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway as being essential for FBMN migration. The PCP pathway is best under- stood as a cell contact-dependent molecular mechanism for generating and transmitting polarity between cells in the plane of an epithelium. However PCP has been implicated in a growing number of cell migrations during development and disease states. Currently no coherent model exists for how PCP regulates directional cell migration. This is mainly because the polarized cell- cell interactions that defin PCP are difficult to reconstitute in cell culture; we must therefore attack the problem in vivo. Th zebrafish model, with its exquisite live imaging, facile transgen- esis and powerful forward and reverse genetics tools, affords us this opportunity. We hypothe- size that direct PCP signaling between the planar-polarized cells of the neuroepithelium and the motile FBMNs polarizes FBMN protrusive activity in the direction of migration. We pro- pose to test the predictions of thi model first by identifying the cells in the migratory environ- ment that are responsible for directing migration (Aim 1), and then by elucidating how PCP sig- naling within the FBMNs affects their behavior in vivo (Aim 2). Furthermore in Aim 2 we will discover how interactions between migrating FBMNs and the surrounding neuroepithelium in- fluence PCP protein localization and protrusive activity in the FBMNs. Finally, we propose to enrich our understanding of PCP-dependent neuron migration through the cloning of FBMN migration mutants we have identified in a forward genetic screen (Aim 3)."
"9287931","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The heavy burden of cardiovascular disease as the world's number one killer is no longer a secret. Formerly regarded as mainly a problem of the richest nations in the world, low- and middle-income countries have surpassed the developed world and now have the lion's share of these chronic, disabling, and deadly diseases. Mental illness is slightly more under-appreciated, even though it is increasing as a major cause of DALYs worldwide and is expected to become number one by 2030. Combined, cardiovascular disease and mental illness form a cycle of ill health: having depression makes one more at risk for a cardiovascular event, and having a cardiovascular event makes one more likely to suffer from depression. Effective interventions for managing these illnesses independently exist, and there is already evidence in some countries such as the US that managing both conditions together can improve health outcomes. However, a model of healthcare service delivery for both mental illness and cardiovascular conditions like acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in China has not been developed. The overall goal of this study is to develop, pilot test, implement, and evaluate a nurse-coordinated depression care model integrated into ACS care, with rigorous assessment of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness through a large scale, randomized controlled trial involving a well-established research network of rural hospitals in 15 provinces across China. This study will train nurses in cardiology wards in low-resource hospitals in China to use validated mental health screening and treatment tools among patients with ACS. Specifically, the study will determine if the integrated model can: reduce symptoms and severity of depression following ACS, improve cardiovascular health by reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular events and re-hospitalization, improve patients' quality of life, and finally whethe the model can improve other issues related to their health such as increasing physical activity and better adherence to cardiovascular medications. The long-term object of the study is to find a way to provide mental health services for patients with any chronic illness - whether it be ACS, diabetes, stroke, or cancer - in a sustainable and cost-effective manner that can be implemented in low-resource hospitals lacking in mental health specialists. This study will fill ina knowledge gap in bridging two health fields in low-resource conditions and will pave the way for an integrated service model customized to low-resource settings that can be replicated or tested in other low-resource environments. This study represents a strong local and international collaboration of researchers and academics from around the world, including The George Institute for Global Health in China, Australia and India, Peking University Institute of Mental Health, the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Duke University."
"9382702","Project Summary  Type I Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines with well-defined anti-viral activities. While beneficial effects of IFNs are well documented, it has become clear that IFNs also have profound detrimental effects to human health. Disorders where dysregulated IFNs cause pathology are collectively termed type I Interferonopathies. Mendelian type I Interferonopathy disorders like Aicardi?Goutires syndrome (AGS) and spondyloenchondromatosis (SPENCD) showcase how constitutive upregulation of IFN activity can lead to neurologic and autoimmune disease pathology.  We have recently identified eleven children presenting with Mendelian type I Interferonopathy. Genetically, we discovered six children with complete ISG15 deficiency and five children with complete USP18 deficiency. These deficiencies are the first genetic defects affecting the negative regulation of the IFN response. ISG15 and USP18 deficient individuals present with elevated IFN stimulated genes in their blood cells, increased resistance to viral infections, but also with neurologic and autoimmune manifestations, similar to AGS and SPENCD. This proposal is built around the hypothesis that ISG15 and USP18 are the essential factors controlling responsiveness to and duration of type I IFN responses. To address this hypothesis we propose to study these eleven rare patients in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo at the molecular, immunological, and clinical levels to determine the functional significance of these genes in regulating IFN pathway and resistance to viral infections in humans.  Deeper understanding of molecular regulation of IFN will allow us to better understand the pathophysiology behind these deficiencies and will lay the ground for development of medicines aiding management of persistent inflammatory disorders and/or increased anti-viral responses.

The ZFN technology is extraordinarily efficient and does not require the use of embryonic stem cells, as a result any rat strain should be able to be rapidly (3 to 6 months) modified.        This R24 resource grant enables our existing infrastructure: personnel, expertise in gene editing, high    throughput phenotyping, distribution channels resulting in an economies of scale that can be leverage to generate novel and important rat models to more investigators. The unique rat models already developed by our existing program, have demonstrated: 1) that the infrastructure is already in place to meet our objectives; 2) these gene modified strains can be used to validate a gene underlying a quantitative trait locus, testing a GWAS result, follow-up studies to define function of a predicted gene, or developing a model to study the physiology/mechanisms of a gene; 3) our economy of scale; 4) a full distribution system in place; and 5) over a decade of resources development (data, rats, genetic and genomic reagents) for the rat. To assure the resource meets community needs, we will establish an External Advisory Board (EAB) that will assess our progress, and conduct a scientific merit review process to select the genes and use of the resources of the R24 nominated by the scientific community (Aim 1). We plan to generate 250 gene targeted rat models (Aim 2), to provide a menu of phenotypic characterization that are available, but not required (Aim 3), and cryopreserved sperm from each line, along with a tissue and fibroblast primary culture bank for each strain, as well as distribute all the animals and reagents to the community (Aim 4).        Specific aims 1-4 are expected to generate a cost effective and powerful collection of rat models for the    community that will accelerate discovery and increase the field's understanding ofthe mechanisms involved in complex diseases. The scientific community has already nominated more than 343 genes demonstrating that the resources developed in this R24 will be of significant value to many investigators.

"9270022","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein interfaces are of biomedical relevance not only as drug targets but also in cellular aggregates. Cells use liquid-liquid phase transitions involving proteins and other macromolecules to locally sequester components and thereby regulate many processes. The dense liquid like phases of non-enveloped organelles or cellular bodies are a way to change the cytosolic activity of the aggregated species. We will study the mechanisms of protein solubility and phase separations as an organizing principle to characterize protein aggregation and recognition. We will consider the contributions of each of the amino acids to the formation of protein-protein interfaces in various states of aggregation from dimers to phase separated systems. Theoretical analyses of large scale computer simulations will be used to compare with experimental data. The change in the free energy of solution with respect to concentration of proteins and peptides has been difficult to compute. We will make use of our new computational tools to study concentration driven phenomena for peptides and proteins. We can calculate the solubility limits and analyze the change in solution free energy along the aggregation/nucleation coordinate. We hypothesize there is a relationship among protein solution states involved in aggregation and those in recognition between proteins. Solubility is a stringent test of the balance of solvation and protein interactions in current force fields. By analyzing the mechanism in terms of contributions of the solubility of each of the amino acids to the aggregation, we will build more reliable and accurate models of the nonpolar van der Waals solvation components of the mechanism using our new perturbative analysis methods. This is not a protein interface prediction project, but rather we seek to understand the relationship between how any interface, ordered or disordered, is made and the components of the underlying free energy surface driving solubility."
"9211438","Project 2 Grayson ABSTRACT Role of maternal bariatric surgery in programming cardiovascular disease in offspring Bariatric surgery for long term body weight loss and resolution of obesity-associated comorbidities has gained popularity in recent decades. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is a surgical weight loss procedure that resects 80% of the stomach creating a tube linking the esophagus to the duodenum.Because of the great effectiveness and relative simplicity of the VSG surgery, VSG is now on the rise in the U.S. >80% of the recipients of VSG are women of whom approximately half are of child-bearing age. VSG in female rodents has similar characteristics of women undergoing VSG. Women who have undergone bariatric surgery have a lower risk of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, and reduced risk of large-for-gestational age (LGA) babies. However, recent reports also highlight negative outcomes in women with previous bariatric surgery that include an increased risk for small-for-gestational age babies (SGA) or IUGR birth at a reduced gestational age or preterm birth, and still birth or neonatal death. We were the first to show in our model of rodent VSG, that offspring had IUGR and increased mortality in the absence of identifiable negative outcomes in the dam. My novel preliminary data indicate that maternal plasma testosterone is increased in VSG dams during late pregnancy, and we hypothesize that this could play a role in the developmental programming of increased cardio-renal risk of the IUGR offspring. This proposal will test the novel hypothesis that prenatal exposure to increased endogenous levels of testosterone in VSG dams increases the risk for cardio-metabolic abnormalities in male and female IUGR offspring. (1) We will test the hypothesis that fetal exposure to elevated maternal endogenous levels of testosterone in VSG dams programs glucose intolerance mediated by impaired pancreatic beta cell function and leptin resistance leading to obesity and hypertension in IUGR offspring. (2) We will test the hypothesis that fetal exposure to elevated maternal endogenous levels of testosterone in VSG dams programs activation of the renin-angiotensin system leading to elevated blood pressure in IUGR offspring."

"9319830","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall project goals are to study the cortical network dynamics of human upper limb motor control spanning two distinct spatial scales recorded with electrocorticography (ECoG), and to demonstrate that these dynamics can be estimated in real-time and used to control the JHU Applied Physics Lab Modular Prosthetic Limb (MPL) during execution of functionally useful complex action sequences.  Our human subjects will be instructed to perform complete functional movements characteristic of activities of daily living.  We will analyze the task-related temporal evolution in the strength and pattern o interactions among large-scale cortical networks known to be recruited in visually-guided reach-to-grasp tasks.  Using multi-scale subdural ECoG with combinations of routine clinical macro-electrodes (2.3 mm diameter, 1 cm spacing) recording activity of broadly spread elements/nodes of neural networks, and inset arrays of microelectrodes (75 ?m diameter, 0.9 mm spacing) recording the activity of local sub-networks, we will test our overall hypothesis that there is a functional hierarchy between the two scales (Aim 1).  More specifically, we hypothesize that large-scale network dynamics involving premotor/motor cortex reflect the evolution of sensory-motor processing demands during complex action sequences, while micro-scale population activity and network dynamics in motor cortex reflect the low-level kinematics of these tasks.  We will utilize methods of estimating dynamic effective connectivity developed by our team to study interactions between these scales and test whether there exists a spatially heterogeneous and hierarchical structure within the macro-micro scale networks.  The results of these analyses have wide-ranging clinical implications for both the optimal scale of functional mapping for clinical diagnostic purposes and the extent of implantations for neuroprosthetic control.  We will exploit multi-scale ECoG recordings and online estimates of the dynamics of neural activation and large-scale/local network interactions to achieve control of the MPL during functionally useful tasks (Aim 2).  This approach will go beyond traditional paradigms that have developed neural control over individual degrees of freedom.  We will do this by embedding low-level control within an innovative framework whereby knowledge of task goals supplement direct kinematic decoding.  This project will build on our team's previous successes in implementing a system for semi-autonomous ECoG control of the MPL, employing machine vision and route-planning algorithms, during complex interactions with objects requiring the coordination of multiple joints.  This system will be able to leverage for the first time the rich complexity of temporally and spatially resolved network dynamics correlated with high-level goals to achieve functionally useful control of an advanced neuroprosthetic limb."
"9328109","FENESTRAE are circular transcellular pores in vascular endothelial cells playing critical roles in the maintenance of normal endothelial barrier function, blood homeostasis and ultimately survival. Fenestrae are spanned in most cases by a protein barrier called a fenestral diaphragm (FD). There is a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of the basic cell biological mechanism of fenestrae assembly, which is the subject of this proposal. Recently, our group demonstrated that Plasmalemma Vesicle Associated Protein (PLVAP or PV1) is critical for FD assembly, and that absence of PV1 in mice and humans causes abnormal fenestrae and early postnatal lethality due to multiple vascular defects. Critically for this proposal, PV1 is the only known marker for fenestrae, and we will exploit this property in our investigation of fenestrae assembly mechanisms. Our central hypothesis is that fenestrae assembly follows a three-step model: In Step 1, controlled actin depolymerization leads to cell thinning and apposition of apical and basal plasma membranes to within 50 nm. In Step 2, fenestrae pores form by fusion of exocytic vesicles with apical and basal membranes. In Step 3, the FD assembles using exocytosed PV1 and its interacting partners. This hypothesis is based on our key new observations including: 1) Arp2/3 complex inhibition induces fenestrae assembly; 2) de novo formation of the FD requires exocytosis of PV1 from an internal pool; 3) fenestrae assembly does not require caveolin 1, caveolae or PV1 endocytosis. We will critically test specific aspects of this model, using a functionally validated endothelial cell culture system. In Aim 1 we will define the role and mechanism of actin depolymerization in fenestrae formation. Using our fenestrae morphogenesis assay, we will determine the spatio-temporal relationship between actin disassembly and cell thinning, and will elucidate the roles of actin nucleators and actin depolymerizers. In Aim 2 we will define the mechanism of fenestrae pore formation. We will use live-cell microscopy to measure the timing of PV1 delivery to the cell surface, and identify the intracellular compartment(s) from which exocytosed PV1 is derived. In Aim 3 we will define the determinants of fenestrae diaphragm assembly. We hypothesize that PV1 is the major FD structural component, but requires additional proteins for functional FD assembly. We will use a combination of biochemistry and cellular complementation to test PV1 oligomerization structurally and functionally, and will test five PV1 interacting proteins we recently identified for roles in FD assembly. We are uniquely positioned both in terms of key and necessary expertise to complete this work. These investigations will define the assembly mechanism for an intricate and physiologically relevant cellular structure, providing valuable cell biological insight that is currently lacking."
"9275513","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Actin plays many vital roles in eukaryotic innate defense mechanisms against pathogenic microorganisms. Reciprocally, pathogens have developed various elegant and sophisticated ways to disrupt and/or usurp the actin cytoskeleton. By acting on the actin cytoskeleton, pathogenic toxins disturb cell morphology, cell motility, phagocytosis, epithelial permeability, and antigen presentation. Bacterial toxins not onl represent targets for biomedical interventions, but having been tuned to the host cytoskeleton throughout millions of years of co- evolution, they foster our understanding of the cytoskeleton on molecular and cellular levels. The long-term goals are to learn pathogenic mechanisms employed by actin-specific toxins and to utilize the obtained knowledge to illuminate functions of the actin cytoskeleton in norm and pathology. One such poorly understood disruptive mechanism is implemented by the Actin Crosslinking Domain (ACD) toxin produced as a part of larger toxins by pathogenic strains of V.cholerae, V.vulnificus, A.hydrophila, and several other species of bacteria. ACD is an enzyme that covalently crosslinks monomeric actin into oligomers that cannot polymerize. The current paradigm of ACD pathogenesis suggests that the toxin merely depletes functional actin by causing accumulation of bulk amounts of polymerization-incompetent actin oligomers. Instead, this proposal suggests a radically different concept, according to which ACD initiates a unique toxicity cascade by converting actin monomers into highly toxic oligomers that potently disrupt actin dynamics when present at very low concentrations. The central hypothesis is that a unique combination of properties absent in G- and F-actin confers an exceptionally strong interaction of the oligomers with tandem organized G-actin binding proteins and enables them to potently disrupt several key steps of actin dynamics. Guided by strong preliminary data, this concept will be thoroughly tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the effects of the ACD- crosslinked actin oligomers on actin dynamics controlled by mammalian formins, Arp2/3 complex, WH2 tandem nucleators, and Ena/VASP in solution and at a single filament level in vitro; 2) Confirm predicted cellular targets of the oligomers, identify novel targets, and study cellular effects of the oligomers using a combination of tandem affinity purification, immunoblotting, mass spectrometry, and functional assays; and 3) Apply the acquired knowledge for producing novel ACD-based and ACD-inspired tools for studying actin dynamics at the molecular and cellular levels. These goals will be achieved via a combination of biochemical, biophysical, cellular, analytical, and protein engineering approaches, all of which have been proven to be feasible in preliminary studies conducted by the applicant and his research team. The proposed study is both significant and innovative as it promises to fill a major gap in our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms employed by several life-threatening pathogens and permit the research team to utilize the acquired knowledge by creating tools for studying the role of tandem-organized actin regulators in actin dynamics."
"9264008","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cystic fibrosis (CF), is the most common fatal genetic disease in the United States. The main cause of mortality in CF patients is CF lung disease, which is characterized by persistent inflammation and neutrophilic infiltration.  The  mechanisms  that  lead  to  increased  airway  neutrophilia  in  CF  are  not  well  understood,  and  antiinflammatory  therapies  are  limited.  Short  Palate,  Lung  and  Nasal  epithelium  Clone  1  (SPLUNC1)  is  an  abundant  airway  protein  with  host  protective  functions  that  may  be  important  in  the  development  of  CF  lung  disease. SPLUNC1 is low in the airways of patients with allergic inflammation, and based on our preliminary work, it appears to play a role in regulating neutrophilic airway inflammation. SPLUNC1 is rapidly decreased by  LPS  and  common  respiratory  pathogens  in  wild-type  mice,  a  potentially  protective  mechanism  that  limits  neutrophilic  injury  during  acute  airway  inflammation.  Interestingly,  SPLUNC1  is  increased  in  the  inflamed,  infected  lungs  of  CF  patients  undergoing  lung  transplantation  suggesting  that  the  downregulation  of  SPLUNC1,  and  thus  its  protective  effect  against  neutrophilic  inflammation,  may  be  impaired.  Similarly to CF patients, SPLUNC1 is increased in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of CF-specific animal models. SPLUNC1- deficient  (splunc1-/-)  mice  and  CF-specific  animal  models  seem  to  have  divergent  responses  to  LPS:  SPLUNC1-deficient  mice  have  limited  neutrophilic  inflammation,  whereas  CF-specific  mouse  models  have  increased neutrophilic inflammation. The researchers hypothesize that high levels of SPLUNC1 may contribute to the exaggerated neutrophilic responses observed in CF airways.      The objective of this proposal is to discern the molecular details of the regulatin of SPLUNC1 and its  molecular interactions in neutrophil chemotaxis, transmigration and survival in airway inflammation, in order to  propose an initial approach to modulate SPLUNC1 with therapeutic purposes in CF. The specific aims of this  project  are:  1)  Define  how  SPLUNC1  controls  neutrophilic  inflammation  in  the  lungs  by  performing  neutrophil  function  assays  with  splunc1-/-  neutrophils  and  airway  epithelial  cells~  2)  Define  mechanisms  of  SPLUNC1 regulation by establishing the kinetics of SPLUNC1 expression, and dissecting signaling pathways  of cytokines that regulate SPLUNC1 expression, and 3) Define the effects of increased SPLUNC1 in CF by  establishing mechanisms of increased SPLUNC1 in CF, and measuring airway inflammation after SPLUNC1 is  decreased  by  siRNA  or  blocking  SPLUNC1-increasing  mechanisms  in  CF-specific  animal  models.  This  work  will  provide  insights  into  the  role  of  this  abundant  airway  protein  in  modulating airway  inflammation,  its  regulatory mechanisms, and its role in CF lung disease pathogenesis. If successful, this project will identify the mechanisms by which SPLUNC1 controls neutrophilia in CF, laying a foundation for new therapeutic targets in the prevention and treatment of CF lung disease.

"9329157","PROJECT SUMMARY Proper organization of microtubules (MTs) is critical for development and function of neural circuits. MTs form the tracks on which the molecular motors kinesin and dynein transport cargo to specific cell locations. The inherent plus end/minus end polarity of MTs directs motor transport. In axons MTs are arranged with their plus ends distal to the cell body. MT polarity must be established during initial axon formation, and also during axon branching events. The mechanisms regulating MT polarity in axons and branches are poorly understood, but a body of evidence suggests that molecular motors are crucial to MT polarity. Kinesin and dynein contribute to MT polarity and are hypothesized to act by transport of MTs. However, visualizing MT polymer transport is challenging and has only been done in vitro or cultured neurons. Our lab showed previously that Clstn1, a kinesin-1 adaptor, regulates axon branching in sensory neurons. Our preliminary data show that Clstn1 is also required for MT polarity in axons. How a kinesin adaptor, known primarily to mediate cargo transport, also regulates MT polarity is unknown. My goal is to reveal the underlying mechanisms. Clstn1 is known to bind and activate KLC, which activates KHC and kinesin motor activity, and inhibits KHC tail binding to MTs. I hypothesize that Clstn1 activation of KLC prevents excessive MT crosslinking by KHC tail-MT binding. In the absence of Clstn1, this crosslinking may oppose dynein?s ability to remove misoriented MTs from the axon, leading to an increase in mispolarized MTs. I will use high-speed in vivo 4D imaging approaches to test these hypotheses. In Aim 1, I will first test if activation of KLC using a Clstn1 W-acidic domain peptide is sufficient to rescue MT polarity in Clstn1-/- mutants. Second, I will use two approaches to disrupt the binding of the KHC tail to MTs to reduce KHC crosslinking to MTs, and test for rescue of MT polarity Clstn1-/- mutants. Finally, I will test the roles of KLC phosphorylation and proteolytic cleavage of Clstn1 in MT polarity. In Aim 2 I propose to use advanced imaging technologies in collaboration with the Laboratory of Optical and Computational Instrumentation to image MT dynamics in vivo. I will label MT polymers and plus/minus ends with multiple fluorophores, and use fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to determine whether MT transport contributes to polarity in vivo. I will test whether Clstn1 loss affects MT transport, and thereby influences polarity. I will also test the hypothesis that Clstn1 functions to organize MT polarity during axon branching by imaging MT dynamics at branch points. These experiments will enhance our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that establish axon MT polarity."
"9364359","Abstract High-grade brain cancer (glioblastoma) is a devastating disease that very few patients survive long-term. The average life expectancy is 15 months, and throughout therapy patients undergo serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors.  The long-term goal of this project is to provide imaging tools and biomarker integration strategies for individualizing glioblastoma treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic glioblastoma cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging. Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the performance of machine learning algorithms for predictively mapping these heterogeneous histological features. !"
"9332463","Memory for the ?what?, when? and ?where? of serial events, termed ?episodic memory?, is a critical element in human cognition and is particularly disturbed in conditions of congenital intellectual disability (ID) including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The encoding of episodic-like memory depends upon the entorhinal cortex with medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) fields supporting processing of spatial and non-spatial memories, respectively. With the goal of understanding the neurobiological processes contributing to ID in autism disorders and other forms of congenital cognitive dysfunction, we have evaluated mechanisms of transmission and enduring synaptic plasticity in LEC projections to hippocampus in the Fmr1 KO mouse model for Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of ID which is also co-morbid for autism. Our results show that Fmr1 KOs have particularly severe deficits in the expression of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) in the LEC- hippocampal connection (the lateral perforant path, LPP) and fail to learn episodic memory tasks that, in wild type (WT) mice, depend upon the LPP. Proposed studies build on these results with goals to identify mechanisms underlying the failure of LTP in Fmr1 KOs and to test manipulations predicted to rescue both potentiation and episodic memory. The project takes advantage of our recent discovery that LTP in the LPP involves novel substrates: LPP potentiation is induced postsynaptically but expressed presynaptically, via increased transmitter release, with the endocannabinoid (eCB) 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) as the critical retrograde messenger. The presynaptic adjustments underlying this eCB-dependent LTP (ecLTP) involve CB1 ?mediated signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization within LPP terminals. Collectively, the results suggest that encoding episodic memories depends upon an unusual, pathway specific-form of synaptic plasticity. The three specific aims will test the hypothesis that mechanisms of this ecLTP are severely impaired in Fmr1 KO mice, thus (i) accounting for disturbances in episodic memory and (ii) identifying therapeutic targets to improve learning in this and potentially other forms of ID associated with autism. Aim 1 will identify postsynaptic processes required for ecLTP that are defective in Fmr1 KOs: this aim builds upon preliminary results indicating that on-demand production of 2-AG is impaired in Fmr1 KO mice. Aim 2 will test if presynaptic events that regulate the expression of ecLTP are impaired in the KOs and, in particular, if there are disturbances in the regulation of 2-AG breakdown and CB1 signaling to actin. Finally, Aim 3 will test if in Fmr1 KOs ecLTP, and episodic memory that depends upon it, are rescued by manipulations that enhance 2-AG levels. These studies use a new learning paradigm that tests the `what' component of episodic memory for which WT learning depends on the LPP and Fmr1 KO encoding is severely impaired. Together, results will provide unique insights into the bases of disturbances in episodic memory with congenital ID and identify novel therapeutic targets, and candidate treatments, for enhancement of this specific component of cognition.

"9231485","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Imaging-based metrics have recently played a central role in the quest to identify COPD phenotypes, serving to establish homogeneous sub-populations to aid in genotyping, therapeutic targeting and design and outcomes assessment. Recent findings in both animals and humans have lead us to believe that CT derived perfusion (PBF) and mean transit time (MTT) measures within regionally injured lung parenchyma provide for a functional phenotype of which may be directly tied to the etiology of the pathologic process leading to emphysema in acentrilobular emphysema susceptible subset of the smoking population. The primary hypotheses of the proposal are built around the notion that smokers prone to emphysema have abnormal vasoregulation in that regional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) continues despite regional lung injury. This failure to block vasoconstriction alters the repair response and leads to tissue destruction in emphysema susceptible smokers (SS) with abnormal vasoregulation. The normal response to regional hypoxia is to shunt blood towards better- ventilated regions. However, smoking induces small scale, regional infiltrates which in turn lead to local hypoxia, HPV would interfere with defense mechanisms serving to clear the irritant and thus interfere with mechanisms of repair. We have demonstrated that, in SS subjects with normal PFTs but CT evidence of early centriacinar emphysema (CAE), there is an increased heterogeneity of perfusion. This is supportive of the notion that attenuation of vasoconstriction has failed. Further, we have demonstrated a tight correlation between quantitative CT evidence of emphysema with reduced LV filling down to very small amounts of emphysema. We outline a series of experiments seeking to: 1) link increased pulmonary perfusion heterogeneity in SS subjects to the lung's response to alveolar oxygenation; 2) establish that the perfusion heterogeneity is reversible; 3) demonstrate that the response to inflammation and not just inflammation itself is a key factor in the increased heterogeneity and finally; 4) demonstrate that, by alleviating heterogeneous vasoconstriction, parenchymal hyper-density associated with smoking will clear more quickly in association with smoking cessation. With any combination of positive outcomes of this study, we will have provided new insights into disease etiology, serving to provide new targets for disease intervention and providing the tools needed for assessing outcomes."
"9376280","PROJECT SUMMARY  Radical cystectomy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer and is among the most complicated oncologic procedures performed in the United States. Along with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, these two modalities comprise the current standard of care for the disease. Approximately 1/3 of patients who undergo radical cystectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will have no residual disease left in the bladder. Retrospective literature supports the use of cystectomy deferral in patients who undergo endoscopic biopsy showing no residual disease. However, this algorithm is prone to a high false negative rate necessitating salvage cystectomy, delay of which may result in worse survival outcomes.  The first aim of the proposal will explore the phenomenon of mutation clearance and persistence in urine-derived cell-free DNA as a marker for disease absence or persistence, respectively, after endoscopic resection and chemotherapy. In preliminary studies, combination of single molecule tags and next generation sequencing resulted in high sensitivity detection of somatic variants previously identified in tumor whole exomes in prechemotherapy urine samples. At least one variant persisted in postchemotherapy urine samples from two of two nonresponders, and no variants were detected in urine samples from two of two complete responders. This preliminary data shows that the assay is feasible, reliable, and merits further exploration. The assay will be used on banked samples collected on a previously completed trial (NCT01031420) and on samples from a prospective clinical trial opening now at Fox Chase Cancer Center.  Localized bladder cancer demonstrates a relatively high rate of pathological complete chemoresponse, but the mechanism of chemosensitivity remains incompletely understood. Data described herein suggests that the immune infiltrate is driven by CD8+ cells and high neoantigen density. Neoantigens are the non-self peptides that result from somatic missense or frameshift mutations that can be recognized by the immune system. Aim 2 of the proposal seeks to clinch a role for the immune system in this context by identifying tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cells which recognize tumor neoantigens. Expressed neoantigens will be identified using whole exome sequencing and RNA-seq of tumors and available computational algorithms. These mutant peptides will then be synthesized and used to screen live patient-derived CD8+ cells for neoantigen- specific cytotoxic responses. Samples to be used in this study will be obtained from a prospective clinical trial opening now at Fox Chase Cancer Center. This hypothesis-driven molecular and cellular biological study can potentially identify a new and unexpected mechanism for chemoresponse mediated by the immune system.  If successful, these aims will go hand-in-hand in the future to prospectively and retrospectively identify responders and provide a framework to manipulate the immune system to achieve chemoresponse with the long term goal of safe radical cystectomy avoidance."
"9356585","The Mayo Glioblastoma (GBM) Xenograft National Resource will provide users with robust animal models, with corresponding phenotypic and molecular characterizations, that recapitulate key molecular and histologic phenotypes of human GBM tumors from a panel of 79 patient-derived xenografts (PDX). These tumor models were created at the Mayo Clinic by implanting surgical tissue directly into immunocompromised mice and then serially passaging these tumors in mice. The PDX models are highly representative of human GBM tumors and preserve the complex molecular features of the human tumors they were derived from. These highly translational and relevant models have been used widely in neuro-oncology research; the Mayo GBM PDXs are used in over 100 peer-reviewed manuscripts and are key reagents in 37 NIH-funded grants (including 16 NINDS-funded grants). As a complement to the rich multi-omic data sets available on human tumor samples (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas), the goal of this R24 is to provide a similar level of molecular characterization across our GBM PDX models and make the data freely-available for Users. Availability of comprehensive multi-omic data for this large PDX panel is critically important to allow Users to readily identify the most relevant tumor model(s) for use in their specific research projects. Towards this goal, the RNAseq, total- and phospho-proteomics studies proposed in this study (Aim 1) will be combined with our whole-exome sequencing and whole methylome studies to provide a broad molecular characterization across the PDX panel. These datasets will be integrated using systems biology approaches to identify critically deregulated signaling networks, which will help Users with limited bioinformatics experience interpret the multi-omic PDX characterizations (Aim 2). We will host all of the PDX molecular and phenotypic characterizations using the open-source cBioPortal software (used to host The Cancer Genome Atlas data at MSKCC) to provide a user-friendly interface to a powerful database with robust integrative multi-omic search capabilities (Aim 3). In parallel, the Mayo GBM Xenograft National Resource will develop an archive of early-passage tumor analytes (DNA, RNA, and protein extracts) and frozen or cryopreserved tumor samples for distribution to Users (Aim 4). In this way, the Aims planned for this proposed National Resource will significantly enhance the availability of highly characterized GBM PDX models for use in basic and translational research across the neuro-oncology community."
"9248445","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain tumors are the most common cause of oncological death in American children, and medulloblastoma is the most common malignant childhood brain tumor, with over 500 cases diagnosed each year. While therapy for standard-risk patients has resulted in improved outcomes, high-risk patients with Myc oncogene overexpression still do poorly. In addition, there remains significant therapy-related morbidity, particularly in very young patients. Thus, there is a critical need for more effective therapies to combat high Myc expressing medulloblastoma. Using integrated genomic analysis we have recently identified the WEE1 kinase as a potential therapeutic target in medulloblastoma. We demonstrated that WEE1 is over expressed in medulloblastoma patient samples and that inhibition of WEE1 suppresses medulloblastoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In particular Myc overexpressing cells are more sensitive to WEE1 inhibition. However how WEE1 enhances medulloblastoma tumorigenesis is unknown. Further whether Myc driven medulloblastoma can be treated with current clinical inhibitors of WEE1 is not known. Thus the objectives of this proposal are to determine the mechanism of WEE1 activity in medulloblastoma and to provide pre-clinical validation of WEE1 inhibition as a therapeutic approach in Myc driven medulloblastoma. We hypothesize that WEE1 enhances medulloblastoma cell survival by protecting cells from Myc oncogene induced replicative stress and promoting DNA damage repair in response to DNA replication targeted chemotherapeutics. To address the hypothesis the studies in aim one will determine the role of WEE1 in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis by examining the impact of WEE1 expression in Myc expressing medulloblastoma cells, examining how WEE1 co-operates with Myc in transforming human neural stem cells and evaluating the synthetic lethal interaction of Myc expression with WEE1 inhibition. Aim two is designed to establish the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of WEE1 inhibition in vivo using a specific WEE1 inhibitor, MK 1775, that is currently in clinical development. Aim three will identify determinants that mediate synthetic lethality with WEE1 inhibition in medulloblastoma using genome wide RNAi technology and kinase inhibitor high throughput systems. The proposed studies will define how WEE1 regulates medulloblastoma tumorigenesis and establish WEE1 as a novel therapeutic target in medulloblastoma by providing the scientific rationale and preclinical data required for early phase clinical studies. Completion of these studies is expected to impact medulloblastoma therapy by resulting in novel therapeutic strategies incorporating WEE1 inhibition."
"9279066","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): About 15-20% of breast cancer patients fall under the basal-like category, which represent a diverse subtype that is characterized by tumors that are more aggressive conferring poor prognosis. Deaths from these carcinomas result from metastatic spread of the disease to distant sites and from therapeutic resistance, which results in the relapse of cancers into more aggressive forms that are difficult to contain. Both these properties are attributed to their cellular heterogeneity that arises through various mechanisms including clonal evolution and the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs). The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one program that we have shown to be responsible for the generation of cells that have CSC-like properties. Our current proposal aims to induce differentiation of these CSCs through the induction of a mesenchymal- to-epithelial transition (MET). To do this, we carried out a screen to identify compounds that are capable of inducing the transcription of E-cadherin, a hallmark of the epithelial/non-CSC state, in cells that are more mesenchymal/CSC-like. Through this screen we identified Forskolin, an activator of cAMP, to be able to induce E-cadherin transcription and a reversion of the mesenchymal/CSCs to a more benign epithelial state. Through this proposal we aim to uncover the mechanism by which cAMP-elevating agents are able to induce an MET by complete characterization of the essential downstream components of signaling, namely Protein Kinase A (PKA) and its downstream substrates. We also aim to uncover specific GPCR- ligand pairs that could modulate cAMP levels thereby serving to maintain the epithelial state. Through extensive in vivo studies, we plan to develop a novel targeting strategy that combines the use of cAMP- elevating agents as adjuvants to chemotherapeutic drugs. This would serve as a means of depleting CSCs through cAMP-mediated differentiation as well as non-CSCs by hemotherapy in basal-like breast cancers."
"9282659","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) affect millions of patients in the United States. These arrhythmias can be cured with catheter ablation, but the arrhythmias often recur, and these recurrences are generally due to reversible conduction block from incomplete ablation. The inability to confirm the presence of completely ablated lesions in the desired locations is the major factor in the greater than 40% recurrence of VT after ablation, and the greater than 30 % recurrence of AF after ablation. In addition, it is no possible with current technology to adequately predict the pathways of VT through scar, which are the targets for ablation. The overall goal of the program is to use advanced, image-based technologies to improve targeting and assessment of electrophysiology intervention. In the initial 5-year funding period, the goals were to develop needed technology, define the clinical system, and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. Those goals were achieved. In this renewal funding period, the goals are to use the developed technology in clinical studies of VT ablation, continue to improve the technology, and expand the scope into clinical studies of AF ablation. We hypothesize that high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with compatible electrode catheters, location sensors, mapping systems, real-time scanner control, and computational modeling, can (1) aid in predicting the locations of arrhythmia circuits (2) aid in predicting the locations of critical ablation targets, (3) provide for accurate catheter navigationto those critical targets, (4) monitor the formation of ablation lesions in real time, and (5) assess the completeness of ablation. Once validated, these enhanced capabilities could dramatically improve the outcomes from complex ablation procedures, become the ablation methodology of the future, and become a platform for improving outcomes from many other interventions. In the current program, we developed important, innovative methods, and MRI-compatible versions of ablation equipment, for predicting VT ablation targets, for performing ablations in an MRI scanner, and for lesion imaging. We developed imaging methods that differentiate incompletely ablated (reversibly damaged) tissue from completely ablated (necrotic) tissue. This allows determination of whether there is complete lesion necrosis, or whether additional ablation is needed during the procedure to complete the ablation, and, thereby, reduce recurrences. In this new proposal, we will apply these innovative technologies to clinical ablation studies, since they already represent a substantial improvement over current methods. We will continue development of improved technologies for full realization of the potential for MRI guided ablation. We will expand our previous focus on ablation of VT to ablation of AF, and emphasize studies of procedure efficacy. This project is a partnership between the Johns Hopkins University Departments of Medicine, Radiology, and Biomedical Engineering; Sheba Medical Center; and industrial partners: St Jude (impedance-based tracking system), Greatbatch (catheter components), and Siemens (intra-procedural computational modeling)."
"9278306","The major goal of the proposed research is to elucidate central molecular controls and regulatory mechanisms critical for development, identity, and subtype diversity of neocortical corticofugal (output) projection neurons (CFuPN), which might also enable their future directed differentiation, or molecular-cellular manipulation / ?reprogramming?. CFuPN are the broad population of cerebral cortex excitatory output neurons that extend axons away from cortex to subcortical targets. Dysregulation of CFuPN developmental controls contributes to human developmental diseases? and potentially later to selective vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases. CFuPN include corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN), the broader subpopulation of subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN), corticothalamic projection neurons (CThPN), and major subsets of corticostriatal projection neurons (CStrPN). They play key roles in motor, sensory, high-level cognitive, and behavioral functions. Distinct CFuPN subtypes are specifically vulnerable and central to distinct disorders. CSMN/SCPN degenerate with spinal motor neurons in ALS; CStrPN with striatal MSN in Huntington's disease. CSMN damage is central in spinal cord injury. Cerebral palsy involves CFuPN injuries; some pain syndromes and epilepsies, CThPN. Understanding controls over development and maintenance of CFuPN diversity and precision will contribute centrally to basic understanding of the complex organization and function of cortex and its output circuitry, to identification of causes and therapeutic approaches for disease involving specific CFuPN subtypes, and to future strategies for cortical disease modeling, therapeutic screening, and regeneration/repair, since manipulation of these controls might also enable directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (m/h ES, iPS) for accurate disease models for mechanistic study and therapy discovery; directed differentiation of appropriate progenitors for regeneration; and potentially ?reprogramming? of some CFuPN (e.g., a subset of CThPN) into clinically desired subtypes (e.g., CSMN).  We and others have made substantial progress identifying some broad, overall molecular/transcriptional controls over CFuPN subtype development, but much remains to be discovered at the subtype-specific level most relevant for disease and understanding of cortical function and organization. Building on our previous work, we propose to investigate novel regulatory biology of CFuPN subtype differentiation, diversity, and maintenance, substantially focused through a `lens' of regulation by Tle4 of identity acquisition of the distinct and clinically relevant CThPN, CSMN, and related SCPN subtypes (Aim 1), and to identify core transcriptional mechanisms at the molecular level that enable this precise regulation of CFuPN subtype diversity and balance (Aim 2). Further, based on highly motivating pilot studies indicating that Tle4 function is required to maintain CThPN vs. CSMN distinction even after circuit formation, we will rigorously and deeply investigate the potential to interconvert or ?reprogram? CFuPN subtype identity of some CThPN into ?genuine? CSMN by manipulation of Tle4 function at progressively later stages of development (Aim 3), exploring limits of subtype plasticity and circuitry manipulation. "
"9272822","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dermal fibrosis may result from a variety of insults including trauma, irradiation or such diseases as scleroderma. Not only is fibrosis disfiguring but it may also lead to death due to loss of function and fibrosis of internal organs, as occurs in scleroderma or cirrhosis of the liver. In preliminary studies carried out during the initial term o this project we have elucidated, in part, the role of adenosine, acting at A2A receptors (A2AR) in stimulating collagen production, the role of ecto-enzymes in producing adenosine at fibrotic sites and the capacity of A2AR blockade to diminish scarring in an animal model. In preliminary studies we have discovered that tenofovir, an AMP analogue that inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase and Hepatitis B Virus polymerase,  reduces extracellular adenosine levels and diminishes fibrosis in murine models of scleroderma and hepatic cirrhosis. In other studies we have found that A2AR blockade diminishes radiation dermatitis and fibrosis and that A2AR stimulation promotes collagen production via cross-talk with Wnt/-catenin signaling pathways. We propose here a highly translational program of investigation into the potential therapeutic utility of indirectly and directly targeting A2AR to treat and prevent fibrosis and to determine th signaling mechanisms involved in A2AR stimulation of collagen production. We propose the following three aims: I. Determine the mechanism by which tenofovir, an AMP analogue that inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase and Hepatitis B Virus polymerase, prevents fibrosis in the skin and liver. We will test the effect of tenofovir on dermal and hepatic fibrosis in murine models and determine whether tenofovir diminishes extracellular adenosine levels by blocking adenine nucleotide release via pannexin 1 or conversion of extracellular adenine nucleotides to adenosine; II. To examine the effect of A2AR blockade and deletion on radiation-induced fibrosis, epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation. We will determine whether topical A2AR blockade or A2AR deletion prevents dermal fibrosis, increased epithelial proliferation and infiltration with lymphocytes following localized dermal irradiation in a murine model; III. We wil dissect cross-talk between A2AR and Wnt signaling. We will determine the effect of A2AR stimulation on -catenin activation and translocation to the nucleus and whether A2AR promotion of collagen synthesis depends on -catenin activation and nuclear translocation both in vitro and in vivo. We will also examine expression patterns in A2AR-stimulated fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The results of the proposed experiments will provide novel targets for the treatment and prevention of fibrosing conditions and shed light on signaling pathways involved in fibrosis."
"9282287","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability. Despite conventional therapy, a majority of stroke survivors have persistent hand dysfunction. This proposed research will further our understanding of mechanisms of recovery of hand function and provide a scientific basis for post-stroke rehabilitation protocols in clinical practie. Motor recovery occurs through motor learning, which depends on at least three processes: adaptation, repetition and reinforcement. Adaptation is the ability to predict forces and movements according to the expected consequences of an action, and is fundamental to motor skill learning. When adapted movements are reinforced through repetition, learning is enhanced. We have shown that adaptation of fingertip forces and movements is disrupted after stroke. However, we found that context-specific sensory information from the unaffected hand can restore adaptation in the affected hand. These results suggest that the 'good' hand can teach the 'bad' hand fundamental aspects of grasp control. We also found that increased activity in anti-gravity postural muscles is associated with increased efficiency of finger movements. Based on these results we hypothesize that an alternate hand practice strategy, enhanced with postural muscle activation, will improve the rate of motor re-learning and enhance recovery of hand function post stroke. This strategy will tap into redundant connectivity between the two sides of the brain to facilitate sensorimotor integration during skill learning. In Aim 1, we will refine the alternate hand practice strategy to restore adaptation in the affected hand. The experiments will lead to a better understanding of how kinesthetic, tactile and visual sensory modalities interact during adaptation, given existing sensorimotor impairments after stroke. In Aim 2, we will delineate postural strategies that improve grasp efficiency and reduce abnormal directional biases to facilitate repetition of more efficient movements during practice. In Aim 3, we will examine the rate of within-session and between- session motor learning and improvement in hand function with the 'enhanced alternate hand training paradigm', and compare this to training with the affected hand alone, using a novel task panel and structured training protocols. We will test our Aims using quantitative psychophysical measurements of fingertip forces, finger kinematics, 3-D arm and trunk kinematics, and electromyographic recordings of bilateral upper limb muscle activity during functional reach-to-grasp and lift tasks. We expect to identify impairments that directly affect function, provide objective information about how a task is performed, and inform treatment strategies and dosing of therapy for enhanced re-learning. This project will advance our understanding of how redundant circuitry can be harnessed for integration of sensory input with motor output for re-learning, and provide a scientific basis for the selection of content and structure of practice. The knowledge obtained will inform best- practice rehabilitation protocols for recovery of hand function, which will impac the quality of life of individuals after stroke and other neurological conditions."
"9332478","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission application for the K99 Pathway to Independence Award. Molecular motor proteins actively transport intracellular cargos in a highly regulated fashion. Cytoplasmic dynein is the largest, most complex, and least understood of the microtubule motor protein families. Because dynein is utilized by the cell for many diverse functions, its activity is highly regulated by a complex web of external protein factors that impinge on the basic mechanochemistry of the motor. As a graduate student, I trained with Dr. Richard Vallee at Columbia University to study the biochemistry and biophysics of cytoplasmic dynein regulation by the neurodevelopmental disease proteins LIS1 and NudE/L. During my postdoctoral career in the lab of Dr. Ronald Vale at the University of California, San Francisco, I have developed new skills in fluorescence single-molecule microscopy. I have used these new skills to discover a novel mode of dynein motility used to slide anti-parallel microtubules apart, a function critical during mitotic spindle assembly. Recently, I have utilized these skills and training to isolate and characterize a stable super-complex of dynein, dynactin, and the adapter protein BicD2 that is over 2MDa in size. I have made the first biophysical measurements of this complex at the single molecule level, revealing unanticipated new motile properties. The goal of this proposal is to understand how dynein regulatory pathways exert proper control of the motor at both the molecular and cellular level. During the mentored K99 phase, this multi-disciplinary proposal aims to: 1) Elucidate the molecular mechanism of dynein motor regulation by divergent regulatory pathways made up of dynactin-BicD2, and Lis1-NudE/L, and 2) Probe the roles of this regulatory activity in the transport of physiological important cargo in a living neuronal system. With the new training and skills acquired in the mentored phase, I will then extend the scope of my research in the independent R00 phase in an effort to understand how dynein processivity regulation is utilized in the coordination of opposite polarity motors, and what effects human neurodegenerative disease mutations have on this coordination. For the experiments proposed in this application, I will acquire additional training in nanometer-precision, multi-color single molecule microscopy and data analysis, Drosophila genetics, DNA nanotechnology, genome engineering, and confocal microscopy in live animals. As co-mentors, Ron Vale and Yuh-Nung Jan will provide expertise in advanced imaging techniques, Drosophila neurobiology and genetics. My collaborators will provide the necessary experience and support in optical trapping microscopy and novel Drosophila genome editing techniques. These new skills and training will afford me the best opportunity to achieve my career goal to launch an independent and successful research laboratory within two years. Overall, the implementation of this proposal will answer long-standing questions in the molecular transport field, and provide novel insight into the mechanism of human neurodegenerative diseases that result from impaired intracellular transport."
"9409272","Abstract IgE-mediated food allergies have become a major public health concern, now estimated to affect 6-8% of children under 4 years old and 4% of adults in the US. Approximately 200,000 emergency hospital visits are caused from allergic reactions to foods annually, with at least 150 fatalities resulting from anaphylaxis. The overall economic cost of food allergies in the US is estimated at $25 billion. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for food allergies and as such the only options available to allergic individuals are strict dietary avoidance of the allergen and emergency treatment with epinephrine if a reaction occurs. Allergic reactions to tree nuts, including walnuts and pecans, often result in life-threatening anaphylactic reactions and, along with peanut, are the primary foods known to trigger fatal reactions. Accidental exposures to nut allergens are common, since nuts can be hidden in foods or contaminate foods served in restaurants and cafeterias. Tree nut allergies are rarely outgrown and have increased in prevalence over the past decade and are now estimated to affect greater than 1% of the US population. While some treatments, including oral and epicutaneous immunotherapies, are being investigated for peanut allergies, there are no rigorous studies being conducted in subjects with tree nut allergies. Unfortunately, the benefits of these desensitization therapies are typically mild to moderate and in most cases are short-lived. Therapeutic vaccination is a new and exciting potential treatment option for allergies that require a considerably abbreviated treatment schedule and may have more profound and longer-lasting effects. Most therapeutic vaccination approaches being tested seek to reduce the symptoms caused by Th2-driven IgE by shifting the anti-allergen immune responses toward a Th1 phenotype characterized by IgG antibodies. Genetic vaccination approaches are among the most promising of the therapeutic vaccination approaches being investigated. Three main types of seed storage proteins (legumins, vicilins, and 2S albumins) bind IgE and cause allergic symptoms to walnuts and pecans. Targeting these nut proteins represents a sound strategy for therapeutic vaccination. Under this phase I SBIR, we intend to test an adjuvanted multi-valent walnut/pecan therapeutic DNA vaccine co-expressing a Th1 polarizing genetic adjuvant in a pre-clinical mouse model of walnut and pecan allergies. If our vaccine can be used to treat walnut and pecan allergic mice to successfully prevent anaphylaxis upon oral challenge, we will continue development under phase II by performing toxicology studies and beginning GMP manufacturing of the vaccine to support an IND application. 2"
"9278295","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories."

The overall goal of this U54 Cooperative Agreement application is to combine the research strengths, resources and opportunities at UNC and new partner, RTI International (RTI), to build on the foundation established in the CTSA's last five years. NC TraCS will work to improve human health by accelerating clinical and translational research from health science discovery to dissemination to patients and communities. NC TraCS will strive to overcome the well-documented barriers to the effective, sustained translation of research discovery along the translational research continuum by improving efficiency, training a research workforce and exporting successful, validated methods developed in NC TraCS to other CTSA institutions and the public. The proposed CTSA will specifically (1) amplify a thriving CTSA program to the point that it supports the full spectrum of clinical and translational research; (2) leverage CTSA resources and institutional strengths to create a critical, sustained focus on three strategic initiatives: (a) next-generation technologies to transform the very nature of clinical research and practice, (b) new paradigms and resources to accelerate drug development, and (c) robust comparative effectiveness research studies to provide definitive evidence of the benefits and harms of tests and treatments; and (3) train, support and incentivize the next generation of clinical and translational science researchers. These goals will be accomplished by three resources, six services, integrated and streamlined from the original 11, and the three strategic initiatives.  UNC and RTI now have a unique set of research and training resources to support the full range of clinical and translational research, from basic science to clinical application to policy change. NC TraCS will leverage the opportunity of this CTSA application to garner >$60 million dollars in matching institutional support to extend our capabilities to meet the three aims. In partnership with RTI, NC TraCS will take advantage of the resources it has created and nourished during the past five years to quickly and effectively bring the fruits of research to patients across the state, as well as nationally through the CTSA Consortium.

"9294173","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene cause the autism spectrum disorder Rett Syndrome (RTT). To understand the pathogenesis of RTT, we previously developed and characterized a mouse model recapitulating an RTT-associated missense mutation, MeCP2 T158A. We found that mice with T158A mutation show similar RTT-like phenotypes to that of Mecp2-null mice. T158A mutation decreases the binding of MeCP2 to methylated DNA and reduces MeCP2 protein stability. Mice with MeCP2 dysfunction also show age-dependent impairment of neuronal event-related potentials (ERPs) indicative of disrupted neural circuitry. Moreover, our ongoing work supports a role of MeCP2 in modulation of gene transcription and dendritic development in a cell-type specific manner. Together, these findings lead to a new series of questions pertaining to the pathogenic mechanisms of RTT. We propose to address them in the following specific aims: 1) To define the role of methyl-DNA binding of MeCP2 in the etiology of RTT-like phenotypes; 2) To dissect the role of MeCP2 in different neuronal cells regulating information processing; and 3) To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which MeCP2 modulates cell type-specific neuronal function. With the combined genetic, genomic, behavioral and neurophysiological approaches, we hope to not only reveal novel insight into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying RTT, but also to expedite the development of mechanism-based therapeutics that are focused on MeCP2 methyl-DNA binding and specific neuronal types. Moreover, our proposed study will provide the research community at large with innovative tools and resources to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying a variety of biological processes and diseases."
"9415820","We previously identified a novel mechanism that directly links the inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsPSR) Ca2+ release ion channel to programmed cell death. We extended our new insights into the biochemical and functional interactions of the InsPSR and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins with the discovery of an essential requirement of InsPSR activity to suppress macroautophagy and maintain efficient mitochondrial respiration and normal cell bioenergetics. The InsPSR participates in generation of complex Ca2+ signals that regulate many physiological processes in cells, including, as we have discovered, autophagy and basal metabolism, as well as cell survival and death decisions. The studies undertaken to explore this regulation have led to the development of an important new paradigm regarding the regulation of cellular bioenergetics that involves a ubiquitous pathway involving constitutive Ca2+ delivery from the ER to mitochondria mediated by Ca2+ release through the InsPSR and Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex. Although our studies have previously defined many of the features of the InsPSR ion channel, the details of the mechanisms of permeation, gating and regulation of the complex of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter are largely unknown. Our preliminary studies suggest that whereas normal and cancer cells have a similar reliance on constitutive mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake for maintenance of optimal bioenergetics, cancers cells are addicted to it since they cannot survive when it is blocked. The mechanisms that underlie this differential sensitivity between normal and cancer cells remain to be elucidated, with obvious clinical relevance. We will employ biophysical (electrophysiology, optical imaging), biochemical, genetic and cell biological approaches to define the mechanistic and structural basis for the uniporter Ca2+ channel complex. Furthermore, we will define the roles of this complex and the InsPSR as molecular targets for cancer cell growth, by use of metabolomics, cell biological and genetic approaches and in vitro and in vivo mouse models. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The ubiquitous expression of constitutive ER-mito Ca2+ transfer has relevance for many physiological and pathophysiological processes, including cancer. A complete molecular understanding of the Ca2+ uniporter complex and appreciation of how cancer cells are addicted to its activity will provide insights that may lead to therapeutic approaches."
"9275270","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dendritic arbors adopt diverse, branched morphologies of varying complexity that are characteristic for a given neuron type. The organization of the dendritic arbors is fundamental to the connectivity and function of a neuron. Although critical to the shape and connectivity of the nervous system, the mechanisms that regulate dendrite morphology are not well understood. In particular, our understandings of membrane molecules that promote and guide patterned dendritic branches are lacking. The overall goal of this grant is to identify novel molecule ligands and receptors that generate the complex and orderly dendrite branches of the nociceptive PVD neurons in C. elegans. Our hypothesis is that interactions between membrane molecules guide dendritic growth and branching in its environment. Following up on our recent discovery of a transmembrane leucine-rich repeat molecule DMA-1 that is essential for PVD dendritic morphogenesis, in specific aim 1, we will further understand the function of DMA-1 by further characterizing its loss-of-function phenotypes, testing its sufficiency and searching for its interaction partners. In specific aim 2, we will explore the function of cell adhesion L1CAM/SAX-7 in generating patterned dendritic branches. We will examine the loss- and gain-of-function phenotype of sax-7, determine its cellular requirement and examine its subcellular localization. We will also study the function of a novel transmembrane protein W01F3.1, which we isolated from a forward genetic screen. In specific aim3, we will test if DMA-1, SAX-7 and W01F3.1 form a tripartite ligand-receptor complex that pattern PVD dendrite using genetic and biochemical means."
"9329297","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reproductive success of all animals depends on the development and function of the gonads, which are responsible for producing and delivering eggs and sperm. Among humans, ovarian integrity and output are key determinants of health, fertility and fecundity. Understanding how animals regulate ovarian development is therefore critical to advance biomedical research. The cells that will become the ovary are first set aside in embryonic development in both humans and fruit flies. They then proliferate throughout fetal development in humans, and larval development in flies. Germ cells, which will go on to produce eggs and sperm, also proliferate during this time, in close contact with the somatic cells of the ovary. It is thought that germ cell and somatic cell proliferation are coordinated, but the detailsof this coordination are poorly understood. Incorrect proliferation of either cell type can lead to tumors and ovarian cancer, which often cause sterility in humans. It is therefore clear that the coordination of growth in different ovarian cell types is a critical determinant of fertility and reproductive health, but we do not know how this growth is regulated so that the proper number of each cell type is achieved. The specific Aims of this project are (1) to understand the developmental processes that cells undergo during early ovarian development; (2) to understand the role in this process of a signaling pathway called the Hippo pathway, which is strongly implicated in many human cancers; (3) to understand how the Hippo pathway interacts with other genes to direct ovarian development. For the first Aim, we have compared ovarian development in fly species with very different ovariole numbers. This has taught us that there are two critical stages of development that future work should be focused on: first, the earliest stages of embryogenesis when cells are first set aside; and second, the later period when these cells proliferate to create the correct number of cells needed to make ovarioles. For our second Aim, we will investigate how the Hippo pathway functions during normal ovarian development. Mutations in Hippo pathway genes are linked to several types of human cancers, including cancers of the ovary and reproductive system in humans. Finally, for our third Aim, we examine the other potential signaling and growth genes that the Hippo pathway interacts with to direct ovarian development. This has clear relevance to human health, since several reproductive disorders and cancers are associated with defective Hippo signaling. Understanding more about the role of Hippo signaling in normal ovarian development is thus an important priority in our research."
"9389594","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Molecular profiling ? the practice of molecularly testing tumors in order to find specific gene or protein alterations which can be used to recommend targeted therapies ? is increasingly used in oncology and is fast becoming a major part of precision medicine. In practice, each patient or physician generally receives a list of molecular anomalies and a list of therapies which are predicted to be beneficial or not beneficial based on the tumor molecular profile. This may lead to a difficult process of prioritizing therapies for individual patients. In the current proposal, we will develop computational network-based approaches to therapy recommendation by using existing resources to inform the connections between drugs and gene or protein variants. We will consider approaches both for creating ?average? networks based on population-level data and for creating ?patient-specific? networks based on an individual?s specific tumor profile. We will also design and implement an interactive data visualization approach for these networks which will be usable by both clinical researchers and clinicians. The methods and tools developed as part of this project will be entirely reproducible and shared with the community via open-source software packages and interactive tools. We believe our project could eventually lead the way to improving the way therapies are targeted to cancer patients."

"9501875","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed longitudinal study seeks to understand the intergenerational transmission of risk for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use (ATOD) in a predominantly African-American sample, the first generation of which we have been following since 1994. Generation 1 (G1) in the proposed study includes parents of over 700 children aged 5-15 years old. Our sample is unique in that the few studies on intergenerational transmission do not include a large sample of urban African-Americans with middle to low income backgrounds. We will apply a socioecological developmental framework to study how familial and neighborhood environments, as well as the individual behaviors, attitudes, and experiences of a cohort of parents in middle adulthood (ages 33-37; G1), influence parenting style, attitudes, and behaviors over time, and how these factors may influence the attitudes and behaviors of their children (G2). We currently have 12 years of data (from age 14 through 32) for the G1 sample. Thus, we can examine how trajectories of development (e.g., ATOD) in G1 may influence G2 outcomes (e.g., executive function) longitudinally. We will examine both direct effects of G1 trajectories, and how these trajectories may affect parenting behaviors, which in turn influence G2 outcomes (mediation). Researchers have demonstrated a strong link between internalizing and externalizing behaviors in early and middle childhood, and ATOD in adolescence and early adulthood. Understanding how parenting and broader social context factors (e.g., family conflict; neighborhood factors) relate to child outcomes across this period i therefore critical. Researchers have focused extensively on understanding the risk factors for adolescent ATOD use, while less attention has been given to those factors which might prevent or mitigate the transmission of ATOD use from parent to child. We will therefore examine the parent-to-child transmission of coping and prosaically behaviors that may mitigate the risk for ATOD use. Each family will be assessed annually for 4 years so that we can model trajectories of growth across key developmental periods. At each annual visit, one interviewer will meet privately with the G2 child, while another interviewer will meet privately with the G1 parent to complete questionnaires. We will employ hierarchical linear modeling and structural equation modeling in our analyses to understand developmental trajectories over time. We have a history of applying FAS results to developing prevention programs, and the proposed study will continue this effort. Our unique dyadic perspective will contribute to intervention development for parent/child early interventions in the area of ATOD."
"9374579","Project Summary Life is dynamic, local and directional. For example, neuronal morphogenesis requires precise spatial and temporal control of sub-processes such as growth cone guidance, branching and synapse formation and consolidation to build a functional nervous system and maintain complex cognitive functions. Such complex, sequential biological processes require precise control of protein activities in time and space. Yet, current genetic approaches are inadequate to dissect protein functions with high spatial and temporal accuracy, which fundamentally limits our understanding of complex biology. At the apex of the genomic era nearly the entire proteome has been catalogued and high resolution structures and reliable predictions are available for almost half. However, for a large percentage of proteins, we only have a vague or no idea of what they are doing in order to build and maintain functional, living, dynamic cells and organisms. This widening gap between the ever-growing wealth of genomic data and our inadequate functional understanding of the proteome represents a central challenge of the post-genomic era. In order to deeply and mechanistically probe how specific protein activities enable complex biology in the various tissue types and developmental stages of an organism, we must have technologies to acutely, locally, and reversibly modulate protein activities in cells and organisms, we must be able to watch biological responses in real time, and we must be able to do so repeatedly to generate statistically robust data and insights into underlying dynamic molecular mechanisms. Such a technology would bridge the gap between our vast genomic datasets and our need for a thorough functional understanding of the proteome, and has the potential to spark a revolution in how cellular processes are studied, and ultimately how diseases are treated. The central goal of this exploratory project is to develop and demonstrate acute and reversible photo-inactivation of endogenous proteins under endogenous transcriptional control as such innovative and transformative technology to probe or screen protein activities within cells or whole organisms with unsurpassed spatial and temporal accuracy. Our team is currently at the cusp of developing a compact and simple protein photo-inactivation module encoded in a single genetic element. We refer to this as a ?-element, and we will test the central idea that this module can be employed to replace endogenous proteins with light-controlled variants by: Developing technology for inserting light-sensitive ?-elements into endogenous genes in mammalian tissue culture cells; and defining molecular rules for reversibly disrupting protein activities by ?-element-induced photo-dissociation. As a proof of concept, we further plan to test this approach by screening ?-variants of exemplary cytoskeleton proteins with pleiotropic functions in an in vitro neuronal morphogenesis model system."
"9295018","Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with hormonal functions and many are found in widely used consumer products. Hormones play a critical role in the formation ofthe nervous system, which makes it vulnerable to these common chemicals. Two ofthe major examples of endocrine disruptors, the phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), are known to disrupt both the gonadal steroids and thyroid function. Both chemicals are the focus of this proposal using a rodent model. Increases in body weight are found with exposures to the phthalates and BPA, and this weight gain is exacerbated by high fat diets. High fat diets alone interfere with cognition in both rodents and human children. BPA and the phthalates, as well as high fat diets, all increase oxidative stress and inflammation, and these environmental factors can have epigenetic effects. We hypothesize that the combination of the exposure to endocrine disruptors and a high fat diet during development will be especially pernicious for cognitive behavior and the neural regions of the brain that are important for this behavior, such as the cerebral cortex.  The experimental design entails exposure to either a phthalate mixture or BPA with or without a concurrent high fat diet. Two different times during development are targeted in the two Aims. Aim 1 examines the long-term effects after exposure during pre- and post-natal development when the nervous system is rapidly changing. Aim 2 examines exposure during adolescence, a time when the final growth and pruning ofthe nervous system occurs, especially in the prefrontal area of the cerebral cortex. The end point for both of these aims will be the number of neurons, the number and types of glia including microglia (which increase with inflammation) and dopaminergic innervation through immunolabeling of tyrosine hydroxylase in the medial prefrontal cortex. Tests of cognition will include object recognition and intra- and extra-dimensional shifts. There will be accompanying measurements of body weight and fat composition and indices of oxidative stress, inflammation and epigenetic changes in these markers."

"9324534","Project Summery Mixed hematopoietic chimerism is a promising approach to inducing allograft and xenograft tolerance. Our preliminary studies have shown that the addition of expanded recipient regulatory T cells (Tregs) to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation results in more durable mixed chimerism in non-human primates. This is supported by in vivo data in mice. In humans, Treg also have potential for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major complication after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, and for preventing rejection or promoting tolerance of transplanted solid organs. Studies in mice indicate that durable mixed chimerism is associated with strong systemic tolerance that permits survival of challenging allografts. In our current study we focus on the addition of expanded recipient regulatory T cells (Tregs) to non-myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation to induce durable mixed chimerism and thereby robust allograft tolerance in the pre-clinical cynomolgus macaque model. However, with the current protocol we have found that we must euthanize the donor animal to obtain sufficient bone marrow cells to achieve high levels of chimerism, precluding delayed transplantation of donor kidneys as a robust test of tolerance. Equipment that would permit pheresis of mobilized hematopoietic stem cells from live donors would overcome this obstacle. Furthermore, a bioconfinement device for protective isolation that would reduce infectious complications in immunosuppressed recipient animals, infusion pumps that efficiently deliver immunosuppressive drugs and instruments that would enhanced the surgical efficiency (fluoroscopic table, retractor system) may substantially improve the results and outcome of the parent project. Since our establishment of the non-human primate transplant program at Columbia, there has been major growth of this and other NHP programs at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC). Our research is advancing steadily in many areas of organ transplant including bone marrow, liver, kidney, lung, islet cells and skin and other areas of clinically relevant human diseases. Many investigators at CUMC are working closely together to bring xenotransplantation tolerance to clinical reality. In this exciting time of growth, the proposed state-of-the-art equipment proposed through this grant will not only help us to successfully progress with our primary goals but will also enhance research outcomes of other NIH-funded investigators at Columbia."
"9324289","Project Summary Cytokinesis is an essential step in cell division during which the newly separated genomes, cytoplasm, and organelles are partitioned from a mother cell into two daughter cells. How key events in cytokinesis are coordinated remains largely unknown because of the poor spatiotemporal resolution of each event and genetic redundancy. The long-term goal of our research is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cytokinesis. The objective of this application is to investigate the coordination of actomyosin contractile-ring constriction, plasma- membrane deposition, and extracellular septum formation during cytokinesis. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a favorable model system for these studies because it is genetically tractable, has efficient homologous recombination facilitating gene targeting, and carries out cytokinesis using distinct temporal and spatial pathways.  Previous studies on fission yeast cytokinesis and our solid preliminary data led to our central hypothesis that contractile-ring constriction guides plasma-membrane deposition and septum formation via vesicle trafficking pathways during cytokinesis. We will test this hypothesis by investigating three specific aims: we will characterize the molecular mechanisms that 1) cause contractile-ring constriction, 2) coordinate ring constriction and plasma-membrane deposition, and 3) coordinate ring constriction and septum formation. We will employ complementary approaches including genetics, quantitative microscopic imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution, biochemistry, and mathematical modeling in these studies.  We will combine innovative approaches and hypotheses to investigate the three specific aims involving the most conserved aspects of cytokinesis. Our study on roles of four novel proteins Rng13, Rng14, Rng15, and Rng16 will provide molecular links among key cytokinesis events. These proposed studies are significant because they will advance our understanding of cytokinesis in three important ways: a) elucidating the basic principles and contributions of key actin-binding proteins in contractile-ring constriction; b) shifting the current paradigms on where and how vesicles are tethered during cytokinesis; and c) elucidating how glucan synthases at the division site coordinate ring constriction and septum formation for successful cytokinesis. Discerning molecular mechanisms that control proper completion and coordination of key events of cytokinesis in a simple model system is a critical step towards understanding more complicated but similar processes in human cells."
"9272004","Although adenosine signaling is involved in numerous cellular functions by engaging its membrane  receptors, little is known about its role in erythrocytes. The goal of this Project is to address the major theme  of this PPG by focusing on the role of the erythrocyte in the hypoxic adenosine response in normal  individuals and those with sickle cell disease (SCD); a disease constantly facing hypoxia with dangerous  complications including pulmonary hypertension (PH) and kidney damage. The proposed research builds on  our recent discovery that elevated adenosine signaling through the A2B adenosine receptor (AD0RA2B)  promotes sickling, a key feature of the disease, by the induction of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), an  erythroid specific molecule known to decrease hemoglobin (Hb) O2 binding affinity. Intriguingly, extending the  findings from SCD, we discovered that inhibition of equlibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) coupled with  AD0RA2B also induces 2,3-DPG levels in normal erythrocytes. Thus, our studies raise a novel and  compelling hypothesis that increased adenosine is beneficial for normal individuals by facilitating O2 release  to prevent acute ischemic injury. However, this process is detrimental for SCD patients by promoting O2  release, deoxyHbS polymerization, sickling and tissue injury. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are  proposed. AIM I. Extend our discovery of detrimental effects of elevated adenosine signaling in SCD to  preclinical animal studies and human translational studies. We will use SCD Berkley mice as an investigative  tool to test the efficacy of lowering adenosine by enzyme therapy, or inhibiting AD0RA2B signaling by  specific antagonists, on morbidity and mortality. Moreover, we will collaborate with NHLBI to analyze 236  adult samples obtained from a large cohort of SCD patients to determine whether elevated adenosine and  2,3-DPG levels are novel pathogenic biomarkers correlated to disease severity and PH. AIM II. Define the  importance of AD0RA2B signaling in normal and SCD erythrocytes in hypoxia-induced tissue injury. We will  generate a novel genetic mouse line with the deletion of erythrocyte-specific AD0RA2B to define the  function of erythrocytes in ischemic injury under normal and SCD conditions. AIM III. Evaluate the role of  ENT on normal and SCD erythrocytes in the hypoxic adenosine response. We will use both pharmacological  and novel genetic approaches to assess the contribution of erythrocyte ENTs to blood adenosine levels, O2  binding and hypoxic injury under normal and SCD settings. Overall, our findings will provide new insight on  the role of the erythrocyte in the hypoxic adenosine response.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  In sickle cell disease (SCD), hemoglobin mutations result in near constant hypoxia. We recently found a  molecule that is detrimental for SCD by promoting O2 release, sickling, and tissue injury. However, this  molecule is likely beneficial for normal individuals by stimulating O2 release to prevent hypoxic injury. Our  findings could have a significant impact on the management of acute ischemic injury in normal individuals  and chronic responses in SCD patients."
"9389715","SUMMARY An obstacle to studying human cancer is the limited availability of models with human stroma and immune cells. This is particularly relevant for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) given the pivotal role the immune system plays in their development. An unmet need is an investigation of how cancer stem cells (CSCs) modulate immunity, because it is critical to understand how CSCs harness oncogenic signaling to evade immune surveillance. To address these outstanding questions, we will use two unique tools: 1) CSCs derived from a panel of patient HNSCCs propagated in mice, and 2) a humanized mouse (HM) model that enables studying tumor-stromal interactions. We have defined CSCs as ALDH+CD44high in multiple patient cases, and documented that SOX2 is responsible for key CSC features such as growth, invasion, and resistance to therapy (1). Further, we observed an association between SOX2 and tumor expression of the ligand PD-L1, which activates PD-1 in T cells leading to immune escape. Additionally, SOX2 modulates SOX9, which regulates the other PD-1 ligand, PD-L2. After treatment of HNSCC HM mice with a PD-1 inhibitor, we documented resistance associated with an increase in PD-L2; thus, we propose that alternate ligands are used by HNSCC as a resistance mechanism. We initially developed a mismatched HM (mHM; tumor and hematopoietic stem cells [HSCs] from different sources), and now have generated an autologous HM (aHM; tumor, HSCs and mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] from the same patient). Tumors grown in HM more closely resemble the originator tumor than those grown in non-HM mice, and the drift in gene expression caused by prior passaging was partially reversed. Signaling in key immune and stroma pathways was more prominent and closely resembled the originator patient in HM vs. non-HM models. The immune cells mounted effective tumor-specific immune responses, mediated by human immune cells including T cells. Two salient and under- studied issues limit the wider application of HM: tumor-immune mismatch and T cell education. Tumor and immune matching can affect the faithfulness of immune response, and that can only be appreciated by comparing mHM and aHM. HM are subject to xenogeneic education of human T cells by mouse thymic cells, resulting from the lack of a functional human thymus in such models. The goals of this proposal are to: 1) study the regulation by SOX2 and SOX9 of PD-1 ligands; 2) understand how SOX2 and SOX9 affect CSC properties; 3) generate and characterize aHM and mHM from 10 HNSCC patients; 4) test if SOX2 and SOX9 are involved in resistance to PD-1 inhibitors by testing them on HM; and finally, we will 5) generate thymic epithelium from the same patient's HSCs that will result in HM with a fully autologous HNSCC, thymus and immune system, thus enabling immune cell education in a strictly human context. This project will lead to a deeper and more mechanistic understanding of the interplay between HNSCC CSCs and the immune/stroma systems, and ultimately, improve precision medicine."

"9469602","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Orofacial sensorimotor cortex (OSMcx)-orofacial primary motor cortex (MIo), primary somatosensory cortex (SIo), cortical masticatory area (CMAp)-dysfunction has been implicated in many orofacial sensorimotor disorders, including dysphagia, orofacial dystonia and dysarthria, spasmodic dysphonia, apraxia of speech, bruxism, chronic pain, and temporomandibular disorders. OSMcx displays neuroplasticity in association with acquisition of novel oral motor skills, intra-oral manipulations, and pain, and clinically targeting OSMcx has promise in treatment of orofacial disorders, such as dysphagia. The relationship between OSMcx neuroplasticity and learning of new oral skills is poorly understood, and the potential of OSMcx-targeted therapies for rehabilitation of speech, chewing, and swallowing disorders is barely explored. What roles do MIo, SIo, & CMAp independently and collectively play in control of natural feeding and trained orofacial motor tasks? How are neuroplastic changes in OSMcx orofacial motor and sensory representations related to changes in task performance?  To address these questions, we will quantify neuroplasticity in OSMcx, and encoding of tongue and jaw kinematics and kinetics by recording simultaneously from MIo, SIo, & CMAp during natural feeding and learning of tongue protrusion or incisor biting tasks. We have 3 specific aims: Aim 1: to document the modulation of activity in neural ensembles in MIo, SIo, & CMAp during feeding, and performance of tongue protrusion or incisor-biting tasks before, during, and after long-term training to these tasks. Aim 2: to document simultaneously in MIo, SIo, & CMAp the encoding of jaw and tongue kinematics and kinetics in neural ensembles during feeding and during performance of tongue protrusion or incisor-biting tasks before, during, and after long-term training to these tasks. Aim 3: to document simultaneously in MIo, SIo, & CMAp the timing and nature of neuroplasticity associated with training in tongue protrusion or incisor biting tasks. The proposed research will provide novel insights into neuronal processes underlying OSMcx control of orofacial function and lay the groundwork for future studies of the rehabilitative potential of intensive task training and neuroplastic changes n OSMcx in recovery of orofacial function. These data will inform treatments of sensorimotor disorders that target OSMcx, such as those using stimulation or brain machine interfaces. The proposed research will leverage significant advances in neural recording, kinematic measurement, and data analysis that are being applied to studies of reach-to-grasp behaviors and, for the first time, apply them to addressing clinically significant problems in orofacial function."
"9283601","DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this project is to collect continuous longitudinal data over a two year period on both people's social networks and health behaviors in order to (1) test theories about the mechanisms linking social networks and human behavior, and (2) assess the extent to which social influence processes lead to changes in health-related behaviors. Assessing the extent to which social influence operates in social networks is critical for devising future interventions that could harness the power of social networks to reduce incidences of unhealthy behaviors and increase the prevalence of healthier ones. However empirically determining how important social influence is has turned out to be very difficult. There are other mechanisms besides social contagion through which the observed clustering (i.e. ties among similar people) can occur: self-selection (forming ties with similar others), joint exposure to concurrent exogenous factors, selective avoidance, and high decay rates for ties that do not exhibit trait matching.  Empirically adjudicating between these competing processes requires high-validity, fine-grained, longitudinal data on changes over time in people's social networks and their health-related behavioral sides. This project will collect such data through the innovative use of two mobile, remote, always-on unobtrusive sensor systems: smartphones and other smart devices to capture information on communicative interactions and social ties, and health monitor armbands to capture information on physical activity (PA) and sleep habits (SH). Five hundred incoming college students will be asked to install monitoring applications on their smart devices and will receive a health monitor armband upon arrival on campus to wear the armband at all times. Data about who communicates with who obtained from the phones and other smart devices, and data on PA and SH obtained from the armbands will allow us to map out the co-evolution of a social network and PA and SH behaviors within it. Because students are randomly allocated to same-sex residence halls and rooms within them, and because there are few social ties prior to arrival, this is an idea population in which to observe the emergence of a social network.  With these data we will answer fundamental questions about networks and behavior. Does who you know (a person's position in a social network) determine what you do (for instance, how physical active a person is)? Or does what you do determine who you know? What happens when two people with different PA and/or SH form a social tie? Are they likely to become similar, and if so, is it because the less active (poorer sleeper) becomes more active (a healthier sleepier) or vice a versa? Alternatively, when there are health behavior differences, is the tie likely to die quickly and never get a chance to strengthen enough so that influence processes can begin to come into play?"
"9314907","PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). My overarching career goal is to develop an independent NIH-funded program of research that explicates the etiology of comorbid alcohol involvement (AI) and eating disorder (ED) pathology using sophisticated and comprehensive statistical methodologies that incorporate both genetic and environmental risk. I seek additional instruction in: (1) advanced training in ED and alcohol phenotypes; (2) adolescent development; and (3) modern genomic analyses. Research Project: Existing data from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS) will be leveraged with existing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) to explore the manner and extent to which the comorbidity between AI and ED pathology are accounted for by genetic and environmental factors. Specific aims are to: (1) obtain descriptive information and explore genetic and environmental effects on comorbid AI and ED pathology in adolescence and young adulthood, and investigate the extent to which childhood adversity affects this association; (2) identify shared genetic risk factors for AI and ED pathology; and (3) develop and apply polygenic risk scores for AI and ED pathology to more comprehensively examine the genetic etiology of these behaviors. This research will provide crucial information to explicate the comorbidity between AI and ED pathology, as well as ultimately assist in developing targeted prevention strategies and enhance early detection and tailored interventions for these debilitating behaviors. Environment: The research and training will occur primarily at UNC-CH and secondarily at Washington University in St. Louis, MO (Department of Psychiatry). Training at both institutions is essential in order to work with the statisticians who are at the forefront of applying the methods proposed here to both AI and ED pathology. Mentors and Collaborators/Consultants: The mentorship team includes primary mentor, Dr. Cynthia Bulik, a clinical adolescent psychologist, internationally recognized ED specialist, and co-chair of the PGC-Eating Disorders working group; and co-mentor, Dr. Arpana Agrawal, a genetic and psychiatric epidemiologist, internationally recognized alcohol and substance use specialist, and co-chair of the PGC-Substance Use Disorders working group. Collaborators/consultants are: Dr. Andrea Hussong (developmental psychologist specializing in substance use and developmental trajectories); Dr. Paul Lichtenstein (genetic epidemiologist and CATSS PI); Dr. Kari North (genetic epidemiologist specializing in GWAS); and Dr. Benjamin Neale (statistical geneticist specializing in novel genomic analyses)."

"9282636","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aortic dissection is a life threatening event; it is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in individuals ranging in age from children to young and older adults. When a dissection communicates with the true lumen and forms a so-called false lumen within the aortic wall, this false lumen may remain patent or become either partially or completely thrombosed. Increasing clinical evidence suggests that a completely thrombosed false lumen results in an improved prognosis whereas a partially thrombosed false lumen may render the wall more vulnerable to further dissection or rupture. Yet, there is a pressing need to understand better the mechanisms by which, and conditions under which, a false lumen is expected to develop either a partial or a full thrombus and why the latter is beneficial. We hypothesize that the extent of thrombus formation depends primarily on the hemodynamics within the false lumen and that partially thrombosed dissections are dangerous because the continued release of plasmin by an intramural thrombus in contact with flowing blood can activate constitutively produced, latent matrix metalloproteinases within the remnant aortic wall, which in turn weaken the wall. We will develop the first data-driven, multiscale, multiphysics model of the biomechanics of intramural throm- bus in aortic dissection. Specifically, we will extend and then couple a multiscale model of blood flow, platelet kinetics, fibrin organization, and plasmin transport (Karniadakis group) with a multiscale model of aortic wall mechanics and fibrin/collagen remodeling (Humphrey group) that will be informed and validated with extensive new imaging and immuno-histological data from the most widely accepted mouse model of dissecting aortic aneurysms (i.e., 28 day infusion of angiotensin II in the apolipoprotein null mouse). In addition, our model will be designed to simulate the potential benefits of two anti-coagulants in terms of the time(s) of delivery. Realization of our three Specific Aims will significantly increase our understanding of roles of thrombus in aortic dissection, with the promise of eventually leading to an improved prognostic capability and interventional planning. In addition, insight gained in this study will have important implications for a host of other vascular conditions, including dissections of other arteries, treatment of pseudo-aneurysms with thrombin following catheterization, and the different roles of intraluminal thrombus in abdominal aortic aneurysms and intracranial aneurysms. We submit, therefore, that this project has significant promise to increase our basic understanding of a key issue in vascular biology as well as to contribute to treating better a broad class of clinical problems. 1"
"9272005","The major goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is to gain insight into the regulation of hypoxic  adenosine responses in acute and chronic settings in order to advance novel adenosine-based therapies for  the treatment of lung disease. The Project Leaders of this PPG have made substantial contributions to the  understanding of adenosine signaling and the regulation of different injury processes, including acute and  chronic lung disease. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies are actively developing adenosine-based  therapies to treat various disorders including lung disease. However, confusion over the beneficial and  detrimental aspects of adenosine signaling has hindered these efforts. The experiments planned in the  Component Projects of this PPG will address aspects of adenosine signaling in acute and chronic disease  states with a focus on lung disease, and they will interact scientifically to understand organ and stage-  specific aspects of adenosine signaling. It is hoped that the knowledge gained will help guide the  development of specific adenosine-based therapies. However, we feel that this goal will be facilitated further  by establishing mechanisms that promote interactions amongst the Project Research Teams, The Cores and  Advisory Board Members. Thus, a major goal of this Administrative Core will be to provide administrative  assistance to facilitate scheduled monthly meetings, Bi-Annual Project Leader Conferences, and a yearly  PPG Scientific Retreat. These activities will focus on the exchange of data and ideas to understand the  differences and similarities of the hypoxic adenosine response in different environments, and promote the  importance of this pathway to the greater scientific community. Other goals of this Core include providing  the administrative structure to assure the successful use of the Scientific Cores and the exchange of data  and research material, monitor scientific progress of the Projects, address concerns, monitor compliance  issues, and facilitate the presentation and publication of scientific results. By achieving these goals, this  Administrative Core will contribute to the overall success and significance of this PPG.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Acute and chronic lung diseases are the third leading cause of death behind cancer and cardiovascular  disease. This is due in part to an incomplete understanding of injury responses in the lung. This  Administrative Core is highly relevant to the betterment of human disease in that it will seek to facilitate  interactions that are geared towards understanding novel mechanisms of lung disease that may lead to new  treatments for these deadly lung disorders."
"9385727","ABSTRACT Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life-saving therapy for respiratory failure but also leads to severe physiological and morphological alterations in the lung, known as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Inflammation is a key component of acute lung injury (ALI), and work from our group and others has shown that MV leads to hypoxemia, cytokine production, neutrophil recruitment, and lung injury, even at low tidal volumes. Although neutrophils are most often associated with the pathology of VILI, our proposed study aims to demonstrate a regulatory, tissue-reparative function of neutrophils in the context of VILI and susceptibility to infection. Indeed, the immunomodulatory effects of MV with regards to infection remain unknown. Preliminary data from our lab show that MV stimulates rapid but transient neutrophil recruitment, activation and deposition of extracellular DNA in the airspaces, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and we found that these NETs provide protection against infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In particular, this protective effect of neutrophil activity lasts several days after MV, at a time when neutrophils can no longer be detected in the airspaces. Thus, we propose the novel hypothesis that MV-induced neutrophil activation and NET deposition in the airways constitute an innate immune response to tissue damage that counterbalances post-trauma susceptibility to infection. In Specific Aim 1, we will demonstrate that neutrophils are the source of MV-induced NETs using depletion, adoptive transfer and PCR- based methods to detect NET-DNA, as well as quantify the half-life of NETs in the airspaces. Despite the known antibacterial properties of NETs and their induction in response to MV, no study has investigated the impact of NETs on subsequent infection. Thus, in Specific Aim 2, we will experimentally ablate NETs and NET components, both in vivo and in vitro, to determine their impact on bacterial infection of the lung. Thus, using MV as a model of sterile ALI with transient neutrophil extravasation into the air spaces, our work aims to identify an as-yet-unidentified protective effect of NET production and thereby improve the design of future clinical treatments to increase lung function and prevent infection."

"9277229","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical outcomes data informing the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) guidelines strongly support angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) for the treatment of essential hypertension. Reduced mortality in hypertension-associated disease attributable to ACEi is strongly related to their secondary peripheral vascular effects. Emerging data indicate that ACEi containing a sulfhydryl group (SH-ACEi) exert beneficial peripheral vascular effects via lipophilic targeting to the endothelium where they act through hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-dependent mechanisms. H2S (1) prevents redox-induced damage in the vasculature by preserving NOS function, (2) attenuates eutrophic vessel remodeling29, and (3) is purported to be the mechanism by which SH-ACEi improves vascular function20. Therefore, examining H2S- mediated pathways is critical to elucidating (1) the mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in hypertension, and (2) its viability as a therapeutic target for SH-ACEi therapy. In the previous grant cycle, we developed and validated the human cutaneous microcirculation as a model for the in vivo examination of novel signaling mechanisms mediating microvascular dysfunction in hypertensive (HT) adults nave to pharmacotherapy. The emerging importance of H2S as an endothelial signaling modulator and inhibitor of eutrophic vessel remodeling in hypertension highlights the need to explore target-based intervention strategies related to these mechanisms. SH-ACEi has been extensively prescribed for the secondary treatment of cardiovascular disease with highly effective clinical outcomes; however, the precise mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic benefit of SH-ACEi in the human vasculature are unclear. As a logical extension, we propose to elucidate the role of H2S-specific mechanisms in HT humans by completed two separate aims. In Specific Aim 1 we propose to examine the mechanisms underlying H2S- mediated vasodilation in the cutaneous microcirculation of adults with essential hypertension utilizing a cross-sectional approach. In Specific Aim 2 we propose to determine the peripheral vascular effects of sulfhydryl-containing antihypertensive pharmacotherapy on in vivo and in vitro indices of microvascular function and eutrophic vessel remodeling. We will utilize a 16- week randomized double-blind approach comparing and contrasting the effects of (1) a SH- ACEi, (2) a non-SH containing ACEi, and (3) a thiazide-type diuretic (nonvascular therapeutic control). The proposed work has the potential to uncover novel vascular signaling mechanisms related to the gasotransmitter H2S in hypertensive humans and better inform the clinical treatment of essential hypertension."

"9278300","TITLE: The epigenetic role of EGR1 during postnatal brain development and in neuronal activity Project Summary/Abstract  Early growth response gene-1 (Egr1) is a critical transcription factor involved in many important biological processes, including neuronal plasticity and memory formation. With a rapid increase in expression during the first few weeks after birth, Egr1 controls the selection, maturation and functional integration of newborn neurons. The regulation of Egr1-mediated gene expression has been shown to be under methylation control. However, Egr1 target sites and their epigenetic regulation in the nervous system remains largely unknown. The investigators have recently identified a large number of genomic loci with their cell-type specific methylation patterns established during postnatal frontal cortex development. For both human and mouse, these loci enrich for transcription factor binding motifs, in particular for Egr1. The CpG dinucleotides within these predicted EGR1 binding sites become hypo-methylated in mature neurons but remain heavily methylated in glia. In this study, the investigators propose to systematically investigate Egr1-mediated epigenetic regulatory networks underlying the postnatal brain development. The central hypothesis is that, Egr1 is a key mediator for gene-environment interactions shaping brain methylome during early postnatal development, and plays an essential role in the establishment of cell-type specific DNA methylation patterns and in the epigenetic control of activity-induced methylation changes. In Aim 1, the investigators will determine the methylation profiles of EGR1 binding sites during postnatal brain development. In Aim 2, the investigators will determine DNA demethylation mechanism underlying the postnatal brain development. Gain- or loss-of-function methods will be used to manipulate Egr1 and Tet enzymes expression to test the hypothesis that increased Egr1 and Tet enzymes expression is prerequisites for the establishment of the cell-type specifically methylation patterns on its target sites during development. In addition, the investigators will examine whether high basal Egr1 expression is required to maintain the hypo-methylation states of its binding sites. Given the critical role of Egr1 in brain development and function, the investigators anticipate that these studies will provide important new insights into the key epigenetic mechanisms that underlie postnatal brain development and neuronal activity."
"9276839","SUMMARY RNA functions as the central conduit of information exchange in all cells, a role encapsulated in two critical observations. First, a large fraction of emerging infectious diseases are caused by RNA viruses including Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, and Dengue. Second, a much larger fraction of the mammalian genome is transcribed into diverse kinds of non-coding RNAs (~70%) than is translated into protein (1- 2%). The functions of messenger, non-coding, and viral RNAs are governed by the linear sequence, base-paired secondary structure, higher-order tertiary structure, and quaternary interactions involving proteins and small molecules. Overall, our understanding of the number and complexity of RNA structures and how RNA structure drives diverse biological functions is very limited. Most methods developed to date for analyzing RNA structure in high-throughput ways do not measure structure in a definitive and accurate way, making it difficult to define broad principles for interrelationships between RNA structure and function. We seek to understand the fundamental roles of RNA structure in all areas of biology by pursuing a two-pronged approach involving (1) inventing, developing, and rigorously validating highly accurate chemistry-based technologies for discovery of novel RNA structures and the networks of interactions between RNAs and proteins and then (2) applying these technologies to problems of broad importance. Here we propose to interrogate the structures and interaction partners of the pathogenic Dengue RNA virus and the Xist long non-coding RNA. Throughout this work, we will focus on in-cell analysis of native viral and endogenous RNAs. This work is expected to have long-term impact for three broad reasons. First, RNA elements with higher-order folds and extensive protein networks are likely to be harbingers of function. Second, there are likely to be structural folds that are different from the relatively limited classes of structures that have been analyzed to date. Third, RNA elements with higher-order folds also contain clefts and crevices that are ideal targets for small- molecule ligands ? and novel drugs ? that modulate biological function by targeting RNA."
"9356577","PROJECT SUMMARY  Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs), represent a large group of chronic pulmonary disorders that are common causes of morbidity and mortality of both children and adults worldwide. Alveolar dysfunction, pulmonary fibrosis, and vascular remodeling associated with chronic ILDs lead to progressive respiratory failure for which they are few effective therapies. Both genetic and environmental factors underlie the pathogenesis of ILDs; including smoking, air pollution, and chronic inflammation and genetic disorders. Mutations in genes regulating surfactant homeostasis or alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell function or survival includes ABCA3, SFTPB, SFTPC, SFTPA, Telomerase (and related genes) that cause respiratory failure in neonates, children, and older individuals. Our PCTC Consortium seeks to develop novel strategies designed to use CRISPR/CAS9 gene editing for lung progenitor cells for correction of a prototypic Childhood Interstitial Lung Diseases (CHILD) disorder that disrupts pulmonary surfactant homeostasis (ABCA3 deficiency) that leads to fatal infantile lung disease. Mutations in in the ABCA3 gene disrupts surfactant lipid and protein production gene causing severe respiratory dysfunction after birth or chronic lung disease in infancy. We will apply CRISPR/CAS9 mediated gene editing to correct ABCA3 in alveolar progenitor cells as disease targets applicable to other genetic and acquired disorders affecting AT2 cells and their progenitors. The identification, targeting and gene editing of alveolar AT2 cells and their progenitors will be widely applicable for the treatment of both genetic and acquired diseases of the peripheral lung in the future."
"9298704","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Child care facilities are prime settings for healthy eating and physical activity (PA) interventions with preschoolers because over 70% of U. S. children under the age of six attend out-of-home child care averaging 35 hours per week and consuming 50-75% of their daily calories there. Preschool years are critical times when dietary and PA behaviors are established. Unhealthy food and PA behaviors contribute to the high prevalence rates of childhood obesity and associated chronic diseases that disproportionately affect low-income and racial and ethnic minority children. Improving child care environments is a recommended strategy for improving children's diets, PA and for preventing obesity; and childcare intervention studies have been shown to be effective. However these studies have predominantly used expensive experts to deliver the intervention and were time and labor-intensive. Moreover, almost all of these studies were conducted in childcare centers and not in family child care homes (FCCHs), which provide care for 25% of U.S. and 28% of R.I. preschoolers. FCCHs are less regulated than centers and most do not meet national nutrition or PA diet or PA recommendations and, family child care providers (FCCPs). They also have limited access to 'best practices' training or technical assistance. RI is in particular need of suh interventions due to its recent C+ national childcare report card rating for its nutrition and PA regulations, and a recent state-wide survey of RI FCCPs also supports the need for, and interest in, childhood obesity prevention. Through the proposed research, our team will adapt components of previous evidence-based interventions to create a new innovative intervention in both English and Spanish to improve food and PA environments of FCCH. The intervention will integrate: a) support from peer counselors with child care experience who will serve as team leaders for groups of FCCPs; b) tailored print and video materials; and c) a set of portable active toys. A cluster-randomized trial with 132 FCCHs will evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention with a Steering Committee and Community Advisory Board guiding all aspects. The Specific Aims of the study are to: 1) Conduct formative research to inform the development and adaptation of the FCCH intervention. 2) Conduct a cluster-randomized trial of the intervention's efficacy with 66 FCCPs and a control intervention with 66 demographically-matched FCCPs to evaluate its impact on: a) Children's overall dietary quality at FCCHs; b) Children's PA and sedentary behaviors at FCCHs; and c) the physical and social food and PA environments of FCCHs. We will also conduct extensive mixed-methods process evaluation to determine fidelity, dose, acceptability, context, and unintended consequences; explore the relationship between outcome measures and intervention dose as well as with mediating/moderating variables, and explore the intervention effect on child BMI. If proven effective, this intervention has the potental to be replicated and widely disseminated throughout RI and the US, where improvements in the childcare environment are a high priority."
"9385901","PROJECT SUMMARY: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a collective term for chronic idiopathic autoimmune inflammatory diseases of synovial joints, which affect an estimated 43 million adults in the US and is a leading cause for disability. RA is associated with elevated levels of a numerous acute phase proteins (APPs), including lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), that drive/dampen the inflammatory response. However, the biological activity, and thus therapeutic potential, of some of the most dynamically regulated APPs remain unexplored. The upregulation of APP such as lipocalin2 (Lcn2) during various inflammatory disorders including RA could be result of inflammatory reactions, but recent studies have shown that upregulated Lcn2 has multifunctional biological activity including bone remodeling function, apart from serving as a disease correlative marker. These studies suggest that it may play a central role during the pathogenesis of RA.  More recently, we observed that Lcn2 knockout mice exhibited exacerbated arthritis with severe metacarpal and articular bone damage with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1? and IL-6) when compared to its wild type littermates in serum-transfer arthritis model. In addition, Lcn2 knockout alternative macrophages (M2) exhibited reduced secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-?1 and IL-10, but upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-? and IL-1?) by classical macrophages (M1). Taken together, upregulation of Lcn2 during RA may play a crucial role in limiting inflammation and prevent severe bone erosion at the arthritic microenvironment. Therefore, we hypothesize that during arthritis systemically/locally upregulated Lcn2 attenuates the severity of the bone damage by limiting the inflammation and bone erosion. Lcn2 consequently plays an indispensable role in prevention of serious bone damage during autoimmune arthritis. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to investigate the function and mechanism of action of Lcn2 during bone remodeling in IC-mediated autoimmune arthritis. Therefore, establishing the functional role of this dynamically regulated protein will improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and lead to development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat RA."
"9293888","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regenerative medicine holds great promise for the treatment of a wide range of diseases and major advances have been made in the ability to control and direct cellular differentiation for the purpose of tissue repair. However, the developmental signaling mechanisms are complex and cellular differentiation protocols in vitro and tissue regeneration in vivo require much improvement. Members of the TGF- superfamily including Activins, Nodal, Growth and Differentiation Factors (GDFs) and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) play crucial roles during development and tissue morphogenesis and have been widely used in regenerative medicine applications. The goal of the present study is to make structure-guided modifications of TGF- superfamily ligands in order to develop new signaling activities that enhance cellular differentiation steps required for effective regenerativ medicine applications in musculoskeletal disorders. Mesodermal specification is driven by Nodal signaling during natural vertebrate development and represents a critical early step in the differentiation of pluripotent progenitor cells toward many lineages including bone, tendon and cartilage. Current protocols for in vitro mesodermal differentiation use varying concentrations of Activin A and can likely be improved significantly as they neglect Nodal signaling altogether. Aim 1 of this proposal will generate chimeric Nodal and Activin molecules with a range of signaling activities that we will then use to fine tune mesodermal differentiation in vitro. The structural and mechanistic basis of Nodal and Activin complex assembly with their type I (ALK4) and type II (ActRII and ActRIIB) signaling receptors and the co-receptor Cripto will also be determined and the resulting information will be used to assist in engineering the chimeric ligands. Directed terminal differentiation of osteocytes, chondrocytes and tenocytes is critical fo regeneration of bone, cartilage and tendon, respectively. Current protocols for specifying these cell fates use high doses of specific BMPs and GDFs. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that enhancing the potency of BMPs/GDFs by substituting their low affinity type II receptor binding epitopes for the high affinity binding epitope of Activin A will result in engineered ligands with heightened ability to promote terminal differentiation of osteo-, chondro- and tenocytes. It will also test if additional structure-guided modifications can further increase type I or type II receptor binding to make these ligands even more effective for this purpose. Overall, these studies will not only pave the way towards discovering potentially powerful therapeutics for musculoskeletal diseases but also elucidate key structural and mechanistic aspects of signaling of TGF- superfamily ligands."
"9271086","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endothelial cells (ECs) display marked phenotypic heterogeneity in structure and function, in time and space and in health and disease. Phenotypes differ between: 1) different segments of the vasculature (i.e., artery vs. vein vs. capillary); 2) different organs (i.e., lung capillary vs. heart capillary); and 3) neighboring cell (so-called mosaic heterogeneity). The mechanisms underlying the first two types of heterogeneity involve a combination of site-specific environmental signals (nurture) and vascular bed-specific epigenetic programs (nature). However, such mechanisms do not adequately explain mosaic heterogeneity of the endothelium, where phenotypically distinct neighbors have near-identical histories and environments. Mosaics of mutually exclusive phenotypes are observed across all domains of life. They are believed to arise from multistable regulatory circuits that are sensitive to biological noise. We propose that the normal endothelium leverages intrinsic noise-driven mosaic heterogeneity as a means of responding to opposing environmental demands with flexibility and speed. This ability to enhance its response repertoire (and hedge its bets) may be compromised in diseased or dysfunctional endothelium. The objective of this proposal is to use a combination of experimentation and modeling to delineate the mechanisms that govern mosaic heterogeneity of the endothelial-restricted procoagulant, von Willebrand factor (VWF), and to understand the adaptive significance of this phenomenon. We have shown that VWF expression is expressed in a minority of capillary ECs in heart, skeletal muscle, lung and brain and that this mosaic pattern is dynamically regulated. We have also observed dynamic mosaic heterogeneity of VWF in cultured primary human ECs. Surprisingly, we found that the bistable switch responsible for mosaic VWF expression involves noise-sensitive DNA methylation of the VWF promoter. Finally, and most importantly, our preliminary data indicate that the absence of mosaic VWF expression in the heart leads to profound endothelial damage. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that organ-specific mosaic heterogeneity of VWF is mediated by a cell-autonomous, bistable DNA methylation switch, whose sensitivity to noise is modulated by its extracellular and intracellular environment. We further hypothesize that mosaic VWF heterogeneity is required for cardiac health. Our goal is to measure, model and predict the behavior of this switch and to delineate the mechanisms by which mosaic heterogeneity promotes cardiac health. We propose three specific aims. In the first aim, we will delineate the role of biological noise in generating VWF mosaic heterogeneity. In the second aim, we will delineate the molecular basis of the bistable switch underlying VWF mosaic heterogeneity. In the third aim, we will delineate the role of VWF mosaic heterogeneity in cardiac health. The project is significant because it establishes a foundation for testing the hypothesis that dynamic mosaic heterogeneity of the endothelium provides a means for tunable, organ-specific bet hedging. Such behavior has important therapeutic implications for treating vascular diseases."
"9348670","Project Summary/Abstract Aggressive/challenging behaviors (AC/Bs) are a major public health problem for individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) living in group homes. A leading reason for psychiatric hospitalizations and incarcerations, A/CBs are costly to the healthcare system, agencies and families. Social problem solving (SPS) training programs for individuals with ID have had positive behavioral results, but most were conducted in clinical or forensic settings. None were community-based preventive interventions, none examined whether A/CBs decreased in participants? group homes and work settings, and none addressed cost effectiveness. In our preliminary work, we modified an effective SPS training program, using input from individuals with ID and residential staff, as a preventive intervention for the group home setting. Steps to Effective Problem-solving (STEPS) includes residential staff and uses the group home environment to facilitate behavior change. The purpose of this clinical trial is to test the efficacy of STEPS for individuals with ID. Specific aims are to 1) Assess the efficacy of the STEPS intervention in group homes to improve SPS skills and reduce A/CBs of the individuals with ID compared to an attention-control nutrition program from baseline to 12, 24 and 36 weeks, controlling for behavioral determinants of A/CBs (demographics, agency/home environment, current health). 2) Assess the mediating effect of the support environment for SPS (residential staff SPS skills, group home level SPS skills, and group cohesiveness) on the improvement of SPS skills and reductions in A/CBs. 3) Evaluate cost effectiveness of STEPS relative to usual care for A/CB incidents in group homes. .A cluster-randomized clinical trial design will be used in which 36 group homes (18 male, 18 female) will be randomly assigned to STEPS or attention-control. We will recruit 180 individuals with mild to moderate ID, at least 18 years old (approximately 5 per home), and at least two residential staff from each home (2-3 per home). SPS outcomes will be assessed with Iowa Family Interactions Rating Scales (IFIRS) Individual-level Problem-solving Scales and the Problem-solving Task. A/CB outcomes will be assessed with IFIRS Dyadic-interaction Scales, General Maladaptive Index (agency, work settings), and incident reports (agency). Mediating effects will be assessed for residential staff with SPS Inventory Revised- Short Form and IFIRS Individual-level Problem-Solving Scales; for group home level SPS skills by IFIRS Group Level Problem-Solving scales; and for group cohesiveness by the Cohesiveness subscale of Group Environment for the Intervention Scale. Cost- effectiveness of STEPS will be evaluated taking into account costs of A/CBs borne by the participant and family, program, group home, healthcare system, and public services. STEPS will be compared to usual care, (control group costs of behavior incidents). We expect to show STEPS to be a preventive behavioral strategy to reduce A/CBs among individuals with ID, improve the cost effectiveness of their care and make an important incremental advance in SPS research."
"9395608","ABSTRACT Asthma is a heterogeneous disease for which inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are a cornerstone of treatment by current guidelines. However, up to 45% of patients do not respond to ICS therapy, which is more effective against airway inflammation driven by type 2 immune responses. Moreover, ~50% of asthmatic adults do not demonstrate evidence of significant type 2 airway inflammation. Thus, patients with ?Type 2-low? asthma comprise a large subgroup with poorly understood disease etiologies and limited treatment options. Moreover, the consequences of chronic ICS treatment in Type 2-low patients are uncertain and potentially even harmful. Recent bronchoscopy studies have revealed that Type 2-low asthma, even in ICS-nave patients, is associated with significant alterations in the airway microbiome (?airway dysbiosis?), and patterns of airway dysbiosis are linked to differences in asthma control. These findings have largely relied on invasive studies using bronchoscopy. In contrast, analysis of induced sputum allows for larger numbers of patients to be studied longitudinally, so that relationships between airway dysbiosis, airway immune response patterns, and asthma control can be better understood. In addition, a sputum-based microbial biomarker(s) of asthma phenotype or outcome would allow for identification of particular patients for tailored interventions targeting the microbiome. In Aim 1 we will conduct cross-sectional analyses to identify induced sputum microbiota that are differentially enriched among Type 2-low individuals, stratified by ICS use, whose asthma is or is not well controlled. In Aim 2, a subset of asthmatic subjects in each group will be followed for 12 months, spanning seasonal variations in asthma control, airway microbiome composition, and ICS treatments that are important to consider. We will perform metagenomic sequencing studies to gain comprehensive insights into all microbiota present, the functions they contribute, and relationships between the airway microbiome, concurrent airway immune response patterns and clinical outcomes in Type 2-low patients. We expect to identify novel sputum-based microbial biomarkers of Type 2-low asthma and asthma outcomes in this population that will lead to new therapeutic avenues for this important subgroup. "
"9279272","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Megalocephaly (or MEG) is a developmental brain disorder characterized by generalized brain overgrowth. It occurs in a growing number of developmental and metabolic disorders and is associated with severe childhood neurological complications including epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, and hydrocephalus and Chiari malformations. MEG shows significant overlap with more severe but segmental brain disorders including hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) that collectively constitute the most common cause of intractable epilepsy in children. Activating mutations in key genes within the critical PI3K- AKT-mTOR signaling network (including PIK3CA, PIK3R2, AKT3 and CCND2) have been recently identified in MEG, HMEG and FCD, suggesting that these phenotypes constitute a single broad spectrum of developmental brain disorders with shared molecular etiologies and neuropathological features.  The goal of this proposal is to interrogate the molecular basis of these disorders in affected human-derived cells and tissues to define the mutational spectrum, levels of mosaicism, tissue distribution and pathway dysregulation in these disorders. First, I propose to perform single cell sequencing of affected neurons from HMEG and FCD human brain samples obtained from epilepsy surgery to test for known and candidate genes. Second, I will globally assay PI3K-AKT pathway proteins in affected human brain tissues with mutations in key PI3K-AKT pathway genes using high throughput proteomics to identify pathway dysregulation and localize specific sub-pathways and downstream targets. Third, the PI3K AKT genes discovered so far explain ~75% of children with the two most common MEG syndromes, ~25% with HMEG-FCD and none with rare MEG syndromes. I propose studies to identify additional MEG-HMEG-FCD causative genes using whole exome and whole genome sequencing on multiple tissues from affected individuals.  My career goal is to become a physician-scientist devoted to integrating cutting-edge genomic and proteomic techniques on human-derived brain tissues, including single cell sequencing, with accurate and quantitative phenotyping to further our understanding of the molecular and biologic basis of human developmental brain disorders. I propose a five-year research program that will incorporate didactic and research training under the mentorship of Dr. William B. Dobyns at the Center for Integrative Brain Research (CIBR). My advisory committee and network of collaborators, combined with the resources at the Seattle Children's Research Institute and University of Washington, will provide the environment necessary for my successful completion of this proposal and transition to an independently funded physician-scientist."
"9350743","Project 1 ? Project Summary Despite tremendous advances in our understanding of cancer pathogenesis, the treatment of individual patients with either conventional chemotherapy or targeted agents remains highly empiric. To date, precision medicine efforts in oncology have focused primarily on genetic or epigenetic biomarkers within an individual tumor. However, not all marker-based predictions guarantee patient response, as many are the result of correlations from population-based studies. Approaches that utilize individual patient tumors specimens for ex vivo drug susceptibility testing are similarly limited by the process of generating a cell line and subsequent effects on drug sensitivity. Existing assays that measure cancer cell growth, such as ATP-based growth assays (CellTiter-Glo), require extended culture and a large volume of tumor cells. This precludes their use for disease monitoring in most patients with cancer. Furthermore, these bulk approaches are ill-suited for characterizing therapeutic susceptibility within subpopulations. Thus, there is a pressing need for rapid and facile approaches to characterize therapeutic sensitivity within individual tumor specimens that capture heterogeneity and can be applied to very small specimens, including minimal residual disease. Project 1 leverages a unique suite of tools to profile the intrinsic factors that inform the responses of individual cancer cells to therapeutic interventions. We will ask to what extent paired phenotypic and transcriptomic measurements can identify pathways that mediate cell autonomous resistance and highlight therapeutic approaches to overcome that resistance. Cancer cells will be isolated from primary tumors or from patient-derived cell lines/xenografts of both leukemias (as a liquid tumor model) and colon/pancreatic cancers (as a solid tumor model). In contrast to Project 2, cells will be measured in isolation without mimicking aspects of the microenvironment. Over a period of many hours, we will examine distinct phenotypic attributes of the cells (mass and mass accumulation rate) and link these attributes to the transcriptome at the single-cell level. We will then determine cell intrinsic mechanisms for resistance by analyzing transcriptomic features of responding and non-responding tumor cells."
"9250809","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Family-based treatment (FBT) is a behavioral weight control intervention that targets children who are overweight/obese and their parents, and has the capacity to improve the weight status of non-targeted family members such as siblings. FBT has significant positive effects on body weight in children for up to 10-years of follow-up, and a robust relationship is observed between child and parent outcomes. FBT's concurrent care of two generations of obesity in the family is more efficacious and cost-effective than if family members are treated by their separate health care providers. Despite its recognized efficacy, FBT is mainly available in specialty clinics and many children fail to receive this guideline-based level of treatment, as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Primary care offers an optimal setting for delivery of FBT by capitalizing on the established relationship between primary care providers and families. Using interventionists co-located within the primary care setting overcomes barriers posed by fragmentation of care, and lack of provider time and training. One of the challenges to integrating childhood obesity treatment into primary care is optimizing limited health care resources. In behavioral weight loss programs, some individuals learn diet, physical activity, and behavior change information quickly, while others learn more slowly. Individuals also differ in their ability to implement treatment recommendations due to individual differences, such as problems with delaying gratification. FBT accommodates these individual differences by using a personalized system of instruction, or a mastery model, in which the content and dose of treatment is calibrated to the needs of the family, ensuring that treatment effort is consistent with need. This multi-site, clinical trial aims to evaluate over a to year period the effectiveness of FBT delivered by a trained interventionist co-located within primary care plus enhanced usual care delivered by the primary care provider (FBT+EUC) compared to enhanced usual care alone (EUC). Participants will be a representative sample of 528 families with a 6-12 year-old child and a parent who are both overweight/obese. Weight changes in approximately 228 siblings who are overweight/obese and between 2-18 years of age will also be studied. This study will test between group differences in child (Primary Specific Aim 1A) and parent (Primary Specific Aim 1B) weight change, as well as weight change in siblings who are overweight/obese (Secondary Aim 1), changes in parent and child delay of gratification, and how changes in delay of gratification are related to parent and child weight changes (Secondary Aim 2), participant level predictors of treatment success (Secondary Aim 3), and how provider attitudes toward evidence-based treatment and perceptions of FBT may relate to their intention to use co- located FBT in their practices in the future (Exploratory Aim 1). Establishing that FBT can be effectively implemented within real world settings is crucial to creating a system by which children and their families who suffer from obesity can be treated in a centralized primary care setting."
"9272912","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane (ER/PM) junctions are best understood in muscle and immune cells where they mediate contraction and lymphocyte activation. Despite the early electron microscopic detection of sub-surface cisterns in neurons the function and molecular interactions responsible for the maintenance of this membrane junction are poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the Kv2.1 delayed rectifier K+ channel plays a central role in the formation of neuronal ER/PM junctions. This channel forms highly stable cell surface clusters on the neuronal soma that reside in close apposition the ER membrane. Most of these localized channels are non-conducting and play a direct structural role by enhancing the ER/PM junctions and dramatically increasing the junction surface area, likely by binding unknown ER membrane proteins. Our published data indicate that the Kv2.1 enhanced ER/PM junctions are trafficking hubs, providing platforms for delivery and retrieval for multiple types of membrane proteins. In addition, our preliminary data indicate that calcium signaling proteins localize to the neuronal Kv2.1/ER/PM junction. We propose the Kv2.1-stabilized ER/PM junctions represent a macromolecular plasma membrane complex that functions as a scaffolding site for both membrane trafficking and Ca2+ signaling. Given that this complex is regulated by stroke-related neuronal insults, an improved understanding of the components, function and dynamics within this cell surface microdomain is needed. This proposal assembles an interdisciplinary team from four institutions with combined expertise in intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, ion channel electrophysiology, molecular and cell biology, nanoSIMS cellular imaging technology, high-resolution real time imaging, optics, and quantitative analysis of single molecule diffusion. Aim 1 seeks to identify the proteins and lipids involved in the Kv2.1/ER/PM complex, Aim 2 examines L-type calcium channel function at the Kv2.1/ER/PM junction and Aim 3 studies calcium channel/beta2 adrenergic receptor dynamics within this domain."
"9291497","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is based on two novel findings that identify both Sox9 and Hox5 as critical players in lung development. In addition to identifying novel roles for these transcription factors in early lung patterning and branching morphogenesis, our preliminary evidence suggests that Hox5 regulates Wnt signaling in the mesenchyme to control mesenchyme-epithelial crosstalk upstream of Sox9 expression in both the mesenchyme and epithelium. By identifying novel molecular mechanisms by which Hox5 and Sox9 regulate lung development, the proposed work will add significant new data to our existing understanding of lung organogenesis. Furthermore, the proposed experiments are designed to synthesize a comprehensive view of how Sox9 and Hox5 integrate with the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway to regulate early events in lung development, including patterning, branching morphogenesis, proliferation and differentiation. In order to fully elucidate this novel Hox-Wnt-Sox signaling axi, we will define Hox5- and Sox9-mediated molecular regulation of lung development and determine the mechanisms by which Hox5 modulates Wnt/?-catenin signaling to control mesenchymal-epithelial crosstalk and Sox9 expression."

"9276792","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We discovered that the SMN protein binds to alpha-COP, the largest constituent of the heptameric COPI vesicle. The hypothesis to be investigated in this project is that pathogenesis of SMA results from inability of this cargo transport complex to sustain the functional integrity of motor neurons. We explore the role of the SMN protein's interaction with alpha-COP in neurite development and maintenance. Importantly, we observed that over-expression of alpha-COP restores neurite development in SMN depleted NSC34 cells. New data reveal that low levels of SMN alter the functionality of endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi trafficking, suggesting a previously unrecognized effect on this protein processing pathway. We recently reported that the alpha-COP complex incorporates ~800 specific RNAs from the total transcriptome of differentiated NSC-34 cells. A high fraction of these mRNAs contain in their 3' untranslated regions a G-quadruplex motif, which has been assigned a role in neurite localization. Our goal is to identify the mRNAs that depend on SMN for association with the COPI complex, enabling studies of the roles of alpha-COP and SMN in the trafficking of these RNAs into the axon and characterization of their requirement for neuronal development. To examine the biological physiologic significance of the interaction of SMN with alpha-COP and subsequent mechanistic studies, we generated novel transgenic mice with reduced levels of alpha-COP protein, with the prediction this will result in motor unit dysfunction. We also have created a transgenic strain that over-expresses tagged human alpha- COP. These mice will be crossed with SMA model mice with low levels of SMN to test the hypothesis that increased levels of alpha-COP and COPI vesicles promote SMN dependent cargo delivery to the axon and restore motor skills and increase lifespan. These experimental mouse models will be important resources to study the mechanism of neurodegeneration and the transport of proteins and specific RNAs to and within the axon. Pharmacologic induction of the COPI pathway may represent a novel means to treat SMA."
"9311704","Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak?though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this ?pre-Tourette? population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder."
"9345634","PROJECT ABSTRACT  HIV remains a dangerous and prevalent disease globally contributing to millions of infections and deaths per year and tens of billions of dollars in healthcare costs. The use of Truvada as Pre Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is 99% effective at preventing HIV infection if taken daily, but its impact on reducing HIV burden is limited by poor adherence. PrEP is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in populations known to have a high risk of HIV infection, which include men who have sex with men, people with a history of an STI, intravenous drug users, and people with a partner who is HIV positive. Monitoring of drug adherence is well known to improve drug compliance, but there are no commercial products for adherence monitoring of PrEP. Hence, there is a critical unmet need for a tool that will allow physicians to monitor adherence to PrEP in their patients. In order to be acceptable to patients on a routine basis and feasible in the physician workflow, this adherence test needs to be noninvasive, painless, inexpensive, and provide rapid, accurate results.  The overall goal of this project is to develop a point-of-care (POC) test that will measure patient adherence with the PrEP regimen and ultimately prevent HIV infection in people known to be at risk of exposure. The POC test will be based on a laboratory-based mass spectrometry urine test for levels of tenofovir, one of the drugs in PrEP, which UrSure already developed. The POC assay will be faster (minutes to get a result) and therefore can be used during a clinic visit to measure PrEP adherence and, if appropriate, counsel patients on how to improve their compliance. The aims of this Phase I project are to: 1) synthesize four tenofovir derivatives and conjugate them to form two immunogens for polyclonal antibody production in Aim 2 and two HRP-conjugated proteins for ELISA use in Aim 3; 2) produce two affinity purified polyclonal antibodies against each of the two immunogens produced in Aim 1; and 3) develop a prototype ELISA using these derivatives and antibodies, which will be validated with urine samples positive and negative for tenofovir.  The final deliverables of this Phase I project will be conjugated tenofovir derivatives, polyclonal antibodies to these derivatives, and an ELISA, all of which will be used to develop monoclonal antibodies and ultimately a Lateral Flow Immunoassay POC urine tenofovir test in a subsequent Phase II application. This Phase I project will be a critical step towards developing our POC urine test and bringing a powerful tool with the ability to drive PrEP adherence and reduce HIV infections to physicians worldwide."
"9364744","Project Summary Hookworm infection is a leading cause of anemia and malnutrition in poor countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization recommends repeated Mass Drug Administration of benzimidazole anthelminthics to high risk groups, including school age children, as a way to control morbidity and reduce transmission of hookworm and other Soil Transmitted Helminths. Although it is anticipated that hookworm resistance to benzimidazoles will eventually emerge, little is known about the frequency or distribution of resistant genotypes, as well as the potential for repeated anthelminthic exposure to reduce the effectiveness of deworming in human populations. Since 2007, the Ghana-Yale Partnership for Global Health has carried out collaborative field studies on hookworm epidemiology and deworming response, first in Kintampo North Municipality (KNM) and more recently Kpandai District (KD). Studies in adults and school age children (2007- 2015) have demonstrated reduced efficacy of albendazole, and preliminary data confirm the presence of putative benzimidazole resistance markers in N. americanus hookworms. We hypothesize that the mechanism of hookworm treatment failure in Kintampo involves genetically mediated resistance to albendazole. In Specific Aim 1, deworming effectiveness will be correlated with albendazole susceptibility using N. americanus isolates from KNM and KD in a field adapted in vitro assay. In Specific Aim 2, genomic DNA from hookworm field isolates will be used to define the temporal and spatial distribution of known benzimidazole resistance markers, as well as the genotypes associated with in vitro resistance and treatment failure. Studies in Specific Aim 3 will establish the structural basis of benzimidazole binding to hookworm ? tubulin, as well as map the functional significance of putative resistance associated mutations. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 the effect of benzimidazole exposure on hookworm gene expression will be characterized using stage specific cultures of field adapted and laboratory strains of human parasites. In addition to creating new knowledge to promote Neglected Tropical Disease control, this project will provide a framework for ongoing collaborative research and training, building on the record of the Ghana-Yale Partnership for Global Health. Ultimately, development of molecular methods to elucidate the mechanisms of deworming treatment failure will bridge a pressing technological gap and fill a critical public health need in Ghana and other resource limited countries."
"9264481","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is strongly linked to the development of osteoarthritis (OA); however, the mechanisms involved are not clearly understood. Accumulation of lipids/free fatty acids (FFA) in non-adipose tissue results in lipid toxicity, characterized by cell dysfunction, inflammation, and cell death. One of the mechanisms proposed for lipid toxicity is induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Our preliminary studies showed that mice fed a high- fat diet developed more severe OA than mice fed a low-fat diet. Immunohistochemical studies of the joint tissue from these mice showed increased expression of CHOP, a molecular marker of ER stress, compared to mice on a low-fat diet. In addition, our in vitro data suggest that lipid toxicity activates the ER stress transducer IRE1? in chondrocytes, and elicits inflammatory and pro-apoptotic pathways. Thus, we have both in vivo and in vitro evidence suggesting that ER stress is mechanistic link between high-fat diet and OA. The overall goals of this project are to determine (a) if lipid toxicity promotes joint tissue destruction and development of OA by inducing ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), and (b) elucidate the mechanism(s) involved. Hence we propose 3 Specific Aims: Aim 1.To determine OA severity in CHOP-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet. Aim 2: To determine OA severity in IRE1?-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet. Aim 3: To determine if dietary supplementation of palmitate (palm oil) promotes ER stress and OA in mice. The successful completion of our project will establish ER stress as a mechanistic link between a high-fat diet, and OA, and provide new targets for improved therapeutic treatments for OA or - ideally - interventions to halt its progression."
"9298690","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stage 2 pre essential hypertension (preEH; 130-139/<90 mmHg) entails a 3-fold risk of developing EH and 2- fold risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared to those with optimal blood pressure (<120/80 mmHg). Prevention programs are needed which can be sustained by preEHs and readily disseminated by healthcare providers. Psychological stress is a risk factor for future EH and CVD. Stress reduction via meditation has shown promise in reducing blood pressure (BP) but adult studies have not determined optimal dosage level nor evaluated dosage adherence objectively. Multiple underlying biobehavioral mechanisms linking meditation with BP reduction also require additional scrutiny. The proposed research will address these issues by further developing and optimizing a smart phone breathing awareness meditation program (Tension Tamer:TT). Stage 2 preEH 21-50 year old African Americans and Whites balanced by geographical locale (urban vs. rural) and healthcare providers from 12 practice sites (6 urban/6 rural with 12,843 stage 2 preEHs) within the OQUIN practice based research network will be enrolled. The 3 stage process of intervention development specified in PA-11-063 will involve: 1) Optimization of TT content and delivery formats guided by behavioral and technological theories using 6 focus groups of OQUIN healthcare providers and 6 focus groups with preEHs (8 preEHs per group); 2) 6 month TT proof of concept study (n=60 stage 2 preEHs) to establish dosage tolerability and impact upon resting and 24 hour SBP and biobehavioral mechanisms: worry, rumination, anxiety, hostility, mindfulness, sleep, physical activity, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) activity; 3) 12 month 2-arm randomized control trial (RCT; TT vs enhanced standard of care smart phone health education program; total n=80) to generate estimates needed for design of a large scale RCT. This series of iterative studies, implemented and guided by healthcare providers and their preEH patients, will result in an intervention acceptable to multiple racial/ethnic groups in both urban and rural settings, feasible to conduct in clinical practice settings, effective in reducing SBP in a pilot RCT and ready for a large scale RCT."
"9352865","Project Summary  In 2010, 330,000 infants were born with HIV, predominantly due to mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), and 90% of these infants were born in Sub-Saharan Africa. The number has dropped considerably due to increasingly successful prevention of MTCT using combination (triple) antiretrovirals (ARVs). The HIV epidemic remains substantial in South Africa, with 30% infection in pregnant women presenting at South African antenatal clinics. The Western Cape Government has adopted the WHO recommended ?Option B+? treatment plan, which has the potential to reduce HIV MTCT to under 1%, and the MTCT rate has fallen considerably. However, it has been reported that HIV-exposed, uninfected infants experience neurodevelopmental delays relative to their unexposed peers. In this study, we propose to measure the effects of in utero and perinatal exposure to ART and HIV on the developing infant brain, using neuroimaging at 38 to 41 weeks gestational age (GA) and neurodevelopmental assessments at 9 and 19 months of age. We aim to determine whether early clinical indicators, including both infant and maternal health, and neuroimaging of the neonatal brain are predictive of later neurodevelopmental outcomes, whether HIV and ART exposure affect infant neurodevelopment, and whether the duration of in utero ART exposure affects outcomes.  We will recruit 210 pregnant women, 140 HIV-infected and 70 uninfected, attending the antenatal clinic at the Michael Mapongwana Community Health Centre in Khayelitsha. Infected mothers and infants are treated according to the ?Option B+? guidelines, so that their infants will have been exposed to ARVs in utero either since conception (70 infants) or after 12 weeks (70 infants), postnatally and longer if breast feeding. Infants will be tested with HIV-1 DNA PCR at birth, and every 3 months if breast feeding. At 38 to 41 weeks GA, the infants will undergo neuroimaging at the Cape Universities Body Imaging Centre, including structural imaging for brain morphometry, diffusion for brain connectivity, and spectroscopy for brain metabolism. Participants will be followed every three months, with general examinations and growth assessments of the infants, and maternal health assessments, including depression, feeding practices and ARV compliance. Comprehensive neurodevelopmental testing with the Griffiths Mental Development Scale will be done at 9 and 19 months at the KID-CRU at Stellenbosch University (SUN). Acquisition and analysis techniques will be developed jointly by the University of Cape Town (UCT) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).  This project extends a successful collaboration between Dr. Barbara Laughton (SUN), Dr. Ernesta Meintjes (UCT) and Dr. Andr van der Kouwe (MGH). The project will build leading-edge neonatal brain imaging capacity in Cape Town, with unique imaging sequences and hardware, and infant handling techniques developed locally for ethically imaging neonates without sedation. UCT and SUN students will be involved in developing and applying the imaging, cognitive testing and analysis techniques used in the study."
"9469408","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to acquire a FEI Krios 300 kV transmission electron cryo-microscope equipped with a counting mode electron detector, a phase plate holder, a Gatan post-column energy filter with a K2-XP camera and automated data acquisition software. This facility will be administered by the National Center for Macromolecular Imaging (NCMI), a NIGMS supported Biomedical Technology Resource Center at Baylor College of Medicine. In addition to technology development, one of the NCMI's primary missions is to collaborate with and provide service to researchers who need Cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) and Cryo-electron tomography (CryoET) for structure determinations from macromolecules to cells at atomic to nanometer resolutions. We have identified 7 major users and 10 minor users in this proposal who are already active NCMI users both in and outside the Houston Area. This instrument facility is aimed for our users who have projects with one or more of the following objectives: (1) atomic resolution structure determination of molecular machines, (2) single particles structures with conformational and/or compositional heterogeneity, (3) subcellular and macromolecular studies of cells in normal and pathological states. All of these users' projects require high throughput and high quality data which will lead to 3-D structures yielding new structural insights of molecular and cellular components and biological processes related to cancer, infectious and neurological diseases. Due to the large quantity of data needed for each of these projects, we will manage our facility similar to an X-ray synchrotron beamline to provide 24 hours per day and 6 days per week (24/6) operation. None of the existing NCMI electron microscopes can deliver comparable data quality with the high throughput needed by the current state of art of CryoEM/ET projects. The actual microscope scheduling will be made quarterly by considering users' preference and the microscope availability. The proposed instrument will be maintained and operated by two NCMI staff who will assist users with data collection. We will provide regular training courses to users and their lab members to enable them to collect data with minimal assistance from our staff. We plan to make the proposed instrument available to other NCMI users after the first 18 months of operation. Then, an external user project evaluation committee made of CryoEM/ET experts appointed by the PI will evaluate and rank the proposals submitted by existing and new users. Two advisory committees will be set up to monitor the operation and productivity of the proposed instrument. One local committee will be appointed by the Senior Vice President of Research at Baylor College of Medicine; while an external committee is set up by the PI as mandated by the NIGMS supported P41 Center. The total cost of the instrument is ~$6 million. Baylor College of Medicine is committed to provide matching funds of $4 million towards the purchase of the instrument and the cost for the laboratory renovation. We have the adequate NIH support for the operation of this proposed instrument via the existing P41 Center grant funding the NCMI, now in its 30th year, extending at least until January 1, 2020. We expect to seek competitive renewal of this grant to continue the operation of the proposed facility beyond 2020. Should this prove unsuccessful, we plan for the proposed instrument to become a Core Lab under the management of the Advanced Technology Core Laboratories (ATCL) at Baylor College of Medicine, which will provide half of the instrument operational costs (service contract, personnel and supplies) and use established ATCL cost recharge mechanisms to recover the remaining operational costs."
"9480206","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent sexually-transmitted infectious organism in the United States with roughly 7 million people affected. Individuals infected with T. vaginalis face an increased risk of cervical cancer, infertility, pelvc inflammatory disease, prostatitis, and susceptibility to HIV. The nitroimidazoles are the only class of drugs available to treat trichomoniasis, but they suffer from several serious side effects Additionally, the emergence and spread of resistance to nitroimidazoles is becoming a concern. Consequently, there is a critical need for the development of new therapeutic agents to combat T. vaginalis and the proposed studies, designed in response to this RFA, provide a mechanism for the discovery and development of bioactive molecules that meet this need. Vital to the success of a drug discovery program is access to an outstanding library of chemically diverse substances that are well suited to become early stage leads. Natural products meet this essential requirement with metabolites from fungi having not been previously screened against T. vaginalis. Thus, this work is innovative since we will couple a novel natural product source with a new high-content screening system to identify promising bioactive substances from a large fungal secondary metabolite library. During the R21 phase of this investigation, we will focus on the following objectives to secure new compounds for treating T. vaginalis infections: (i) implement a high-content screening system for the detection of natural products that inhibit T. vaginalis viability; (ii) test a one-of-a-kind library of pure natural products, pre-fractionated materials, and secondary-metabolite-enriched fungal extracts for inhibitors of T. vaginalis; (iii) employ a mammalian-cell-based counter-screen to remove non-selective toxins from screening; and (iv) use fungal taxonomic information and secondary metabolite dereplication tools to select extracts and fractions for further studies. The most promising agents emerging from the R21 studies will be subjected to detailed R33 studies via the following aims: (i) purify bioactive natural products from fungal fractions and extract mixtures, (ii) establish the structures of bioactive metabolites and secure milligram quantities for biological evaluation, (iii) develop a complimentary high-content screening assay to evaluate each hit molecule against additional anaerobic protozoan targets (Giardia intestinalis and Entamoeba histolytica), and (iv) conduct in vitro metabolism studies of the most promising hit molecules and test their metabolites for toxicity and bioactivity. The successful accomplishment of these aims is expected to yield a focused set of natural products that inhibit T. vaginalis viability with minimal toxicity to human cells. It is anticipated that 3-5 promising inhibitors will be obtained that will serve as bioactiv leads for immediate investigation during subsequent R01/SBIR studies. The focus on securing high-quality bioactive compounds during the R21/R33 study is anticipated to help generate first-in-class molecules with applications for treating T. vaginalis and other anaerobic protozoans."
"9282327","Peripheral nerve injury is common and occurs due to a variety of causes including trauma, diabetes, cancer chemotherapy, autoimmune reactions, and genetic disorders. Although peripheral neurons are capable of regenerating, this process is generally incomplete. It is therefore crucial to determine ways in which regener- ation can be enhanced. Macrophages are thought to promote peripheral nerve regeneration after an acute injury due to their accumulation in the distal nerve where they phagocytize axonal debris and myelin thereby creating an environment through which axons can grow. In addition, macrophages secrete cytokines that trigger growth factor synthesis in non-neuronal cells in the nerve. The absence of these actions has been assumed to be the basis for the slow regeneration that occurs in the slowly degenerating Wlds mouse. How- ever, it has been known for 20 years. In part due to our studies. that there is a second, distinct, site of mac- rophage accumulation after injury, namely, peripheral ganglia such as dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) where the axotomized cell bodies reside. What has remained unknown is what function these macrophages subserve. Recent studies from our lab represent a major advance in answering this question. Work with two mutant mouse strains, a knockout for the chemokine receptor CCR2 and the Wlds mice led to the hypothesis that macrophage accumulation in ganglia is required for the occurrence of the conditioning lesion (CL) response, the response in which neurite outgrowth after a lesion is increased as a consequence of an earlier condition- ing lesion. This application is designed to test the following overall model: macrophages brought into the DRG by the chemokine CCL2 trigger the expression of regeneration associated genes (RAGs) via the secretion of cytokines around axotomized cell bodies and this promotes the CL response and regen- eration in addition to any effects macrophages have on the distal nerve. To establish beyond doubt that CCL2-dependent macrophage accumulation and the CCL2-dependent CL response are causally related, we will use an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptors to deplete circulating monocytes. To deter- mine whether macrophages act directly on neuronal cell bodies, we will use microfluidic chambers in which a neuron?s cell body and axon can be separated. Gene expression using RNAseq will be compared after ax- otomy in CCRs -/- and wild type animals to determine which axotomy-induced genes are dependent on mac- rophage accumulation. Since we have shown that Wallerian degeneration is normal in CCR2 -/- mice but monocyte infiltration into DRGs is blocked, these animals will allow us to determine whether macrophage accumulation in DRGs is required for sensory nerve regeneration in vivo. Using these novel approaches, we will examine the mechanisms underlying the relationship between macrophage accumulation near axoto- mized cell bodies and axonal growth. Emphasizing ganglia, unexplored sites of neuroinflammation, repre- sents a paradigm shift from the traditional view that focuses on macrophage effects on the distal nerve."
"9496290","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing evidence from epidemiology, genetics and clinical neuroscience implicates neuroimmune mechanisms in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ) and other developmental psychiatric disorders. A new class of animal models of maternal immune activation (MIA), expressing developmentally phenotypic features related to SZ, has been developed; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which MIA results in changes to brain development, connectivity and behavior. The UC Davis Conte Center seeks to bridge that gap. Supported by pilot funding for the past three years, this team has worked together to develop hypotheses, design experiments and collect preliminary data to develop the present application. The Center comprises an accomplished group of investigators from molecular and cell biology, systems and behavioral neuroscience, biomedical engineering, neuroimaging, and clinical neuroscience and a highly integrated set of studies conducted across species and scale to test the hypothesis that MIA contributes to SZ by altering immune molecules in the brains of offspring, which, in turn, alters cortical connectivity, function and behavior during development. Synaptic changes, gene expression, structural and functional connectivity, neural inflammation and behavior will be measured in mouse and non-human primate (NHP) models at multiple ages to determine the timing and hierarchy of the effects of MIA. When possible, parallel studies in humans will be conducted to establish the clinical relevance of the MIA animal models. The Center will pursue two Specific Aims to determine: 1) if MIA increases risk for neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders in offspring by altering neural circuitry through dysregulated signaling of immune molecules and gene networks throughout development; 2) the timing of the appearance and progression of structural and functional changes in the brains of MIA offspring relative to the onset of dopamine dysregulation, neural inflammation, and SZ-related behavioral disturbances in the MIA NHP and compare these data to those seen in first-episode SZ. The projects will measure changes in synaptic connectivity, gene expression, structural and functional connectivity, neural inflammation, and behavior in parallel mouse and NHP MIA models at multiple ages to determine the relative timing and hierarchy of these changes and understand the underlying mechanisms. These studies in the mouse and NHP model will be complemented by novel analyses of synaptic connectivity and gene expression in post mortem human tissue from SZ."
"9282732","Project Summary/Abstract Genetically engineered tumoricidal neural stem cells (tNSCs) are a promising therapy for the highly aggressive brain cancer Glioblastoma (GBM). Engineered tNSCs have unique tumor-homing capacity that allows them to deliver anti-cancer gene products directly into local and invasive GBM foci. We recently discovered that polymeric scaffolds significantly increase the survival of therapeutic stem cells in the GBM resection cavity, remained permissive to stem cell tumoritropic homing, and markedly prolong the survival of mice with post-operative GBM. Yet, limitations to scaffold design are likely to prevent the effective application of scaffold/tNSC therapy in a clinical setting. Additionally, the matrix properties that regulate tNSC therapy are unknown, preventing the optimization of scaffold parameters in order to develop a scaffold/tNSC treatment that is effective against post-surgical GBM in patients. Our results show that altering fiber diameter and gelatin doping within scaffolds improves tNSC transplant. This allows us to hypothesize that optimizing the design features of scaffolds will achieve effective suppression of post- surgical GBMs by tNSC therapy. We propose to identify the scaffold features that promote tNSC cancer therapy by using a panel of scaffolds with different biophysical and biochemical features known to influence stem cell adherence, movement, and differentiation. We will then determine the ability of scaffolds incorporating multiple optimized features to improve tNSC therapy using surgical resection models of patient- derived human xenografts in immune-depleted mice and syngeneic GBM allografts in immune-competent animals. We propose to undertake the following Aims: 1) Develop and characterize a panel of polymeric scaffolds with differing topographic, mechanical, and biochemical properties; 2) Determine the scaffold design parameters that regulate tNSC therapy for post-operative GBM; 3) Investigate the efficacy and safety of tumoricidal tSC therapy in immune-competent models of GBM resection/recurrence. The results of our study will generate a therapeutic tNSC/scaffold transplant strategy capable of robust GBM killing that can be translated for human patient testing. It will also uncover the scaffold features that regulate different aspects of tNSCs, allowing us to modulate tNSC cancer therapy through matrix design."
"9374801","PROJECT SUMMARY In addition to its established role in sensory integration and motor control, the cerebellum is rapidly emerging as a prominent regulator of emotional functions and has been implicated in affective disorders. However, the mechanistic link between the cerebellum and emotion is lacking. The short-latency functional connections that have been identified between the cerebellum and amygdala- a structure crucial for emotion - raise the exciting, yet untested, hypothesis that a cerebellum-amygdala pathway communicates information important for emotion processing. The major obstacle in rigorously testing this hypothesis has been the lack of knowledge about the anatomy and synaptic connectivity of the cerebellar-amygdala circuit. The central goal of this project is to delineate the connectivity between these brain regions. To achieve this goal, we will employ a powerful combination of anatomical and optophysiological tools that will provide for the first time the wiring diagram of the cerebellar-amygdala circuit and begin to map its functionality. We will also validate for the first time the potential of a recently developed in vitro approach to report synaptic connectivity in complex monosynaptic circuits in vivo. We will further extend applicability of the approach to the study of disynaptic circuits, for which no tools are currently available to directly visualize synapses. Application of this approach to the cerebellar-amygdala circuit will facilitate identification of synaptic partners and can reveal connectivity patterns, which are important determinants of local computations and information flow in a circuit. A successful outcome will pave the way for spatiotemporally precise manipulations of the cerebellar-amygdala pathway, which are absolutely necessary in order to decipher the contributions of this circuit to emotion processing and memory in health and disease."
"9392680","Project Summary  CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are essential for germinal center (GC) responses and long- term humoral immunity. However, the complex regulation that determines the differentiation of Tfh cells, their developmental progression in GC, and their number and function in helping GC B cell differentiation and antibody affinity selection, are still not fully understood. Our long-term goals are to identify novel pathways underlying the differentiation of Tfh cells and design new strategies to manipulate humoral responses for treatment of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders and to aid vaccine development.  Recently we have identified transcription factor Foxp1 as a rate-limiting and critical negative regulator of Tfh cell differentiation, which drastically affects both the kinetics and the magnitude of the antibody responses. Our new preliminary data now start to reveal that Foxp1 engages a complex network of regulators that are coordinated to suppress Tfh cell differentiation as well as Tfh help to B cells at different stages/steps of the GC response. In this application, we aim to identify Foxp1 targets and elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Foxp1 regulates Tfh cell differentiation. In addition, we will further delineate how Foxp1-mediated regulation of Tfh cell differentiation affects GC B cell development, antibody affinity selection and chronic infection. Our study will not only reveal new components of the transcriptional regulation in Tfh cell differentiation, but also provide fundamental mechanistic insights in the regulation of GC B cell responses and antibody affinity selection."
"9372274","The herpes simplex virus (HSV) capsid plays a critical role in multiple steps of the virus life cycle. Early steps in infection include: fusion of viral and host membranes and release of the capsid into the cytoplasm; dynein- dependent trafficking of the capsid along microtubules to the nuclear envelope; docking of the capsid at a nuclear pore; and release of the viral genome into the nucleus. Binding of the capsid to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) appears to be mediated by the capsid protein pUL25 and the capsid-tethered tegument protein pUL36 through their interaction with the NPC proteins Nup214 and Nup358. In addition, NPC binding requires importin beta and a functional RanGTP/GDP cycle. A key knowledge gap in the early stages of infection is how the capsid engages the NPC and what triggers release of the viral genome from the capsid. The packaged HSV DNA creates a pressure of tens of atmospheres within the capsid and this pressure likely drives the translocation of the viral genome into the nucleus. Temperature-sensitive mutants in pUL25 and pUL36 have been found to dock at the NPC but both mutants fail to release DNA indicating that the role of these two proteins in NPC docking and uncoating can be separated. The objective of this proposal is to understand what triggers release of the packaged genome after docking of the capsid at the NPC. We have recently reported high-quality cryoEM reconstructions of the herpesvirus capsid imaged inside intact virions which allowed for a detailed model of subunit and domain organization of pUL25 and identified subunit contacts that pUL25 makes with capsid and with pUL36. Based on our preliminary studies of a novel pUL25 HSV mutant whose capsid binds the nuclear membrane but does not uncoat, we hypothesize that pUL25 initiates DNA release through its interaction with pUL36 and/or with one of the NPC proteins. We propose to test our hypothesis in two specific aims that i) define the role of pUL25 in capsid binding to the NPC and its role in triggering DNA release from the capsid; and ii) determine the structural changes in the capsid/NPC interaction that trigger HSV genome uncoating. These studies will examine the biochemical and structural basis of genome uncoating, provide unique information on how the capsid structure controls interactions with the NPC, and may reveal vulnerable structural intermediates as targets for blocking virus replication."
"9340235","Epithelial cells, which line both the inside cavities and outside of the body, exist in tissues as monolayers, multilayers of cells, and three dimensional tube/duct structures. Proper formation and homeostasis of the epithelium is critical for tissue and organ function; dysregulation of the epithelium is associated with epithelial barrier loss (including sepsis), defective wound healing, and development and progression of cancer. Although mechanical forces on epithelial cells have been shown to influence cell organization, proliferation, and migration, it is not known the mechanisms by which cells respond to force. This proposal examines the role of force across proteins in both cell-cell junctions and the nuclear linker of nucleoskeleton to cytoskeleton (LINC) complex as mediators of epithelial homeostasis. Strong cell-cell junctions are critical to the integrity of the epithelium, including cell cohesion, barrier function, and ability to resist mechanical stress. Loss of junctions is associated with epithelial dysfunction including inflammatory-induced increases in permeability and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although formation cell-cell adhesions have been shown to be critical regulators of cell proliferation, migration, and tissue organization, very little is known how cell-cell junction forces contribute to these processes. In addition to altering junction forces, externally applied forces are likely transmitted inside the cell, across the cytoskeleton, and onto organelles. The nucleus, which is physically connected to the cytoskeleton by the LINC complex, is likely affected by external forces. Nuclear forces have been suggested to regulate nuclear geometry and nuclear positioning, both of which are altered in a variety of diseases, including cancer. The major research goals of this MIRA proposal are to examine how forces across cell-cell junction proteins and the nuclear LINC complex regulate epithelial proliferation, migration, junction stability, and 3D organization. Novel FRET-based tension biosensors will be used to directly measure forces across tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes at cell-cell junctions and specific isoforms of nesprin at the LINC complex. Treatments or mutants for which junction or nuclear force is perturbed will be used to assess the causal nature of force in regulation of the epithelium. An additional goal of this proposal is to identify the relationship between forces across cell-cell junctions, cell-matrix adhesions, and the nuclear LINC complex, identifying how forces are transmitted from one region of the cell to another. This comprehensive study of cell-cell, cell-matrix, and nuclear forces will greatly advance the understanding of epithelial homeostasis, which includes the processes of wound repair, inflammation, and epithelial tissue development and organization, as well as epithelial diseases, including cancer, fibrosis, and chronic inflammation. Junction and nuclear forces may represent a universal mechanism to regulate proliferation, migration, and organization; therefore, results from this study may also be relevant to a large number of non- epithelial cells and tissues."
"9276042","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am a general pediatrician and internist at Baystate Medical Center and an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, MA. Since completing a fellowship with the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program at Yale (2005) I have focused my career on improving maternal-child health care quality, with a particular emphasis on vulnerable populations. During my recent two-year KL-2 Career Development Award, I studied variation in risk-adjusted maternal infection rates in a national sample of hospitals and found substantial variation in infection rates. This discrepancy in care quality revealed a potential opportunity to improve rates in lower performing hospitals. During the first year of my KL-2, I received R21 funding from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to develop an intervention to improve access to publicly reported pediatric quality data for low income pregnant women. In this randomized controlled trial, we are determining whether an intervention to help these women use the publicly reported quality data impacts their choice of pediatrician. Both of these research experiences have been instrumental in my decision to pursue additional training in the field of dissemination and implementation research. This training will enable me to not only identify best practices for delivering high quality care to women and children, but also to test interventions to disseminate and implement these practices. My short- term career goals are to satisfy the criteria for a PhD in health policy and management while completing my proposed research study. My PhD will be focused on developing dissemination and implementation science skills, including further expertise in mixed-methods research. The training and education provided by this career development award will enable me to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator in the field of maternal-child health care quality.    As a core faculty member in Baystate Medical Center's (BMC) Center for Quality of Care Research (CQCR), I am in a strongly supportive research environment. Dr. Lindenauer, my primary mentor and the Director of the CQCR, is an accomplished dissemination and implementation scientist. He currently leads an NHLBI-funded study (1 R18 HL108810-01) that uses the positive deviance approach to identify best practices for implementing non-invasive ventilation for patients with respiratory failure. In addition, he leads an AHRQ- funded study (1 R18 HS 18645-01) in which he is conducting a national survey to understand the determinants of effective implementation of evidence based practices within a quality improvement collaborative. He is currently the primary mentor for three physician investigators supported by NIH Career Development Awards, and has mentored four KL-2/KM-1 awardees within the past three years. Prior mentees have successfully transitioned to independence with R01 level funding. The CQCR offers bio statistical and research assistant support to core faculty members and serves as an intellectual and scientific hub for health services researchers throughout BMC. The CQCR is also closely linked to Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute where I completed coursework for my KL-2, and where Dr. Lindenauer serves as a faculty member. Finally, as a PhD candidate in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst, I will have access to high-level instruction and academic guidance in the multi- disciplinary fields critical to understanding and conducting dissemination and implementation research.    There is a critical need to ensure that the nearly 75 million children in the U.S. receive the highest quality of health care possible. However, more than half of children in the U.S. do not receive recommended primary care and children from vulnerable populations are most affected. Although initiatives are underway nationwide to improve care quality for children, the field will benefit from scientists trained in dissemination and implementation science to translate quality of care research findings into practice. For my career development award project, I will perform a positive deviance study to identify the organizational strategies and contextual factors associated with high performance on pediatric primary care quality measures. This study will also serve as my PhD thesis project. The specific aims of the proposed study are: 1) to qualitatively identify organizational strategies and contextual factors common to primary care pediatric practices with high clinical quality and patient experience scores in Massachusetts; 2) to develop and test a questionnaire to determine which of the organizational strategies and contextual factors identified in Aim 1 are present in pediatric primary care practices; and 3) to determine the association between these strategies and factors and practice performance on clinical quality measures in pediatric offices throughout Massachusetts. This proposed study will build on our unique partnership with Massachusetts Health Quality Partners. This study's goals are highly responsive to the recent NIH-wide emphasis on using dissemination and implementation science to close the substantial gap between what is known to improve health care and actual care provided. They are also consistent with the mission of the National Institute of Child Health and Development ...to ensure that every person is born healthy... and that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability."
"9279266","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Less than half of individuals living with HIV in the United States are receiving ongoing care, and only one- quarter have an undetectable viral load. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy prioritizes care and treatment of HIV- infected individuals, yet improvement in care retention rates is clearly needed. Research on HIV care has used attendance at primary care appointments to assess whether patients are in care. While medical visits are necessary, they are not sufficient and do not necessarily reflect a patient's level of engagement. Engagement in care is about the patient experience and interactions with providers and the care site. We propose to create a patient-centered Index of Engagement in HIV Care that will be framed within a model of Health Care Empowerment, which refers to participation in care in a way that is engaged, informed, collaborative, committed, and tolerant of uncertainty. We will create the index through a collaborative process of consensus- building with patients, providers, and research experts using iterative online Delphi surveys and in-person focus groups. We will then translate these narrative findings into scale items and develop them further through cognitive interviewing with patients. We will validate the index by administering i to a sample of patients undergoing the Patient Reported Outcomes within the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) and examining retrospective, cross-sectional, and prospective appointment and viral load data. The resulting Index of Engagement in HIV Care will have implications for both clinical care and research, identifying patients who are at risk fo poor clinical outcomes and providing a metric by which to develop and evaluate interventions aiming to improve engagement in care."
"9328616","PROJECT SUMMARY In the mitral valve (MV) several pathological factors such as mitral regurgitation (MR) and degenerative myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD), have been shown to affect tissue structure and composition. Current clinical treatments for both functional and degenerative MR include ring annuloplasty. Though beneficial in the short-term, it has been shown to be less promising in the long term, with repair failure as high as 60%. Mechanical stress is a strong etiological factor: alterations in mechanical loading caused by surgical repair lead to stress-induced changes in valve interstitial cell (VIC) function that affect both tissue structure and composition, ultimately leading to repair failure. The link between tissue-level stresses and cellular homeostatic response is essential in understanding valve disease progression and in developing novel approaches to improve surgical repair. We thus hypothesize that mitral VIC (MVIC) deformation is a major driver for cellular mechanoregulation, and that abnormal mechanical stimuli lead to non-physiological MVIC deformations that result in phenotypic activation and altered biosynthetic activity. Extending these ideas for pathological valve conditions, we further hypothesize that myxomatous MVICs can exhibit signs of phenotypic reversal after being exposed to a physiological strain regime in a healthy microenvironment. Exploiting this knowledge can lead to improved surgical repair techniques for both functional and degenerative MR. We will address our hypotheses with the following two aims: (1) Investigate the response of normal MVICs to a range of physiological and non-physiological biaxial  loading conditions. First, using intact ovine MV anterior leaflets. Then, by utilizing a human MVIC  seeded engineered-tissue approach to characterize the responses of normal human MVICs to biaxial  loading conditions. (2) Characterize the response of human myxomatous MVICs to physiological and non-physiological  biaxial loading conditions. Building upon our hypothesis that MVIC deformation drives homeostatic  response, we will use our established MV macro-micro finite element model to simulate in vivo MVIC  deformation under different surgical repair scenarios and bracket physiological and non-physiological  regions within the range of in vitro biaxial loading conditions used in (1). We will then explore the  potential to induce phenotypic reversal in myxomatous MVICs after an in vitro treatment in an optimal mechano-microenvironment."
"9470935","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) affects 5.1 million adult patients in the US. About 50% of people diagnosed with HF will die within 5 years. Ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy has evolved into a standard therapy for patients with advanced HF, not only as a bridge to myocardial recovery or cardiac transplantation but also as a destination therapy. The recent data suggest that approximately 85 and 75% of patients supported with continuous flow VADs (CF-VADs) will survive at 12 and 24 months, respectively. These survival rates are approaching those of heart transplant patients. However, bleeding has become a significant problem for the CF-VAD therapy. Thus it is critical to understand the bleeding risk of CF-VAD support and their underlying mechanistic origins. Given the potential of the CF-VAD therapy for end-stage HF patients and the need to reduce significant device associated complications, we propose to conduct a series of clinical, biological and bioengineering experiments to seek a better understanding of shear-induced hemostatic dysfunction (SIHD) and bleeding in HF patients supported with CF-VADs and their link to blood flow dynamics of CF-VADs and pre-existing hemostatic disorder of HF patients. Further we seek to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of SIHD for better medical management and to create a database of SIHD for VAD design refinements. Three specific aims of the proposed project are: (1) To determine temporal changes of biomarkers of SIHD in HF patients prior to and during CF-VAD support and to link these changes to post-implant bleeding events; (2) To model shear stress indices (SSI) of CF-VADs and link them to measured biomarkers of SIHD and Bleeding in CF- VAD patients with consideration of pre-existing hemostatic disorder and patient-specific SIHD sensitivity to SSI prior to receiving a CF-VAD; and (3) To elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms of SIHD associated with CF-VADs and to establish a database of biomarkers of SIHD for VAD design improvement. Altogether, a combination of clinical hematology, biological as well as bioengineering approaches will be used to derive the basic knowledge behind bleeding complications and to investigate the influence of device-specific non- physiological fluid dynamic characteristics like shear stress and exposure time on SIHD. The successful completion of this project will create a new knowledge of bleeding associated with CF-VADs. The new knowledge can be used by clinicians to refine bleeding risk stratification in patients for the improved quality of life and by engineers to develop less traumatic, next generation biocompatible VADs."

"9178077","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of malnutrition and death worldwide. In the US, close to 48 million people contract AGE and 128,000 are hospitalized each year . Episodes of AGE can result in substantial morbidity to children and their families. In addition, the costs to caregivers, the health-care system, and society are significant. At present, treatment options are limited and targeted at symptom management rather than disease modification. Probiotics - live microbial cultures which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer documented health benefits - may be an ideal solution. They are hypothesized to work via a combination of direct microbiologic and immunologic mechanisms. Probiotics have shown promise in early clinical research in hospitalized children in developing countries. These early efforts are limited by small samples, outcomes lacking relevance to outpatients, poor methodology and absence of side effect reporting; thus, the potential role of probiotics remains poorly defined and practice guidelines do not endorse their use. There are current trends, however, that obligate an urgent assessment of these agents. First, probiotic manufacturers have embarked in aggressive public marketing strategies that make health claims that may not be supported by rigorous research, and the world-wide market for probiotic products is growing steadily (projected growth 2009-2014 12.6% for a total of US $32.6 billion/year). Second, government agencies (US FDA and European Food safety Authority (EFSA)) remain concerned about their value and safety. Third, some institutions are now recommending the use of probiotics based on potentially flawed or limited evidence. Fourth, parents of patients with AGE are often medicating their children without guidance from medical professionals. We are therefore concerned that probiotic consumption is increasing without solid evidence to support its use, which underscores the necessity to conduct a definitive trial without delay. Objectives - The overall objective of this multi-national randomized clinical trial is to determine if a specific probiotic agent, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG(LGG), the most widely available, studied and regulated probiotic in the US, should routinely be administered to outpatient children who are suffering from AGE. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to determine the clinical effectiveness of LGG and (2) to determine the safety and side effect profile of LGG in children 3-48 months of age presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with AGE. Study Setting & Design - The study will be conducted in 8 US pediatric emergency departments within the federally funded Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN). We will randomize 900 children to receive 5 days of a probiotic agent (LGG 1 x 1010 CFU twice a day) or placebo. The main outcome is the occurrence of moderate-severe disease as defined by the Modified Vesikari Score, a validated clinical severity score, which incorporates the frequency and duration of diarrhea, frequency and duration of vomiting, height of fever, need for future health-care visits and medical interventions provided. We will also assess the occurrence of adverse events and side effects related to the use of LGG. We will collect stool samples to conduct mechanism of action studies as well as economic data to conduct cost effectiveness analyses in the future. Impact - This study will directly inform clinica practice by providing the first definitive evidence to support recommendations for or against the routine use of probiotics in the treatment of pediatric AGE. In addition it will provide health-car practitioners and policy makers with (a) a clear picture on the potential side effects from probiotic use, and with the data collected (b) knowledge on the mechanism of action and (c) of the potential economic impact of probiotic use on health-care systems and society. Thus, the potential clinical and societal impacts of the proposed study are substantial and the results will guide the standard of care: if positive, guidelines will be able to endorse probiotic administratio with important positive consequences for the health of several million US children annually. Moreover, if beneficial the cost savings to the health-care system and society may be substantial. If the results are negative, a firm recommendation against the routine use of probiotics would be justified. Collaborators - This work is collaboration between leaders in multicenter and AGE research (Schnadower, Freedman, Tarr, Gorelick, Mahajan, Stanley, Roskind, Powell, O'Connel, Ruddy Chun, Levine and Casper) in prestigious Children's Hospitals within a federally funded multicenter network (PECARN) with a strong record in conducting high quality, high impact clinical trials."
"9281056","Splicing is fundamental to gene expression in all eukaryotic organisms. Indeed, aberrant splicing is associated with many inherited diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), myotonic dystrophy (DM), microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 1 (MOPD1) and others. The process of splicing is co-transcriptional and is executed by the spliceosome of which there are two types, i.e. the major and the minor spliceosome. As the name suggests, majority of the splicing in humans is executed by the major spliceosome, but there are <2% of the genes in humans that have at least one intron that it cannot splice. This minor subset of introns is spliced by the aptly named minor spliceosome. It must be noted that the efficiency of minor intron splicing is lower than its major introns and is attributed to low levels of these snRNAs. Moreover, these minor introns are found in ~450 human genes that execute various functions in the cell. Therefore, the function of the minor spliceosome including its inefficient splicing can have a profound impact on expression of these genes. Yet, the role of these introns and its spliceosome as it relates to mammalian cortical development has not been explored. Thus, our overall objective is to understand the role of minor introns and the minor spliceosome in neocortical development and disease. Recently it was discovered that infants born with devastating disease MOPD1 is caused by mutations altering the function of the minor spliceosome. Here we report a U11 conditional knockout mouse that inactivates the spliceosome in the developing cortex that recapitulates one of the cardinal features i.e., microcephaly in MOPD1. Therefore in this mouse model of microcephaly, we will be able to determine how minor spliceosome informs cortical development. Specifically, we will employ custom microarray and RNAseq to capture genes regulated by the minor spliceosome. This in turn will reveal the specific step(s) of the cell cycle that is affected in the absence of a functions U11 snRNA. Understanding regulation of cell cycle has long been a major goal in developmental biology and in stem cell biology as it is the foundation of developing tissue. Moreover, failure to precisely control cell cycle can have drastic developmental defects such as those observed in MOPD1 and infant glioblastomas. While these issues have been under intense investigation, the role of minor spliceosome has remained unexplored. Hew we show that minor spliceosome is indeed crucial for neocortical development and our proposed experiments will shed further insights on the manner in which it regulates cell cycle and neocortical development."
"9326348","Project Summary/Abstract Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a heterogeneous group of rare recessive pediatric neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative disorders, characterized clinically by severe age-dependent neurological impairment, and notable radiographic volume loss of the pons and cerebellum. Currently there are 10 partially overlapping subtypes and 13 genes known mutated in PCH, but most cases remain without genetic diagnosis, suggesting new causes remain to be identified. Several of the genes are implicated in protein synthesis including key steps of tRNA maturation, mRNA splicing, protein translation and apoptosis, but fundamental questions remain: 1] How many genetic subtypes remain to be discovered? 2] Why do these mutations predispose to neuropathology? 3] Can we effect new treatments for these disorders? Through an international recruitment effort, we have ascertained a cohort of 190 families with recessive PCH and have begun sequencing to identify new causes and mechanisms. Our preliminary data suggests new treatments may emerge from these studies. In our preliminary data we have: 1] Recruited a cohort of 190 PCH probands, including 124 still without cause identified. 2] Identified mutations in AMPD2 associated with a syndromic form of PCH, leading to GTP depletion and subsequent collapse of protein synthesis. 3] Identified a common founder mutation in CLP1 leading to defective assembly of the tRNA splicing machinery. 4] Identified mutations in TOE1 as the long-sought snRNA 3'-exonuclease, leading to defective mRNA splicing. 5] Identified mutations in several other genes encoding tRNA processing factors. 6] Identified mutations in PPIL1 predicted to lead to defective mRNA splicing. 7] Uncovered a total of 13 new genetic causes of PCH, more than doubling the number of known causes. These novel PCH candidate genes are mutated in patients with unique presenting features, highlighting new genotype-phenotype correlations, emphasizing the protein synthetic defect model and pointing to new mechanisms of disease. The goal of this application is to identify the remaining `discoverable' genes that when mutated lead to PCH, functionally validate mutations within a pathogenic framework, and test the hypothesis that mutations in PCH genes lead to collapse of protein synthesis and vulnerability to apoptosis."
"9378435","Abstract  The tumor microenvironment (TME) is recognized as a key factor in multiple stages of disease progression, particularly local resistance, immune-escape, and distant metastasis, thereby substantially impacting the future development of frontline interventions in clinical oncology. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a pattern recognition receptor predominantly involved in the recognition of endogenous molecules released in the context of sterile inflammation and infection. We recently demonstrated that RAGE plays a unique oncogenetic role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrated that: 1) RAGE was highly expressed in mouse and human PDAC; 2) Global ablation of RAGE in mice prevented pancreatic cancer growth in a genetically-modified spontaneous mouse model (Pdx1-Cre;K-RasG12D/+;RAGE-/-) and a xenograft mouse model; 3) RAGE was essential for oncogenic K-Ras-mediated hypoxic signaling in PDAC development; and 4) The mechanism by which this occurs in part involves inflammatory response-associated metabolic changes, cell death-promoting limitations in autophagy, and a reduction in the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. These exciting findings raise several important questions regarding RAGE's novel role in PDAC. We hypothesize that RAGE expression in multiple components of the TME is critical for PDAC development and therapy resistance. We will pursue the following aims. Aim 1: identify RAGE as a critical receptor of nuclear danger signal in the TME; Aim 2: define the cell-specific role of RAGE in the TME; and Aim 3: investigate antitumor efficacy of the combination of the RAGE inhibitor with chemoimmunotherapy in different tumor models in mice. The completion of these exciting studies will provide new insights into our understanding of the TME and guide future development of RAGE-based novel therapeutic strategies for PDAC patients."
"9377120","?    DESCRIPTION:  Structural, congenital heart defects are the number one non-infectious cause of infant death in the US. Repair often requires multiple surgeries and implantation of nonviable or mechanically inactive patches, which are non-functional but occupy areas important to heart function. These patches are highly effective in the short- term, but as the infant grows and the patches remain static they can cause arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and an increased likelihood of sudden cardiac death in addition to the possibility of calcification or aneurysm formation necessitating further surgery. The overarching goal of this study is to create a biodegradable patch prevascularized with cells harvested from amniotic fluid that is autologous for repair in a newborn, can recruit resident progenitor cells from the infant's heart and eventually be absorbed and become functional heart tissue. Current patch materials are made from Dacron, Teflon or fixed pericardium, which have been shown to lead to a foreign body reaction, resulting in a large, scar-like capsule in the heart. We recently published on a biodegradable cardiac patch that is strong enough to be sutured into a ventricle as a full-thickness patch, and has a porous structure that is rapidly populated by cardiac cells. In the proposed study, we will create multi-layered bio-synthetic patches with strong supporting cores of polyurethane, and cell-friendly fibrin modified with poly(ethylene glycol) to control degradatio and inflammatory response. We will then investigate these materials in vitro in cultures with cardiomyocytes. Finally, we will assess the functionality in vivo in a right ventricle free wall replacement in a nude rat model, and assess vasculature function, cell survival and heart function. If successful, these studies will develop a method for generating a full thickness myocardial patch for repair of congenital heart defects. This therapeutic option could transform the surgical approach to major congenital heart defects."
"9272142","PROJECT SUMMARY The Pacific Northwest Proteogenomic Translational Research Center (PNPTRC) has two overarching aims: 1) to use combined measurements of protein abundance and post translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, to build predictive models of drug response that can be effectively used to guide the choice of agents for first-line therapies, and 2) to model the processes of signaling crosstalk and redundancy to more effectively predict drug resistance and to guide second line therapies. To accomplish these goals, the PNPTRC will leverage on-going preclinical and clinical studies of individualized treatment selection strategies for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) to improve the emerging models based on DNA and RNA data to include signal transduction pathway information derived from proteomic and phosphoproteomic measurements, and improve the predictive power of the models by integrating genomic and proteomic data. The PNPTRC represents a collaboration between innovative clinical trial design and therapeutic interventions at the OHSU Knight Cancer Center, and cutting edge mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies at PNNL. The Preclinical Research Arm of the PNPTRC will identify differences in protein abundance and protein phosphorylation that correlate strongly with cell survival in the in vitro IC50 assay developed at OHSU. Measurements of protein abundance and phosphorylation over time of treatment will be used to build networks of pathway activation and crosstalk that can inform the likelihood of eventual resistance and identify alternative signaling pathways which can be targeted in second line therapies. The models will be further tested and refined in subsequent ex vivo experiments using primary human AML cells exposed to specific combinations of inhibitors. The Clinical Research Arm will apply high quality targeted proteomic assays on samples from AML patients enrolled in NCI-sponsored clinical trials to confirm the predictive abilities of specific differences in protein abundance and/or phosphorylation identified in the Preclinical Research Arm."
"9277493","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limbic-based bottom-up systems characterized by heightened reactivity to motivational stimuli and rewards mature rapidly from early adolescence, while prefrontally-organized top- down systems that enable more effective cognitive control and judgment mature more slowly (Casey & Jones, 2010). This mismatch has been proposed as a key contributor to health risk behavior among adolescents, which is of critical importance because: (1) risk behaviors are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this age group, including diseases arising from unprotected sexual activity and casualties arising from reckless behavior (including driving fatalities and serious injuries); (2) it is the peak age for the onset f a wide range of risk behavior patterns with potential long-term consequences, including substance use and abuse, and delinquency. The developmental maturity mismatch hypothesis, however, has not been directly tested in relation to risk behavior at a level sufficient to inform this critcal health area (Pfeifer & Allen, 2012). The primary aim of the proposed research is to understand the behavioral, cognitive, and neural bases of risk taking, through integrated analyses of age differences, developmental trajectories, and individual differences in psychosocial, neurocognitive and neural imaging assessments."
"9269242","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Previous groundbreaking discoveries have made it possible to grow pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells in vitro and to reprogram adult cells back to a pluripotent state. These advances have opened new opportunities for regenerative medicine by providing the cellular starting point from which we can derive adult cell types with physiological properties to study and treat human disease. Attaining cell types suitable for direct therapeutic application or as cellular models of human disease for drug development both require a substantial level of similarly to the in vivo cellular counterpart. Most often, investigaors attempt to attain the best in vivo mimics by replicating key aspects of a cell's developmental progression through embryogenesis. Given the appreciation that epigenetic effects are cumulative and progressive through embryogenesis, a central hypothesis of this proposal is that the initial steps in lineage specification are critical, and epigenetic mistakes made during exit from pluripotency can have undesirable effects even after cells have reached the targeted differentiated state. To address this problem, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms that eliminate or decommission ES cell- specific gene regulatory elements (i.e. enhancers) from lineage specified cell types. We discovered that a sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor, Tcf7l1, binds specifically to enhancers in ES cells that are targeted for decommissioning. Given our previous findings that showed Tcf7l1 stimulated differentiation of ES cells, we propose testing the hypothesis that Tcf7l1 is necessary to decommission ES specific enhancers. The proposal will further determine how this effect of Tcf7l1 changes the responses of cells to extracellular signals, and measure how important it is for genuine lineage specification using established in vitro differentiation protocols. The immediate outcome of completing the proposed research will be a better understanding of how cells exit the pluripotent state, and a demonstration of how defects during early steps can diminish the efficiency of subsequent stages of differentiation. Finally, given the oncogenic potential of accessible ES- specific enhancers in adult cells, the importance of the proposed work for increasing the safety of cell-based therapies should be appreciated."

To attain this goal we propose the following specific aims: 1) provide rigorous clinical research methodological training for 20 promising young physicians in cerebrovascular neurology and rehabilitation medicine - with the long-term goal of developing a cadre of physician clinician scientists who will conduct independent research on the epidemiology and etiology of cerebrovascular diseases and eventually develop and lead independent research programs in Peru; 2) fund mentored clinical research projects for these 20 Peruvian trainees to provide practical experiences in clinical research and obtain pilot data for future grant applications; and 3) build alliances between academic institutions and the Peruvian Ministry of Health to facilitate development and implementation of policy strategies to translate research findings into improved public health relevant to cerebrovascular disease. These specific aims will be addressed through a combination of short, medium and long-term training, with an emphasis on master's degree training at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) and the University of Washington (UW) and three-month Comprehensive training in epidemiologic research methods at the UW with practical experience in stroke management and rehabilitation medicine. We also propose short training workshops in cerebrovascular and chronic diseases epidemiology, manuscript and grant preparation, and responsible conduct of research; mentor training courses will be held concomitantly with workshops. The greatest strengths of this proposed training program are the successful collaborations of prior UW/UPCH training programs in Peru; world- renowned clinical researchers, neuroepidemiologists, and stroke experts in Seattle and Peru who will serve as mentors; and well-developed study sites in Peru. The vast network of Peruvian colleagues trained through prior Fogarty-funded training programs provides an outstanding opportunity to leverage existing research and training expertise to expand capacity to address the increasing burden of chronic diseases, specifically cerebrovascular disease, in Peru."
"9391119","PROJECT DESCRIPTION: This U01 proposal is intended to investigate the pathobiology of radiation- induced vascular endothelial cell (EC) injury and elucidate the mechanisms responsible for its attenuation by human ghrelin. Radiological incidents can cause severe and widespread organ damage, of which endothelial injury is a key component. We have demonstrated that ghrelin administration starting at 24 h after total body irradiation (TBI) doubled the survival rate of rodents exposed to TBI. Ghrelin attenuated endothelial activation and leakage in the lungs of irradiated mice and in irradiated human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) monolayers. For the first time, we discovered pyroptosis, a new mechanism of cell death, in the lungs of mice exposed to TBI and in irradiated HUVECs. Serum levels of the novel inflammatory mediator cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) were elevated in TBI mice and reduced by ghrelin. When exposed to recombinant murine CIRP, mouse lung vascular ECs underwent pyroptosis associated with NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and NAD(P)H oxidase activation. Ghrelin also decreased radiation- induced production of reactive oxygen species in HUVECs. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that ghrelin mitigates radiation-induced endothelial injury by inhibiting CIRP-mediated EC pyroptosis. We will determine ghrelin?s beneficial effects on endothelial integrity after irradiation, examine ghrelin?s effects on radiation-induced EC pyroptosis and the role of CIRP, and evaluate the long-term effects of ghrelin treatment on radiation-induced EC injury in mice after TBI. These proposed studies will further confirm ghrelin?s beneficial effects on radiation injury to vascular ECs and establish CIRP-induced EC pyroptosis as a novel mechanism of radiation-induced injury. This information will support the preclinical and clinical development of human ghrelin towards its FDA approval as a novel and effective radiation medical countermeasure."

"9374858","ABSTRACT Activation induced deaminase (AID) is essential for both immunoglobulin (Ig) somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) in mature B cells. AID deaminates dC to dU. Using the base excision repair (BER) pathway, many (but not all) AID induced dU bases can be excised by a uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) leaving an abasic site that can then be replicated over by error prone polymerase to produce both transition and transversion mutations. Genetic studies show that UNG deficiency in mice and humans leads to loss of class switch recombination (CSR) and impaired somatic hypermutation (SHM). U:G mismatches are also substrates for mismatch repair (MMR) MSH2/MSH6 binding which in turn recruit the MutL? homologues, PMS2-MLH1. PMS2 nicks the DNA and contributes to the induction of double strand breaks in switch regions, the AID targets during CSR. Although MSH2/MSH6 are critical for the induction of A/T mutations, PMS2-MLH1 are not active in SHM. This raises the intriguing question of which nuclease contributes the critical nick to initiate A/T mutagenesis during SHM. There are four uracil DNA glycosylases, UNG, SMUG1, TDG, and methyl binding domain 4 (MBD4), that are capable of recognizing and removing dU in U:G mismatches. Evidence indicates that TDG cannot substitute for UNG and SMUG1 plays little natural role in these processes since it is poorly expressed in activated B cells. MBD4 protein was originally discovered by virtue of its interaction with MLH1. We were intrigued by the functional association of MBD4 and AID in the context of active DNA demethylation in zebrafish. However, previous studies indicated no phenotype with regard to CSR and SHM in Mbd4 deficient mice. Based on our observation of alternative Mbd4 splice variants with open reading frames which could enable expression of the C-terminal end of MBD4 even when 5'-Mbd4 is deleted, we constructed CH12 cells and mice deleted 3'- Mbd4. Strikingly we found in new studies that CSR was significantly impaired in 3'-Mbd4 deficient CH12 cells. Furthermore, SHM was essentially abolished in 3'-Mbd4 deficient mice. We are currently characterizing 3'-Mbd4 deficient mice with respect to CSR and SHM. We propose to construct a new mouse that expresses a catalytically dead MBD4 to definitively determine the role of this uracil glycosylase in SHM, CSR and cancer."
"9268095","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     ABSTRACT Mitochondrial diseases manifesting as encephalopathies occur at a rate of 1 in 5000 live births and are often fatal by ~5 years old. Mitochondrial diseases are respiratory chain disorders in which the mitochondria are no longer operating efficiently to produce ATP, usually due to a problem with one or more components of the electron transport chain (ETC). Fortunately, genetic sequencing has identified a large number of the mutations in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA which cause these encephalomyopathies. However, in most cases there is still no clear metabolic link between the genetic defect and the neuropathology, and very few effective treatments. The innovative studies described in this proposal are expected to reveal a novel metabolic link between reduced ETC activity and neural pathology. Previously, we have detected a new post-translational modification of proteins, S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC), which is formed by reaction of the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate with reactive cysteine residues in protein. Both fumarate and succination of proteins are increased in adipocytes in diabetes, disturbing protein function and turnover. The increase in fumarate develops as a result of excess fuel supply, accumulation of NADH, and feedback inhibition of the Krebs cycle. In a novel, lateral extension of these observations we propose that a similar inhibition of the ETC, e.g. in Complex I deficiency during Leigh Syndrome, would result in increased NADH, fumarate and succination in mitochondrial disease.  In Preliminary Studies, we demonstrate that increased succination of proteins is detectable on several proteins in the brainstem of a mouse model of Leigh syndrome (Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mouse) in association with neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that mitochondrial stress results in the accumulation of fumarate and that succination alters protein structure or function contributing to disease pathology. We will confirm this in Specific Aim 1. We have identified several succinated targets already and we plan to mechanistically address how succination of these leads to further reductions in mitochondrial function in Specific Aim 2. In Specific Aim 3 we will use a molecular strategy to distinguish the bioenergetic defect from protein succination and investigate therapeutic strategies designed to reduce fumarate and succination leading to improvements in mitochondrial function and the disease phenotype. Overall, these foundational studies will demonstrate that succination is a mechanistic link between mitochondrial stress and neuropathology, with important implications for the elucidation of novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases."

"9328936","Abstract/Project Summary The Ras homologous (Rho) proteins comprise a major branch of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. My studies are focused on RhoA. Since RhoA shares significant structural and biochemical identities with the Ras oncoproteins, early studies addressed the possibility that RhoA may also function as an oncogene and drive cancer growth. Since RhoA regulates the actin cytoskeleton, cell migration and motility, and cell cycle progression, it seems logical that aberrant RhoA function can indeed impact the biology of cancer cells. Supporting an oncogene role for RhoA, early studies designed activated mutants of RhoA based on the cancer-associated mutants found in Ras. These studies in rodent fibroblast models made observations that supported mutant RhoA function in cancer. Therefore, it was disappointing when early cancer genome sequencing studies failed to identify RHOA mutations in the most common cancer types. This changed in 2014 when sequencing studies of T cell lymphomas and gastric cancers found recurrent missense mutations in RHOA. However, the mutations found were unexpected and suggested that loss rather than gain of RhoA function was responsible for driving the growth of these cancer types. My studies will address this apparent paradox in the field: is it a gain or loss of function in RhoA that is important to drive cancer? I propose comprehensive biochemical and cellular evaluation of the cancer-associated RhoA mutants to complete three aims to (1) determine the biochemical defect caused by cancer-associated mutations in RhoA; (2) evaluate the cellular activities of these RhoA mutants to assess gain or loss of function; and (3) determine if different RhoA mutants can drive cancer-associated growth phenotypes. In summary, my studies will provide a better mechanistic understanding of how aberrant RhoA function may drive cancer growth, an important first step to guide the development of pharmacologic approaches for the treatment of RHOA-mutant cancers. Furthermore, these studies will expose me to a wide variety of techniques and instruments and will enhance my development as a cancer researcher."
"9274367","Five years after its formation, the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute (NC TraCS), has become the integrated, campus-wide home for clinical and translational research at UNC. The overall goal of this U54 Cooperative Agreement application is to combine the research strengths, resources and opportunities at UNC and new partner, RTI International (RTI), to build on the foundation established in the CTSA's last five years. NC TraCS will work to improve human health by accelerating clinical and translational research from health science discovery to dissemination to patients and communities. NC TraCS will strive to overcome the well-documented barriers to the effective, sustained translation of research discovery along the translational research continuum by improving efficiency, training a research workforce and exporting successful, validated methods developed in NC TraCS to other CTSA institutions and the public. The proposed CTSA will specifically (1) amplify a thriving CTSA program to the point that it supports the full spectrum of clinical and translational research; (2) leverage CTSA resources and institutional strengths to create a critical, sustained focus on three strategic initiatives: (a) next-generation technologies to transform the very nature of clinical research and practice, (b) new paradigms and resources to accelerate drug development, and (c) robust comparative effectiveness research studies to provide definitive evidence of the benefits and harms of tests and treatments; and (3) train, support and incentivize the next generation of clinical and translational science researchers. These goals will be accomplished by three resources, six services, integrated and streamlined from the original 11, and the three strategic initiatives.  UNC and RTI now have a unique set of research and training resources to support the full range of clinical and translational research, from basic science to clinical application to policy change. NC TraCS will leverage the opportunity of this CTSA application to garner >$60 million dollars in matching institutional support to extend our capabilities to meet the three aims. In partnership with RTI, NC TraCS will take advantage of the resources it has created and nourished during the past five years to quickly and effectively bring the fruits of research to patients across the state, as well as nationally through the CTSA Consortium. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Researchers, clinicians and health policy experts have long lamented the well-documented lag between basic science discoveries and when those discoveries reach patients to treat them and make their lives better. The proposed UNC-RTI partnership in cooperation with the CTSA Consortium will help to ensure that patients will more quickly and effectively benefit from the results of biomedical research."
"9375761","Project Summary  One mission of the NIH is to ??better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent?? autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. All of these diseases are currently managed by broadly immunosuppressing drugs. The objective of this proposal is to develop an effective method for delivering components of an antigen-specific treatment that tolerizes both dendritic cells (DC) and T cells in situ without the requirement for ex vivo manipulation of patient immune cells. For this, the major animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS) will be used. MS in both people and rodents is an autoimmune disease caused by abnormal T cells that, having escaped thymic deletion, destroy the myelin sheath, and eventually the neuronal axons, of motor neurons. The mouse model is called experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and is inducible by injection of animals with components of the CNS, especially myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and its most antigenic epitope, MOG35-55. EAE has excellent kinetics for providing access to the cells that initiate the disease.  Our strategy is to develop injectable biomaterial scaffolds that act in the subdermal layer to attract and tolerize DCs and then release tolerogenic DCs to restrain the ongoing autoimmunity in the host. This goal will be achieved by using our fabricated biocompatible alginate scaffold that is porous, injectable, and can release granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor for recruiting a large number of DCs. To program the recruited DCs inside the scaffold, we will fabricate polymeric nanoparticles carrying 2-(1?H-indole-3?-carbonyl)- thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE), which is an endogenous ligand of the intracellular aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) of DCs and T cells. ITE is known to induce tolerogenic DCs and regulatory T cell expansion. We will attempt to make this process antigen-specific by incorporating MOG35-55 peptide, which should be taken up and presented by the DCs to MOG-reactive T cells in the periphery. This interaction in turn should lead to anergy or deletion of the pathogenic T cells and conversion of nave CD4+ T cells to regulatory T cells. Our scaffolds incorporating polymeric nanoparticles will be tested in induced EAE models. In this manner we will determine if and when DC tolerizing occurs in the scaffolds, where the released DC travel, and if and how the process quells ongoing autoimmunity in the host."
"9260700","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease that causes microvascular and neurologic complications and affects 20-30% of Veterans. Evidence supports a link between DM and hearing loss. A growing body of evidence-including from our own laboratory-suggests that DM-related harmful effects alter the cochlea, auditory nerve, and brain, impacting auditory processing at peripheral, central, and cognitive levels. Because ofthe documented adverse effects of hearing loss on an individual's social, emotional and economic well-being, the insidious nature of even a mild peripheral hearing loss when combined with central and cognitive declines,and the potential for dual sensory loss of vision and hearing in this population, it is important that the pathophysiologic and histopathologic mechanisms of DM-related auditory senescence be revealed.          Like most previous studies considering hearing loss and DM, initial findings originating from the NCRAR were established in cross-sectional studies. Our published results support the notion that DM effects are more notable in a younger population, reminiscent of changes from presbycusis among non-diabetics who are much older, and among Veterans with more severe disease, requiring insulin (Austin et al 2009; Konrad-Martin et al., 2010). However, historically, we did not address progression in auditory dysfunction over time, or how these hearing changes impact speech understanding or quality of life. We are currently in the last year of a 4-year longitudinal study of auditory function among Veterans with and without DM, some of whom were first seen in our DM studies 5-17 years ago, thereby providing additional longitudinal contrasts. Like many cohort studies, this longitudinal study becomes more valuable the longer the observation is continued.          We propose to continue longitudinal surveillance in this valuable cohort of Veterans with DM-related     auditory and cognitive changes and to augment findings with a longitudinal assessment of DM-related auditory senescence in a mouse model of type 2 DM. Proposed research aims to more precisely determine the longitudinal changes from DM compared to changes from aging alone in humans and mice, including estimating effect sizes and the age of onset of key measures of auditory and cognitive dysfunction. We introduce measures of temporal processing in both species because of its importance for speech understanding in humans and because, in animal models, impaired temporal processing at neural and behavioral levels has been linked to peripheral-auditory changes that may occur prematurely with DM.          Specific Aim (1) Benchmark longitudinal changes in auditory function among Veterans with type 2 DM and estimate the differences from normal aging. Specific Aim (2) Determine the extent to which type 2 DM exacerbates presbycusis in the mouse cochlea. Specific Aim (3) Determine the DM characteristics and comorbidities that are risk factors for auditory dysfunction in Veterans.          We expect results to demonstrate that DM precedes and contributes to declines over time in peripheral,     central-auditory and cognitive processing among Veterans, although the temporal trajectory of the DM effects will vary across individuals. Since some DM comorbidities can be mitigated by strict metabolic control, if premature deterioration of the auditory pathway can be shown to associate strongly with DM severity, there exists a potential mechanism for prevention that can be tested in a future clinical trial. By studying longitudinal changes in auditory function in humans and mice together with longitudinal trends in DM, we will be better able to determine the biological causes of auditory dysfunction in this complex disease, and thus ways to prevent or delay the damage. Results will include prediction models that identify the likely longitudinal trajectory of key auditory measures for an individual given their DM risk factor profile. Appropriate intervention could potentially mitigate impairments of hearing and cognition, leading to improved quality of life for those with DM. Therefore, this study indisputably promotes the VA mission of improved health and well-being of our nation's Veterans."
"9321997","PROJECT SUMMARY  The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) or ?3D mammography? brings promise of improved sensitivity and specificity. Even as DBT undergoes rapid clinical adoption, this new imaging modality poses new challenges to radiologists due to many differences in image appearance compared to conventional mammography. Recent studies and clinical experience show the urgent need for improved training in DBT. These changes necessitate dedicated training for both radiology residents and board-certified radiologists. The currently accepted training paradigm (i.e., the ?one size fits all? approach) cannot effectively accommodate the individual needs of each radiologist-in-training. We propose to address this shortcoming.  This project seeks to develop a new paradigm of adaptive, computer-enhanced training in the interpretation of DBT. Using predictive algorithms similar to the recommendation systems of companies like Amazon and Netflix, our system will create a training environment tailored to the needs of each individual radiologist. We have shown that the radiologists-in-training do not make errors in a random manner; instead their error making demonstrates specific patterns. Even more importantly, those errors can be predicted from each individual?s previous interpretations. We propose to use machine learning-based user modeling as well as collaborative filtering algorithms to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. Then, we will adapt the training protocol to the individual needs of the trainee in order to accelerate the training and improve his/her diagnostic skills in the areas that need improvement. The aims are: (1) develop user models that predict the difficulty of a DBT case based its image features and trainee performance, (2) implement an educational system that presents training cases that focus on the unique needs of each individual, and (3) conduct a reader study to validate the improved effectiveness of the proposed adaptive system.  This has work has the following key innovations. We propose the first ever computer-aided education system for residents and radiologists that is adaptive and individualized. We leverage cutting edge concepts from the fields of user modeling and collaborative filtering, which our lab has introduced to the field of medical imaging. This work addresses training limitations for the newly adopted modality of DBT.  This research has very high clinical significance: Improving training in the interpretation of breast images will ensure the greatest benefit of breast cancer screening. The proposed work, while developing a fully functional DBT education system, will contribute to the foundation for a more general, new paradigm of improved individualized education that extends to other image interpretation tasks and imaging modalities. This work is a collaboration between computer vision and machine learning experts, breast imaging radiologists, director of Radiology residency, a biostatistician, and a human factors expert. Our technology will be disseminated through a partnership with IMAIOS, a leading provider of online radiology education."
"9274990","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The end stages of the cellular engulfment mechanisms phagocytosis and entosis, which mediate the uptake of exogenous substrates, and autophagy, which mediates the engulfment of intracellular substrates, involve lysosomal digestion of engulfed cargo and export of catabolites to the cytosol for use in biosynthesis. Despite the critical role of these pathways for the removal of targeted substrates, and the importance lysosome- mediated digestion for the actual clearance and recycling of engulfed material, little is known about how the lysosomal processing of engulfed cargo and export of degraded components is regulated. We have found that the mTORC1 protein kinase, a regulator of mRNA translation and autophagy, and the lipid kinase PIKfyve, are required for a program of phagosome fission that shrinks large lysosomal vacuoles as internalized cargo is degraded, which reminiscent of the recently described autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR) program that functions similarly during autophagy. Vacuole fission is associated with nutrient recovery that rescues engulfing cells from the effects of amino acid or glucose/pyruvate starvation, and reactivates mTORC1. Reactivated mTOR recruits specifically to large lysosomal vacuoles harboring degrading cells and controls their fission. The proposed research will identify amino acid and sugar transporters acting at lysosomes that mediate nutrient recovery and mTORC1 activation, and will identify mTOR and PIKfyve-regulated proteins that control the fission of lysosomal vacuoles."
"9397086","PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic malignancies result from dysregulated self-renewal pathways and an altered differentiation program. Traditional chemotherapy treatment is often used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) but approximately 30% of patients relapse within five years. Recent therapeutic approaches have focused on forcing leukemic cells to differentiate and in some cases have found great success. However, our understanding of the pathways that control differentiation is lacking. Despite the many studies focusing on genetic and epigenetic regulators in AML, there remains a gap in our understanding in how RNA transcripts are post-transcriptionally controlled. Recent discoveries from my sponsor's lab have found that mRNAs are subjected to the reversible base modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and this ?epitranscriptomic? regulation is a novel and potent regulator of many molecular processes including: transcript stability, mRNA splicing, and protein translation. Importantly, embryonic stem cells deficient in m6A remain pluripotent despite treatment with diverse stimuli that promote differentiation. On the other hand, more highly differentiated stem cells, such as primed stem cells, show enhanced and abnormal expression of differentiation markers upon depletion of m6A. These studies show that alterations in m6A levels can alter differentiation pathways. A major goal of this proposal is to test the innovative concept that m6A has critical roles in determining the differentiation of leukemia cells. My preliminary studies suggest that m6A ?writers? are highly expressed in myeloid leukemia cells and are required for maintaining leukemic cells in an undifferentiated state. Therefore, I hypothesize that aberrant m6A is a hallmark of leukemia and targeting the methylation machinery represents a new path forward for drug discovery. With the combined expertise of my sponsor and co-sponsor's laboratories I am ideally placed to address key questions to identify new differentiation-inducing strategies for AML: Is m6A necessary and sufficient for the development and progression of AML by controlling cellular differentiation? What mRNAs are aberrantly regulated by m6A in leukemia and how does m6A affect their function? Are there cellular pathways that are particularly susceptible to m6A levels? To address these questions I will (1) use established AML mouse models to define the functional requirement for m6A in leukemia formation and progression; and (2) uncover the m6A program that leads to leukemia by utilizing technological innovations developed in my sponsor's lab to generate nucleotide-level resolution of m6A in cells. I will create an m6A map in leukemia to identify leukemia-specific m6A sites and determine how m6A controls myeloid leukemia cell differentiation. Together, these experiments are poised to fundamentally alter how we view normal hematopoietic and leukemic differentiation and addresses whether m6A is a critical regulator of this process. These studies offer a new direction in the development of more effective differentiation-inducing therapies for AML. !"
"9279209","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Doxorubicin is a well-established and highly effective chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat multiple cancers such as lymphoma, leukemia, ovary, lung, and breast cancer, but its use is limited by cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity can range from asymptomatic reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction to highly symptomatic heart failure (Class III to IV). Acute doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) occurs in ~11% of patients and long-term cardiotoxic side effects, which can manifest up to 10 years after treatment, are observed in up to 36% of patients. Currently, we cannot predict which patients will develop cardiotoxicity. A major hurdle in filling the significant gaps in our knowledge about the mechanisms of DIC and how best to prevent it is the lack of good human models, due to the inaccessibility of patient-specific human cardiomyocyte samples, and the difficulty in isolating and maintaining human cardiomyocytes in vitro. Animal models are limited by significant functional disparities between animal and human cardiomyocytes. This hurdle has now been overcome by the recent advances in the generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in which a patient's somatic cells can be reprogrammed to pluripotency and maintained indefinitely in vitro. These iPSCs can then be efficiently differentiated into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and further studied in detail. In our preliminary studies, we have developed and validated a set of tools for assessing DIC in human iPSC-CMs. We have established that iPSC-CMs, derived from patients who have developed DIC, accurately recapitulate the susceptibility phenotype in vitro. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) studies have identified several SNPs that are predicted to be highly associated with DIC (P=10-9 to 10-5). Hence in Aim 1, we will generate iPSC lines from 100 cancer patients treated with doxorubicin, 50 of whom experienced cardiotoxicity and 50 did not. In Aim 2, we will use the assays established in our pilot studies to assess the susceptibility to DIC and perform RNA-seq and eQTL mapping to discover novel SNPs. In Aim 3, we will introduce a very well established DIC-related SNP into five control iPSC lines using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and assess the effect on DIC susceptibility. Hence the overall aim of this R01 proposal is to use patient-specific iPSC-CMs to help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of DIC."
"9335398","ABSTRACT  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder whose prevalence is increasing. Sleep apnea is a systemic disorder, with recurrent falls in oxygen (hypoxia) and reoxygenation (oxidative stress) affecting every tissue. Thus, sleep apnea is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (heart attack and stroke), hypertension, cognitive impairment and dementia, and cancer. However, there are major individual differences, with some individuals even with severe OSA not developing any of these consequences. While it has been known for two decades that OSA aggregates in families, no convincing gene variants conferring risk have been identified in human studies. This suggests that a new approach is required. The study we propose introduces the following new approaches: a) it will be conducted in mice as a model system. Mice have proven to be a powerful model system to identify gene variants for human disease; we will use the recently described Diversity Outbred strategy that identifies quantitative trait loci of the order of three genes. This requires high throughput phenotyping of large numbers of genetically heterogeneous mice in combination with genotyping by a universal mouse SNP chip; b) we will study key endophenotypes that confer risk to OSA?tongue fat and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. We will assess heritability of each of these traits and determine if tongue fat is a unique fat distribution; and c) we will assess the blood pressure response to cyclical intermittent hypoxia that simulates the pattern of deoxygenation/reoxygenation that occurs in patients with OSA. For all phenotypes assessed, functional assessment of genes identified will be performed. Thus, the study introduces an entirely novel approach to identifying gene variants and performing a functional assessment of genes for all phenotypes assessed. Large numbers of human samples with well phenotyped individuals are already in hand to translate findings from these mouse studies to humans, and in particular the phenotypes being assessed in these mouse studies are being assessed in a quantitative manner in the two human projects (Projects 01, 02). Sequencing of genes identified will be performed in the samples from the other projects in the Program Project Grant."
"9328589","PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) claims over 7 million lives each year ? more lives than all communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional disorders combined, and more than twice the number of deaths due to all cancers. For the past three decades, the standard treatment for CHD has been the deployment of a metal stent in the occluded artery to restore blood flow. In the US alone, over 1 million patients receive stents each year. However, the permanent and rigid nature of metal stents inhibits arterial vasomotion and induces serious complications such as Late Stent Thrombosis (LST). A promising new alternative to metal stents are Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVSs). Unlike permanent stents, BVSs are transient implants that provide support to the artery for the first 6 months, but completely dissolve in 2 years, leaving behind an artery capable of vasomotion with no incidence of LST. BVSs derive their transient nature from the material they are made of ? the semicrystalline polymer poly L-lactide (PLLA) that hydrolyses to L-lactic acid, a metabolic product processed by the body. The clinical success of BVSs provides an impetus to make them broadly applicable to the treatment of CHD. Current BVSs are nearly two times thicker (~150m) than metal stents (~80m) due to a disparity in strength between PLLA and metal alloys. Consequently, BVSs need to be much thicker to have the strength needed to hold the artery open. A thinner BVS is easier to implant and can access smaller and complex arterial lesions. Thus, there is a critical need to reduce the thickness of BVSs so that a broader patient population can benefit from transient vascular implants. At present, the manufacture of BVSs is largely based on trial-and-error because there is limited understanding on how to control the BVS?s microstructure, which is responsible for the BVS?s strength and clinical success. This proposal will develop novel methodology and instrumentation that offers precise control of the BVS?s microstructure to enhance strength in a thinner profile. The proposed instrumentation will be the first of its kind that can relate the evolving structure of BVSs during manufacture to the BVSs? bulk strength. The connection between structure and strength, the lack of which is an obstacle to progress in the BVS community, will enable the rational design of next generation BVSs to meet the evolving needs of cardiovascular disease."

"9410722","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT More than 30 years into the global HIV-1 epidemic, novel HIV-1 prevention strategies are still being sought. A challenge to the design of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is the lack of known natural correlates of protection from infection. A relevant model to identify such correlates is offered by individuals who remain seronegative despite repeated HIV-1 exposures (HIV-1-exposed seronegatives, HESN). Studies of HESN have uncovered evidence of potential immune correlates of protection from HIV-1 infection in the form of HIV-specific immune responses and reduced immune activation, or immune quiescence. However, the vast majority of these studies were focused on immunity within the peripheral blood rather than mucosal sites of initial virus entry and replication. Thus, we plan to use mucosal sampling of a novel cohort including male and female HESN from HIV- serodiscordant couples and HIV-unexposed (HUSN) men and women, combined with state-of-the-art immunological techniques, to identify novel mucosal immune mechanisms of protection from HIV-1.  Given our recent findings of an association of increased cervicovaginal HIV-neutralizing IgA and higher HIV- 1 exposure, we hypothesize that immune responses within the genital mucosa will be altered in HESN compared to HUSN. Thus, in Aim 1 we will examine local T cell responses in the genital mucosa of HESN compared to HUSN, and we expect to observe increased responses and retention of these immune cells in individuals with higher HIV-1 exposure. As we and others have shown that immune quiescence appears to offer protection from HIV-1 infection, we propose to examine both HIV-specific immunity as well as immune activation in HESN and HUSN longitudinally. In parallel, we will examine the stability of these local T cell responses in the genital tract upon PrEP initiation by HESN men and women, as we have evidence of higher magnitude mucosal immune responses in PrEP users. Finally, using previously archived samples from the nested Partners PrEP case-control study, we will in test whether the novel changes in immune signatures we identify are correlated with protection from HIV-1 infection. In Aim 2, following up on our finding of differential cervicovaginal HIV-neutralizing IgA in women with higher HIV-1 exposure and with PrEP use, we will examine mechanisms of local antibody-secreting cells within the genital tract of men and women following HIV-1 exposure and PrEP initiation. In sum, upon completion of our proposed studies, we will have a complete characterization of adaptive immune responses and activation in the male and female genital tracts and blood in HESN upon HIV-1 exposure, with measures of the changes that occur longitudinally upon PrEP treatment. These studies will potentially inform vaccine and other HIV prevention strategies though identification of immune correlates of protection, and will also address a critical need to better understand mechanisms of the human mucosal immune responses, as such work will enhance our knowledge of the immunopathology of and immune-mediated protection to a range of chronic and infectious diseases."
"9284528","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders."
"9273930","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adults with histories of childhood abuse are particularly vulnerable to the development of stress- related psychopathology in adulthood. Although much research has focused on long-term negative sequel of childhood abuse across the lifespan of the abused child, surprisingly little research has examined the impact of childhood abuse across generations or the mechanisms of its trans-generational impact. Research demonstrates that children of mothers who were abused in childhood are at increased risk for stress related psychological disorders in adulthood and that mothers living in stressful environments are at increased risk for child maltreatment, impaired parenting and psychological disorders. Given the elevated levels of environmental stressors for families living in low-income, urban environments, it is particularly critical that we delineate how trauma is transmitted across generations in these populations. In order to address this gap in the literature, we propose to collect data on 400 low-income, urban, African American mothers and their 9-12 year old offspring. We will gather data at baseline and at 9 and 18 months post baseline. The proposed research will focus on maternal affect and affect regulation, and on maternal parenting and maternal stress response biomarkers as intermediate phenotypes that may contribute to increased intergenerational risk in children of maltreated mothers. We will also examine the role of child exposure to trauma, neighborhood violence and stress. We anticipate that this research will contribute significantly to the development of empirically grounded intervention and prevention approaches aimed at increasing resilience and decreasing risk in this population."
"9309699","PROJECT SUMMARY This application probes the role of the myosin motor protein in aging and in progressive, genetically based diseases of skeletal and cardiac muscles. We will employ a multidisciplinary approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools available for Drosophila melanogaster along with a broad range of expertise that allows us to study myosin in an integrative manner, from its crystal structure and biochemical function through its effects upon muscle ultrastructure, fiber mechanical properties, cardiac physiology and locomotion. For Aim 1, we will examine the functional significance of specific residues within the skeletal muscle myosin motor and rod domains that are post-translationally modified during human aging. Using transgenic Drosophila, we will assess the effects of mutations at these sites on myosin ATPase activity, in vitro motility, thick filament formation and stability, indirect flight and jump muscle ultrastructure, fiber mechanics and organism locomotion. We will test the hypothesis that specific myosin amino acid residues that are subject to age-related post-translational modifications are critical for myosin's biochemical properties and structure and function of the myofibrillar apparatus. For Aim 2, we will examine how amino acid mutations associated with human age- related dilated cardiomyopathy affect the structure and biochemical properties of the myosin molecule, as well as the structure and physiological function of the Drosophila heart. We will gain mechanistic insights into protein structural features that are vital for cardiac myosin function using a unique in vivo method to produce mutant forms of the myosin protein for crystallography. Further, we will assess the power of the Drosophila system as a screening tool for identifying putative dilated cardiomyopathy myosin alleles defined in humans. This combined protein structural and in vivo screening approach will test the hypothesis that mutations that cause human dilated cardiomyopathy disrupt intramolecular communication leading to depressed myosin motor function, Drosophila cardiac dilation, heart wall thinning and reduced cardiac output. For Aim 3, we will define the roles of specific chaperone-affiliated proteins in inclusion body myopathy type 3, a progressive skeletal muscle disorder. Specific small heat shock proteins, a mitochondrial chaperone and an ubiquitin ligase anomalously accumulate in aggregates in our Drosophila model of this disease. Up- or down-regulating their expression, followed by structural and functional analyses of skeletal muscles, will yield insights into their roles in aging and in degenerative muscle disease. We will test the hypothesis that manipulating the levels of specific small heat shock proteins, a mitochondrial chaperone and an ubiquitin ligase can ameliorate or exacerbate progressive myosin-based myopathy phenotypes. Overall, our project will take advantage of an innovative experimental system to test significant questions regarding basic myosin function during aging of healthy and diseased skeletal and cardiac muscles."
"9275526","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanisms that lead to toxicity in neurodegenerative amyloid disease as well as the mechanisms that enable other amyloid fibrils to carry positive functions are some of the most important unsolved questions in amyloid biology. The long-term goal of our research is to understand what structurally distinguishes functional amyloids from disease causing amyloid and how amyloid fibril formation can act as a switch to control the native function of a protein. Towards this goal, we are working on Orb2 a functional amyloid that has been shown to be a key translation regulator important for long-term memory in Drosophila, but also has interesting similarities to huntingtin exon-1 (HDx1) important in Huntington's disease. The objective of this proposal is to determine a structural model of the Orb2 amyloid fibril and test the functional implications of this structure with mutations and functional assays. Our central hypothesis is that the N-terminus of Orb2A initiates amyloid core formation regulated by membrane interaction. The predominant isoform Orb2B, which has an N-terminus different from Orb2A, only forms fibrils when interacting with Orb2A. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims: In aim 1 we will determine a structural model of the Orb2A amyloid fibril core. We will use cloning, solid-state NMR, and EPR experiments to identify the core of the Orb2A amyloid fibril and determine a structural model of this core using solid-state NMR and EPR spectroscopy. In aim 2 we will map Orb2B's amyloid core and interface with Orb2A. We will measure solid-state NMR and EPR experiments on Orb2B alone and mixed Orb2A and Orb2B aggregates that will map the Orb2A-Orb2B binding interface and characterize the structure of the amyloid fibril formed by the two Orb2 isoforms. In aim 3 we will determine the function of Orb2A-membrane interaction. We will test our hypothesis that membrane interaction is a regulator of amyloid formation and function by determining how Orb2A interacts with membranes of different lipid compositions and to which extend it forms amyloid under these conditions. We will also characterize the structure of the membrane bound form. All these structural studies will be accompanied by functional assays in which we test mutants derived from our structural findings as well as lipid compositions found in aim 3 for their ability to regulate Orb2 dependent protein translation. This contribution will be significant since it will bea major step towards understanding how amyloids can function as a molecular switch in translation regulation and will advance our knowledge of the structure and formation of glutamine-rich amyloids. The proposed research is innovative because we will combine solid-state NMR and EPR experiments to determine a structural model of an amyloid fibril. Furthermore, by choosing a functional amyloid that resembles the domain structure of HDx1 we will advance our understanding of what structurally distinguishes toxic from functional amyloids."
"9460905","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mediator, a large (25 polypeptides, MW ~1 MDa) multi-protein complex conserved throughout eukaryotes is the key coactivator responsible for conveying regulatory signals to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) during transcription initiation. Mediator has essentially no enzymatic activity and it is generally agreed that its mechanism must be based on modulation of molecular interactions and conformational rearrangements. Therefore, a structural understanding of Mediator and its interaction with RNAPII is essential to elucidate how Mediator's role during initiation ultimately influences cell differentiation, development, and homeostasis. Macromolecular electron microscopy (EM) is the technique of choice for characterization of large, dynamic macromolecular assemblies because it is uniquely suited to provide information about their structure, conformational changes, and interactions. EM studies of Mediator supported by this grant have set the stage to achieve a molecular understanding of the complex and here we describe further EM, biochemical, and functional analyses of yeast and human Mediators that build on our previous work and will provide a detailed understanding of the structure, subunit organization, and regulation of Mediator conformation and interactions, and reveal the mechanism of regulation by Mediator across eukaryotes.  In Aim 1 we will pursue EM analysis of yeast Mediator (yMED) at subnanometer resolution and investigate subunit interfaces critical for yMED assembly, conformational variability, and function. In Aim 2 we will study how different factors control Mediator conformation and interactions to modulate RNAPII engagement and transcription initiation, and obtain detailed structural information about the Mediator-RNAPII holoenzyme. In Aim 3 we will leverage the experience gained from EM analysis of yMED to pursue EM studies of the structure, subunit organization, and interactions of human Mediator (hMED). Parallel analysis of yeast and human Mediators will reveal fundamental aspects of the regulation mechanism related to structural conservation of Mediator across eukaryotes, while highlight aspects of regulation specific to the more intricate human complex.  Our results will provide a molecular understanding of the way in which Mediator enables regulation of transcription initiation, and help us understand the direct connection between dysregulation of gene expression and oncogenesis. The work we propose continues our strategy of combining structural analysis with biochemical and functional studies, and will depend critically on 1) application of novel EM image analysis approaches developed in collaboration with the group of Pawel Penczek (UT Houston) specifically tailored to study the structure of dynamic complexes; 2) a strong, ongoing collaboration with the group led by Joan and Ron Conaway (Stowers Institute), leaders in biochemical and functional studies of human Mediator."
"9312890","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this project is to investigate the etiology of cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with phenylketonuria (PKU), one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism detected through neonatal screening. Many adolescents and adults with PKU struggle with adherence to recommended dietary therapy. Chronic hyperphenylalaninemia is frequently associated with anxiety, depression, and impaired executive function such as difficulties with concentration and short-term memory. Deficiencies of the monoamine neurotransmitters, dopamine and serotonin, in brain have been implicated as probable proximal causes of neurobehavioral difficulties in PKU. In our recent work with the Pahenu2 mouse, a model of human PKU that exhibits both a memory deficit and anxiety, we have found that brain dopamine content is relatively undisturbed but that serotonin is severely deficient in untreated adult mice. The most likely mechanism causing brain serotonin deficiency in Pahenu2 mice is phenylalanine-mediated competitive inhibition of TPH activity leading to impaired serotonin synthesis. Correction of hyperphenylalaninemia following administration of either a phenylalanine restricted diet or liver-directed gene therapy leads to increased brain serotonin content and improved anxiety behaviors but no change in memory. These outcomes are similar to those seen in adult humans with PKU who were late treated and suffered irreversible damage to the brain early in life prior to the initiation of dietary therapy. Our hypotheses are that anxiety in hyperphenylalaninemic mice is caused by CNS serotonin deficiency but that the memory deficit is a result of other more permanent abnormalities of brain development resulting from long standing hyperphenylalaninemia beginning in infancy. In the first aim of our project, we will continue to explore the relationship between brain serotonin and anxiety in Pahenu2/enu2 mice and to evaluate novel therapeutic approaches directed at this complication. In the second aim of our project, we will develop and characterize a novel model of PKU, more analogous to the status of contemporary adults with PKU who were detected by newborn screening, received dietary treatment early in life, but subsequently lost dietary control, by treating Pahenu2/enu2 neonates with recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL, Pegvaliase?) to control blood phenylalanine throughout infancy and into adulthood. We will compare behavioral outcomes, neuropathology and neurochemistry between PAL-treated and untreated Pahenu2/enu2 mice and furthermore will study the consequences of remerging hyperphenylalaninemia upon discontinuation of PAL treatment. We propose that PAL-treated Pahenu2/enu2 mice will more effectively model the current status of contemporary PKU treatment and will provide novel insights into the nature of PKU- associated neurocognitive deficits."
"9282460","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The topology and spatial organization of DNA in cells is essential to its function and is tightly regulated by proteins. Two prominent features of protei-mediated structure are DNA loops and the formation of condensed DNA. Looping allows protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions over large genomic distances. An example of protein-mediated DNA looping is the telomere structure. Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that cap the ends of linear chromosomes. Human telomeric DNA can be arranged into DNA T-loops as large as thousands of base pairs. Only static snapshots of T-loop formation are known. TRF1 and TRF2 are essential proteins associated with the loop formation, but their precise role and function in the dynamics of T-loop formation remains unclear.  Nuclear DNA exists in an intrinsically crowded environment containing a very high volume fraction of DNA and proteins. Generally there is a hierarchy of domains of order, and thus the traditional crowding model may not fully capture the influence of the environment.  To improve understanding of the looping process, we propose to study time-resolved DNA looping at the single-molecule level by confining DNA and proteins to nanofluidic volume. We argue that this confinement mimics certain aspects of the nuclear environment that are not reproduced by crowding in small molecules. We will use nanochannel-confined telomeric DNA to observe the dynamic actions of TRF1 and TRF2, and form an operational model of how the telomeric loop forms. The same will be performed for the model enzyme T4 ligase. All experiments use dynamic single molecules in real time.  To establish the role of confinement in loop formation, we will apply high-resolution AFM imaging to derive the  static conformations of T4 ligase, TRF1 and TRF2 mediated DNA loops formed inside nanochannels and that formed in free solution. Comparison with DNA loops formed by the model system, T4 DNA ligase, will aid in the interpretation of looping mechanisms mediated through TRF1/TRF2.  In the last study, we will align independent DNA strands parallel or perpendicular to each other in nanochannel junctions, and follow the actions in real time using fluorescence imaging to measure the capture rate by ligase and TRF1/TRF2 as DNA molecules are scanned past each other. We anticipate that moving molecules in parallel past each other increases DNA-DNA capture when compared to mere point contacts.  The results are essential for advancing our understanding of telomere biology, the influence of geometric constraints on the utilization of nuclear DNA, and physics of confined stiff biopolymers in general."

The objective of this research training program is to prepare biomedical and clinician scientists for independent investigative careers in academic nephrology and basic renal sciences. A priority of this training program is to ensure that its trainees acquire an in-depth education and expertise that combines the study of renal physiology or pathophysiology and the development of skills in one or more areas of basic or applied sciences. This training program is now comprised of 30 Full Faculty members and 3 Associate Faculty members grouped into 8 units. The scope of this program is wide enough to afford the trainee an appreciation and understanding of the breadth of academic nephrology. Its depth is sufficient to provide rigorous training in the major disciplines of nephrology. The postdoctoral training program is available to MD graduates who have commenced or have completed training in clinical nephrology as well as postdoctoral biomedical scientists. In this renewal, we propose to continuing training three (3) postdoctoral students per year. The duration of training is a minimum of two and preferably three years. The first year of training is supported by this training grant; an effort is being made to obtain alternate sources o funding to support the second and third year of training if possible in order to increase the number of candidates that benefit from this training grant and to provide trainees experience in writing grant proposals. This Training Program benefits from close interactions of its Faculty with the Mayo Graduate School (MGS), of which many are full members with Teaching Privileges. The MGS also serves as an excellent pool of potential trainees. Based on estimates of the recruitment pool in the MGS (23 current PhD students in the Physiology & Biomedical Engineering (BME) Graduate Program, with 10 conducting research in areas relevant to renal physiology and disease; 31 current Ph.D. students in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BMB) Graduate Program, with 5 conducting research in renal physiology and disease) there are ample potential and qualified applicants. A stated goal of the Mayo Nephrology Training Program during this cycle is to increase interactions with the PhD programs in the Mayo Graduate School. These programs attract talented and qualified students, including a rich pool of minorities. These recent graduates will be ideal candidates who were attracted to and are familiar with the rich translational nature of research at Mayo. The faculty of this training grantis organized into 8 training units. Twenty-one faculty members are from the Nephrology Research Unit and/or the Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, 1 from the Transplant Center, and 11 are from other clinical or basic science departments engaged in nephrology related research. These faculty members have been carefully selected because of their skills in basic or applied sciences and because their interests overlap with those of the Nephrology and Hypertension faculty members in each of the research units. All of the faculty members have a strong commitment to the training of the next generation of biomedical and clinician scientists. Thirty-one of the 33 members are NIH funded while the remaining six have other sources of funding. Given the breadth of research interests of key faculty members, we will also strive to appoint trainees such that no faculty member will serve as a primary mentor for more than two trainees in the 5-year funding period."

"9331248","Abstract Neuroinflammation is a key central nervous system (CNS) response that protects the brain following injury, trauma, and infection; however, chronic neuroinflammation is recognized as a pathologic manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Multiple Sclerosis. The inflammatory process is well characterized in cells of the immune system but less is known about how CNS cells can initiate inflammation. Neurons and glia are resident cells in the CNS that have been reported to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. Among CNS cells, astrocytes have emerged as mediators of inflammation resulting from infection and injury where they release various chemokines and cytokines important in recruiting and activating peripheral immune cells. This creates an important interface in which astrocytes detecting pathologies initiated within the CNS can then in turn modulate the progression of inflammation in both the CNS and potentially in the systemic immune system. Ongoing studies in our laboratory indicate that mice ingesting the disease-associated metabolic neurotoxin rotenone have elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL6) observable in brain extracts. IL6 is an important inflammatory mediator whose levels are elevated in association with multiple neurodegenerative disorders. Astrocytes have been reported to secrete IL6 in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1b (IL1b); however, we do not yet know whether astrocytes are the cellular origin of IL6 observed following rotenone exposure. The JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway is activated by IL6 and was recently reported to comprise a feed-forward autocrine loop in glial tumor cells. If such a mechanism existed in pro-inflammatory astrocytes it would be of great interest since self-perpetuating neuroinflammation is posited to contribute to normal aging and the progression of chronic neurologic disorders of the elderly. A major component of the training program will be the execution of molecular biology studies to test the prediction that astrocytes are the cellular origin of IL6 induced by disease- associated neurotoxin exposure in primary cultures. In these studies, we will determine if the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway is activated by neurotoxins, and if once established, this pathway can be sustained in an IL6-dependent manner following cessation of exposure. In our second aim, we will use histologic and biochemical techniques to determine if the IL6/JAK/STAT pathway is activated and sustained in mice initially exposed to the disease-associated pesticide rotenone and determine if treatment with a pharmacologic inhibitor of JAK/STAT can normalize IL6 levels in mice during and following rotenone exposure. Understanding the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of IL6 induction in astrocytes and in CNS cells subjected to neurotoxic stress may identify new pathways of interest for detecting and treating neuroinflammation occurring in association with normal aging and disease.

"9482900","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this investigation is to improve understanding of the effects of children's direct exposure to 9/11 and future mental health disorders, substance use or abuse and other risky behaviors as they now enter into adolescence and emerging adulthood. Based on the behavioral development literature, our city-wide assessment of children 6 months after 9/11 and the numerous findings of post- 9/11 consequences amidst exposed adults, there is strong evidence to suggest that exposure to 9/11 early in life would increase directly exposed children's vulnerability within the domains of interet in this investigation. Unfortunately, to date, the science-base of post-disaster behavioral consequences for youth, including those who were 9/11 exposed as children, lacks a longitudinal assessment, that includes in-depth measurement of the multiple, complex relevant domains, from type and severity of exposure to well-defined behavioral outcomes and intrapersonal, familial, academic and environmental factors. The proposed study will assess 1,000 children directly exposed to 9/11 at ages 0-12 and currently ages 12- 24, drawn from the World Trade Center Health Registry (WTCHR) Pediatric sample, who will be compared to unexposed Controls (N=500). The study involves a synergistic collaboration between the Child Psychiatric Epidemiology Group (CPEG) at Columbia University-Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene and the WTCHR.

The Native EH Equity approach, also for the first time, provides an integrative understanding of the generalizability of risk and resilience factors across multiple tribes - Navajo Nation, Crow Nation, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (CRST) - to improve both our understanding of these relationships, and our ability to develop and prioritize evidence-based risk reduction and prevention strategies. The focus of Native EH Equity will be to develop common data sets that for the first time will standardize our approach to assessing these variables across multiple tribes.  Achieving these goals requires a strong administrative structure to ensure consistency across all components of the Center, to ensure parallel data are collected from each of the partner tribes, and that data are managed in a structure that ensures integration and allows comparative analyses. The Administrative Core (AC) for Native EH Equity brings decades of experience working with Tribal communities, leadership, and agencies; of managing and analyzing large and complex datasets; of oversight of career development programs; of integrative analyses allowing replication of findings with multiple levels of data; and of successful translation of results to enhance understanding in communities, among researchers, to federal agencies, and to health care providers. The goal of the Administrative Core (AC) is to facilitate responsible management, resource allocation, integration and communication within the team; to foster successful career development for new investigators; to provide and manage pilot funding; and long-term to develop sustainable partnerships integrated within the institutional and tribal structures to ensure sustainability of research on Native Environmental Health Equity."
"9276820","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), the most common inherited muscular dystrophy, leads to progressive muscle weakness and death by the third decade of life. A conundrum is that the mouse model that has the same genetic defect, absence of dystrophin, does not mimic the human disease, which has limited the development of efficacious therapies. Recently, we hypothesized that telomere length differences between mice and humans could account for this discrepancy and developed a mouse model that lacks dystrophin and has shortened telomeres (mdx/mTRKO ). This model exhibits all of the major pathological hallmarks of human DMD. In particular, the mdx/mTRKO mice exhibit impaired regeneration and progressive muscle wasting due to functional defects in their muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Here we address a major challenge: MuSCs are known to be functionally heterogeneous, but the nature of their diversity has yet to be characterized which is essential for targeting therapies. We propose to capitalize on two groundbreaking technologies developed in our laboratories to elucidate the defects in the signaling networks that underlie the dysfunctional MuSC subsets in a manner previously not possible. To this end we will use novel (1) state-of-the-art single cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) and (2) artificial bioengineered stem cell niches. The CyTOF is uniquely suited to identify dysfunctional MuSC subsets. Using new parameters identified by CyTOF, we will purify these subsets and in conjunction with our biomimetic hydrogel microwell platform perform single-cell fate mapping. The combination of highly multivariate single cell CyTOF analyses and real time single cell time-lapse imaging will reveal dysfunctional signaling profiles and behaviors within subsets of stem cells. Defects in signaling pathways identified in specific MuSC subsets in the mouse model will be validated in MuSCs isolated from human DMD patient samples. These subsets and pathways can then be targeted, leading to novel therapeutic strategies that will enhance muscle fiber repair in DMD patients."
"9390628","Choline phospholipid metabolism is profoundly altered in cancer. While a lot of research has been devoted toward elucidating the molecular origins of elevated phosphocholine (PC) in cancer, little attention has been paid to the oncometabolite glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and its underlying molecular biology. High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have shown that GPC is higher than PC in normal breast epithelial cells, whereas PC is higher than GPC in breast cancer cells. This finding is known as ?GPC to PC switch? in the choline metabolite profile upon malignant transformation. To date, the genes and specific enzymes responsible for the cancer-related alterations in GPC are unknown. The changes in cellular GPC levels could occur through glycerophosphocholine-phosphodiesterase (GPC-PDE) or lysophospholipase (LPL). By combining HR MRS with gene silencing strategies, we have observed that silencing of GDPD5 and GDPD6, both of which are GPC-PDEs, significantly increased the GPC levels in breast cancer cells, while reducing their proliferation, migration, and invasion. Chemotherapy treatment of breast cancer cells with doxorubicin resulted in down-modulation of the choline cycle genes choline kinase alpha (Chk?), phospholipase D1 (PLD1), and GDPD6, thereby resulting in a net increase of GPC and a decrease in PC along with a significant inhibition of proliferation. These preliminary data clearly point towards an important role of GDPD5 and GDPD6 in breast cancer cell aggressiveness and treatment response to chemotherapy. Our new preliminary data with three different commonly used FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents indicate that there is value in exploring GPC as an additional biomarker of treatment response independent of PC, which, of course, would be in addition to other valuable imaging biomarkers. We will also investigate the reciprocal interactions between oncogenic signaling pathways and GPC-regulating enzymes that are critical for tumor maintenance and progression. The proposed research will provide novel insight into the molecular regulation of the oncometabolite GPC in breast cancer, and will help understand its role in cancer progression. Our findings will provide the foundation for interpreting GPC levels detected by noninvasive 1H and 31P MRS as an additional complementary biomarker of transformation, staging, and response to therapy. GPC or critical GPC- regulating enzymes may also be useful biomarkers of transformation, staging, and response to therapy in biopsied tissue samples ex vivo. The enzymes studied in this proposal, e.g. GDPD5 and GDPD6, may prove useful as anticancer targets, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy treatment of breast cancer."
"9300756","ABSTRACT Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest cancers with a 5-year survival rate of 7%. Notable racial/ethnic differences in PC incidence have been observed, with U.S. blacks having 30% higher rates compared to whites. The rates of PC in Native Hawaiians and Japanese Americans have been rising in past two decades and have surpassed those of whites, but no study has been conducted to identify the cause(s) of this rising incidence. In the large prospective Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC; N>200,000) we observed highly significant differences in PC incidence across racial/ethnic populations, with African Americans having 39% higher rates compared to whites. Native Hawaiians are observed to have the highest rates in the cohort that are 74% higher than whites while rates in Japanese Americans are 32% higher and rates in Latinos are similar to whites. We expect that inter-ethnic differences in risk factor prevalence are likely to explain the observed ethnic differences in PC incidence. However, to date, few studies have included African Americans and no studies have included Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, or Latinos; thus, the factors underlying PC disparities remain undefined. The goal of this study is to identify factors that explain racial/ethnic disparities in PC incidence, particularly the excess risks observed in African Americans, Japanese Americans, and Native Hawaiians. We hypothesize that in addition to known risk factors, host genetic factors and unknown non-genetic factors contribute to the observed racial/ethnic differences in PC incidence. To test our hypothesis, we will leverage the well-characterized lifestyle and genetic data of the MEC, a long-standing ethnically diverse prospective cohort of >200,000 African American, Latino, Native Hawaiian, Japanese and white participants established in the early 1990's in California and Hawaii. The MEC is uniquely positioned to address racial/ethnic disparities in PC incidence, with >2,100 incident cases of PC diagnosed over >20-years of follow-up and with detailed lifestyle and exposure data collected in a consistent fashion amongst all populations to permit valid ethnic comparisons. Our specific aims are: 1) To quantify racial/ethnic-specific associations of known and potential/suspected risk factors with PC incidence in African Americans, Japanese Americans, Latinos, Native Hawaiians, and whites; 2) To determine whether the risk factors confirmed or discovered in Aim 1 contribute to the observed ethnic differences in PC incidence; 3) To characterize the association of known common genetic variants with PC risk in African Americans, Japanese Americans, Latinos, and Native Hawaiians and build a quantitative risk model to compare the distribution of genetic risks across populations associated with these marker alleles. By leveraging the existing resources/infrastructure, this study will efficiently and cost-effectively examine multiple factors that may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in PC. Because of the lack of effective treatment and low survivorship, identifying modifiable risk factors is critical in reducing PC burden; this is even more crucial for minority populations who are at greater risk and are likely to have limited access to care."
"9326410","This application is for a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) entitled ?Degradation of The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) by FBXO10 ? A Novel Mechanism in Lung Epithelial Cell Injury?. I am a physician in pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. I am applying for this award to acquire advanced training in molecular physiology and cell biology, as well as new training in translational research methods and regulatory science, to develop my career as a physician scientist focused on the study of Acute Lung Injury. The main objective of my proposal is to determine how a novel RAGE degradation pathway in lung epithelial cells modulates severe lung injury. RAGE is a cell membrane receptor enriched in lung epithelia, and contributes to epithelial cell injury by weakening attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and amplifying inflammatory signals in response to circulating ligands encountered in excessive inflammatory conditions such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Our preliminary data indicate that RAGE is degraded in lung epithelial cells in a mechanism dependent on the post-translational modification of ubiquitination. Furthermore, we have preliminarily identified a novel ubiquitin-transferring subunit termed FBXO10 responsible for targeting RAGE for degradation, and also show that RAGE is degraded in response to a ligand elevated in ARDS, CpG DNA. The aims of this study are: 1.) To determine if RAGE is ubiquitinated and degraded in lung epithelial cells by the E3-Ligase subunit FBXO10, and 2.) To determine the mechanism and biologic effect of RAGE degradation in pulmonary epithelial cells. These studies will provide insight into a novel pathologic model whereby RAGE degradation, regulated by FBXO10 mediated protein ubiquitination, controls epithelial cell detachment and excessive inflammation. FBXO10 mediated ubiquitination and degradation of RAGE may contribute to the histopathologic phenotype of ?diffuse alveolar damage? characteristic of ARDS by promoting epithelial cell detachment from the ECM. Thus, modulating RAGE degradation may be a novel strategy to render epithelial cells more resistant to injury and contribute to an unmet need in novel ARDS therapies. This project will provide me advanced skills in molecular physiology and cell biology, and I will be trained in translational research methodologies and regulatory science to strengthen my development into an independent investigator. My work will be completed within the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, which is dedicated to the development of physician scientists. I have committed mentoring from our Division Chief Dr. Rama Mallampalli as well as a PhD cosponsor in Dr. Bill Chen. Additionally, my mentoring committee includes Dr. Janet Lee, MD ? an expert in innate immunity and host defense, and Dr. Bryan McVerry ? a translational scientist and member of the Acute Lung Injury Center of Excellence in charge of the clinical ALI program."
"9281023","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a unique multi-scale mathematical model that will provide quantitative information regarding mechanisms governing nitric oxide (NO) activity in the microcirculation and to utilize innovative, real-time experiments to validate the model. The model will integrate intracellular NO production processes with extracellular, vascular and tissue transport, including the coupling of NO to O2 delivery and metabolism under normal conditions and in hypercholesterolemia. The model will help to elucidate mechanisms by which NO is produced and transported and provide greater insight into its vasodilatory role.  While the importance of nitric oxide (NO) in regulating blood flow and metabolism is well established, many of the mechanisms by which NO is produced and transported have not been fully elucidated. Importantly, the various phenomena that can potentially affect the bioavailability of NO and vascular dynamics interact over a range of time and length scales. A mathematical model that transcends different spatial and time scales, coupled with in vitro and in vivo experiments, is required for understanding of system behavior.  Mathematical Modeling: The development philosophy is to sequentially couple lower scale with higher scale simulation: cell-scale to vessel-scale, to vascular networks. Predictions of the simulation will be validated using our experiments and results reported in the literature.  In vitr: A parallel plate laminar flow chamber, designed and constructed previously, which -- for the first time and only by our group -- enables direct, real time measurements of the kinetics of NO release under a wide range of conditions will be used for cell culture studies. The coupled effects of shear stress and altered mass transport of signaling molecules on flow- induced NO production will be investigated to isolate how they influence NO production and transport. Results will be compared with the simulations.  In vivo: Experiments will be performed using the rat mesentery and apolipoprotein-E deficient mice. Local blood flow, PO2 and NO, combined with vessel diameter measurements, will be obtained from individual small arteries, arterioles, venules, and small veins under normal and abnormal physiological conditions to characterize relationships among vascular diameter, NO, blood flow, and O2 delivery. The effect of nitrite as an NO source from O2-dependent nitrite reductase activity in blood and tissue under hypoxic conditions will also be evaluated. The proposed model will lead to an improved understanding of the complete system, and set the groundwork for future research that can shed light on NO-related pathologies."
"9353226","Intergenerational Influences on Family Formation Processes  This project will significantly advance the scientific understanding of key factors shaping family formation processes---both marriage/cohabitation and fertility---in recent cohorts by (A) designing and assessing new data that will create comparable family formation measures across the two primary data sources available for tracking family change in the US, and (B) providing reliable empirical answers to two high-priority research questions. The first question considers how the associations between parental SES and children's family formation outcomes vary across cohorts and racial groups in response to key changes in economic conditions. The second question asks the extent to which children's own early-life cognitive and socio-emotional abilities determine their family formation outcomes in young adulthood. Answers to these questions will substantially advance our understanding of change and variation in family formation and will also facilitate the design of policies and programs to help Americans' achieve their family formation goals.  The processes of family formation---the formation of sexual and co-residential relationships, marriage, pregnancy, and childbearing---are among the most influential experiences of adult life, with wide-ranging consequences for the health and wellbeing of families and children. The US National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) documents trends, but it does not provide the longitudinal design required to document long-term associations from childhood to adulthood or across multiple generations. By contrast, because it features years of repeated measures in many domains across the life courses of grandparents, parents, and their children, the PSID and its Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS) are unparalleled resources for advancing family formation research. We propose to significantly enhance the value of the TAS for the study of family formation by revising the TAS measures to create direct comparability with NSFG, facilitating comparisons between the nation's monitoring study and the nation's most valuable longitudinal study of multiple cohorts. The result will be a tremendously valuable public good for family formation research, which will also allow us to answer the scientific questions we propose to investigate.  We will demonstrate the high scientific and policy significance of this advance with the two analyses we propose, one creating innovative new insights into changes in intergenerational influences on family formation process across cohorts and the other significantly advancing our understanding of the long-term consequences of children's early-life skills and abilities on their early-adult family formation behaviors. Finally, by integrating this project within the P01 proposal, we will coordinate analyses across projects and build key results from Research Project 3 into the analyses for this project, significantly expanding the scope of both bodies of work."
"9315872","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop a validated multiscale modeling methodology for quantifying the biophysical characteristics of sickle cell disease (SCD) -- a hematological disorder that affects tens of thousands of people in US with one in every 500 African-American births resulting in a child with SCD. The pathogenesis of SCD results from (1) irregular red blood cell (RBC) shapes due to hemoglobin polymerization inside the RBCs; (2) stiffening of the RBC membrane; and (3) adhesion of sickle RBCs to the endothelium and the other blood cells. The combination of these phenomena results in vaso-occlusive events or crises responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality associated with SCD but little is certain about the proximal causes or the circumstances in which they occur. The spatio-temporal scales involved in accurately modeling SCD blood flow and vaso-occlusion span at least four orders of magnitude, hence new numerical methods are needed to simulate such multiscale phenomena. We present a general methodology based on 3D dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) to model flow and soft matter seamlessly, i.e., RBCs and other blood cells, blood plasma, cytosol, hemoglobin polymerization, and adhesive dynamics. DPD can be interfaced with molecular dynamics (MD) and with continuum-based description (e.g. Navier-Stokes) based on the triple-decker algorithm we have developed in order to capture molecular details or for computational efficiency in simulating large arteries or networks, respectively. We adopt the same approach here that has proven very effective in our previous work on malaria, namely that models for single RBCs (healthy or sickled), informed and validated from comprehensive single-cell measurements, will be used to predict the collective dynamics and rheology of SCD blood flow. We also present a systematic experimental plan, using microfluidics, nanomechanics and advanced optical techniques, to validate the various stages of the development of our models by targeting individual scales as well as interactions between scales. We will extend the first generation of models to study different modalities of existing and experimental therapeutic interventions for SCD, including simple transfusion, fetal hemoglobin (HbF) induction by hydroxyurea, and RBC hydration. Predictability of multiscale models requires quantifying uncertainty, and, to this end, we will incorporate polynomial chaos methods to model and propagate parametric uncertainties through the multiscale system. We plan to disseminate our models, software tools, and experimental data including the general-purpose triple-decker algorithm, via web-based repositories, existing public open-ware sites, tutorials and through the MSM consortium."
"9281926","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Periventricular heterotopia (PH) is one of the relatively common malformations of cortical development (MCD) characterized by the abnormal presence of gray matter nodules along the lateral ventricle and late-onset intractable epilepsy. Mutations in the X-linked filamin A (FLNA) gene, which encodes an actin binding protein, are known to be the leading genetic cause of PH. Despite extensive cell molecular studies of filamin A in the past three decades, the developmental mechanism underlying FLNA's role in cerebral cortical neurogenesis and neuronal migration, as well as the pathogenesis of PH, remains elusive. This proposal presents a set of approaches to establish an experimental system to allow FLNA's function in cerebral cortical development to be tested directly. Towards this goal, we generated a mouse model of PH by conditionally eliminating filamin A (Flna) in the developing cortex together with its closely related family member filamin B (Flnb). Preliminary analyses showed that this mouse model recapitulated almost all anatomical features of PH caused by human FLNA mutations. Our developmental studies using this PH model suggested a previously unrecognized role of FLNA in maintaining the structure and organization of neural progenitor domains and the neurogenic niche of neuronal fate restricted intermediate neural progenitors (INPs). Loss of this function leads the mislocalization and extraneous neurogenesis of INPs along the brain ventricles. The three specific aims of this proposal will validate these findings and further investigate the molecular developmental programs governed by filamin by 1) further characterizing anatomical features of the mouse PH brain, 2) determining the developmental processes disrupted by filamin mutations, and 3) identifying the cell molecular functions of filamin in normal and pathological formation of the cerebral cortex. The completion of these aims will not only reveal the pathogenesis of PH, but also provide important insights into mechanisms through which the neurogenic potential may be enhanced in the developing brain. Results from these studies are thus expected to guide the development of neural stem cell based therapies for a wide variety of developmental brain disorders."

"9279170","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial pathogenicity and ability to survive in adverse conditions depends on bacterial stress response. This proposal aims at a structural understanding of two bacterial stress- response processes, in which stalled non-translating ribosomes are being sensed: 1) stringent response, which is mediated by stringent factor RelA; and 2) rescue of stalled ribosomes by a peptidyl- tRNA hydrolase YaeJ. Bacteria adapt to insufficient nutritional conditions via a mechanism termed the stringent response. One of the consequences of nutrient deprivation is amino acid starvation, which may lead to more than a 5-fold increase in cellular levels of uncharged (deacylated) tRNAs. Deacylated tRNAs cannot participate in protein synthesis but can bind to ribosomes, which are in a paused translational state due to insufficient levels of aminoacylated tRNAs. Such stalled ribosomes are thought to interact with RelA and initiate the stringent response. RelA is an 84 kDa enzyme, which, upon binding to stalled ribosomes, catalyzes the synthesis of the small molecule alarmones ppGpp and pppGpp. These molecules trigger the stringent response by initiating a global gene expression program. The molecular mechanism of the RelA-mediated stringent response is poorly understood. First, the binding site for RelA on the ribosome has not been identified. Second, it is not known how the presence of deacylated tRNAs on the ribosome triggers the (p)ppGpp-synthesizing activity of RelA. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to address these questions by obtaining structural and dynamics information on 70S*RelA ribosome complexes. In addition to nutrient-deprivation conditions, other cellular conditions exist that result in mRNA degradation or modification, interfere with aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the A site, tRNA translocation or other steps of translation elongation. This leads to the stalling of translating ribosomes. In this stalled state, peptidyl-tRNA is stably bound to the ribosomal P site, and the ribosome is not available for initiation of translation on a new mRNA. Because ribosome synthesis requires large amounts of cell resources, it is essential that non-translating ribosomes be recycled and not degraded. To rescue such ribosomes, the incomplete protein chains and tRNAs have to be released from the ribosomes. At least two mechanisms exist, namely the well-characterized tmRNA-assisted ribosome rescue and a recently proposed YaeJ-mediated peptide release. YaeJ is a 16 kDa protein that is hypothesized to directly catalyze peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis on the ribosome in a codon-independent manner. Our Specific Aim 2 is designed to address mechanistic questions concerning YaeJ-mediated response to ribosome stalling. The proposed aims will be accomplished by structural and biochemical methods."
"9292052","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurobiological science has established that the first three years of life lay the basis for lifelong outcomes. But during this life-cycle stage children living in poverty are often vulnerable to negative influences including malnutrition, illnesses, an un-stimulating environments, possibly preventing them from reaching their full potential and perpetuating poverty across generations. Small-scale studies have demonstrated that offering stimulation and nutrition to young children can have positive effects on short and long-term outcomes, such as cognition, self-esteem, depression and other important measures. However it has not yet been demonstrated that these interventions can be scaled-up to form the basis of sustainable and effective policy towards child development. The project will introduce a stimulation program, coupled with micronutrient supplementation, to improve interactions between mothers and their young children with the aim of achieving better child outcomes. The program will follow a systematic weekly curriculum based on the natural developmental stages of the child. It will be implemented in rural communities of Odisha in India, an area where poverty and malnutrition are prevalent. It will be delivered by women from within the communities, which will have been trained for this purpose, in the following forms: (i) weekly individual home visits to the child and its main caregiver/mother, or (ii) in a suitably modified way, within the context of weekly main caregiver/mother and child group meetings. The intervention will be accompanied by an evaluation based on a randomized control trial with five variants including a control group. Data will be collected on child developmental outcomes and detailed maternal- and household-level data before the start, halfway through and at the end of the intervention. Having local women deliver the intervention is key to designing low-cost and sustainable policies. The formation of groups could further reduce costs and enhance the dissemination of good child rearing practices. The aim is to test for effectiveness and to understand the pathways through which these interventions achieve their outcomes. As such the project relates directly to the NIH mission of applying knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness. The research will be disseminated through presentations at academic conferences, to policy makers and stakeholders at specially designed meetings and will form the basis for submission to top peer-reviewed Journals such as the Lancet and the American Economic Review. Results will be posted on a dedicated website."
"9280942","SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (AC)  The integrated approach described in the UNM Center for Native Environmental Health Equity (Native EH  Equity) will for the first time address, across multiple tribes, disparities in social determinants of health, and  tribal cultural and traditional practices with the potential to provide resilience to reduce the effects of  environmental disparities on the health of Native Americans. The Native EH Equity approach, also for the  first time, provides an integrative understanding of the generalizability of risk and resilience factors across  multiple tribes ? Navajo Nation, Crow Nation, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (CRST) - to improve both  our understanding of these relationships, and our ability to develop and prioritize evidence-based risk  reduction and prevention strategies. The focus of Native EH Equity will be to develop common data sets  that for the first time will standardize our approach to assessing these variables across multiple tribes.  Achieving these goals requires a strong administrative structure to ensure consistency across all  components of the Center, to ensure parallel data are collected from each of the partner tribes, and that  data are managed in a structure that ensures integration and allows comparative analyses. The  Administrative Core (AC) for Native EH Equity brings decades of experience working with Tribal  communities, leadership, and agencies; of managing and analyzing large and complex datasets; of  oversight of career development programs; of integrative analyses allowing replication of findings with  multiple levels of data; and of successful translation of results to enhance understanding in communities,  among researchers, to federal agencies, and to health care providers. The goal of the Administrative Core  (AC) is to facilitate responsible management, resource allocation, integration and communication within the  team; to foster successful career development for new investigators; to provide and manage pilot funding;  and long-term to develop sustainable partnerships integrated within the institutional and tribal structures to  ensure sustainability of research on Native Environmental Health Equity."
"9280946","SUMMARY- PILOT PROJECT PROGRAM  The Pilot Program will emphasize high quality research that promotes collaboration between the  Center and the partner communities, and the development of new investigators as they strive to  establish independent research programs in environmental health disparities research. The  program is designed to not only increase research capacity of the young investigators at the  partner institutions to engage with the local communities in the course of their research projects,  but to also foster the career mentorship of Native faculty, and allow non-Native faculty to  participate in and build team-science partnerships to address environmental health disparities in  Native communities. The Pilot Project will serve as an additional bridge between the Center  administration and the partner institutions as projects are developed, implemented and reported  at the annual meeting; and as a nexus for mentorship of junior researchers by providing a  structure and support for the development of a competitive research proposal through grant  writing trainings offered through the Career Development Plan of the Administrative Core.  Coordinated by the Administrative Core, the Pilot Program will encourage active participation of  Center partners to develop a sustained, powerful influence on the Center?s mission and theme  during years 3 through 5. The UNM Health Sciences Center will commit an additional funding  for pilots initiated by UNM Center investigators throughout years 1-5. It is anticipated that initial  Center pilot projects will promote the validation of models of tribal health developed through the  initial interactions of the Community Engagement Core and the Environmental Monitoring and  Interpretation Core. Successful implementation of the PP will ultimately expand research in  environmental health disparities through development of new extramural projects based on  research findings obtained through the Pilot Program mechanism. Therefore, the Pilot Program  is a key component of the overall integrative nature of the Center and important for sustainability  of the Center?s goals and objectives."
"9280944","Summary-Research Project 2  The high concentration of abandoned mine waste and rural nature of Tribal communities often brings  community members into direct and frequent contact with low-level metal mixtures from un-remediated and  abandoned mine sites, resulting in potentially toxic exposures occurring via inhalation, drinking water, and  ingestion of food sources that are either directly or indirectly contaminated by wastes. The objective of  research project 2 (RP2) is to assess the relationship of metal exposures (determined through biomonitoring of  blood and urine samples) with immunologic outcomes in individuals from Tribal communities who live in  proximity to legacy mine waste. This objective responds directly to concerns of the Tribal communities that  chronic exposure to metal and metalloid mixtures affects immune responses and contributes to development of  disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that there is an increased body burden of metals due to environmental  exposure to mixed metal contaminants within the Tribal communities, and that this exposure results in immune  dysregulation and autoimmune responses. We will 1) Determine whether exposure to metals or metal  mixtures (measured through biomonitoring) increases the prevalence of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and/or  lymphocyte apoptosis in individuals from our three affected Tribal communities. 2) Determine whether  exposure to metals or metals mixtures are associated with predictable changes in cytokine profiles or T and B  cell phenotypes in individuals from our three Tribal populations and 3) Determine the effect of metal mixtures  relevant to our three participating Tribal communities on exacerbation or induction of autoimmune disease and  immune dysregulation via a drinking water exposure in in vivo animal models. A fundamental question  addressed by these studies is whether certain combinations of environmental metal have independent,  additive, or even synergistic toxic effects. Tribal communities are disproportionately exposed to a variety of  heavy metals and metalloids, yet there are no population-based studies investigating the effect of mixed metals  exposure on immune responses, especially across different Tribal communities with exposures to  environmental metals. We have the unique opportunity to use the same research approaches on three different  Native American Tribal populations to clearly identify commonalities and differences in exposures and  exposure outcomes. A major goal and innovation of this study is the development of a common database with  data from three Tribal communities (with planned expansion to other communities) on exposure and resulting  immunologic parameters that have never been compiled. This data will be crucial to establishing  commonalities and overlaps in exposures and health outcomes in these communities for which such significant  health disparities exist."
"9327541","PROJECT SUMMARY Exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) is a painful condition characterized by rapid-onset muscle cell necrosis and subsequent leakage of intracellular contents into the systemic circulation in response to exercise. Genetic fac- tors are especially important in pediatric patients, military recruits, and athletes with recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis; however, approximately half of these cases fail to receive a definitive diagnosis, leading to a lack of targeted therapy. A deeper understanding of the possible etiologies of recurrent ER (RER) will provide useful insight into its pathophysiology, which could eventually translate to the refinement of treatment and pre- vention strategies. The domestic horse is uniquely suited to serving as a naturally occurring model for exer- tional muscle disease. RER has a major impact on health in Thoroughbred (TB) and Standardbred (STB) horses, with many of the same clinical signs and risk factors as in human patients. There is strong evidence for a genetic component conferring RER susceptibility in both breeds; however, the specific genetic variants con- tributing to this susceptibility are currently unknown. Results from in vitro contracture tests are suggestive of a defect in muscle contractility in RER-susceptible horses that is physiologically and biochemically distinct from known forms of malignant hyperthermia. Therefore, the hypothesis driving this project is that RER in TB and STB horses is caused by functional genetic variants affecting the regulation of skeletal muscle contractility. Preliminary genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified seven chromosomal loci significantly associated with RER. The goal of this project is to expand on these preliminary analyses and identify the ge- netic variants underlying RER skeletal muscle dysfunction through the following specific aims: 1, Identification of candidate genes for RER susceptibility; and 2, Identification of putative causal variants for RER. In aim 1 candidate genes for RER susceptibility will be determined via GWAS and prioritized using computational methods that capitalize on knowledge of rhabdomyolysis pathophysiology for humans and other species. In aim 2, analysis of whole genome sequence will be employed to identify potentially functional alleles within these candidate genes that occur at higher frequency in RER cases than controls. High-priority variants will be used to create a custom genotyping assay to genotype our entire GWAS cohort as well as independent valida- tion cohorts to identify the true functional variants. The proposed work is expected to identify genes of moder- ate to major effect contributing to RER susceptibility and will pave the way for future studies focused on as- sessment of the physiologic function of causative variants. Results from this project are expected to advance overall understanding of altered muscle contractility and RER pathophysiology and therefore lead to the even- tual improvement of prevention and treatment regimes."
"9344650","Project Summary The interplay between cellular adhesion and cellular signaling is essential for the development of all organs such as the brain, and for the functioning of systems such as the immune and nervous systems. Adhesion G- Protein Coupled Receptors (aGPCRs) are an understudied GPCR family that is thought to mediate intercellular communication. They have emerging roles in multiple cellular functions and numerous human diseases including neurological disorders and cancers. Unlike other GPCRs, aGPCRs have large extracellular regions (ECR) that are autoproteolytically cleaved from their seven-pass transmembrane regions (TM) within a conserved GPCR-Autoproteolysis INducing (GAIN) domain. The two fragments stay associated even after cleavage. It is believed that ligand binding to the ECR causes shedding of the ECR, and exposure of a short peptide that was previously hidden within the GAIN domain. This short peptide, called stachel, acts as a tethered agonist and activates the transmembrane domain. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying aGPCR activation remains poorly understood. The ultimate goal of the research proposed in this application is to understand the stepwise mechanical details of aGPCR activation that start with adhesion of the ligand to the ECR, continue with transduction of the adhesion signal from the ECR to the TM domain via the GAIN domain, and end with the activation of the TM domain by the stachel peptide. We propose three Specific Aims that are based on the major unknowns in these fundamentals steps for aGPCR activation: First, we aim to reveal if and how extracellular adhesion starts signaling. Second, we aim to understand the role of the GAIN domain in transducing the adhesion signal to the TM domain. Third, we aim to reveal the molecular details of aGPCR TM domain activation by the stachel peptide. This research has a multi-disciplinary approach where the structural and functional data performed in the PI's lab are complemented with electron microscopy, agonist/antagonist generation via protein engineering, neuronal assays and G-protein expertise provided or performed by the laboratories of close collaborators. The proposed experiments will build on exciting results obtained since we started our lab, including the establishment of a robust in vitro signaling assay, the crystal structure of a ligand- aGPCR complex, the engineering of a synthetic protein that inhibits an aGPCR function, and key advances in the purification protocols of aGPCRs. We expect that this research will provide critical insights into the mechanistic details of the aGPCR activation, helping to establish fundamental principles on intercellular communication that are vital for numerous cellular functions."
"9278254","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Phosphorylated metabolites of phosphatidylinositol, called phosphoinositides, play major constitutive and regulatory roles in a wide variety of physiological processes. Their generation and interconversions, via phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the 3, 4 and 5 position of the inositol ring, are mediated by a large number of kinases and phosphatases. An especially important enzyme for this metabolism is phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type IIIa (PI4KIIIa), as this protein is responsible for the generatin of the bulk of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) at the plasma membrane. This PI4P pool is a key determinant of plasma membrane identity and the precursor of the majority of cellular PI (4, 5) P2 and thus also its downstream metabolites, such as PI (3, 4, 5) P3, DAG and IP3. Thus, the function of PI4KIIIa impacts numerous fundamental processes, including exo-endocytosis, actin dynamics, transport of ions and other substances across the plasma membrane, signal transduction and regulation of the cell cycle. PI4KIIIa is part of a protein complex conserved from yeast to humans. The kinase PI4KIIIa itself (expressed by a single gene in all species) is essential for cell life, whereas defects in accessory factors (EFR3, TTC7 and FAM126, all three encoded by a pair of genes in mammals) have been implicated in human diseases. The fundamental importance of the PI4KIIIa complex for cellular physiology together with its emerging connections to pathological conditions argues forcefully for the need to understand its structure and function. We will use a comprehensive approach that combines cell biology, structural biology and biochemistry to investigate the function and regulation of the PI4KIIIa complex at molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. In Aim 1, to obtain mechanistic insights as to how the PI4KIIIa accessory factors target the kinase to the PM and regulate its activity there, we will investigate the molecular architecture of the PI4KIIIa complex. We will obtain crystal structures for complex components or their subassemblies and then piece together the entire complex from these, making use of biochemical and electron microscopy (EM) information. Structures for EFR3, TTC7 and a TTC7/FAM126 subassembly already available from preliminary work, together with biochemical and cell-based experiments, define the molecular mechanism for PI4KIIIa recruitment to the PM. They further suggest a mechanism for regulating complex assembly that we will investigate, along with the roles of the accessory factors in modulating the catalytic activity of PI4KIIIa. Aim 2 is complementary, with biochemistry and imaging studies of these proteins in cell extracts and living cells (mouse and human derived cells) to determine the dynamics of the complex and of its subunits in their natural context in mammalian organisms. In this aim, we will test our hypotheses that depletion of these subunits causes a defect in plasma membrane PI4P synthesis, and, further, that this defect underlies disease pathogenesis in humans."
"9384273","Abstract Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the most successful human pathogen, causing 1.8 million deaths in 2015. Accumulating evidence suggests that Mtb?s ability to survive, persist and cause disease is largely due to its ability to subvert the host immune and antimicrobial response to infection. Recent advances in immunometabolism have shown that a metabolic shift to glycolysis, aka the Warburg effect, is critical for the activation and differentiation of lymphocytes, dendritic cell maturation, and for M1 macrophage polarization, which is associated with microbial killing and effective control of infection. However, little is known about the metabolic state of immune cells during Mtb infection and its role in TB pathogenesis. Using transcriptomics and fluorescent IHC-assisted imaging, we found evidence for metabolic remodeling consistent with the Warburg effect during Mtb infection of macrophages ex vivo, as well as during Mtb infection in mouse, rabbit and human lungs. More intriguingly, we observed that infected macrophages at the center of granulomas showed decreased Warburg effect state compared to those at the periphery, suggesting that Mtb perturbs host cell metabolic switch to impair their pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial functions. Based on these and other data in the literature, we hypothesize that Mtb perturbs the Warburg effect to dampen APC polarization and function, compromising pro- inflammatory and antimicrobial functions of adaptive immunity and dampening macrophage activation, thus favoring the survival and persistence of the pathogen. To test our hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims. First, we will determine the correlation between the Warburg effect state and macrophage polarization, activation and differentiation of T cells in granulomas in rabbit models of pulmonary active TB and latent infection, using fluorescent IHC- and single molecule RNA-FISH (smFISH)-based imaging. We will also perform metabolomic analysis of regions of granulomas at different stages of the differentiation and maturation. Second, we will perturb the Warburg effect by commercially validated therapeutic small molecule compounds and siRNA knockdown and analyze the effects of this perturbation on the effector functions of innate and adaptive immune cells ex vivo and in a mouse model of pulmonary TB in vivo. Third, we will use RNA-Seq and IHC- and smFISH-based imaging to dissect the metabolic/Warburg effect determinants responsible for the establishment of latency and for the reactivation. We will also characterize the effects of Warburg effect perturbation by small molecule therapeutic compounds on the host immune response and Mtb growth dynamics in a rabbit latency model. By elucidating the correlation between the Warburg effect and the functional potential of host innate and adaptive immunity in TB and its association with infection outcome, this study will establish an understanding of a novel aspect of Mtb pathogenicity. Outcomes of this study may lead to the development of host-directed therapies to target metabolism of immune cells to enhance their antimicrobial responses, facilitating efforts to control and eradicate this deadly disease.!"

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposal describes a five-year training program for development of a research career in cardiovascular disease, particular in the field of vascular biology and inflammation. The candidate, Dr. Yogendra Kanthi, is a physician-scientist with focused interest in venous disease. The primary mentor (D. Pinsky, vascular biology) and an advisory committee of highly successful, translational scientists with complementary expertise in platelets/thrombosis (M. Holinstat), cardiovascular fluids/biomechanics (D. Michele and S. Takayama) have been assembled to provide the candidate with guidance in career development and investigation. The research environment provides extensive resources, core facilities, and content expertise in a collaborative setting. The career development plan includes didactic courses and seminars. There is an immersive research program designed for the candidate to develop both preliminary data and the requisite skillset in experimental study design, grant writing, and knowledge to transition to independent investigator status, with his own laboratory and R01 funding. In patients who fail medical management of atherosclerotic vascular disease, revascularization by surgical bypass grafts initially restores tissue blood flow. However, the most commonly used autologous human vein bypass grafts carry a disproportionately higher rate of failure than arterial bypass grafts (10-30% per year), characterized by adverse remodeling and stenosis. Vein grafts transplanted into an arterial tree are exposed to arterial patterns of pulsatile distention uncharacteristic of typical venous mechanical stresses which alter vein graft phenotype. The overriding hypothesis of this proposal is that cyclic stretching of vein grafts by pulsatile distension from arterialization promotes venous endothelial inflammation leading to excessive vascular remodeling and obstructive lesions, unless curbed by endogenous mechanisms that suppress vascular inflammation. One potential such mechanism is through endothelial CD39, an enzyme that dissipates extracellular nucleotide danger signals (purines) which are potent activators of inflammation and thrombosis. We recently discovered that CD39 expression is induced by laminar fluid shear stresses and is a potent suppressor of atherogenesis. However, whether CD39 expression responds to another significant biomechanical stimulus- cyclic stretching of the endothelium as seen in vein grafts- is not yet defined. My preliminary data supports the overriding hypothesis that CD39 expression is induced by cyclic stretch as seen in vein graft arterialization. The Specific Aims of the proposal are to: 1) Define the response of arterial and venous endothelial CD39 to varying degrees of cyclic stretch simulating arterialization of vein grafts; 2) Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CD39 expression is induced by cyclic stretch with a focus on molecular mechanotransducers interacting with the CD39 promoter; and 3) Define the impact of vascular CD39 in mitigating stretch-induced endothelial dysfunction and accelerated intimal hyperplasia in a murine arterialized vein graft model. The goal of this proposal is to define the role of CD39 in suppressing cyclic stretch-induced venous endothelial stress to enhance our understanding of purinergic signaling in vein graft distention and remodeling. The potential impact of this proposal will be to advance our approaches to improve vein graft patency by leveraging endogenous protective mechanisms and to enhance the career development of a dedication physician-scientist."
"9382149","SUMMARY Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with higher risks of a dozen or more serious health complications. Unfortunately, antibiotic treatment is only effective for temporarily alleviation of BV. Microbiological and biochemical signatures of BV have been studied at length in relation to the `healthy' vaginal microbiome dominated by lactobacilli. However, little is known about the metabolism of many fastidious vaginal bacteria, how the metabolism of carbohydrates may drive bacterial growth, or how metabolic function of different bacteria may drive the compositions of bacterial communities and the physiology of the vagina. Such gaps in our understanding prevent the development of rational strategies to deter BV bacteria and encourage lactobacilli in the vagina. This proposal uses new experimental models of human vaginal community dynamics with the overarching goal of defining the carbohydrate preferences of vaginal bacteria. By measuring the growth and metabolic output of bacteria in mono-culture, and within ex vivo vaginal microbial communities, our broader objective is to develop conditions that specifically discourage BV bacteria and favor lactobacilli. In three specific aims, this proposal will use a combination of tools in microbiology and biochemistry together with genomics and proteomics to investigate the carbohydrate preferences of vaginal bacteria and potential mechanisms that can change in the composition and metabolism of vaginal communities. Glycogen is one example of an abundant potential source of carbohydrates in the vagina. As a polymer of glucose, glycogen is believed to be a carbon source for `healthy' lactobacilli. However, this interpretation has been based largely on correlative data rather than experimental investigation of the metabolic behaviors of vaginal bacteria. We present evidence that glycogen metabolism can fuel the outgrowth of specific BV bacteria and can lead to depletion of glycogen in culture. In Aim 1, we will examine which bacteria found in the vagina can employ amylases to metabolize glycogen, and we will define the relevant biochemical activities and identities of glycogen-cleaving enzymes. In Aim 2, we will investigate the larger role of glycogen metabolism for vaginal community dynamics, testing the hypothesis that glycogen supports the growth of bacteria in cultured BV communities, and that the inhibition of glycogen metabolism limits the expansion of BV-associated bacterial communities. Finally, in Aim 3, we will comprehensively investigate the carbohydrate preferences of vaginal bacteria, with particular emphasis on selectively promoting the growth and metabolism of lactobacilli. The successful completion of these aims will have an important positive impact on this field by establishing mechanistic insights about how BV bacteria utilize potential carbohydrate carbon sources available in the vagina. Furthermore, successful completion of these studies will lead to important insights about how to use the carbohydrate preferences of beneficial lactobacilli to promote their growth in the vagina, modulating carbohydrate metabolism for the treatment of BV."
"9278283","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Patients with congenital heart disease frequently exhibit increased pulmonary blood flow (PBF) that leads to altered respiratory mechanics, respiratory distress and poor growth. Although it has been known for decades that these patients also have altered pulmonary lymphatics, and that lymphatic dysfunction can contribute to the disease course, investigations into the mechanisms that underlie these lymphatic aberrations are sparse. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to better understand the mechanisms that regulate lymphatic function and growth, in order to develop new treatments for these vulnerable patients. Using our established clinically relevant ovine model of a congenital heart defect with increased PBF (shunt), we have shown that the resulting increase in pulmonary lymph flow leads to impaired lymphatic endothelial signaling and disrupts the normal post-natal function and development of the pulmonary lymphatic system. Specifically, we have found that chronically increased PBF resulted in (1) impaired pulmonary lymphatic tone and flow associated with decreased bioavailable NO; and, (2) aberrations in pulmonary lymphatic development associated with HIF- and c-MYC-dependent accelerated growth and metabolic reprogramming. Importantly, an expanding body of literature indicates that lymphatic vessel capacitance and pumping primarily dictate lymphatic function, and supports the idea that endothelial NO signaling is an important modulator of lymphatic pump activity and flow. Additionally, metabolic alterations are associated with pulmonary vascular remodeling in the setting of pulmonary hypertension. Based on our findings, our overall hypothesis is that chronic exposure to increased pulmonary blood and lymph flow leads to lymphatic endothelial dysfunction characterized by disrupted NO signaling, resulting in decreased pulmonary lymphatic flow and abnormal postnatal pulmonary lymphatic growth and development associated with metabolic remodeling. By integrating whole animal, isolated vessel, cell culture, molecular and biochemical investigations, the proposal seeks to: 1) elucidate the mechanisms underlying alterations in pulmonary lymphatic tone and flow induced by chronically increased PBF; and 2) elucidate the mechanisms whereby HIF- and c-MYC interact to promote abnormal postnatal pulmonary lymphatic growth and development in response to chronically increased PBF. These experiments will establish an interdisciplinary research program aimed at incorporating novel insights with respect to lymphatic biology into the care of critically ill children born with congenital heart disease. Our clinical expertise, large animal model-driven research, cell culture expertise and molecular and metabolic research capabilities uniquely position us to translate our findings into the care of these patients. Importantly, our preliminary data suggest a possible therapeutic strategy to support lymphatic function in this setting."
"9315889","Enter the text here that is the new abstract information for your application. This section must be no longer than 30 lines of text. Understanding the mechanisms of cell migration is a fundamental question in cell, developmental and cancer biology. Cell motility is influenced by a complex interplay among intracellular mechanics and signaling, and the physical cues of the microenvironment. Our knowledge on the mechanisms of cell migration stems primarily from in vitro studies using two- dimensional (2D) surfaces. Cell locomotion in 2D is driven by cycles of actin protrusion, integrin-mediated adhesion and myosin-dependent contraction. However, cells in vivo migrate within 3D extracellular matrices and through 3D pre-existing longitudinal channels created by various anatomic structures. Accumulating evidence suggests that the physical confinement affects the regulation and mechanisms of cell locomotion. For instance, myosin contractility and ?1 integrin- dependent adhesion are dispensable in cell migration through confined spaces, which persists even when F-actin is disrupted. Thus, an alternative mechanism is at play for cells migrating in narrow microchannels. We recently proposed a new mechanism of cell motility in confined spaces that is described by the osmotic engine model (OEM). According to OEM, a cell migrating in a narrow channel establishes a spatial gradient of aquaporins (AQPs), ion channels and pumps in the cell membrane, so that there is a net inflow of water at the leading edge and a net outflow of water at the cell trailing edge. We hypothesize that cells can use different mechanisms (actomyosin-based and water permeation-based) depending on the physical cues of the microenvironment. We herein propose to develop an integrated experimental and theoretical approach to delineate the mechanisms of cell entry and migration in confined spaces. Experimental work will directly interact with theory and modeling throughout our proposed studies. In Aim 1, we propose to directly measure water uptake by cells migrating through confined spaces, and decipher the molecular mechanisms of water permeation and the role of mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels in confined migration. In conjunction with experimental work, we will develop a comprehensive molecular model of OEM integrating the roles of AQPs, membrane voltages and ion channels and pumps in cell migration in narrow channels. Because confined migration largely depends on microtubule (MT) dynamics, we will determine the role of MT molecular motors and their synergistic effects with actin polymerization in establishing AQP and ion channel polarization (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will examine the process of cell entry into physically- constricted spaces using our microfluidic device, and explore the role of cytoskeletal proteins, adhesions and membrane components during this process. Taken together, we will decipher the physical and molecular basis of a fundamentally new mechanism governing cell entry and migration in confined spaces in which AQPs, ion pumps and MS channels play key roles using a multidisciplinary approach, involving state-of-the-art bioengineering, imaging, molecular biology tools along with mathematical modeling"
"9374989","ABSTRACT Lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is generally treatable by a 2-4 week course of antibiotics. However, there is strong evidence from studies of human patients and experimental animals that antibiotics do not always clear B. burgdorferi infections. Studies of other bacterial species have revealed genetically-encoded physiological adaptations to antibiotic stresses, such as altering expression levels of target proteins or metabolic enzymes. To gain insight on whether the Lyme spirochete also adapts to antibiotic stresses, we will examine the transcriptomes and proteomes of B. burgdorferi that are exposed to sub-lethal and lethal concentrations of antibiotics that are commonly used to treat human Lyme disease infections. Results of these studies will reveal whether B. burgdorferi possesses genetically-encoded adaptive mechanisms, which can then be targeted for development of improved therapeutics."
"9363198","Project Summary /Abstract  Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are two of the most important diarrheal pathogens worldwide, causing moderate-to-severe diarrheal disease in young children in developing countries and travelers' diarrhea among U.S. travelers who visit developing countries. We have developed a lead candidate prototype Shigella-enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) vaccine candidate strain, CVD 1208S-122, which consists of an attenuated ?guaBA,?set,?sen Shigella flexneri 2a strain engineered to express ETEC colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) and the B and A2 subunits of heat-labile enterotoxin (LThA2B) from genes integrated into the chromosome. In animal models this prototype has elicited protective immune responses against these two important human diarrheal pathogens. The overall goal of this proposal is to translate this prototype Shigella-ETEC vaccine construct from an academic research laboratory vaccine candidate to a potential human vaccine ready to enter Phase 1 clinical trials (under other funding) to evaluate its safety, clinical tolerability, excretion pattern, transmissibility to close contacts, and immunogenicity. We have engaged an industrial partner, PaxVax, Inc. of Redwood City, CA. PaxVax is committed to becoming a future manufacturer of our multivalent combination vaccine and will provide overall strategic guidance for this translation, including regulatory support (in preparation of the chemistry/manufacture/control (CMC) portion of the IND, advice on interaction with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), and other industrial know- how. To accomplish this transition from promising research laboratory candidate to potential human trial, we propose the following activities. Aim 1. Technology transfer, Cell Bank production, process development and pilot scale-up of Shigella-ETEC vaccine candidate CVD 1208S-122. Aim 2: Comprehensive cGMP pilot production lot to provide 3000 vials of CVD 1208S-122.

"9321491","Abstract Asthma is a heterogeneous lung disease that has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S.A. The pathogenesis of asthma involves airway epithelial cells that respond to insulting agents and airway smooth muscle cells that constrict because of the disruption of mechanisms that maintain normal bronchial diameter. This latter aspect of the disease is critically important because the morbidity and mortality in asthma stems from airflow limitation due to bronchoconstriction. In order to design more effective therapies for the most crippling manifestation of the disease, we need to identity all systemic regulators, which is our long-term goal. In particular, we have gathered evidence that bone via the hormone osteocalcin favors bronchodilation. Osteocalcin is a newly described hormone that signals following its binding to a specific receptor, Gprc6a. Remarkably, the organ that expresses Gprc6a at the highest level is the lung. This prompted us to study whether osteocalcin exerts any function in the lungs in vivo using mouse models we had generated. Another important reason to do so is that circulating levels of osteocalcin increase during exercise, when bronchodilation is needed to increase ventilation. What we observed is that Osteocalcin-/- (Ocn-/-) and Gprc6a-/- mice have increased airway resistance (Rn) at baseline and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) to methacholine, a hallmark of asthma. Remarkably, these two features of the disease develop in the absence of any evidence of airway inflammation. Conversely, mice harboring a gain of function mutation in osteocalcin signaling (Esp-/-) have decreased Rn at baseline and no AHR. Thus, these results dissociate two cardinal manifestations of asthma and further underscore the importance of the endocrine regulation of bronchial diameter. That osteocalcin infusion directly into the brain of Ocn-/- mice did not correct their bronchoconstriction phenotype whereas its systemic administration did, suggest that osteocalcin acts peripherally rather than centrally to control airway diameter. These and other preliminary data presented in the body of this application suggest that bone favors bronchodilation through the hormone osteocalcin after it binds to its cognate receptor Gprc6a in a cell type we intend to identify. Suggesting the cell type, we provide evidence that in absence of osteocalcin signaling there is increased parasympathetic signaling in the lungs. Based on these and on other preliminary data we now propose the following specific aims:  To decipher the cellular and molecular mechanism that mediates osteocalcin regulation of bronchodilation  To determine whether osteocalcin can improve symptoms of bronchoconstriction in various mouse models  of asthma"
"9353210","ABSTRACT Infertility and spontaneous abortion (SAB) are important public health problems, affecting up to 20% of reproductive age couples. As couples increasingly postpone childbearing to the later reproductive years, many seek infertility treatment, which has relatively low success rates, costs an estimated $5 billion per year in the United States, and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Coping with the stress of infertility also exacts a measurable emotional toll in affected couples. Identifying modifiable risk factors for infertility and SAB is an important public health goal. Couples planning a pregnancy are notoriously difficult to recruit into research studies using traditional methods. We have shown that enrollment and follow-up of pre- conception couples via the internet in North America and Denmark is feasible, valid, and cost-efficient. We propose to harmonize data from three interrelated prospective preconception cohort studies in Denmark (Snart Gravid and Snart Foraeldre) and North America (PRESTO) to evaluate whether selected dietary factors and medications influence female and male fecundity, and SAB risk. In order to increase our statistical power to accomplish these aims, we will use our existing NICHD-supported web-based infrastructure to collect additional data from 6,000 females and 2,000 of their male partners. There is limited evidence on whether commonly-used medications, such as antibiotics, asthma drugs, antidepressants, and analgesics affect fertility and SAB, despite the potentially large attributable risk due to increasing use of medications among couples of reproductive age. In addition, there is a scarcity of research on dietary factors and reproduction from optimally-designed cohort studies of couples actively trying to conceive. Dietary factors of interest include high glycemic load/index, soy, and fish/seafood among females and red and processed meats, dairy, and trans-fatty acids among males. Most studies of TTP and SAB are retrospective in design and prone to misclassification, left truncation, and selection and recall biases. The few existing prospective studies of TTP and SAB are small and underpowered. The harmonization of large preconception cohorts with similar designs will provide excellent power to evaluate a broad range of hypotheses. Enrolling couples at the start of their pregnancy attempt can identify critical windows of exposure susceptibility. The use of social media and health-related websites for recruitment is innovative and extremely cost-effective relative to traditional methods. Inclusion of males is innovative because it allows for the assessment of individual and joint effects of exposures in both partners, and permits better control for confounding. Utilization of registry data will enable the collection of additional exposure and outcome data, data validation, identification of those lost to follow-up, and assessment of selection bias and generalizability. This will be the largest prospective preconception cohort study of modifiable risk factors for TTP and SAB to date. Findings from the proposed research are likely to have a large and sustained impact on the field and will result in actionable recommendations for couples to improve their fertility and lower their risk of SAB."
"9502598","?    DESCRIPTION: This revised competitive renewal application is for continuation of the Training Program in Psychiatric Genetics and Translational Research, offered jointly by the Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH). The principal objectives of the training grant are to educate promising pre- and postdoctoral trainees as epidemiological and biostatistical scientists in psychiatric research, with two focus areas: psychiatric genetics and analytical methods for translational research. We aim to train psychiatrists and other mental health researchers in methods relevant to these two fields, and to train methodologists working in these areas with genuine engagement in psychiatric research and an understanding of psychiatric diagnosis, assessment, and outcomes. The Departments of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at HSPH have an accomplished faculty who have worked collaboratively in these two areas for many years. We also draw on the expertise of Harvard faculty from other world-renown institutions, including Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham & Women's Hospital, and McLean Hospital. These collaborations offer a rich source of ongoing projects for student and postdoctoral training. We are requesting a total of six trainees across the two departments, three predoctoral and three postdoctoral (typically one psychiatrist seeking a masters or doctoral degree and two traditional postdoctoral fellows, or vice versa). Training will be a combination of coursework, seminars, practica, and independent and collaborative research in mental health. High level training in the companion core disciplines of epidemiology and biostatistics is critical to leadership of mental health research in the coming decades."
"9295855","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Persons with serious mental illness (SMI), such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, die on average 25 years earlier than persons without SMI. Much premature death in SMI is attributable to CVD with CVD-related mortality rates twice those of the overall population. Accordingly, this vulnerable group, comprising at least 15 million Americans, has a high burden of modifiable CVD risk factors including smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The American Heart Association (AHA) recently set ambitious strategic Impact Goals to improve the cardiovascular health of all Americans and reduce deaths from CVD by 20 percent by 2020. Substantial efforts are underway to meet these goals in the general population. Still, interventions need to be adapted for persons with SMI who often have substantial barriers related to cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms. Hence, without special efforts to promote CV health and control risk factors in vulnerable populations like the SMI, it is unlikely that CV health will improve in SMI patients, and disparitis in CV health will not only persist, but likely worsen. In view of their extraordinary burden of CVD risk factors, the overarching objective of this R-01 application is to develop and test a scalable intervention that could be widely adopted to reduce risk in this vulnerable population. Our multidisciplinary research team has expertise designing and rigorously testing interventions to decrease CVD risk in the general population and in persons with SMI. We propose the IDEAL Trial, a community organization-based, two-arm clinical trial that will test the hypothesis that an 18-month comprehensive, practical CVD risk reduction program will be superior to control in improving CV health in persons with SMI. We will partner with a large mental health care organization and enroll 250 persons with SMI who attend 4 psychiatric rehabilitation day programs or adjoining mental health clinics. Rehabilitation programs provide opportune settings to implement CVD risk reduction programs because patients attend several days a week and environmental components can take place on-site. We will provide a common background of exercise classes and healthy changes to meals served. Participants will then be randomized to receive this control condition or the 18-month active IDEAL intervention with a Heart Health Interventionist, who will provide on-site: 1) individual CVD risk reduction behavioral counseling (e.g., for smoking cessation, diet); 2) coordination with primary care providers to ensure appropriate management of risk factors (e.g., blood pressure control); and 3) collaboration with mental health staff and social supports to encourage and motivate participants to reach goals. The primary outcome will be the change in estimated CVD risk from the global Framingham Risk Score; secondary outcomes will include AHA metrics for CV health. Accomplishing meaningful reductions in CVD throughout the population will require targeted interventions focusing on vulnerable, high-risk groups such as those with SMI. If successful, this trial will provide persuasive evidence for use of a practical, comprehensive CVD risk reduction strategy in SMI to reduce health disparities."
"9330155","Project Summary / Abstract  Organ-on-a-chip technology has recently presented new tools for studying cellular and micro-organ function within a 3D environment mimicking native organ structures. However, in these enclosed systems, it remains difficult to evaluate the health and function of live cells contained within these devices without retroactive fixation and antibody staining. Secreted protein biomarkers may provide an opportunity to non- invasively evaluate the health and function of these cells, although the tools to reliably sense these biomarkers in real-time have yet to be developed. We have recently applied an organ-on-a-chip approach to study the metabolic disorder diabetes. In healthy individuals, pancreatic islet structures secrete the small molecule insulin to negatively regulate blood glucose levels, a process that is disrupted in diabetic individuals resulting in elevated blood glucose levels. In order to study the mechanisms underlying defective islet function ex vivo, we have recently incorporated human pancreatic islets within a 3D, vascularized organ-on-a-chip platform which mimics the pancreas in vivo. To fully exploit this platform, a simple, reliable, and real-time method for sensing the secreted biomarker insulin is necessary to evaluate islet function within the chip. Here, we propose to design, develop, and validate a receptor-based, bioluminescent imaging approach to optimize the real-time detection of small protein biomarkers. Specifically, we will utilize split luciferase constructs coupled to the human insulin receptor and its substrate, IRS-1, to detect insulin binding, using light output as a read-out of insulin concentration. The sensitivity and specificity of these tools will be extensively validated in two developmental phases: static 2D culture; followed by application in a 3D, biomimetic pancreas-on-a-chip platform. While this proposal focuses on developing these tools for insulin detection, our approach has broad implications in the detection of other secreted biomarkers in both static culture and dynamic microfluidic platforms."
"9439398","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite between one- and two-thirds of US men who have sex with men (MSM) acquire HIV from their primary  4 same-sex relationship partner (i.e., male couples), most HIV prevention efforts have targeted MSM at the  5 individual- and community-levels. Substance use is also an important Public Health issue that affects HIV 6 acquisition and transmission among MSM; substances are often used to enhance pleasure and sustain 7 engagement in sexual behaviors including condomless anal sex (CAS). Findings from the few studies 8 conducted with male couples indicate their use of substances with sex negatively impacts their relationship 9 dynamics and behaviors related to HIV prevention, including CAS with casual MSM partners and poor 10 treatment adherence. Although these findings suggest the need to intervene for prevention, less is known 11 about how primary partners within the male couple influence one another's use of substances, the different 12 context(s) in which they use substances, and how their usage directly affects their risk for HIV and dynamics of 13 the relationship. To that calling, we propose to conduct a 4-year mixed method study that is theoretically 14 grounded to examine how male couples' use of substances affects their relationship and risk for acquisition 15 and/or transmission of HIV. We will use venue-time sampling to recruit 225 substance-using male couples, 16 diverse in terms of HIV status and relationship length, from community and Internet venues in South Florida. 17 We will collect qualitative and quantitative longitudinal dyadic data over a 6-month period to examine the 18 associations between intrapersonal, interpersonal and contextual factors in general and with event level 19 substance use. Participants will complete in-person ACASI at 3 time points (baseline, 3 and 6 months), and 20 daily ecological momentary assessments (EMA) during months 2 and 5. Every third reported substance use 21 event will be supplemented with an in-depth phone interview. All data will be collected independently from each 22 partner of the couple, and couples' substance use and HIV serostatus will be verified at baseline, 3 and 6 23 months. Longitudinal quantitative data obtained from the ACASI and EMA will be analyzed using 24 mixed/multilevel models, including actor-partner effects. Qualitative content analysis, specifically latent and 25 manifest content analysis, will be used to identify and describe the major themes and sub-themes that emerge 26 from the phone interview data. We will use standard mixed methodology to integrate the quantitative and 27 qualitative findings to elucidate how primary partners' influence one another's use of substances and risk for 28 HIV, and how their usage affects dynamics of their relationship. Under the direction of Mitchell, he and his 29 team of senior co-investigators will disseminate these findings, and apply them toward development of a 30 couples-focused HIV and substance use preventive intervention for use in a future project."
"9273475","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Montagna Symposium on the Biology of Skin gathers leading cutaneous biology scientists and dermatologists in a uniquely designed conference to carry out its mission to: discuss new findings, techniques and goals in skin biology; foster collaborations among disciplines that enrich the scientific and clinical specialty; and encourage young investigators. Each year the Symposium addresses a different topic in skin biology encompassing major areas of active skin research and unanswered questions about causes and cures for skin diseases. The central support of this meeting is a multi-year conference grant from the NIH that allows advance planning of program themes and, accordingly, invitation of Program Chairs and highly competitive speakers. It also allows the fundraising required anew each year from corporate and foundation sources, which, along with modest registration fees, offset the balance of meeting production costs. The limited number of participants fosters the informal interactions that are the essence of the meeting. Interactions are among participants in basic research, clinical research and patient care, pharmaceutical research, and foundation research; between trainees and established scientists; and between dermatology faculty and those from other departments/fields. Participation of young scientists is strongly encouraged by presentation opportunities and by competitive travel awards. The meeting format includes clinician/scientist discussion sessions designed to identify unanswered questions, strategize to overcome roadblocks and to grasp opportunities for translation to new treatments. Lastly, the Symposium communicates its presentations through publication of proffered, peer reviewed papers in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology with waiver of fees under the Montagna Symposium on the Biology of Skin logo. This meeting uniquely fulfills the NIH goal to advance scientific progress in understanding of the basic structure and molecular regulation of human biology and disease. Meeting themes reflect and aim to help shape NIAMS' goals and mission. Topics planned include The skin: Our sensory organ for itch, pain, touch, and pleasure, Precision dermatology: Next generation prevention, diagnosis and treatment, From vitiligo to melanoma: Interactions of the melanocyte with the immune environment in the skin, Polygenic skin diseases, and Microbes, Autoimmunity and Cancer. Central focus on the skin offers unique opportunities for multidisciplinary research of clinical relevance, and discoveries made in the skin have enriched knowledge and treatment options in other organs beyond the skin. The complex nature of disease makes it essential that there are comprehensive approaches recognizing the separate but interacting elements tying molecular events to the pathophysiological, tissue and clinical presentations."
"9293390","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis."
"9397067","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A large genome-wide association study identified a common non-coding, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3129882, which was significantly associated with risk for late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Individuals homozygous for the risk allele (GG) have a 1.7 fold higher risk for PD than homozygous individuals with the low risk allele (AA). rs3129882 is located in the first intron of the Major Histocompatibility Complex class  II (MHC-II) Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DRA gene, providing the first genetic link between PD and this critical immune system locus. The conundrum introduced by this study was the fact that HLA-DRA is monomorphic and the polymorphic HLA genes were not found to be associated with PD in this study, suggesting that a protein coding polymorphism is unlikely to be the causative genetic lesion. Instead, we suggest the novel hypothesis that rs3129882 is linked to a novel regulatory element that alters the expression of the locus in antigen presenting cells that reside in and/or infiltrate into the brain, such that there is an increased risk for disease following an inflammatory event. Indeed, HLA-DR-expressing microglia, CD4+ T cells, and anti-CNS protein antibodies have been reported in the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD patients, supporting a role for adaptive immune responses in PD disease progression. We additionally posit that changes in genetic and/or epigenetic regulation of MHC-II genes could be linked to rs3129882 and explain the stochastic and sporadic nature of this disease. Preliminary studies revealed that IFN??treated monocytes from GG individuals with PD co-express HLA-DR and HLA-DQ proteins to a higher degree than monocytes from AA individuals irrespective of disease state. Furthermore, in response to IFN?, GG monocytes expressed up to 300-fold higher levels of both DR and DQ mRNAs than AA cells. Thus, the high risk, GG genotype, is associated with increased levels of MHC-II mRNA and protein. Identification of a direct linkage of rs3129882 to a regulatory mechanism would provide a specific target for neuroimmune modulation and novel therapy to delay, prevent, or attenuate disease. To provide a scientific basis for pursuing treatments to target MHC-II expression and this pathway, we propose to determine the regulatory bases for rs3129882 association with PD and determine a causal role for MHC-II aberrant expression and PD-like neuropathology in a model system through the following specific aims: Aim 1, Determine the extent to which MHCII expression and T-cell subset frequency are influenced by rs3129882 genotype; Aim 2, Identify the molecular bases for rs3129882-related changes in gene expression; and Aim 3, Determine the extent to which modulation of myeloid-specific (including microglia) MHC-II expression determines vulnerability to rAAV-human ?-synuclein-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Together, these analyses will elucidate the molecular mechanism for understanding this important genetic association and potentially provide novel therapies for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases where inflammation plays a role."
"9411359","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Humans possess multi-layered defenses against invading pathogens. One of the first antiviral defense mechanisms is the induction of Type I Interferons (IFNs). IFNs are cytokines with well-defined antiviral activities. They induce transcription of hundreds of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). We discovered and characterized six individuals with complete ISG15 deficiency. The cells of these patients presented with mild IFN auto-inflammation and decreased susceptibility to a broad spectrum of viruses. Thus, ISG15 acts as an anti-inflammatory as well as a proviral molecule. Our studies ascribed ISG15 a role of negative regulator of IFN signaling explaining these two phenotypes. More recently we also discovered five patients with a complete USP18 deficiency, a master negative regulator of IFN signaling. This proposal is built around the hypothesis that germ line mutations in negative regulators of IFN afford increased control of HIV infection. Our preliminary data indicate that HIV is restricted in IFN primed cells from ISG15 deficient patients. We propose test if USP18 deficient individuals' cells also have increased resistance to HIV. Naturally deficient patient cell line will be complemented with a series of ISG15 and USP18 variants in order to discriminate between negative regulation and ISGylation as underlying mechanism of action. We will also determine what step in the HIV life cycle is specifically targeted in the context of ISG15/USP18 deficiency. We will also evaluate whether primary CD4+ T cells deficient in ISG15 or USP18 control HIV better compared to control cells and investigate the extent to which cells from HIV infected patients that spontaneously control infection display expression signatures of ISGs that mimic the unique expression patterns found in patients with deleterious mutations in ISG15 and USP18. These studies have the potential to radically change our understanding of naturally occuring HIV control and point to new interventions suitable to yield functional cures for HIV/AIDS disease."

Here we propose comprehensive in vitro analysis of a unique set of novel small molecule drugs known gamma- secretase modulators (GSMs) to further explore AD therapeutics. This proposal will focus on testing an optimal lead clinical candidate for efficacy in human neurons aimed at halting A?42- related pathologies AD. Our overarching hypothesis is GSM therapy aimed to disrupt production of A?42 will be an efficacious treatment approach for prodromal or early AD, as well as sporadic late-onset AD.

"9346084","Summary Statement: Scientific/Technical Core The MPC Scientific/Technical Core (STC) aims to advance research in population dynamics by providing services in computing and software development, spatial analysis, and data science. STC provides expertise to investigators designing new projects, coordinates technical support of ongoing research projects, and helps investigators master advanced methods and technologies. In past MPC center grant proposals, these three areas were separate cores. The STC consolidates these functions into a single core to reduce redundant effort, maximize administrative efficiency, and better coordinate services. This model allows MPC to employ the most advanced development tools and design standards available, giving us a leading role in demographic data management. Computing and software development services include the development of new software for consistency checking, automated data cleaning and editing, sampling, disclosure control, database harmonization, metadata creation and parsing, and web-based tools for documentation browsing, extraction, and analysis as well as systems administration. Spatial analysis services include training in GIS and spatial statistics, data preparation, data analysis, and data visualization. Data sciences services include data retrieval and preparation; design and development of data integration and dissemination projects; and data coding, cleaning, and preparation. Center grant support of the STC is highly cost-effective, providing research projects with shared resources that could not be efficiently supported by any single project. Investigators have access to specialists for each aspect of their project?such as database design, geocoding, or metadata design?that they could never afford to hire on their own. For example, many projects cannot afford a full-time user experience specialist, but they nevertheless need some user design services. MPC?s model of centralized technical services can provide far better support than could be obtained from a part-time developer hired on a short-term basis. The model increases the impact and pace of population science conducted at the Center in three ways: 1) by maximizing the fit between technical expertise and project needs; 2) by maintaining a pool of talented software developers, GIS experts, and data scientists with experience working with demographic datasets; and 3) by minimizing startup time for new projects."
"9352860","Chemokines and their receptors control cell migration in development, in immune system homeostasis, and in inflammatory responses to physiological insults. Chemokine receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3 also play critical roles in disease, particularly cancer where they work as a trio with their mutual chemokine ligand, CXCL12. CXCR4, a canonical G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) drives tumor metastasis by virtue of its ability to promote cell migration. In contrast, ACKR3 is an atypical receptor that does not couple to G proteins; instead it signals via ?-arrestin and indirectly facilitates metastasis by biased ?-arrestin mediated signaling. As such, CXCR4 and ACKR3 represent promising targets for the development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics. Despite their importance in cancer, the structural basis of ligand recognition and activation of these two receptors by CXCL12 remains a mystery. In fact, the question of recognition of any protein ligand by a GPCR was unanswered until recently when the applicants solved the first structure of a CXCR4:chemokine complex. This was a major breakthrough that poised the applicants well for studying the molecular basis of the interaction of CXCR4 and ACKR3 with CXCL12, and how they function as canonical G protein-coupled and ?- arrestin biased receptors. The long term goal of the applicants' research is to obtain atomic resolution understanding of chemokine receptor interactions with their protein ligands and intracellular partners, thus enabling rational design of highly efficient therapeutics targeting these chemokine receptors. The objective of the present proposal is to understand the structural basis of how CXCL12 is recognized by two functionally distinct receptors and how ligand binding is translated into distinct functional responses. The proposal consists of three complementary Specific Aims. In Aim 1, the structural basis of CXCR4 and ACKR3 interaction with CXCL12 and small molecules will be determined using X-ray crystallography and experiment-guided molecular modeling. In Aim 2, the pharmacological peculiarities of CXCR4 and ACKR3 activation and signaling will be deconvoluted via model-guided binding, kinetic, and functional experiments. In Aim 3, the complex dynamics and the conformational changes that the canonical GPCR CXCR4 and the atypical biased receptor ACKR3 undergo in response to ligand binding will be investigated using EPR. Our comprehensive interdisciplinary approach involves crystallography, molecular modeling, a wide range of experiments for studies of receptor binding and signaling, and EPR characterization of receptor conformational changes and dynamics. The overall project is innovative because of its structural hypotheses, its synergistic methodologies, and because this is the first time a complex polypharmacological system of two membrane receptors (one of which is atypical) and several shared ligands of varying specificity and pharmacology is studied from a structural perspective and in the context of full-length receptors. The research is significant, because it is expected to vertically advance both chemokine receptor biology and the development of novel cancer therapeutics."

The CTSC with the leaders of this TL1 program will build upon the direction and philosophy of our former successful CTSC predoctoral program and its affiliated partners including the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Med-into-Grad program to enhance the interdisciplinary and team science strategies put forth over the past 8 years. There will be a renewed focus on training core competencies in clinical and translational research as well as providing clinical experiences to biomedical trainees recruited from schools and colleges across the UC Davis campus. Diverse scholars and mentors will be recruited from the Schools of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, and Nursing, and the Colleges of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Engineering, all key partners in the past. Our program will be framed over two years (with a one year option for medical students) and focus on rigorous mentoring through the Mentoring Academy with monitoring of scholar progress and the training performance of the mentoring teams. In addition, the program will provide a creative training and scientific milieu facilitating career development to the next stage of the scholars' research careers, either as independent researchers in academic, government, or private research laboratories, or as high-level translational team research scholars. This TL1 program adds substantial value to UC Davis and our CTSC, and uniquely facilitates training and interactions among PhD, MD, and DVM trainees. We view the partnerships forged through the CTSC and trainees as essential to creating a rich interactive research environment and the strong foundation for team science of the future. Our goals are to: create individual training pathways to develop a diverse workforce that crosses disciplinary boundaries, enhance mentoring capacity within the CTSC in the fields of Veterinary Medicine, Engineering, Nutrition, and Biological Sciences to support translational team science, and expand training opportunities for all UC Davis Clinical and Translational Research Scholars. While we emphasize the outstanding foundation and the accumulated experience upon which this program has been built, the proposed training program will begin anew with the added capacity to engage postdoctoral scholars across the UC Davis campus. Overall, the TL1 is well positioned to accomplish new goals and objectives through the opportunities afforded by a strong partnership with the UC Davis CTSC, diverse schools and colleges across UC Davis, and unique resources and related NIH-supported programs.

"9297386","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a need for research that can help better predict risk and prevent suicide among adolescent youth. Rates of suicidality, a strong predictor of suicide, are higher among adolescent girls compared to boys, and highest among sexual minority girls (girls who endorse same-sex romantic attraction, behavior or identity). This study tests an innovative model of suicide risk in a sample of sexual minority and nonminority adolescent girls that integrates neurobehavioral and interpersonal vulnerabilities. Specifically, the model posits that neural sensitivity to social rejection, when occurring in the presence of peer rejection, increases risk for suicide. This proposed K01 bridges the candidate's prior training in interpersonal risk for depression and developmental psychopathology, with new training in affective neuroscience and suicide risk. This training will uniquely position the candidate to investigate the development of negative valence systems, with an emphasis on affective sensitivity to social rejection, and associations with suicidality. Thus, the proposed study will be the first in a larger program of research that will contribute to NIMH research priorities, such as Strategic Objective 2, by investigating how individual differences in biologic and social/environmental factors contribute to heterogeneity in the development of suicide risk in diverse populations. Specifically, the candidate plans to follow the proposed study with larger longitudinal studies using multiple methods and repeated assessments of neurobehavioral and interpersonal vulnerability for suicide during the adolescent developmental period to examine 1) how pain related neural circuitry underlying affective sensitivity to social rejection may be associated with suicide risk, and 2) interpersonal factors (e.g., interpersonal rejection) that may contribute to and strengthen sensitivity to social rejection over time within the context of social and pubertal changes in adolescence. The candidate will also be positioned to investigate etiological models explaining elevated suicide risk among sexual minority youth. This program of research is expected to advance the field by improving the ability to predict risk for suicide among vulnerable youth, and to identify targets for intervention during optimal developmental windows.  To achieve these career objectives, the candidate will receive training in developmental affective neuroscience, neuroimaging methods, and theory and research on development of suicide risk in adolescence, including sexual minority youth. She has an ideal mentorship team within an optimal scientific training environment to provide the requisite training for her to meet her career goals. Dr. Jennifer Silk is an expert on development of social-emotional processing from childhood into adolescence. Dr. Mary Phillips has significant expertise in affective neuroscience and fMRI methods, and neural underpinnings of emotional reactivity and regulation.

"9388073","Project Summary ? Abstract  A fundamental challenge of external beam radiation treatment is that the internal tumor target is not directly visible during treatment. The lack of an efficient imaging technology to monitor beam path and patient anatomy is a significant weakness that limits treatment accuracy, and as a consequence precludes the effective use of radiotherapy in many cancers close to vital organs. This deficiency is particularly problematic for lung cancer patients, as lung tumors often are subject to respiratory-induced motion. This project aims to develop a real-time imaging system for monitoring the treatment target and beam positions in stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) of lung cancer. Once successfully developed, this technology can be applied not only to lung cancer patients receiving SABR treatment but also to other cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Over 60% of cancer patients (about 990,000 in the US) receive some form of radiation therapy each year. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance technology and improve the treatment effectiveness for a large population of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.  To address this challenge, we propose to develop a novel imager to confirm patient alignment and to monitor the patient during treatment in real-time. Our proposed back-scatter imaging technology utilizes the scatter radiation produced by the treatment beam; thus it provides treatment confirmation images without incurring additional radiation dose or potential side effects. In addition, as scatter radiation is present continuously during treatment, these images can be produced in real-time. This approach is innovative, because it utilizes a naturally occurring byproduct from radiotherapy and improves both accuracy and safety of this type of treatment.  This project is intended as the feasibility study for this technology for image-guided radiation therapy applications in clinical practice. The specific aims of the project are: (1) Design a pinhole-camera type imaging system that can be integrated into a commercial external beam radiation therapy system. The system design will include pinhole-camera configurations and requirements for a flat-panel type x-ray detector. (2) Build and use appropriate phantoms containing simulated tumor and lung materials as test treatment subjects to optimize the imaging system. Our results will provide guidelines for the design of a clinical system.  While the immediate focus of the current proposal is to design a novel scatter imaging device for SABR treatment of lung cancer patients, our long-term objective is to use this type of device to improve the accuracy of radiation treatment of cancer in general; this will allow patient-specific adaptive therapy and improve the treatment outcome. The data obtained from this proposed R21 feasibility study will form the basis for a follow up R01 grant application to the NIH."
"9274843","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms whereby anti-Mllerian hormone (AMH) either directly, or indirectly via other locally synthesized factors, regulates preantral follicle growth and antral follicle maturation in the stag-dependent manner in primates during the menstrual cycle. Increasing evidence suggests that AMH alters preantral follicle growth; and the discovery that AMH reduces aromatase and luteinizing hormone receptor expression in cultured granulosa cells adds another dimension to possible AMH actions in antral follicles. Likewise, the PI's evidence that AMH is heterogeneously and dynamically expressed in the macaque follicles reinforces the concept of stage-dependent AMH actions during primate folliculogeneisis. Finally, the recent in vitro follicl maturation (IFM) technique provides a feasible model for manipulative studies to unravel local factors and signaling pathways that are critical to the follicular development and oocyte maturation in the primate ovary. Therefore, translational studies are proposed in the adult, female rhesus monkeys, to test the hypotheses that: (Aim 1) AMH promotes preantral follicle growth, but inhibits antral follicle maturation in vitro and (Aim 2) AMH promotes preantral-to-antral follicle growth, but prevents further maturation and selection of the dominant follicle durig the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle in vivo. AMH addition (recombinant human AMH protein) and ablation (anti-human AMH antibody) experiments will be conducted through IFM in vitro and intraovarian infusion in vivo. Follicular morphology and histology, as well as function i steroidogenesis and local factor production, oocyte maturation and competence in fertilization and preimplantation development, plus genome-wide mRNA levels and selected AMH-regulated genes (Aim 3) will be analyzed with the assistance of the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Support Core and Massively Parallel Sequencing Shared Resource. AMH will also be examined as a noninvasive biomarker for further follicle growth and oocyte maturation during IFM. Finally, data generated from the nonhuman primate research will be applied to human IFM with the hypothesis that AMH manipulation improves the coordinated development and maturation of human follicles and their enclosed oocytes (Aim 4).  These experiments will provide valuable information on the heterogeneous expression and stage- dependent actions of AMH in ovarian follicles, as well as mechanisms of AMH controlling follicular development, in primates. New insight will emerge on the potential of AMH to serve as a biomarker for follicle growth and oocyte competence during IFM. Emerging concepts should refine clinical paradigms, e.g., local AMH action or value as a biomarker of ovarian reserve in infertility, including primary ovarian insufficiency, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, in vitro fertilization, reproductive aging and cancer."

"9447442","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R21/R33 application in response to RFA-MH-15-300 seeks to demonstrate target engagement and clinical viability for a novel combination therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. PTSD is associated with poor quality of life and comorbidity with both physical and mental illness. While exposure-based psychological treatments have proven efficacious, up to 40% retain PTSD diagnoses following treatment. Thus, new protocols to boost treatment efficacy can have a significant public health impact. Recent basic research suggests that consolidation of fear extinction learning memories is at least partly dopamine-mediated and that boosting dopamine signaling in the consolidation window can decrease fear responding during subsequent exposure to fear cues. The overall goal of the proposed project is to demonstrate the viability of boosting dopamine signaling in the post-learning consolidation window as a novel means of boosting therapy outcomes among adult women with PTSD related to assaultive violence (physical or sexual assault). In the R21 target engagement phase, we will test the impact of endogenous and exogenous manipulations of dopamine neurotransmission on 1) acute functional organization of dopaminergic resting-state networks, and 2) the consolidation of generic (i.e., laboratory-induced) fear extinction learning using concurrent neuroimaging, psychophysiological, and self-report assessments among women with PTSD (Aim 1). In the R33 clinical phase, we seek to replicate and extend target engagement to the clinical context of fear extinction learning for ideographic trauma memories and emotional responding to trauma cues among women with PTSD using concurrent neuroimaging, psychophysiological, and self-report assessments (Aim 2). Successful demonstration of target engagement (Aim 1) and efficacy for the clinical target of trauma memories and emotional responding to trauma cues (Aim 2) would provide critical scientific support of the viability of combining exposure-based therapy with pharmacological agents that boost dopamine signaling as a means to improve treatment outcomes for PTSD."

"9277477","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this project is to reveal the mechanisms that ensure error-free segregation of chromosomes during mitosis. While higher levels of segregation errors are lethal, relatively infrequent mis- segregation of individual chromosomes underlies 'chromosomal instability' (CIN), a hallmark of cancer transformation. Therefore, identifying the exact cause(s) of CIN and finding a way to attenuate the rate chromosome missegregation will likely lead to novel strategies for selective elimination of cancer cells. Toward this goal we are employing sophisticated imaging in conjunction with molecular and cell-biology techniques to characterize the 'mitotic spindle', a self-assembling molecular machine that enacts chromosome segregation. In the current funding period we plan to achieve three objectives: 1) Reconstruct 3-D architecture of the spindle in normal and CIN cells via a novel approach based on super-resolution light microscopy. Comparative analyses of spindle organization in normal vs. CIN cells will reveal the structural foundation of chromosome loss. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that some chromosomes lack direct connections to spindle pole and that these chromosomes are more numerous in CIN cells. 2) Characterize the structural reorganization of kinetochores (macromolecular assemblies that attach chromosomes to spindle microtubules) during the transition from the initial 'lateral' to the final 'end-on' attachments. In spite of their importance, the ultrastructure of lateral attachments has not been described due to technological limitations. We will capitalize on a novel approach that involves direct correlation of multi-color light-microscopy with high-resolution electron tomography conducted on the same kinetochore. This approach will allow us test the hypothesis that the same molecular machinery (Hec1) mediates both lateral and end-on attachments and also reveal reorganization of the outer plate that underlies satisfaction of the mitotic checkpoint. 3) Test the hypothesis that mild inhibition of dynein, benign in normal cells, selectively suppresses mitosis in CIN cells. This idea stems from the preliminary data that a significant number of chromosomes in CIN cells lack a direct attachment to the spindle poles and these chromosomes rely on dynein-mediated transport for segregation. We will systematically characterize the effects of dynein inhibitors on cell proliferation, levels of cell death, patternsof chromosome movement, and mechanisms of spindle assembly in normal vs. CIN cells. If our hypothesis is proven correct, partial inhibition of dynein will emerge as a powerful therapeutic approach."

"9276852","The Crane group studies mechanisms of signal transduction with the overall goal of understanding behavior at the molecular level. This understanding will be achieved by defining the structure and dynamics of key macromolecular complexes that coordinate gene expression and transmembrane signaling in two systems that rely on highly cooperative interactions to respond to light, redox and chemical environment. The first, bacterial chemotaxis, concerns the motion of prokaryotic cells toward external stimulants. Chemotaxis is a paradigm for understanding transmembrane communication, intracellular information transfer, and motility. Importantly, many human pathogens that cause diseases such as cholera, gastric cancer and lyme rely on chemotaxis to establish infection. The sensory apparatus underlying chemotaxis, hereafter called ?the chemosome?, displays amazing sensitivity, dynamic range and a rudimentary molecular memory. In the chemosome, receptors, histidine kinases (CheA) and coupling proteins assemble into a specific architecture, whose details are just emerging. This proposal continues efforts to understand chemosome assembly, chemoreceptor conformational signaling, and ultimately, CheA regulation through restructuring of the receptor arrays. Chemosome output modulates Nature's consummate nanomachine ? the flagella motor. The ultrastructure of the switch complex within the motor will be defined to understand torque generation, direction switching and response to chemosome signals. The second system, eukaryotic circadian clocks, comprises cell-autonomous timing devices that pace metabolism to the diurnal cycle. Clocks are composed of transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) within which repressor proteins inhibit the transcriptional activators of their own genes. Light entrains the clock phase by stimulating photosensors that impinge directly on the TTFLs. In humans, aberrant clock function causes mental illness (sleep disorders, depression, mania), cell growth deregulation (cancer) and metabolic defects (diabetes and obesity). This project proposes structural and mechanistic investigations of the key repressor and light-setting activities common to clocks in higher organisms. Biophysical studies will be conducted on the circadian proteins of fungi (Neurospora crassa) and flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Both model organisms provide genetic systems and behavioral assays to probe the biological relevance of mechanistic insights. A complimentary set of techniques including X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering, optical spectroscopy, cryo-electron microscopy and pulse-dipolar ESR spectroscopy (PDS) will be applied to accomplish these goals. For PDS, new strategies for incorporating spin probes based on nitroxides, flavins, nucleotides, and metal ions will be developed and deployed. Overall, this program aims to provide a molecular understanding for sensing and response in bacterial chemotaxis and eukaryotic circadian rhythms through the synergistic application of biophysical methods."

"9268015","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the first report of a myosin mutation causing a human disease in 1990, over 350 mutations in 6 different sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MyHC) genes have been associated with 11 different diseases in heart and skeletal muscle. Thus, it seems likely that all 10 genes in this family will ultimately be implicated in human disease. The goal of our renewal application is to understand the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of myosin skeletal myopathies and to test 2 therapeutic interventions. We are among a small number of labs equipped to study myosin-based myopathies with an integrated structural, biophysical, cellular, and organismal approach. Myosin is an asymmetric molecule with a globular motor domain and an ?-helical rod domain that is responsible for assembly of the thick filament. Mutations that cause disease are found throughout the molecule. We propose that myosin diseases arise by multiple mechanisms that are highly interdependent. Aim I will focus on identifying the molecular and cellular determinants of myosin myopathies caused by motor domain mutations. The same mutation in the in the ATP binding pocket of the embryonic, perinatal, and ? MyHC motor domains leads to 3 distinct diseases: Freeman Sheldon Syndrome, Variant Carney Complex and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respectively. We will measure the cross bridge cycle of the motors bearing these mutations. We will measure the activation states of multiple signaling pathways. We will probe the involvement of the myosin chaperone, Unc45b, in pathogenesis. We will test small molecule therapeutics in genome edited worm models for these mutations. In Aim II we will determine how distal skeletal myopathies are caused primarily by proline substitutions in the ? myosin rod. We will study these structurally, i cells and in mouse models. A therapeutic intervention of allele- specific RNA silencing will be tested in a mouse model. The goal of Aim III is to understand the roles that MYH7b plays in the mouse. MYH7b is found not only in specialized muscles, where it is sarcomeric, but also in a subset of cells in the brain and in hair cells and neurons in the inner ear. Remarkably, a compound heterozygous mutation in MYH7b has recently been linked to hereditary hearing loss. We will determine how striated muscle myosin functions in cells of the inner ear that have no sarcomeres. We will use genetic inactivation, cell-based investigations and biophysical analysis of hearing loss mutations to answer this question. In summary, this integrated approach to understand myosin myopathies and the contribution of MYH7b to hearing loss will provide new insight into the function and dysfunction of myosins in health and disease. We will explore for the first time the response of a portion of the muscle cell phosphoproteome to mutant myosins and attempt therapeutic interventions in skeletal myopathies."
"9380378","The lingual sense of taste is initially communicated by taste buds, clusters of sensory cells located in highly organized taste papillae, to chemosensory neurons whose cell bodies are located in the geniculate and petrosal ganglia. The chemosensory receptor cells in taste buds continuously turn over and are replaced throughout life. The molecular mechanisms that direct the developmental innervation of taste buds, and maintain these constantly renewing functional connections throughout life, are still being elucidated. Neurotrophic factors are essential for the development and lifelong maintenance of sensory systems. Two members of the neurotrophin family, BDNF and NT-4, are well established as being critical for the survival of geniculate chemosensory neurons, and for their innervation of fungiform taste buds. The members of a second important family of neurotrophic factors, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs), are expressed in the tongue during the period of chemosensory innervation. The GFLs, which consist of GDNF, neurturin, artemin and persephin, are potent neurotrophic factors for subpopulations of somatosensory neurons, spinal motor neurons and autonomic neurons. We recently discovered that the signal-transducing receptor for the GFLs, Ret, is widely expressed in Phox2B+ chemosensory geniculate neurons early in development prior to their innervation of the tongue (greater than 70% at E13.5) and then becomes restricted to a subset (approximately 15%) of Phox2B+ chemosensory neurons in adulthood. This expression profile suggests that the GFL/Ret pathway may have two distinct developmentally regulated functions in the differentiation and maintenance of geniculate chemosensory neurons, but their role in the peripheral taste system is unexplored. Based on preliminary data presented in this proposal, our overarching hypothesis is that the GFL/Ret receptor complex is critically important for the early cell fate determination of geniculate chemosensory neurons, as well as for the life-long maintenance and function of physiologically distinct subpopulations of these neurons. In Specific Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that GDNF, NRTN and Ret are critical for the developmental specification of chemosensory neurons of the geniculate ganglion, as well as their peripheral innervation of fungiform taste buds and central innervation of the nucleus of the solitary tract. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that the GDNF/Ret receptor complex is necessary for the lifelong maintenance and physiology of a subset of lingual sensory neurons of the geniculate ganglion. The physiologic function of Ret+ lingual afferent neurons will be determined with chorda tympani nerve recordings in response to the various chemical stimuli and lingual modalities. The rationale for a mechanistic examination of the GFL/Ret pathway in geniculate neurons is that this may aid in the rational design of therapeutic interventions for diseases and injuries of peripheral neurons, and will bring novel insights to the development and maintenance of the peripheral taste system."
"9298718","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common and aggressive tumors of the brain with aberrant resistance to therapies. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that simultaneously suppress and/or activate the expression of multiple protein-encoding genes, and in so doing affect numerous cellular behaviors. Wnt pathway is of fundamental importance to development, tissue self-renewal and repair, cancer occurrence and progression. In GBM, miRs and Wnt signaling are dysregulated and contribute to tumor malignancies and therapeutic resistance. Glioma stem cells (GSC) are a cell subpopulation of primary GBM possess stem cell- like properties and is a key factor in glioma tumor recurrence and therapy resistance. We examined patient-derived GSCs displaying proneural (PN)- and mesenchymal (Mes)-like phenotypes of GBM, and found distinct molecular, biological, and therapeutic response characteristics in each. We also observed that in PN-like GSC relative to Mes-like GSC, two miRs, miR-125b and miR-20b are expressed at substantially high levels and that Wnt signaling is enriched. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that miR-125b and -20b modulate GSC tumor phenotypes. Significantly, there is a positive feedback loop in GSC where Wnt induces miR-125b and -20b while miR-125b/-20b target Wnt inhibitors APC and FZD6, enhancing Wnt activity. Moreover, radiation of GSC induced Mes-like phenotypes, attenuated Wnt pathway and decreased levels of miR-125b and -20b. Based on these novel observations, we hypothesize that miR-125b, -20b and Wnt pathway form a positive feedback loop in GBM, and this interaction regulates malignant behaviors as well as radiation-induced Mes-like GBM phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we propose to 1) define mechanisms by which miR-125b, miR-20b and Wnt signaling positively influence each other, and in so doing affect GSC malignant phenotypes; 2) determine whether miR-125b and miR-20b regulates GSC malignant phenotypes through Mes- associated genes in a dependent vs. an independent manner and 3) determine whether modulation of miR-125b/-20b and Wnt signaling regulates radiation-induced Mes-associated gene expression and phenotypes, and affects GBM tumor response to therapies. Our studies will help address an existing deficiency in understanding of how aberrant miR expression and Wnt signaling activity contribute to glioma malignancy. This knowledge, in turn, could lead to the identification of novel targets and more effective therapies for treating malignant gliomas."
"9287929","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Outbreaks of emerging pathogens are among the most unpredictable threats to health and personal welfare. The causes of pathogen emergence are variable and seemingly idiosyncratic. Although forecasting infectious disease emergence (and re-emergence) therefore seems intractable, new developments in epidemic modeling show that emergence events are united by patterns common among dynamical systems that cross tipping points. Particularly, it has recently been shown that tipping points in the transmission of infectious diseases influence epidemiological patterns in a way that leaves \signatures of their proximity. For instance, a statistical phenomenon called critical slowing down influences the variance and autocorrelation of data streams in characteristic ways. The long term objective of this study is to develop a theory for forecasting epidemic transitions before they occur, focusing on critical slowing down and other near-critical statistical patterns. Its specific aims are: (1) T develop theories of forecastability for emerging and eliminable infectious diseases; (2) to develop model-independent statistical methods for forecasting disease emergence based on this theory; (3) to document critical slowing down and other near-critical phenomena by comparing data on re-emerging and non-emerging pathogens; and (4) to produce software packages implementing these methods. The research strategy adopted by this project combines theoretical studies with data analysis in an empirically- driven feedback loop. The research design requires first the development of mathematical models of intermediate complexity allowing both mathematical solution and dynamic realism to represent contemporary emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Solutions of these models provide the basis for statistical algorithms for detecting early warning patterns in epidemiological data. These algorithms will be \stress-tested using computer simulations of emergence events, including both simple and complex scenarios for the conditions under which emergence occurs and the imperfect surveillance and reporting systems that generate data. The algorithms will then be applied to data on recent emergence and re-emergence of measles, pertussis, and rubella in populations from which these pathogens had been nearly eliminated; lessons learned from this empirical study will inform subsequent rounds of model development, simulation and validation.

In its most lethal form, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), heterogeneity correlates with aggressiveness, however no driver mutations distinguishing SCLC subtypes have been identified. Another singularity of SCLC is that it responds well to initial treatment but quickly relapses into resistance, suggesting phenotypic plasticity. In this basic project, we will investigate the role of transcriptional and signaling mechanisms in promoting SCLC phenotypic heterogeneity and plastic state transitions, leading to aggressiveness and rapid relapse. Our preliminary results indicate that SCLC heterogeneity is more extensive than the canonical neuroendocrine (NE) and mesenchymal-like (ML) subtypes, and includes multiple hybrid states. Most significantly, we found that drug treatment results in phenotypic transitions toward the hybrid states, implicating them in resistance. Based on these data, our central hypothesis is that SCLC is a heterogeneous mix of NE, ML and hybrid phenotypic states and that, due to phenotypic plasticity, transitions between these states is a key mechanism of treatment evasion in SCLC. To test this hypothesis, we will combine computation and experiments to characterize the global landscape of phenotypes in SCLC, and define the impact of phenotypic transitions on resistance. In Aim1, we will identify a regulatory transcription factor (TF) network that controls the differentiation of SCLC cells into NE, ML, and hybrid phenotypic states; validate model predicted phenotypes and quantify their drug sensitivity; and, define reprogramming pathways to drug- sensitive states. Our approach pipeline is comprised of phenotypic clustering and gene co-expression network analysis on SCLC tumor and cell line data, simulations of logic-based TF network models to prioritize TF targets for reprogramming, and experimental validation of model predictions in vitro and in vivo. In Aim2, we will quantify phenotype sensitivity to chemotherapy and plasticity in response to signaling perturbations; identify perturbations that promote phenotype switching; and, test optimal drug/perturbagen combinations that maximize SCLC cell killing under treatment. Phenotypes and signaling pathways will be defined by flow and mass cytometry. SCLC clonal dynamics in response to perturbations will be quantified using a stochastic phenotype transition to prioritize drug/perturbagen combinations for experimental validation. Drug sensitivity and plasticity of SCLC phenotypes will be assessed with the drug-induced proliferation rate metric, which we recently described, and time series single-cell flow or mass cytometry. Success of this project will have translational impact by empowering searches for targeted therapies that reprogram drug-resistant cells toward drug-sensitive cells, which we anticipate will lead to significantly improved patient outcomes in SCLC. We further anticipate that this approach will be useful in other cancer types, opening the doors to a new paradigm of cancer treatment based on epigenetic tumor reprogramming."
"9279187","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intrinsic disorder controls the function of p53 and other cancer-associated IDPs PI's Daughdrill/Chen Project Summary/Abstract -- p53 is a tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulator that is activated by protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Deletion or mutation of p53 can dramatically increase susceptibility to cancer. p53 is also an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). IDPs are highly dynamic, do not form stable tertiary structures, and contain variable amounts of transient secondary structure. IDP domains are hotspots for PTMs and they frequently mediate protein-protein interactions through coupled folding and binding. IDP domains that interact with other proteins can contain defined levels of transient secondary structure that resemble their complex-bound structure. These levels of residual structure can modulate binding affinities with other proteins by tuning the change in conformational entropy that occurs during the coupled folding and binding reaction. Our recent publication in Nature Chemical Biology showed that levels of residual helicity in the disordered p53 transcriptional activation domain (p53TAD) controlled the binding affinity to the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, both in vitro and inside living cells. The levelsof residual helicity in free p53TAD were controlled by conserved prolines flanking the Mdm2 binding site. Mutating these prolines to alanine resulted in higher p53TAD helicity and stronger Mdm2 binding. This stronger Mdm2 binding abrogates the effects of PTMs leading to more rapid degradation of p53 following DNA damage. Lower levels of p53 reduce target gene expression and prevent cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that precise levels of intrinsic disorder and residual helicity are necessary for regulating the p53-signaling network and changing the levels of disorder can modify the effects of phosphorylation and other PTMs. Studies from other groups have shown that PTMs can change intrinsic levels of disorder. Together levels of intrinsic disorder and PTM status allow IDP domains to dynamically respond to signaling changes in cellular networks. We propose to change the levels of intrinsic disorder in p53 and determine the effects on activation dynamics and target gene expression. We will also determine how intrinsic disorder combines with PTMs to control protein-protein interactions. Finally, we will investigate how the levels of intrinsic disorder in other cancer-associated IDPs control structure and function. The following specific aims are designed to accomplish these goals: Aim 1) Determine how intrinsic disorder controls the function of p53, Aim 2) Determine how intrinsic disorder combines with PTMs to control protein-protein interactions, and Aim 3) Determine how intrinsic disorder controls binding affinity and binding kinetics. To test these aims we will monitor the activation dynamics and target gene expression of p53 mutants using single-cell fluorescence microscopy, qPCR arrays, and reporter assays. To investigate how intrinsic disorder combines with PTMs to control protein-protein interactions and how intrinsic disorder controls binding affinity and binding kinetics we will primarily use NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and stopped-flow kinetics."
"9280632","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this grant application is to research, test and validate a bi-modal diagnostic platform combining optical and ultrasound imaging technologies for real-time, non-destructive in-vitro and in-vivo analysis of composition, structure function and site specific cellular repopulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds utilized fr vascular tissue engineering. The proposed approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of vascular tissue engineering and facilitate translation of engineered vascular material to clinical application. The non-destructive nature of the proposed platform enables repeated assessment of ECM scaffold and recellularized construct structure-function relationships both in-vitro and in-vivo. The proposed technology therefore alleviates the need for destructive analysis methods across multiple time points, which are costly, time consuming and frequently impractical. Moreover, the proposed technology will facilitate (a) in-vitro rapid screening of scaffold production methods and non-destructive assessment of batch quality; and (b) non- terminal in-vivo assessment across multiple time points, thereby providing mechanistic insights into engineered vascular tissue regenerative processes. The proposed bi-modal platform will integrate two non-ionizing radiation techniques for label-free tissue analysis: (1) Multispectral Time-Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy (TRFS) system for evaluation of ECM composition and biochemical heterogeneities of vascular biomaterials; and (2) High-frequency Ultrasound (US) imaging for evaluation of structural properties and morphology in vascular biomaterials. This is enabled by either Ultrasound Backscatter Microscopy (UBM) for planar scanning or conventional Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) for rotational scanning. Four specific aims will be addressed. Aim 1 is focused on developing a set of customized tools (instrumentation and data analysis methods) for in- vitro and in-vivo assessment of vascular scaffolds and constructs. Aim 2 in focused on demonstrating the feasibility of the bi-modal platform as a non-destructive tool for assessment of vascular scaffold properties. Aim 3 is focused on demonstrating the bi-modal platform's ability as a non-destructively tool for in-vitro studying and monitoring of vascular tissue construct formation. Aim 4 is focused on demonstrating the feasibility of the bi-modal technique as a non-destructive tool for monitoring the maturation of vascular constructs in-vivo post- implantation. In summary, the technology proposed for development and validation in this grant application offers a non-destructive solution for the evaluation of many important features (compositional, structural and functional) associated with the maturity and functionality of vascular biomaterials. This is likely to improve our ability to produce engineered vascular tissues in the laboratory for in-vivo implantation which can accelerate the integration time of the implant with the surrounding host tissue, thus restoring the desired quality of life to the patient. Emphasis will be placed on the evaluation of engineered vascular tissue, though, if successful, this non-destructive technique can be applied to assess a variety of engineered tissues."
"9280986","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors comprise two different classes, nucleos(t)ide RT inhibitors (NRTIs) and nonnucleoside RTIs (NNRTIs), which act by entirely different mechanisms. However, their extensive use has led to the emergence of drug resistance mutations that may affect use of new RTIs. As new drugs like rilpivirine (RPV) become increasingly available to patients infected with HIV strains of subtypes other than B (HIV-nonB), it is important to understand how RPV resistance-associated mutations determined in HIV-1B samples (RAMB) affect susceptibility patterns in both drug-nave or -treated HIV-nonB patients. This proposal aims to understand differences in drug resistance among different HIV subtypes (HIV-1B vs. HIV-nonB). Recent collaborative clinical data (with A. Snnerborg and U. Neogi) identified RAMBs in treatment-nave (6- 11%, depending on subtype) and nevirapine (NVP) or efavirenz (EFV)-based therapy-failed patients (22-34%, depending on subtype). Hence, it is hypothesized that patients who failed NVP/EFV-based therapy are more likely to fail RPV-based therapy. Moreover, patients treated with TDF/FTC/RPV failed therapy through RPV- associated mutations in ~9% of HIV-1B patients compared to ~25% of HIV-nonB patients. Preliminary analysis of RT sequences from clinical cohorts of HIV-1B and HIV-nonB patients that are treatment-nave or -failed (NVP/EFV-based) showed an increase in prevalence of predicted RAMBs. Hence, it is also hypothesized that RPV resistance emerges through different mechanisms in various subtypes. Furthermore, until recently, it was thought resistance to one class of RTIs was unrelated to the other. However, RT connection subdomain mutations (CSMs), namely N348I in HIV-1B, have been identified, which give multi-class drug resistance (MCDR) to both NRTIs and NNRTIs. It is hypothesized that CSMs affect MCDR differently in various HIV subtypes. The following aims will be addressed: SA 1. Determine how the presence of CSMs and RAMBs affect RPV susceptibility of HIV-1B and -nonB SA 2. Virologically characterize the contribution of CSMs and RAMBs on fitness and multi-class resistance in multiple subtypes SA 3. Unravel biochemical and structural mechanisms of the MCDR phenotype in HIV-1B and HIV-nonB The goal of this application is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying MCDR and how CSMs may impact the RPV susceptibility of different HIV subtypes, providing important insights into the feasibility of RPV as first-line therapy in HIV 1B and HIV-nonB patients."

Following this we will build a predictive digital computational model of regulatory specification throughout the  embryo from a few h after fertilization to 30h, including all interactions between domains, using the approach  and software recently applied to the endomesodermal half of the embryo. A second objective is to utilize  synthetic re-engineering to ascertain the logic processing functions and to answer other questions about the  meaning of particular network subcircuit designs encountered in the sea urchin endomesoderm GRN.  Specifically we will target double negative gate circuitry, feedback circuitry, and also redeploy differentiation  gene batteries.

"9287767","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical inactivity is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality. Adequate sleep is essential for health, but paradoxically, sleep also represents our longest period of inactivity and could therefore compromise circulatory function. Indeed, adverse CV events, including sudden cardiac death, and myocardial infarction all have their highest incidence in the morning, soon after awakening i.e., immediately following this longest period of inactivity that accompanies sleep. In healthy humans, my mentor's research team discovered that our internal body clock causes many (CV) disease risk markers to peak at this time in the morning. These markers include sympatho-vagal responses to stress, markers of thrombosis or clot formation, and the stress hormone cortisol. Additionally, diurnal studies indicate that vascular endothelial function (VEF), which is a strong predictor of CV disease, is also impaired in the early morning. This increased morning risk could be due to individual effects on vascular function of prior sleep or inactivity (so-called `behavioral effects), an internal circadian rhythm, or an interaction between behavioral and circadian effects. To determine whether the inactivity or sleep does pose a potential risk factor, in particular in regards to vascular function, the applicant plans to assess the effects of sleep and inactivity on arterial VEF and, the effect of the endogenous circadian system on vascular function. Our specific aims are to: 1) determine if endogenous circadian rhythms in VEF during rested wakefulness show a trough around 9 AM; and 2) test the separate effects of physical inactivity and sleep on VEF. Our exploratory aims are to: 1) determine the effect of a standardized day on VEF at different circadian phases; and 2) determine the effect of increased physical activity on VEF immediately after awakening. Although the applicant brings expertise in VEF to the laboratory, other dependent CV risk markers will also be measured as part of the associated R01-funded project, including measures of hemodynamics and autonomic nervous system activity. To document circadian rhythms, subjects will spend 5 days in a laboratory in a constant environment and will live on recurring 5h 20min days during which behavior is tightly controlled. To document effects of sleep and inactivity, participants will spend two nights in the laboratory in two experimental conditions in a randomized order: 1) sleep combined with inactivity and 2) wakefulness combined with inactivity. By assessing novel mechanisms by which circadian rhythms and inactivity can affect CV risk, this study will set the foundation for future preventive interventions that could include passive motion during sleep, extending the habitual timing of sleep to avoid risky activities during the vulnerable time window, and to study populations at risk of CV disease, such as those with prediabetes, prehypertension, elderly, obese and those who are physically inactive. This project will set the basis for research that will in the long term, enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives."
"9281074","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A notable determinant of human intellectual capacity is the enormous size and complexity of our neocortex. The neocortex forms during embryogenesis and then expands during fetal development when progenitors differentiate to populate the cortical plate. Defects in brain growth and morphogenesis result in a host of neurodevelopmental disorders, neuropsychiatric diseases, and intellectual disabilities. A key step towards understanding the normal and abnormal functions of the brain thus lies in defining the mechanisms driving neocortical growth. Progress towards this goal has been made though the identification of functionally distinct neural progenitor populations, most prominently ventricular radial glia (vRG), intermediate progenitor (IP), and basal/outer radial glia (bRG) cell. These classes of progenitors are common to both rodents and humans. However, recent studies have proposed that the neocortical enlargement and complexity seen in humans may result in part from a substantial increase in the genesis of bRG and IP cells that is not seen in rodents. Remarkably little is known about the mechanisms behind this human-specific expansion. Our preliminary experiments implicate Foxp transcription factors as important components to this process. Foxp1 and Foxp4 are expressed in the human neocortex as vRG cells transform into bRG and IP cells, and altering Foxp1 and Foxp4 functions in mouse changes cortical development in a manner suggesting that they play pivotal roles controlling the production of bRG and IP cells respectively. In this proposal, we will determine the function of Foxp proteins in both mouse and human cortical development. In Aim 1 we will characterize the expression of Foxp proteins in the developing mouse and human neocortex. In Aim 2, we will determine how manipulation of Foxp functions alters the generation of bRG and IP cells, and the overall size and structure of the cerebral cortex. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will define the genomic targets of Foxp proteins mediating their contributions to neocortical growth."
"9279226","Lung disease continues to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Gene transfer offers the potential to express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and thereby prevent or treat lung disease. But, we lack answers to many questions that are crucial for developing gene transfer. A major impediment to progress has been lack of animal models with disease that mimics human CF. To overcome this roadblock, we developed a porcine model of CF that spontaneously develops lung disease. We discovered that loss of CFTR impairs the activity of antimicrobials in airway surface liquid (ASL) and hinders mucociliary transport (MCT). In both cases, loss of CFTR-mediated bicarbonate secretion and an abnormally acidic pH are key factors. We also developed novel assays of these host defense mechanisms for both in vitro and in vivo experiments. We will use this novel model and assays to answer questions that are key for advancing CF treatments. First, How does CFTR expression level and the fraction of cells expressing CFTR affect airway epithelial ion transport and host defense processes? Answering this question will for the first time provide key data about relationships between specific CFTR functions and host defense. Second, will CFTR expression correct host defense defects and prevent and/or treat CF lung disease in vivo? We will develop CF pigs with inducible expression of CFTR in epithelia and test the hypotheses a) that expressing CFTR in airways rescues host defense processes, b) that CFTR expression beginning shortly after birth prevents airway infection, inflammation and remodeling, c) that expressing less than wild-type levels of CFTR in airway epithelia is sufficient to prevent lung disease, and d) that CFTR expression after disease onset treats or reverses airway disease. Third, will expressing CFTR in ciliated cells rescue host defense defects and prevent clinical CF lung disease? If ciliated cell expression prevents lung disease, it will mark ciliated cells as a key target for gene transfer. If not, the data will guide studies that identify key therapeutic targets. Results from this work and synergism with Projects 1 & 3 will inform strategies for gene transfer and other therapies."
"9274345","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Torsins are essential members of the AAA+ (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) superfamily and have been implicated in protein quality control, modulation of membrane morphology, and nuclear envelope dynamics. Four different Torsin proteins are known in humans. For years Torsins were thought to lack ATPase activity. Correspondingly, the precise cellular functions and the mechanistic roles of Torsin ATPases remained largely elusive. This gap in our knowledge hinders a comprehensive understanding of the etiology of congenital disorders caused by mutations in the Torsin system, including the severe movement disorder DYT1 dystonia. Importantly, our recent work has revealed that Torsins are ATPases whose activity requires LAP1 or LULL1, which are membrane-spanning cofactors that associate with Torsins to form a composite, membrane-spanning machine. Advances in our functional and mechanistic understanding of Torsin ATPases will require (i) definition of the structure and dynamics of the membrane-bound Torsin/cofactor assembly, (ii) identification of the cellular targets of the Torsin/cofactor machinery, and (iii) functional dissection of Torsin/cofactor action on substrates. In this proposal, we will capitalize on our established proteoliposome system to investigate the structural dynamics of full-length Torsin assembly with and without its cofactors via cryo-electron microscopy (Aim 1). We will utilize a novel methodology to overcome the poor solubility of Torsin substrates, allowing for substrate identification via a subtractive proteomic approach (Aim 2). The substrates, and their dependence on Torsin/cofactor action, will be analyzed in a cellular context, using genetic deletions in concert with different imaging techniques, as well as in reconstituted systems (Aim 3). The elucidation of Torsin function and mechanism -as well as its dysfunction resulting from disease-associated mutations- will enable the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of Torsin-related movement disorders, which are the most common inherited movement disorders known."

"9306928","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asian Indians have high rates of diabetes, prediabetes and cardio metabolic risk factors. There is strong evidence that lifestyle change, particularly weight loss, increasing physical activity, and improving diet quality can prevent or delay diabetes, reduce cardiometabolic risk factors such as elevated glucose, plasma lipids, and blood pressure, and improve outcomes among individuals with diabetes. Implementing lifestyle change education and support at the worksite may be an effective and cost-effective method to deliver prevention in a way that is acceptable, accessible, and sustainable and overcomes barriers to lifestyle change (e.g., lack of time or resources). Building off previous work by the international study team, this study proposes implementing and evaluating in a pre-post design trial the acceptability, delivery, effectiveness, and cost- effectiveness of a worksite-based lifestyle improvement package including a peer-led lifestyle change education program augmented with changes in the worksite environment that promote social support, healthy eating and exercise. The lifestyle education program will include 2000 adults with prediabetes (HbA1c of 5.7- 6.4%) or unmedicated diabetes (HbA1c = 6.5% identified at screening) across eight diverse worksites in India (changes to the worksite environment will impact a much broader population of employees). A mixed methods approach will be used to evaluate implementation of the program. The study aims to measure: (1) Success of implementation in terms of program adoption (participation and changes in weight and diet and physical activity behaviors among lifestyle class participants); fidelity to the program (activities of study-affiliaed worksite staff; changes to the food options at the worksite canteen; management support for the program; and changes in the worksite environment); and program acceptability as reported by employees, managers, supervisors, and lifestyle education program participants and dropouts during in-depth, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. (2) Program effectiveness by evaluating the number of cardiometabolic risk goals reached for reductions in blood pressure, triglycerides, and HbA1c (the primary outcome) and through changes in secondary outcomes including rates of diabetes incidence and regression to normoglycemia and changes in anthropometry, lipids, and fasting glucose. (3) Value and return on the investment of the program for employers by assessing program costs, cost-effectiveness, and changes in staff productivity, absenteeism, health status, and quality of life. This project will deliver scientific innovations (lifestyle education programs with text message supports during maintenance) with social innovations (educated peer health educators delivering a program to a large at risk population) and business innovation (worksite stakeholder commitment and partnering researchers to help deliver the program with fidelity, improve the workplace health environment, and evaluate the model). If the program is shown to be feasible, acceptable, effective, and cost-effective at these worksites, the program could be disseminated to other worksites throughout India and elsewhere."
"9281925","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the viscera and central nervous system. A barrier to the development of treatments for NPC1 disease is the lack of readily quantifiable outcome measures to evaluate efficacy of therapy in clinical trials. Through broad-based metabolomic efforts, we have discovered in NPC1 subjects cholesterol oxidation product (oxysterol) biomarkers that reflect the unique intersection of oxidative stress and unesterified cholesterol storage - the biochemical hallmark of NPC1 disease. This proposal tests the highly innovative hypothesis that oxysterol biomarkers, together with other cholesterol homeostatic markers, can serve as outcome measures to assess the effect of disease-modifying therapies (e.g., 2-hydroxypropyl-?-cyclodextrin, HP-?-CD) on cholesterol metabolism in the CNS and to monitor disease progression. 24(S)-HC, which is synthesized almost exclusively in large neurons in the CNS, and CSF cholesteryl esters (CE) offer potential quantitative, non-invasive metrics to guide dosing and to monitor drug response. Likewise, cholestane-3?, 5?, 6?-triol (triol), which we have previously shown to be elevated in the CSF of NPC1 subjects, will inform with respect to the effect of HP-?-CD on intraneuronal cholesterol storage. This hypothesis will be tested in NPC1 animal models administered intracerebroventricular (ICV) HP-?-CD (Aim 1), and in NPC1 human subjects enrolled in a natural history study and in a Phase 1 trial for ICV HP-?-CD at the NIH Clinical Center (Aim 2). The proposal will also explore the possibility that the exceptional receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of the triol assay can be harnessed to develop a newborn screen to identify NPC1 patients earlier and thus intervene in pre-symptomatic patients (Aim 3). The proposed newborn screen for NPC1 disease is innovative and would be the first for a non-enzymatic lysosomal disorder, as well as the first for an inborn error of sterol metabolism. While the goal of this project is to develop a prototype newborn screen for NPC1 disease suitable for implementation at the statewide or regional level, the tandem mass spectrometry methods developed for extraction and detection of the oxysterols could be readily extended to metabolites that accumulate in other sterol disorders (e.g., Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome), thereby permitting multiplexed screening for several inherited disorders within the context of a single screen. The studies in this proposal are highly significant because we address the critical unmet therapeutic and diagnostic needs of NPC1 disease."

In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic Cl will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III] reading comprehension subtest score) and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the Cl Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of Cl (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence at near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudoword decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1-year post treatment.  This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and o retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center.  Symptomatic Cl is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of Cl treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9330394","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT for The 5th International RASopathies Symposium The 5th International RASopathies Symposium will be held July 28-30, 2017 at the Renaissance Orlando Hotel. The meeting chairs are Katherine A. Rauen, MD, PhD, from the University of California, Davis and Frank McCormick, PhD, FRS, from the National Cancer Institute. Leaders of the RASopathy Network, Lisa Schoyer, MFA (PI), Lisa Schill, BS (Co-I), and Beth Stronach, PhD (Co-I) are parent advocates and will help organize and manage meeting logistics. The symposium will overlap with the Costello Syndrome Family Network conference and provide programming relevant to families with other RASopathies (see below). The Ras/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is an important biologic pathway with broad developmental impact. This signaling pathway plays an essential role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, senescence, and apoptosis, all of which have been studied in the context of cancer. This pathway is also critical to normal development as Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation has profound deleterious effects on both embryonic and later stages of development. The RASopathies are a group of medical genetic syndromes that are caused by germline mutations in genes that encode components, both positive and negative regulators, of the Ras/MAPK pathway. These syndromes, which share many overlapping phenotypic characteristics, include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome (NS), NS with multiple lentigines (NSML), Legius syndrome, Costello syndrome (CS), cardio-facio- cutaneous syndrome (CFC), capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM), and autosomal dominant intellectual disability type 5. Together, the RASopathies represent a common group of developmental malformation syndromes affecting more than 1 in 1000 individuals. Hence, they offer a novel window of opportunity to investigate the role of the Ras pathway in human development and oncogenesis. RASopathies are caused by several pathogenetic mechanisms that alter the normal function and regulation of the MAPK pathway. Although these mechanisms are diverse, the common underlying biochemical phenotype shared by all the RASopathies is Ras/MAPK pathway dysregulation. This symposium will focus on the germline mechanisms of Ras/MAPK activation and dysfunction. It is to be a forum for researchers, clinicians, trainees, and affected families to share and discuss basic science and clinical issues to set forth a framework for future research, translational applications directed towards therapy, and best clinical practices for Ras/MAPK pathway syndromes. Though this is the fifth such meeting, the inclusion of many stakeholders in the scheme of developing effective therapies is integral to future scientific breakthroughs."
"9281903","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A key molecule in the pathology of ongoing inflammation in COPD is the collagen fragment proline-glycine- proline (PGP). From the CCRN Macrolide trial, we found that PGP levels markedly declined in concert with azithromycin's ability to reduce COPD exacerbation frequency. To our knowledge, PGP was the only biomarker studied that showed such a profound response. More recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that PGP is negatively regulated by leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H). LTA4H is a unique enzyme which possesses both a hydrolase and aminopeptidase catalytic site. Although the hydrolase site of LTA4H is well- known to catalyze the conversion of leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4 (a PMN chemoattractant), the substrate of the aminopeptidase activity was unknown. In a pivotal Science paper in 2010, our group demonstrated that the aminopeptidase activity degrades PGP, thereby leading to less neutrophilic (PMN) inflammation. As such, LTA4H is both pro-inflammatory (hydrolase) and anti-inflammatory (aminopeptidase) at baseline serving as a critical pivot in inflammatory responses. Cigarette smoke can upregulate the total amount of LTA4H as well as chemically modify and inactivate LTA4H's aminopeptidase but not hydrolase activity thus leaving LTB4 generation intact while allowing for chronic accumulation of inflammatory levels of PGP. Therefore, the regulation of this enzyme's amount and activities may have a crucial role in airway inflammation associated with COPD. In fact, we found marked elevation in amount but reduction in LTA4H aminopeptidase activity in smoking and COPD cohorts compared to non-lung disease cohorts although there was notable variability in each of these groups suggesting that the interaction between environment and genetics may play a key feature in COPD disease progression. In fact, previous genetic analyses have revealed a number of polymorphisms in the promoter and coding regions of LTA4H that showed associations with a variety of inflammatory disorders including COPD. In this proposal to assign alterations in LTA4H protein levels and enzyme activity to associated SNPs, we will examine genetic variation in the putative promoter region of LTA4H to determine impact on LTA4H protein levels both in vitro and in vivo. We will also explore the role of SNPs in the coding regio of LTA4H on its activity. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that variability in expression and enzymatic activity of LTA4H impacts COPD susceptibility and related phenotypes, thus genetic variation affecting LTA4H expression and aminopeptidase function impacts COPD-related phenotypes. Such human studies are only now possible as a result of the COPDGene program, the renewal of which provides a time-sensitive window to conduct these paradigm establishing studies."
"9268693","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Autoimmunity Center of Excellence based at the Baylor Institute for Immunology Research in Dallas, Texas aims at 1) advancing the knowledge of pathways and mechanisms that contribute to the development and amplification of Human Systemic Autoimmunity, and 2) developing assays and tools to monitor these dysfunctional pathways in patients. The specific proposed research focuses on characterizing triggers, sensors and helpers of systemic autoimmunity. It capitalizes on the availability of samples from pediatric patients, who manifest disease early in life, often present extreme phenotypes and lack co-morbidities that confound the phenotypes. It will focus on diseases where breakdown of tolerance to Nucleic Acids (NAs) and dysregulated production of Type I Interferon (IFN) and/or Follicular Helper T cells (Tfh) play central pathogenic roles. While the initial focus will be the study of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), extrapolation of the Center findings to other systemic autoimmune disease scenarios will be pursued.     To this end, BIIR has gathered a highly integrated multidisciplinary team composed of scientists     (including immunologists, molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, software engineers) and Physician-     Scientists/Clinicians. This multidisciplinary team has worked efficiently together for several years at bed-to bench and bench-to-bed translation to meet the challenges of Human Immunology and Medicine. BIIR has also established strong national and international collaborations. The Center will employ in vitro culture techniques using patient cells and knock-down assays of cell lines and primary human cells, immune profiling strategies reflecting human immune status and function, and an extensive infrastructure to support patient-based studies. Throughout the performance of these mechanistic studies, BIIR recognized the fundamental value of data sharing, data integration and data visualization. Thus, significant efforts have been  placed at developing the right bioinformatics and software tools to make possible that clinical and research data provide the most useful information to advance clinical and basic discoveries.          RELEVANCE: The ACE at Baylor aims at 1) advancing the knowledge of mechanisms that contribute to the development and amplification of Human Systemic Autoimmunity, and 2) developing tools to monitor these dysfunctional pathways in patients. The proposed research focuses on triggers, sensors, and helpers of systemic autoimmunity and capitalizes on the availability of samples from pediatric patients who often have extreme cases of autoimmune disease.          Principal Project: Novel Pathogenic Roles for Interferon and Autoantibodies in Human SLE     Project Leader (PL): Virginia Pascual          DESCRIPTION (as provided by applicant): Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by widespread inflammation and development of autoantibodies against nucleic acids (NAs). SLE pathogenesis is not fully understood but genomic studies support an interplay between innate and adaptive immunity. Pathogenic loops involving immune complex(IC)-containing NAs that activate innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), platelets and neutrophils through the endosomal TLR pathway result in plasmacytoid DC (pDC) activation and release of type I IFN. Excessive production and/or sensing of NAs is emerging as a fundamental and upstream event in SLE, and over-expression of IFN-inducible transcriptional signatures is a universal finding, especially in early onset SLE. We and others recently reported that neutrophils release DNA-protein complexes that activate pDCs, thus acting as Danger-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs). DAMPS are extruded upon neutrophil activation with SLE immune complexes (ICs) and directly activate pDCs in an FcB-independent and TLR9-dependent manner. Our preliminary data now show that these DAMPs are composed of damaged (oxidized) mitochondrial DNA-protein complexes (mtDAMPs) released upon type I IFN and anti-Sm/RNP mediated endosomal TLR7 activation of neutrophils. This combination of     stimuli impairs the detoxification of oxidized mtDNA through lysosomal degradation, which is a fundamental step leading to the extrusion of interferogenic mtDAMPs. Here, we propose 1) to characterize the basic mechanisms that lead to neutrophil mitochondrial damage and release of mtDAMPs in SLE, 2) to identify the interferogenic components of mtDAMPs and the mechanisms responsible for their internalization in pDCs, and 3) to characterize the effects of SLE mtDAMPs on non-hemopoietic cells that become the target of inflammation in SLE, especially endothelial cells. Overall, these studies will provide a better understanding of how breakdown of tolerance to NAs and dysregulation of the IFN pathway are interconnected and amplify each other. These studies will bring novel insight into SLE autoantibody pathogenic roles and perpetuation of IFN-amplification loops.          RELEVANCE: Our work supports a previously unsuspected role for neutrophils as a link between lupus-specific nucleic acid-recognizing antibodies and amplification loops for type I IFN production and eventually B cell help. Completion of the project goals will lead to better understanding of these pathways and to the identification of novel therapeutic targets."
"9332683","Project Summary Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), as the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults, affects approximately 1 in 500 individuals and is characterized by diastolic dysfunction, fibrotic tissue formation, impaired contractile properties and, most evidently, left ventricle hypertrophy and increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. To date, there are no effective non-invasive therapies for HCM. Mutations in sarcomeric proteins?including cardiac troponin C (cTnC), the Ca2+ sensor in contraction?seem to be the causative agents in the disease. The disease mechanisms and how the various mutations lead to myopathy, however, are poorly understood. More specifically, the Ala8Val (A8V) mutation in cTnC has been identified among HCM patients and within three independent probands and led us to develop the knock-in mouse model based on its pathogenicity. The A8V mutation in humans and mice causes left ventricular hypertrophy and hypercontractility, atrial enlargement, and increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity (the latter only tested in mice). Recently, cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK) knock-out mice were shown to exhibit reduced ejection fraction. This is attributed to the reduction in regulatory myosin light chain phosphorylation, which is known to decrease myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. Consequently, we hypothesize that a conditional cMLCK knock-out of a cTnC-A8V (HCM phenotype) mouse can normalize cardiac function toward wild-type. We believe this will improve heart morphology, hemodynamics, and protein expression levels, as measured via ECHO, pressure-volume loops, histopathology, heart to tibia length ratios, cardiomyocyte Ca2+ and twitch transients, and western blots for Ca2+ handling proteins. In addition, we will use advanced bioinformatics tools such as proteomics and RNA sequencing to quantify overall changes in these mouse models. Cardiac myosin light chain kinase has thus far been characterized as a dedicated kinase, making it a promising therapeutic target. As such, the proposed work can set the stage for novel, targeted heart disease therapy for HCM."
"9278179","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Site-specific DNA-protein interactions play a central role in all aspects of biology. This proposal focuses on the dynamics in protein-DNA complexes, forging links between the internal dynamics and measures of affinity and specificity. Binding of proteins to proximal sites on DNA is often cooperative, and the DNA itself may mediate cooperativity. Thus, the dynamics of both protein and DNA may influence neighboring interactions. Using the highly specific interaction of EcoRV endonuclease with DNA as a model, we investigate two probes of the dynamics: (a) DNA sequence context around the recognition site, which likely affects the energetic cost of DNA bending and the optimization of positions throughout the complex; (b) Lu3+ ions that bind in the active sites as Mg2+ surrogates and neutralize electrostatic repulsion between protein and DNA. Both probes have large effects on binding (1900-fold range for context, 22,000-fold for addition of metal ions) and markedly enhance specificity. Both have profound effects on the heat capacity change ?CP associated with EcoRV-DNA binding. ?CP is a key hallmark of specific protein-DNA interactions, because a large decrease in the heat capacity (?CP<<0) occurs for specific complexes, but not nonspecific complexes. It thus reflects goodness of fit in a protein-DNA interface. Flanking triple variation does not cause changes in the structure of the EcoRV-DNA complex or the degree of surface desolvation, thus greatly simplifying the analysis. Thermodynamic data suggest that the effects on ?CP are likely due to differences in dynamics of the protein-DNA complex and are too large to be merely local; preliminary NMR studies of methyl relaxation support this. Our central hypotheses are that both these factors tune dynamic freedom in the complex and that restricted dynamics make a dominant contribution to a negative ?CP.  Thermodynamic studies on EcoRV-DNA complexes will measure probe-dependent variation in free energy, enthalpy, entropy and ?CP. NMR dynamics studies will determine whether dynamic changes due to DNA context, ions and active-site mutations map to distinct regions. Methyl carbon relaxation and exchange dispersion measurements will be used to characterize local ps-ns and s-ms motions of the protein. DNA dynamics will be assessed using relaxation and exchange dispersion of 31P, 19F, 15N and 13C groups in DNA. This includes a novel use of DNA phosphorothioates for NMR dynamics studies. Generalized NMR order parameters and their temperature-dependences will be used to relate dynamics to thermodynamic differences in ?S and ?CP. This project will thus illuminate how metal ions constrain conformational fluctuations to those on the path to the catalytic transition state, a potentially critical factor in catalysis y a wide variety of phosphodiesterases and other metalloenzymes. This can have important implications for design of drugs targeting key enzymes of infectious, genetic or metabolic diseases."
"9478475","Understanding of regulatory elements in the human genome is a key step in our ability to understand complex biological and disease systems. Regulatory elements are much more difficult to identify than genes and likely account for more variation among individuals than actual coding differences in genes. Identifying and studying elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, and insulators, will lead to new therapeutic strategies as the complex regulatory networks are revealed. Up to now the characterization and validation of truly functional regulatory elements has been a low throughput endeavor as each regulatory site is cloned into a reporter assay and tested. This proposal produces a novel method that performs one of the most common validation assays, transient transfections, in a high-throughput manner by combining it with an innovative sorting and sequencing system. This system, which has been shown to be practical and feasible, will allow for rapid and thorough identification of the method of action of regulatory elements throughout the human genome.  The candidate's background in both computer science and molecular biology ranging from undergraduate to graduate school and post-doctoral work provides a complete background that should allow for implementation and extension of the described experiment in the post-doctoral environment. The nature of the science and the data produced should allow continuation and extension of the work as a new faculty member. Stanford and the Snyder lab provide an outstanding environment for a strong program allowing development of the candidate and preparation for transition to a long-term independent research career. As part of this program, the candidate will combine a mentoring committee with continuing education via available online courses.  The end result of both phases of the program will be scientific results that can be extended into useful and important medically and scientifically relevant areas as they relate to regulation of expression in humans. The innovative methods described will allow the candidate to pursue various lines of endeavor well past the end of this funding program. In turn the candidate will be positioned at the end of the program to function as an independent principle investigator and valuable collaborator."
"9275842","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a great need for positive contrast agents for ultra-high field strength (e7 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enable increased spatial resolution and sensitivity to disease states in both preclinical and clinical research. Our long-term goal is to develop positive contrast agents for ultra-high field strength MRI to fill this voi in diagnostic medicine by focusing on EuII complexes that are among the most promising areas of study. The overall objective of this application is to establish the groundwork necessary for translation of our new EuII-based complexes into useful contrast agents by maximizing stability, optimizing imaging properties, and evaluating toxicity. The rationale that underpins the proposed research is that EuII can be stabilized against oxidation and rendered non-toxic in vivo through ligand modification and formulation with antioxidants as we have recently demonstrated. The expected outcome of this proposal is the establishment of EuII-based complexes for use as contrast agents in ultra-high field strength MRI. This outcome is expected to have a positive impact by contributing to the NIH's mission in the diagnosis of human diseases. We plan to achieve the objective of the proposal by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to chemically enhance the stabilities and imaging-relevant parameters of our EuII-containing complexes; (2) to characterize the toxicity of our EuII- containing complexes; and (3) to characterize the in vivo imaging properties of our EuII-containing complexes. The new EuII-based probes will be significant because they are expected to enable diagnostic images to be acquired at ultra-high field strengths with higher resolution in less time than those currently acquired at clinical field strengths. Furthermore, because ultra-high field strengths are commonplace in NIH-supported preclinical research, this proposal is expected to maximize returns in the many other investments of the NIH related to MRI."
"9282531","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major current focus of modern structural biology is the determination of the structures of macromolecular assemblies and machines. Such systems are often not amenable to high-resolution x-ray crystallographic techniques. This proposal aims to develop powerful new methods which integrate NMR data, information from homologous structures, cryo electron microscopy data, low resolution x-ray crystallographic data, evolutionary covariance data, and other sources of information to generate models with atomic level accuracy for macromolecular assemblies and machines. With collaborators, the new methodology will be used to solve cutting-edge structural biology problems which cannot be solved by currently available methods. The new methodology will be incorporated into the freely available Rosetta software suite for use throughout the scientific community."
"9254056","Galera Therapeutics is developing selective, small molecule, superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetics for the prevention of radiation-induced toxicities in cancer patients and for the treatment of cancer. In vivo studies demonstrated that Galera mimetics did not interfere with the anti-tumor actions of standard chemotherapeutic or radiation therapy, and in fact, based on preclinical studies in an animal model of lung cancer, the mimetics may sensitive tumors to radiation. One such agent, GC4419, recently completed a multicenter Phase 1b/2a with Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and concurrent cisplatin, to reduce the incidence and severity of oral mucositis (OM) in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity or oropharynx (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01921426) and is currently enrolling patients for a Phase 2 trial in a similar patient population (NCT 02508389). In this FastTrack application, Galera proposes to evaluate GC4419 as a radioprotectant in patients receiving Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for the treatment of lung cancer. The conduct of this research study will be contingent on the continued success in NCT01921426/ NCT02508389 and the results of the preclinical studies described in Phase 1 of this proposal. The specific aims for Phase 1 are: 1) to quantify the ability of GC4419 to prevent pulmonary damage measured via CT imaging, immunohistochemistry and histology in mice exposed to SBRT-like regimens, and 2) to evaluate the effect of GC4419 on a panel of 49 circulating cytokines, growth factors and redox markers to gauge the predictive value for subsequent clinical studies. For Phase 2 of the proposal, a single arm Phase 2 clinical study will assess the effects of GC4419 on SBRT- related pulmonary toxicity in patients with early stage lung cancer and limited metastatic lung disease. It is predicted that GC4419 will reduce the levels of DLCO loss post-SBRT due to its ability to suppress fibrosis and inflammation and ultimately reduce the frequency of patients with significant DLCO changes from baseline. The dose of GC4419 for the present study will be selected based on results from the ongoing Phase I OM trial (NCT01921426) and from the in vivo studies in Phase 1 of this application. The specific aims for Phase 2 are: 1) to assess the efficacy of GC4419 in limiting pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving SBRT as measured by pulmonary function with DLCO changes the primary endpoint, and 2) to evaluate levels of clinical and radiographic pneumonitis; radiographic evidence of pulmonary fibrosis; the effect of GC4419 and SBRT on progression free survival; obtain preliminary information about the anti-tumor effect of the combination of GC4419 and SBRT. If successful, the results of this study will enable further Phase II studies intended to improve the treatment outcomes for NSCLC patients."
"9265483","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a first submission to the NIH Pathway to Independence (K99/R00). Dr. Thompson is establishing herself as an independent investigator in the field of fetal programming, with a particular emphasis on maternal metabolic dysfunction and vascular risk in the offspring. This grant will be critical to achieve the following short and long-term objectives: 1) to acquire additional training in technical skills and scientific knowledg, particularly with respect to vascular function and signaling; 2) to develop an independent project using a model of gestational diabetes that will be serve as a foundation for an independent research program, and 3) to become an independently funded scientist at the forefront of cardiovascular programming. Dr. Thompson has assembled a multidisciplinary team, including mentor, co-mentor and consultants that will guide her career towards independence and assist with the completion of the research proposed in this application. By the end of the funding period of this K99/R00 award, it is expected that Dr. Thompson will have published several high- impact first and last author papers and successfully competed for subsequent NIH funding. The overall objective of the research plan is to explore the impact of metabolic dysfunction on cardiovascular risk throughout the lifespan. In the K99 phase, Dr. Thompson will utilize a dual transgenic mouse model whereby db/db mice are interbred with mice lacking the NADPH enzyme, Nox1, in order to isolate the role of Nox1 in the development of microvascular dysfunction in the context of the metabolic syndrome. Briefly, using gold-standard techniques such as myography and telemetry, cardiovascular function will be measured in db/db and lean mice with and without Nox1 deletion. This mentored project will furnish Dr. Thompson with conceptual and technical skills that will supplement her doctoral training in fetal physiology, and facilitate her independent investigation into the relationship between vascular disease and metabolic complications of pregnancy. In the R00 phase, Dr. Thompson will characterize the cardiometabolic phenotype of offspring born to Hetdb female mice, a novel model of GDM. With use of the same gold-standard techniques proposed for the K99 studies, Dr. Thompson will measure cardiovascular function in offspring born from hyperglycemic or normal pregnancy, with or without a secondary postnatal insult. In order to determine if programmed phenotypic changes trace to the intrauterine hyperglycemic environment, responses to inflammatory/redox stimuli will be measured in vascular cells isolated at term and at various postnatal time-points. This project will set the stage for future investigation into molecular mechanisms linking hyperglycemic pregnancy to abnormal vascular phenotype and allow Dr. Thompson to lay claim to this important field of study."
"9335393","ABSTRACT  The Magnetic Resonance Imaging Core, located in the Sleep Imaging Center will act as a central facility to  handle and process the large number of MRI's (in both humans and mice) and MR data analysis generated by  Projects 1 and 3. The objectives of the Imaging Core are to: 1) transfer data from the MRI to the Sleep  Imaging Center; 2) ensure proper data analysis of the MR images; 3) perform quantitative volumetric analysis  of upper airway soft tissue and craniofacial structures and visceral abdominal fat in humans with MRI and  quantify tongue fat with Dixon imaging; 4) perform quantitative volumetric analysis of upper airway soft tissue  and visceral abdominal fat in mice with MRI and quantify tongue fat with Dixon imaging; 5) ensure quality  control of the human and mice MR images; and 6) establish new automated computer analysis three-  dimensional image analysis programs. The MR images will be electronically transferred to the Sleep Imaging  Center via a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). The image analysis will be performed in  the Sleep Imaging Center where there are 6 workstations running AMIRA software ? Advanced Visualization  and Volume Modeling for volumetric display of the data. The MR data analysis is complicated and cannot be  performed without significant training. Dr. Schwab has been the director of the Sleep Imaging Center since  1991 and has an established track record for analyzing such data. The large number of MRI's justifies the  establishment of a core devoted to the performing the complicated analysis proposed in Projects 1, and 3. A  centralized facility will ensure quality control of the data and cost effectiveness. We will perform MRI's at the  University of Pennsylvania and in Iceland. We have already developed a successful collaboration with the  Iceland MR team in a large NIH-funded Icelandic study (A Family Linkage Study of Obstructive Sleep Apnea  (HL072067)) in which 709 MRI's of the upper airway have been performed. These MRI's have already been  analyzed. In addition we have established track record of performing MRI in rodents. We have published two  studies examining upper airway soft tissue/craniofacial structures including tongue fat in mice and rats. Thus  we have a track record for upper airway imaging in humans and rodents. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging  Core will be under the leadership of Dr. Richard Schwab with support staff consisting of senior research  radiologist (Dr. Torigian), and three research technicians to perform and validate the image analysis.  Development of a central core facility with expertise in upper airway imaging in humans and mice will facilitate  the proposed research by standardizing the imaging analysis paradigms, allow the development of new image  analysis approaches and ensure quality assurance/reproducibility across the research projects."
"9271206","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental gap exists between acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) rates (up to 50%) and the related mortality (up to 50%) following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HTC) and the paucity of therapies and biological correlative studies offered. This gap represents an important problem, because until it is filled, therapies will be limited to the nonspecific steroidal targeting of effector cells, and the understanding of the immunologic pathways involved in therapy-resistant GVHD will remain underexplored. Our long-term goal is to identify and validate GVHD biomarkers with the potential for risk stratification and therapeutic targeting in both adult and pediatric population. Our objective in this application is to investigate validated biomarkers of acute and chronic GVHD in a pediatric multicenter prospective trial. Our central hypothesis is that plasma biomarker panels predict acute and chronic GVHD and their impact on survival. This hypothesis was formed based on our preliminary data characterizing a panel of seven biomarkers in a predominantly adult population [interleukin-2- receptor-alpha, tumor-necrosis-factor-receptor-1, interleukin-8, hepatocyte growth factor, elafin, a skin-specific marker, regenerating islet-derived 3-alpha, a gastro-intestinal specific marker, and suppression of tumorigenicity 2] that allows acute GVHD diagnosis with good specificity and sensitivity and provides important prognostic information including survival. Similarly, a panel of five chronic GVHD proteins [monokine induced by interferon-gamma (CXCL9), elafin, interleukin-2-receptor-alpha, soluble B-cell-activating factor (sBAFF), and soluble CD13] diagnoses chronic GVHD. The rationale for this study is that once we are able to identify children who will not respond to traditional treatments and who are at particularly high risk for subsequent morbidity and mortality, we can propose personalized treatment plans that are most effective if introduced early. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Create a pediatric multicenter clinic-biological repository for proteomic biomarkers. 2) To validate proteomic biomarkers of acute and chronic in the pediatric population. 3) Create an integrated clinically useful protein biomarker panel of GVHD. This approach is innovative because it creates for the first time a large pediatric multicenter repository containing both clinical data and bio specimens that will allow bridging pediatric and adult knowledge and therapeutics in complications post-HCT. The proposed research is significant because the identification of GVHD biomarker panels at symptom onset or earlier is expected to impact our ability to risk stratify patients before initiating GVHD treatment. It will lso guide the intensity and duration of treatment, and help minimize the toxicity associated with chronic steroid administration. Ultimately, we propose the discovery of a GVHD-specific drug to increase efficacy and lower toxicity."
"9277251","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an endogenous neuropeptide with robust anxiolytic properties. NPY has been implicated in a wide variety of anxiety disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and enhancement of NPY levels has been proposed as a potential therapy for PTSD and other anxiety disorders. Low levels of (NPY have been measured in patients with PTSD, and in rodents using the Predator Scent Stress model, which is a model of stress-induced anxiety/PTSD. However, the effect of Predator Scent Stress on NPY release in hippocampus has not yet been demonstrated. Anxiety disorders are considered a maladaptive form of learning, and hippocampal dysfunction has been implicated in anxiety disorders and PTSD. Because of its many clinical implications, it is important to understand how the endogenous release of NPY is regulated. In hippocampus, NPY is released from a subset of inhibitory interneurons that also release GABA. Despite the importance of NPY, very little is known about the physiological properties of the interneurons in hippocampus that release NPY. Experiments in this proposal will investigate the synaptically-evoked spiking properties of NPY-containing interneurons in the CA1 region of hippocampus, including the short-term plasticity of their excitatory inputs from Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses from CA3 and temporoammonic (TA) synapses from entorhinal cortex. Exogenous NPY has been shown to modulate glutamate release at SC synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells and to decrease the strength of feed-forward inhibition from SC stimulation. It is not known if NPY modulates TA synapses or TA-induced feed-forward inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal cells. We will test the effect of exogenous (bath applied) NPY on the excitation/inhibition ratio and circuit function in CA1 in response to SC and TA stimulation. In addition, the effects on CA1 pyramidal cells of endogenously released NPY will be tested. Finally, we will test for alterations in the release of endogenous NPY in CA1 in a mouse model of anxiety, test for mechanisms underlying the changes, and investigate the effects on CA1 circuit function. These studies will lead to a greater understanding of the regulation of NPY cell spiking and the effects of endogenously released NPY, and may lead to potential therapeutic targets to increase NPY cell spiking and thus raise endogenous levels of NPY."
"9288187","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA polymerase elongation during gene transcription may be hindered by the many proteins bound to DNA (roadblocks). Alternatively, displacement by RNA polymerase could inhibit the activity of a DNA-bound protein, and a transcription factor (TF), for example, might lose control of a promoter. The mechanism by which RNA polymerases elongate through roadblocks without compromising their regulatory function is poorly understood. Previous mechanistic, single-molecule studies have focused on RNA polymerase disrupting nucleosomes. However, nucleosomes, which are only found in eukaryotes, interact with DNA non-specifically, and are substrates for post-translational modifications that regulate chromatin remodelling and transcription of DNA. In contrast, many TFs from organisms spanning all kingdoms recognize specific sites on DNA to shape the genome and regulate transcription, and do not undergo chemical modifications regulated by complex pathways. Instead, they respond to environmental cues such as DNA supercoiling, concentration, and the presence of multiple operators to which they bind with different affinities and cooperatively. These tunable, cooperative interactions determine architectural DNA modifications such as DNA bending, wrapping and looping, the role of which has not been addressed in earlier studies on transcription roadblocks either in vivo or in vitro. The effect of three model TFs, the lac repressr (LacI), the l repressor and the 186 bacteriophage CI repressor, on transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase (RNAP), will be compared and contrasted using magnetic tweezers (MT) and AFM imaging. These complementary techniques provide dynamic measurements of active complexes operating on single DNA molecules (MT), and detailed static images of nucleoprotein complexes adsorbed on a surface (AFM), and are the most direct macromolecular analyses for elucidating the mechanistic details by which RNAP elongates past a TF. The results of this investigation will help us (i) understand how transcriptional factors (TFs) generat complex responses in genomic contexts, and (ii) indicate new ways in which to manipulate genes and construct synthetic regulatory circuits for transcription. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to understand how protein-protein cooperativity and protein-mediated long-range interactions, such as DNA looping may affect the strength of a roadblock, and if DNA tension and transcription-generated DNA supercoiling may facilitate RNAP elongation through these TFs. Aim 1 will focus on the effects of TF binding affinity, looping, DNA tension and handedness of DNA supercoiling on the strong LacI roadblock. Aim 2 will focus on the effects of TF binding affinity, oligomerization, looping, DNA tension and handedness of DNA supercoiling on the weak l CI roadblock. Aim 3 will focus on the effects of alternate wrapping or looping, DNA tension and handedness of DNA supercoiling on the 186 CI repressor."
"9281082","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to build a more complete picture of ligand-protein recognition by examining free, intermediate and bound states in order to reveal the why and when of binding mechanisms and kinetic behavior. Non-covalent molecular recognition plays a crucial role in biology, chemistry and medicine. Exploring binding pathways and the transient intermediate states during binding will help elucidate mechanisms that include binding, allostery, induced fit, gated control associations, and the free energetics o binding, which will later guide molecular designs. Molecular simulations play an increasing role in studying binding thermodynamics and kinetics, important in both biology and chemistry. Used in combination with experiments, simulations integrate data and interpret experiments; then contribute to the design of novel molecules with preferred affinities and/or kinetic properties. Kinetic data also can be used as a critical differentiator and predictor for drug efficacy and safety. However, real molecular systems are quite complicated, and computational tools usually are either very time-consuming or over-simplify a biological system. Therefore, the major motivation is that we need projects to further develop new computational methods to both efficiently and accurately model molecular association pathways in order to understand the binding mechanisms, solvent effects and kinetic behavior. Guided by strong preliminary results and existing methods developed by our group, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Develop and apply multi-scale methods to model ligand-protein binding in order to understand binding mechanisms and kinetic behavior; 2) Investigate the role of waters and free energy landscape in binding processes; 3) Adapt and apply the new methods and integrate experiments to peptide- protein binding to study protein function and assist peptide design. The approach is innovative that it involves bringing new methodological breakthroughs to enable realistic modeling of binding pathways and expanding the classical view of molecular recognition. The proposed research is significant, because it provides computational tools for us to study binding processes, free energy surfaces and solvent effects, and reveals fundamental mechanisms of molecular association."
"9281758","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underlie numerous molecular processes in living organisms, such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cell metabolism, and have increasingly been targeted in drug development. Most PPIs are dynamic processes involving the interplay of molecular interactions and protein conformational changes to bind. This project will study the time-dependent process of molecular recognition and binding that give rise to specific contacts. In a collaboration between Andrei Tokmakoff and Stephen Kent at the University of Chicago and Vijay Pande at Stanford University, we propose to merge our unique technologies into an integrated method that will reveal the molecular dynamics of PPIs. Particular emphasis is placed on describing protein conformational ensembles and disorder in the mechanism of recognition and binding. Our investigation will be directed at the association of insulin monomers into a dimer. Insulin monomer, the active form of the hormone, extends the C-terminal residues of its B-chain in the process of binding insulin receptor. This chain is thought to be disordered in the monomer; however, it folds into a compact intermolecular ? sheet in the dimer or hexamer form it adopts in pancreatic ?-cell secretory granules. Our studies will characterize the structure and disorder of insulin monomer and the hinging and dynamic interactions of its B chain, factors that critically influence glucose regulation. Furthermore, we will directly visualize the fleeting encounter species that arise durin recognition and binding, to help test whether insulin dimer association follows a fly-casting mechanism. The approach will use two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) of protein amide I vibrations in concert with advanced synthesis and simulation methods. 2D IR can be used to characterize protein structures with ultrafast time resolution. Using a laser temperature-jump (T-jump), we generate the transient encounter complexes that exist at the transition state for recognition and binding, and use 2D IR to time-resolve their conformational changes over nanosecond to millisecond time scales. Site-specific information on protein conformation is achieved with the help of isotope labels inserted during total chemical synthesis of insulin by Kent. Atomistic molecular modeling using computational IR spectroscopy in conjunction with Pande's large- scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov state models (MSMs) allows us to test and refine structural and dynamical ensembles observed in experiment."
"9308018","PROJECT SUMMARY Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome that is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra and reduced dopamine in the putamen. In PD, a major goal has been to develop therapies that modify disease progression. Unfortunately, despite dozens of clinical trials in PD over the past several decades, identifying a disease-modifying drug for PD has not been achieved. A major reason for this failure is because prior studies have relied upon subjective clinical ratings as outcome measures, and these ratings cannot quantify small differences in disease progression. Sensitive and objective markers of PD progression that directly relate to basal ganglia and cortical neuroanatomy are critically needed. Our group has successfully validated objective markers of disease progression using novel methods from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These novel disease progression biomarkers using dMRI and fMRI provide a critical step forward to evaluate disease- modifying therapies in PD. In this Renewal R01, we will build on these key observations by evaluating how the dMRI and fMRI biomarkers of progression respond to a monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor. The rationale is that MAO-B inhibitors stop the breakdown of dopamine, and may allow the neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway to function more effectively for a longer period of time. We choose to evaluate a MAO-B inhibitor because it is a safe and FDA approved therapy for treating PD symptoms, numerous animal studies already suggest it has disease-modifying qualities, and MAO-B inhibitors have shown some initial promise as a potential disease-modifying therapy for PD. We will study how the MAO-B inhibitor affects biomarker progression using a prospective, placebo-controlled study design. Aim 1 studies a dMRI progression marker of the substantia nigra and Aim 2 studies a task-based fMRI progression marker of the putamen, primary motor cortex, and supplementary motor area. We will conduct a 12-month study in PD patients to test the hypothesis that the MAO-B inhibitor will slow the progression of free-water accumulation in the substantia nigra and slow the reduction of the blood oxygenation dependent signal in the putamen, primary motor cortex, and supplementary motor area. We will also assess a battery of secondary outcomes to monitor motor performance, cognitive status, and emotional status. The outcome and impact of this study will provide the first evaluation of MAO-B inhibitors at slowing the progression of the nigrostriatal pathway using advanced dMRI and fMRI methods in PD."
"9387774","Project Summary/Abstract Asthma is a lung disease that is growing in prevalence and disproportionately affects children. Many asthmatics show underlying allergic inflammation that is thought to trigger their symptoms, and suppressing inflammation shows efficacy in treating disease. However, the mechanism by which allergen inhaled into the lung actually initiates inflammatory responses is poorly understood. In particular, the allergen must be taken up by so-called professional antigen presenting cells to be presented to CD4 T cells, yet the uptake of allergen from the airway lumen has not been well characterized. In preliminary studies, we have identified a subset of macrophages which appear to be the main allergen capturing cells near the bronchi, where inflammation develops. These bronchus-associated macrophages are phenotypically distinct from alveolar macrophages in the distal airways as well as from classical dendritic cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine whether bronchus-associated macrophages are important for the allergic inflammation near the bronchial tree. The specific aims are to 1) characterize the distinct features and cellular interactions of bronchus-associated macrophages compared with classical dendritic cells and 2) assess the impact of deficiency in bronchus- associated macrophages on allergic lung inflammation. We believe these studies will provide important new insights into the mechanism by which allergen is taken up from the bronchi in the initiation of allergic lung inflammation, which may have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of asthma."
"9282281","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records (EMRs) collected at every hospital in the country collectively contain a staggering wealth of biomedical knowledge. EMRs can include unstructured text, temporally constrained measurements (e.g., vital signs), multichannel signal data (e.g., EEGs), and image data (e.g., MRIs). This information could be transformative if properly harnessed. Information about patient medical problems, treatments, and clinical course is essential for conducting comparative effectiveness research. Uncovering clinical knowledge that enables comparative research is the primary goal of this proposal. We will focus on the automatic interpretation of clinical EEGs collected over 12 years at Temple University Hospital (over 25,000 sessions and 15,000 patients). Clinicians will be able to retrieve relevant EEG signals and EEG reports using standard queries (e.g. Young patients with focal cerebral dysfunction who were treated with Topamax). In Aim 1 we will automatically annotate EEG events that contribute to a diagnosis. We will develop automated techniques to discover and time-align the underlying EEG events using semi-supervised learning. In Aim 2 we will process the text from the EEG reports using state-of-the-art clinical language processing techniques. Clinical concepts, their type, polarity and modality shall be discovered automatically, as well as spatial and temporal information. In addition, we shall extract the medical concepts describing the clinical picture of patients from the EEG reports. In Aim 3, we will develop a patient cohort retrieval system that will operate on the clinical knowledge extracted in Aims 1 and 2. In addition we shall organize this knowledge in a unified representation: the Qualified Medical Knowledge Graph (QMKG), which will be built using BigData solutions through MapReduce. The QMKG will be able to be searched by biomedical researchers as well as practicing clinicians. The QMKG will also provide a characterization of the way in which events in an EEG are narrated by physicians and the validation of these across a BigData resource. The EMKG represents an important contribution to basic science. In Aim 4 we will validate the usefulness of the patient cohort identification system by collecting feedback from clinicians and medical students who will participate in a rigorous evaluation protocol. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the queries shall be designed and experts will provide relevance judgments for the results. For each query, medical experts shall examine the top-ranked cohorts for common precision errors (false positives) and the bottom five ranked common recall errors (false negatives). User validation testing will be performed using live clinical data and the feedback wil enhance the quality of the cohort identification system. The existence of an annotated BigData archive of EEGs will greatly increase accessibility for non- experts in neuroscience, bioengineering and medical informatics who would like to study EEG data. The creation of this resource through the development of efficient automated data wrangling techniques will demonstrate that a much wider range of BigData bioengineering applications are now tractable."
"9375411","PROJECT SUMMARY We propose a novel computational method to identify predictive genetic biomarkers to guide the use of targeted therapies using high-throughput pan-cancer data from primary tumors. The method will be used to identify predictive biomarkers in lung cancer for Sudemycin-D6 (SD6), a novel splicing modulator with potent anti-tumor activity. Currently, new therapies are designed to target genes specifically mutated in cancer, and the corresponding oncogenic mutations are used as biomarkers for the drugs. The use of targeted drugs is limited because the sensitizing oncogenic driver events are absent in many cancers, albeit some cancers have alternative mechanisms of sensitivity. This is particularly true for SD6, which was found to be effective in lung cancer cell lines that do not harbor any mutations in spliceosome genes. Our approach is to use synthetic lethality to identify biomarkers that predict drug sensitivity in cancers that are not mutated for the drug target. In synthetic lethal (SL) interactions, a genetic alteration in one gene leads to dependency on a second gene. Neither alteration by itself is essential for survival, but together they lead to cancer cell death. Our hypothesis is that genetic alterations (mutations/copy number alterations) that are SL partners of drug targets can be used as predictive biomarkers for the therapeutic efficacy of the drug in specific cancer types. For SD6, we will identify genetic alterations that are SL partners of genes constituting the spliceosome. Two specific aims are proposed: In Aim 1, we will develop a computational method that can be applied to large-scale primary tumor genomic and transcriptomic datasets to identify candidate predictive biomarkers using SL interactions mined from primary tumor data. This method will be applied to genomic and transcriptomic datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA), and gene expression data from Veterans Administration (VA) patients to identify candidate predictive biomarkers for SD6 in lung cancer. In Aim 2, we will experimentally validate the predictive biomarkers identified in Aim 1 in two steps. First, in Aim 2a, we will validate the top 10 candidate biomarkers using genetic knockdown of the biomarker with shRNA and pharmacologic knockdown with SD6 in isogenic lung cancer cell lines in vitro. We will confirm that the mechanism of SD6 sensitivity is via synthetic lethality between the biomarker and splicing factors. Next, in Aim 2b, we will validate the top 3 candidate biomarkers in vivo using pharmacologic knockdown with SD6. We expect the proposed study will find predictive biomarkers for SD6 efficacy and accelerate its clinical development in lung cancer. The long-term objective is to develop a tool for predictive biomarker identification that can be used by the wider research community (physicians, biologists, and medicinal chemists) and have applications in both the clinical development of new targeted agents and in the identification of patients who are likely to respond to them. This tool has the potential to unlock the clinical benefit of the available drug arsenal and greatly improve patient outcomes."
"9301633","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although nearly half of all adults in the United States (95 million) have high blood pressure (BP), only one in three patients can successfully control their high BP with conventional treatment, including lifestyle modifications and, if needed, antihypertensive medication. Stress is known to increase BP in at least two ways: (1) activating the sympathetic nervous system to make the heart pump harder and the blood vessels constrict, and (2) interfering with health behaviors, including diet, exercise, and sleep. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a proven meditation program to reduce stress. In our in-press trial (R21 AT002698-01A2) on adults with unmedicated prehypertension, an 8-week MBSR program significantly lowered high BP. The current R01 application proposes a two-site randomized clinical trial (RCT) with a larger, more diverse sample of adults from Cleveland, OH, and Durham, NC. We will also test a conceptual model that emphasizes decentering as a key mechanism by which MBSR reduces the impact of acute and chronic stress on high BP. Decentering is the ability to observe stress-related thoughts, emotions, and impulses in a way that allows one to disengage from automatic reactions to stress, maintain one's focus of attention, and respond to a demanding task or stressful trigger more effectively. We expect that MBSR-related gains in decentering will reduce exaggerated cardiovascular reactivity to mild emotional stress, expedite physiological recovery, and increase healthy lifestyle behaviors over time. We plan to enroll 180 unmedicated adults with prehypertension who will receive lifestyle modification advice. Patients will then be randomly assigned to one of three study arms over an 8-week intervention period: (1) MBSR training; (2) Stress Management Education (SME), a credible, active comparison group that controls for instruction time, attention from class instructors, social support, and homework assignments, but without the active ingredient of mindfulness meditation; or a wait-list control (WLC) group that controls for natural history of changes in high BP while patients complete the study assessments only. Assessments of clinic BP (primary outcome), 24-hr ambulatory BP, stress-induced cardiovascular reactivity including heart rate (HR), BP, cardiac output (CO), pre-ejection period (PEP), and vascular resistance, and objective behavioral reactions to a mild emotional stressor will occur at Weeks 0 (baseline), 8 (post-treatment), and 60 (one-year follow-up). In addition, clinic BP will be assessed at Weeks 4 (mid-treatment) and 34 (six-month follow-up). Health behaviors will be assessed at each time point. Waitlist patients will be invited to receive their choice of open-label MBSR or SME-allowing us to explore the effect of patient preference on intervention effect sizes. The proposed two-site RCT will address two critical public health needs: (1) the need for high-quality trials wih longer-term follow-up to definitively test the effectiveness and durability of mindfulness meditation for lowering BP, and (2) the need to discern the specific psychological, biological, and behavioral mechanisms by which mindfulness meditation may reduce high BP."
"9272895","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A contributing factor to a wide spectrum of human diseases is defective cell polarity. Many cell types use mRNA localization as a means to establish polarity. At present, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mRNAs are localized in higher eukaryotes. The goal of this proposal is to address this gap in knowledge by determining the mechanism by which oskar and FMR1 mRNAs are localized. oskar mRNA is localized in Drosophila oocytes and FMR1 mRNA is localized in neurons. These transcripts are ideal candidates for study because although they are localized in different tissues, their localization utilizes many of the same factors. Thus, a common mechanism might operate to localize diverse mRNAs. Insights gained from these studies are therefore expected to be generally applicable to our understanding of mRNA localization. We propose to perform our studies using the Drosophila melanogaster model system. This model system will enable us to study the process of mRNA localization in the context of the whole organism. This study has three main objectives. The impetus for Aim 1 was our recent discovery that core proteins of the spliceosome known as Sm proteins have a role, outside of splicing, in mRNA localization. In the present study, we propose to determine the mechanism by which Sm proteins function in localizing oskar mRNA. In Aim 2, we propose to determine the mechanism by which oskar and FMR1 mRNA are coupled to motor proteins for transport. The primary motor implicated in transporting both mRNAs is Kinesin heavy chain (Khc). However, Khc does not use its canonical adaptor to bind to oskar and FMR1 mRNA. Thus, it is currently unknown how Khc binds to these transcripts. We hypothesize that an unknown adaptor links Khc to oskar and FMR1 mRNA. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify this unknown adaptor. Finally, Aim 3 centers on our unexpected finding that a separate motor, cytoplasmic Dynein, also functions in oskar mRNA localization. A function for Dynein in the localization of FMR1 mRNA has already been demonstrated. In this aim, we will precisely define the role of Dynein in transporting oskar mRNA. Furthermore, we will test the hypothesis that once Dynein delivers oskar mRNA to the posterior pole, it performs an additional function in maintaining asymmetric endocytic activity within the oocyte. Completion of these aims will significantly advance our understanding of how the cell builds a localization competent mRNP, and the mechanism by which that mRNP is coupled to motor proteins for transport. Ultimately, the knowledge gained from these studies will enable us to more effectively treat diseases that result from defective mRNA localization and cell polarity."
"9322467","Project Summary / Abstract A long-term goal is to bring chemical reagents to biology, extending the development of tools on which the community increasingly depends: ZINC (http://zinc.docking.org), DUDE (http://dude.docking.org), DOCK Blaster (http://blaster.docking.org) and SEA (http://sea.docking.org) among them. A second goal explores the fundamental bases and implications of a ligand-based organization of pharmacology, leveraging it to predict biologically-relevant polypharmacology, we argue for the first time in the field. 1. New public tools to bring chemistry to biology. A. We develop ZINC tools that enable one to input a target and find all available reagents known for it, or to input a molecule to find its known and predicted targets, testing several of these. B. Targets operate in pathways and networks. We introduce tools that allow one to island hop from target-to-target in ?clickable? networks organized by both chemo- and bio-informatic similarity. C. By bringing chemoinformatics directly into DOCK Blaster, investigators can search their hit lists for analogs, scaffolds, functional groups, and their docked interactions. D. We develop a library that addresses the key problem of phenotypic screening, target ID, by pre-annotating all library compounds to targets, with each target having two or more orthogonal molecules annotated (with Novartis & Sigma-Aldrich). When such orthogonal molecules share a phenotype in a screen, it suggests the underlying target. 2. Comparing and combining ligand-based, structure-based & bioinformatic similarity. Linking targets by ligand similarity reveals associations very different from what bioinformatics would suggest. This is gratifying but puzzling. Here we A. Comprehensively compare bioinformatic target networks to those predicted by ligand similarity. Preliminary results suggest that these networks are mostly orthogonal but have intriguing areas of overlap (explored in C, below). B. To understand the structural basis for the binding of identical ligands by ?unrelated? proteins, we compare the x-ray structures of hundreds of complexes where two dissimilar proteins bind exactly the same ligands, using widely-used, structure-based site comparison programs. Can these programs recognize the binding sites in the unrelated proteins as, in fact, similar? How many ways can proteins recognize the same ligand functional groups? C. In the areas where the bio- and chemoinformatics neighborhoods overlap, the bioinformatics implicates pairs of targets in a disease, while chemoinformatics suggest that that the pair can be co-modulated by a reagent. For these pairs, shared polypharmacology is functionally meaningful. We predict and test 50. Whereas these goals are ambitious, their plausibility is supported by extensive preliminary results."
"9398535","The overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize the protein machinery that mediates trafficking of postsynaptic membrane proteins critical for synaptic plasticity. Endo- and exocytosis of membrane proteins are critical trafficking steps in all cells, but are especially dynamic and finely tuned in neurons. Unlike presynaptic endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, the precise molecular processes that underlie postsynaptic trafficking still remain poorly defined. Little is known about how specific receptors are removed from the protein scaffolding complex at the postsynaptic density (PSD) or the functional role of protein-protein interactions within the PSD during synaptic plasticity. Our previous work identified the immediate early gene Arc as a critical mediator of memory storage in the brain and showed that Arc regulates AMPA-type glutamate receptor trafficking. We conducted unbiased proteomic screens and discovered novel Arc interacting proteins. Based on these screens, we hypothesize that Arc acts as a novel postsynaptic clathrin adaptor protein. Based on this hypothesis, we will test whether Arc binds lipids, recruits cargo to endosomes (e.g. AMPARs) and interacts with PSD proteins to release receptors from their scaffolding within the PSD. To study protein trafficking within nanodomains of synapses we have developed a novel live super-resolution light microscopy approach. This study will provide mechanistic insight into how Arc mediates multiple forms of synaptic plasticity and also broadly elucidates the protein machinery that is involved in postsynaptic trafficking of membrane proteins at excitatory synapses. Arc lies at a critical nexus as a critical synaptic effector protein and has been implicated in neurological and psychiatric disorders in human patients. Thus, this work will also shed light on synaptic dysfunction associated with neurological diseases."
"9464328","PROJECT SUMMARY Schistosomiasis affects more than 200 million people worldwide. During infection, the type 2 immune response and M2 macrophages (M?) play a critical role in granuloma formation around the eggs and enable the host to tolerate the tissue damage caused by these eggs, which become embedded in the liver and intestines. We previously identified phenotypic and functional differences between M2 M? derived from either tissue resident M? (M2tiss) or inflammatory monocytes (M2mono). We also determined that the M2 M? in acute liver granulomas formed after infection with Schistosoma mansoni are derived from inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocytes. However, as the granulomas mature and become more organized, M2mono in the granuloma eventually adopt features of M2tiss. This phenotypic conversion into M2tiss is disrupted in mice with vitamin A deficiency, an important micronutrient deficiency in developing countries, which leads to increased morbidity during infection. The key metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid (RA), may therefore be essential for the normal function of M2 M? in the liver granulomas. We hypothesize that RA signaling enables M2mono around the S. mansoni egg granulomas to adopt the properties of M2tiss after residence in the local microenvironment. In contrast to S. mansoni, other helminths (e.g. Heligmosoides polygyrus) induce expansion of M2 M? from tissue-resident M?. Hence, different helminth infections induce M2 activation in M? of different lineages. Differences in open chromatin regions may regulate differential activation of M2mono and M2tiss. We have investigated open regions of chromatin in M2mono and M2tiss. By coupling genome-wide gene expression data with sequencing data on chromatin structure, we are uncovering the regulatory networks and identifying key transcription factors that control the differential responses to IL-4 for different lineage of M?. We hypothesize that chromatin structure is reorganized to resemble tissue resident M? when M2mono around the S. mansoni egg granulomas adopt the properties of M2tiss. Failure of this process may increase mortality during infection. In this proposal we will (Aim 1) determine the role and mechanism of action of retinoic acid (RA) in regulating conversion to a M2tiss phenotype and (Aim 2) identify gene regulatory networks mediating differential M2 activation of M2mono and M2tiss, and the phenotypic conversion from M2mono to M2tiss. While our focus is to characterize the biology of M2 M? during helminth infections, our findings should be translatable to the many other sites and physiological processes whereby M2 M? play an important functional role (e.g. in adipose tissues, atherosclerosis, tumor microenvironments and during wound repair). Hence, the impact of these studies should be broader than just helminth infections alone."
"9403428","Project Summary Abstract Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) type, is a major health problem in the United States (US); annual BCC incidences alone are higher than all other cancer incidences combined (1.67 million/year). Most BCC cases are curable by surgery/radiation, but these can be painful and highly disfiguring and are not viable treatment options for BCC patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease where chemotherapy has also not proven effective. Since Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a central role in BCC development and progression, recently FDA has approved GDC-0449 and LDE-225 (Hh pathway inhibitors) to treat BCC; however, acquired resistance and toxicities are limitations. Taken together, clearly there is an urgent need to develop additional non-toxic strategies towards BCC prevention and intervention. In past ~20 years, we have extensively studied and reported chemopreventive efficacy of silibinin against UVB- induced skin cancer in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) model of NMSC; currently, we are in advanced stages of developing silibinin formulation for human skin use. Based on findings showing strong silibinin efficacy in mouse skin SCC model, in preliminary studies, we also assessed its effects against UVB-induced BCC. Using Ptch1+/? mouse model of BCC, we observed that silibinin decreases UVB-induced: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) positive cells in ear skin, microscopic BCC formation, dermal mast cell infiltration and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 gene and protein levels in skin. Furthermore, silibinin decreased: MC9 mast cell chemotactic-migration towards mouse BCC ASZ cells and mucosal mast cell degranulation. Silibinin also decreased proliferation of mouse BCC cells in culture and mouse allografts together with inhibition of mitogenic signaling pathways. In most recent studies, silibinin significantly increased the growth inhibitory effects of Hh pathway inhibitor drugs and reversed the resistance of BCC cells to these drugs via targeting EGFR/AKT and Hh pathway and induction of apoptosis. Based on these highly significant and encouraging findings in BCC models, our hypothesis is that by targeting UVB-induced DNA damage repair and reversal of mast cells-mediated immunosuppressive events, together with modulating signaling pathways associated with drug resistance, silibinin has the potential to be an effective agent for both prevention and adjuvant therapy of BCCs. Our aims are to: I) establish and define the role of silibinin-mediated DNA repair in its preventive efficacy against UVB-induced BCC; II) assess and establish the link between DNA damage repair, mast cells, and reversal of UVB-induced immunosuppression by silibinin in its efficacy against BCC formation; III) further establish the therapeutic efficacy of silibinin against BCC, both alone and in combination with FDA approved anti-BCC therapeutics, and define the associated mechanisms."
"9375630","The innate immune response is an ancient defense system made up of functionally distinct subsystems that have evolved to counter infection by microbial pathogens. A successful innate response promotes the secretion of cytokines and growth factors that shape the later pathogen-specific, or acquired immune response composed of B- and T-lymphocytes. While the role of type I interferons in the clearance of infectious agents is unquestionable, their role in the immune system in the absence of microbial presence is substantially less well understood. We had previously reported a dramatic increase in susceptibility towards autoimmunity in mice lacking the interferon-activated STAT1 transcription factor. Our recent research revealed a considerable contribution of the type I interferon system in the development of thymic epithelial cells that is likely to contribute to the development of various autoimmune disorders.  Intriguingly, the interferon regulatory factors 3 and 7, two transcription factors controlling type I interferon production, have been studied exhaustively in innate immunity, but their potential contributions to the adaptive immune system have largely been left unexplored. Indeed, our recent studies revealed critical, but very distinct roles in lymphocyte development and function: we have already published on a novel and critical involvement of IRF7 and the type I interferon signaling system in the development and function of medullary thymic epithelial cells which are crucial in the prevention of autoimmunity. Our finding of IRF7 activation by RANKL gains additional significance due to the fact that thus far only PAMPs/pathogens were known to activate IRF7, but not any other cytokine. IFN? produced by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTEC) ? a major source of IFN? in the thymus ? acts in an autocrine feedback loop to regulate mTEC proliferation and function. Our newest preliminary date contained within this application revealed that IRF3, too, plays a critical role in the adaptive immune system that impacts the ability of CD4+ T cells to be controlled by Treg cells and alters the ability of CD4+ T cells to trigger autoimmunity. The most important mechanistic aspect behind this observation is our discovery that nave T cells fail to differentiate into Th17 cells in the absence of T cell-intrinsic IRF3, both in vitro and in vivo. We thus exposed that both IRF3 and IRF7 harbor a T cell intrinsic function rather than simply affecting stromal cell/APC function. We therefore propose the generation and basic characterization of conditionally targeted IRF7 mice to continue to investigate the unique, tissue-specific functions of IRF7 in the adaptive immune system, (particularly with respect to the development of T cells and their responses to antigens and/or pathogens. It should also be noted that many of the IRF3/7 contributions we observed in the adaptive immunity can be separated from the type I interferon system).  These animal will not only allow us to shed light onto novel cell-type specific roles of IRF7 contributing to thymic and peripheral T cell development and function, but also elucidate novel roles for IRF3 and IRF7 in the adaptive immune system beyond their well-established function as interferon regulators during innate immune events."
"9295014","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)          The primary goals of this Children's Center are to use a multidisciplinary approach to address critical gaps in our knowledge about the impact of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (phthalates/BPA) on child development, to actively involve junior investigators in this research effort, and to actively communicate our research findings to parents, childcare providers and healthcare providers. There are three common themes that unite the three research projects and the Outreach and Translation Core (COTC) of this Center: (1) assessment of exposures during two critical developmental windows (prenatal and adolescent), (2) investigation of joint effects of phthalate/BPA exposure and a high fat diet/obesity, and (3) investigation of the role of  oxidative stress and inflammation in mediating effects. At the heart of the research effort will be  two human cohorts (Project 1)-a prospective pre-birth cohort currently in progress in Urbana, Illinois and an adolescent cohort to be assessed as part of a long-standing prospective study in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The Center will also include laboratory animal projects (Projects 2 and 3) which will model the timing of exposures in these human cohorts, a COTC, and this administrative core which will provide oversight, coordination and integration of all Center-related activities. The responsibilities of the Administrative Core will include organizing and scheduling monthly meetings of the Internal Advisory Committee and monthly research team meetings of the Center investigators, organizing yearly meetings of the Center scientists with the six-member External Advisory Committee, coordinating the career development activities of the Center, and facilitating interactions of the Pediatric Health Specialist with the COTC to communicate research findings to the healthcare community. As Director and Associate Director of the Children's Center, Drs. Susan Schantz and Jodi Flaws will be responsible for conducting Internal and External Advisory Committee meetings and regularly evaluating the research progress of each of the projects, as well as the outreach activities of the COTC. They will also be responsible for general fiscal oversight of the Center. Dr. Flaws will have full authority to make decisions in Dr. Schantz's absence.           Relevance: Phthalates and BPA are endocrine disrupting chemicals that are found in many consumer products. Exposure is widespread, but the impact of this exposure on child health and development is not well-understood. This Center's research will fill an important gap in our knowledge by investigating the effects of these chemicals, both alone and combination with a high fat diet on reproductive and neural development."
"9272001","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  Acute lung injury and chronic lung disease are together the third leading cause of death in the United States. This is due to the lack of effective therapis and a poor understanding of the mechanisms driving the pathology of these disorders. The major objective of this PPG is to advance novel therapies for the treatment of acute and chronic lung disease. Adenosine is produced following tissue injury, particularly injury involving ischemia and hypoxia. The production of extracellular adenosine and its subsequent signaling through adenosine receptors plays an important role in orchestrating injury responses in multiple organs including th lung. This process of regulated adenosine production and signaling following injury is known as the  hypoxic adenosine response. Our research efforts have established that this response plays an important role in orchestrating injury responses in the lung, but through mechanisms that are not well understood. Activation of this pathway can attenuate acute lung injury, while blockade of this  pathway is beneficial on aspects of chronic lung disease. We need to better understand how the hypoxic adenosine response is regulated in different types of lung injury in order to know when and  how to target the activation or inactivation of this pathway. This will be done by examining direct  injury processes in the lung as well as common secondary pulmonary injuries such as those seen associated with sickle cell disease and acute kidney injury. This will allow us to understand important aspects of systemic and organ responses critical to eventual human therapies. We will capitalize on our recent data showing that the regulation of the equilibrative nucleoside transportrs (ENTs) is a novel mechanism for regulating extracellular adenosine following injury. We will conduc mechanistic analysis in novel mouse models, including cell-specific knockouts of ENTs and other components of the hypoxic adenosine response. Importantly, we will also conduct rigorous assessment of the hypoxic adenosine response in disease relevant tissues from patients with acute and chronic lung disease as well as patients with sickle cell disease and kidney injury that can develop pulmonary complications. This approach will help advance emerging adenosine-based therapies forward for the treatment of lung disease. Three Component Projects, Two Scientific Cores and an Administrative Core are planned to facilitate the research goals and interactions of this PPG."

The Center will build upon and expand a community of bone scientists in the Endocrine Unit and other Units at the Massachusetts General Hospital, the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and other Harvard-associated departments and institutions. This group has already defined itself through a network of collaborations and a monthly seminar series sponsored jointly by the MGH Endocrine Unit and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and includes bone scientists from multiple Harvard institutions. These scientists are diverse, including clinical investigators and laboratory investigators using a broad array of approaches from multiple disciplines. The mechanisms that the Center will use to accomplish its goal include Core Facilities, a Pilot and Feasibility Grant Program, and a seminar series. The Cores will include a Skeletal Phenotyping Core and a Bone Cells and Signaling Core. These Cores will emphasize the development of new techniques that can drive the science of Center investigators, as well as the provision of expert and efficient service. The goal of the Pilot and Feasibility Grant Program will be to allow young investigators to develop sufficient data to obtain  their own grants; in that context, a vigorous mentoring program will complement the funding. The seminar series will foster collaboration and communication among Center scientists. Young investigators will present current data in some sessions, while others will bring in distinguished bone scientists from outside of Boston to enrich the environment. This series will also include presentations by Core Directors that explain the techniques used in the Cores and will provide a forum for feedback by Center investigators that will include suggestions for novel Core services. An  Administrative Core will assure effective functioning of these activities through regular meetings of Core  Directors that, four times a year, will also involve meeting with an Advisory Committee made up of senior  investigators within the Center, as well as investigators from elsewhere with relevant experience leading  similar programs. The Center will be committed to sharing its innovations with the broader community of bone scientists across the country."
"9337486","Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) exhibit pronounced sexual dimorphism. Similar to humans, we demonstrated previously that testosterone is a primary contributor to a 4-fold higher incidence of angiotensin II (AngII)-induced AAAs in male compared to female mice. In addition to sex hormones, sex chromosomes have been suggested to contribute to sexual dimorphism of cardiovascular diseases. Preliminary data demonstrate that changing the sex chromosome complement from XX to XY in female mice results in an AAA incidence that is similar to males. As testosterone promotes AngII-induced AAAs in XY males, we administered testosterone to neonatal (1 dose) and adult XY females. Testosterone caused aneurysm rupture in 73% of adult XY females. These results demonstrate that sex chromosome complement has a striking impact on AAA severity, and that these effects are augmented by testosterone. Gene arrays on smooth muscle cells from XX versus XY females incubated with AngII or testosterone identified neprilysin and heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) as gene targets that may contribute in a sex-specific manner to higher AAA incidences, severity and progression in males compared to females. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that an interplay between sex hormones and chromosomes promotes the incidence and severity of AAAs. Moreover, we hypothesize that a Precision Medicine approach to therapeutically target specific pathways influenced by sex hormones, chromosomes, or AngII will provide sex-specific efficacy against AAA formation and progression. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that an XY sex chromosome complement increases susceptibility to AngII-induced AAAs due to the presence of genes on the Y chromosome. We will use a novel mouse model (XY*) that when bred to XX females enables delineation of whether XX, XO, XXY, or XY sex chromosome complement influences the development and/or progression of AngII-induced AAAs. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that sex-specific therapeutic approaches, targeting neprilysin inhibition in males versus HO1 stimulation in females will provide efficacy against the formation and/or progression of AngII-induced AAAs. These studies will increase basic knowledge of sex chromosome influences on the vasculature, identify sex-specific therapies that may have therapeutic applicability against AAAs, and increase cardiovascular knowledge for the use of sex hormones in the growing trans-gender population."
"9357870","The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as ?type-specific?, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of ?type-specific? immunity against GAS infections to one of ?cluster-specific? immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS."
"9116116","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Solid tumors require new blood vessels to grow beyond a few cubic millimeters. Tumor blood vessels are complex and dysfunctional and multiple cell types may coalesce to form the tumor vasculature. In a striking example, some tumor cells may directly integrate within vascular structures or form tumor cell-lined conduits that carry blood and fluid (termed vascular mimicry, VM). We have recently isolated and characterized a novel subpopulation of vascular-like tumor cells identified by expression of the vascular cell adhesion molecule, CD31. These CD31+ tumor cells do not express VEGF receptors, they down-regulate the neural crest transcription factor/CD31 repressor AP-2alpha, and they form tumor blood vessels when engrafted in mice. Furthermore, CD31+ tumor cells do not respond to VEGF inhibition and are enriched in tumors challenged with VEGF neutralizing antibodies. In aim 1 we will use clonal populations of CD31- and CD31+ tumor cells we have derived from human and mouse cell lines and a spontaneous mouse melanoma model to determine the functional role of CD31 in forming perfused vascular structures in tumors. Aim 2 is to use cell ablation strategies and cutting-edge tumor perfusion studies to determine how CD31+ tumor cells mediate escape from anti-angiogenic therapy. In aim 3 we will define how loss of the neural crest specifer AP-2alpha controls CD31 expression and generates VM-competent tumor cells. For this aim, we will use genetic deletion and over- expression studies and intravital microscopy to visualize VM-competent tumor cells implanted in the mouse ear. Upon completion of our study aims, we will clarify how CD31+ tumor cells form functional connections with the host vasculature, the molecular mechanisms that generate and maintain this unique subpopulation, and how these vascular like tumor cells mediate escape from anti-angiogenic therapy."
"9374462","Summary Viruses infect organisms in all kingdoms of life, posing a challenge to all hosts of recognizing the presence of a foreign invader. Little is known about how simple metazoans, such as the model organism C. elegans, recognize infection by viruses or how downstream signaling pathways or transcription factors are activated following virus infection. Studies in model organisms have given rise to many fundamental paradigms in biology. For example, seminal discoveries of caspase cell death pathways and RNA interference (RNAi) were first made in C. elegans. A new virus infection model in C. elegans was recently established that capitalizes on the discovery of Orsay virus (ORV), a positive strand RNA virus that is the first and to date only virus capable of naturally infecting C. elegans. With this system, it is now possible to exploit the robust genetic tractability of C. elegans to define the mechanisms by which C. elegans recognizes and signals the presence of RNA virus infection as well as the viral determinants that trigger such signaling. These studies will provide novel insights into the evolution of self versus nonself discrimination and could also lead to identification of novel antiviral pathways that are broadly conserved. Little is known mechanistically about viral sensing in C. elegans. Multiple members of the RNAi pathways have proven to be important in antiviral immunity including DRH-1, a dicer related helicase that shares some similarity to the antiviral sensor RIG-I. ORV infection also induces a specific transcriptional response in C. elegans, including a set of genes that is induced >100 fold specifically in the intestine, which is the primary site of ORV infection. Notably some of these genes are not transcriptionally activated following ORV infection in drh-1 mutants, demonstrating a role for drh-1 in both RNAi and transcriptional regulation. However, it is currently not known what additional C. elegans genes are important for inducing this transcriptional response. Neither are the specific ORV determinant(s) recognized by the host to trigger the response known. The goals of this proposal are to (1) Identify C. elegans genes that recognize or signal in response to ORV infection using an unbiased forward genetic screen and (2) Define the viral determinant(s) that are recognized by C. elegans to induce a transcriptional response to ORV infection."
"9301276","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT All drugs of abuse produce unique interoceptive/subjective (i.e., discriminative stimulus) effects that can impact drug-taking, seeking, and relapse in both clinical and preclinical studies. However, the neural circuitry modulating the interoceptive effects of alcohol has yet to be established. The nucleus accumbens core (AcbC), a region known to mediate alcohol-related behaviors, also plays a central role in modulating the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol. Therefore, to begin to establish the circuitry modulating the interoceptive effects of alcohol, two brain regions with projections to the AcbC will be the focus of the proposed studies: the insular cortex (IC) and the rhomboid/reuniens ventral midline thalamic nuclei (RhRe). Despite the implicated role of the IC in processing interoceptive cues and responding to alcohol-related cues, its functional role in modulating alcohol-induced interoceptive effects has not been investigated to date. Additionally, the RhRe are proposed to modulate inhibition, behavior flexibility, and motivation, but their role in modulating any drug-related behaviors has yet to be determined. However, our preliminary data demonstrate that chemogenetic inactivation of the IC increases sensitivity to alcohol and pharmacological inactivation of IC and RhRe (independently) results in partial ?alcohol-like? interoceptive effects, thus implicating a functional role for the IC and RhRe in modulating the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol. Therefore, by investigating the two novel brain regions (IC and RhRe) and their projections to the AcbC, this application proposes to investigate the neural circuitry underlying alcohol-induced interoceptive states. Using drug discrimination methods, rats will be trained to discriminate alcohol vs. water, and we will chemogenetically inactivate the brain regions and their specific incoming AcbC projections to examine whether sensitivity to alcohol is altered. Thus, experiments in Aim 1 will determine whether IC and its projections to the AcbC modulate the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol. Aim 2 will use a similar approach to determine the role of RhRe and its projections to the AcbC. Together these experiments will demonstrate a functional role for two novel brain regions in modulating the interoceptive effects of alcohol, while identifying potential AcbC-related neural circuitry. By conducting these experiments in parallel, this innovative approach has the ability to inform the alcohol field of regions not previously implicated or understudied while demonstrating the importance and neurobiology underlying alcohol interoceptive states/internal cues, thus helping bridge the clinical and preclinical fields."

"9281047","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding and mitigating persistent inflammation and coagulation activation is central to improving the quality and quantity of life for contemporary HIV-positive persons. Epidemiologic data demonstrate that HIV infection is associated with ongoing coagulation abnormalities that also predict long-term clinical event risk, though questions remain regarding the underlying pathogenesis. We propose a model where hypercoagulation contributes to disease risk by amplifying inflammatory pathways, in addition to the direct effects of thrombogenesis. We hypothesize that increased generation of activated factor X (FXa) contributes to a systemic elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (e.g. interleukin-6 [IL-6]) among HIV positive patients. This occurs, in part, via FXa activation of protease activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) on monocytes and tissue macrophages, which perpetuates innate inflammation. We will test this hypothesis with low dose of an oral antagonist to FXa (rivaroxaban at 10mg daily), using a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial design. Treatment effects within participants (compared to placebo) will be characterized over 4 months among n=40 HIV positive patients with viral suppression and D-dimer levels >100ng/mL. In aim 1, we will determine if inhibition of factor Xa down regulates systemic inflammation (reflected in interleukin-6 levels), as well as coagulation activity. In aim 2, we wil specifically study the effects of factor Xa inhibition on monocyte- mediated inflammation and tissue factor activity. In aim 3, we will study tolerability of rivaroxaban and estimate the potental clinical risk reduction predicted by the observed treatment effects. Supported by preliminary data, we proposed that FXa, PAR-2, and monocytes are key mediators linking hypercoagulation to systemic inflammation. This central hypothesis, our laboratory methods, and our interventional strategy are novel, innovative and have not been tested in the context of HIV infection. Findings will provide a clearer understanding of inflammation-coagulation cross talk in the context of treated HIV disease, and inform future development of treatment strategies to improve the quality and quantity of life for persons with HIV infection."
"9357386","Project Summary/Abstract Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability worldwide. However, despite extensive rehabilitation efforts, marked physical inactivity remains emblematic of individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery and contributes to poor health and quality of life. For poststroke rehabilitation to be better positioned to enable more physical activity, factors such as insufficient training dosage and poor ecological validity, which limit the effectiveness of clinic-based gait training, must be overcome. Community-based rehabilitation approaches can overcome these limitations; however, the amount of walking practice that they are able to leverage is inherently limited by the reduced walking capacity typical after stroke. Indeed, recent work has shown that despite producing some improvement in poststroke walking activity, individuals still remain largely sedentary after community-based walking programs. A critical need thus exists for rehabilitation technologies that bridge the gap between the clinic and the real world and facilitate the massed walking practice in salient contexts that is necessary to induce experience-dependent neuroplasticity. In response to this need, we are developing lightweight and unobtrusive soft wearable robots (exosuits) suitable for community-based rehabilitation after stroke. Exosuits use innovative force-transmitting, conformal textiles that anchor to the body and proximally-mounted, lightweight, cable-based actuation systems to generate assistive joint forces. Adaptive control algorithms that use signals from the minimum number of sensors direct the timing of assistance. These innovative wearable robots have the potential to increase an individual's capacity for community ambulation. Indeed, we have demonstrated through preliminary treadmill-based studies that an ankle-assisting exosuit produces paretic limb functional restoration in a manner that induces gait symmetry, reduces the energy cost of walking, and increases walking stability. In contrast to the rigid exoskeletons that have dominated the last half century, exosuits provide partial assistance through a lightweight platform (<3kg overall, including motors and batteries) that requires low power (<100W), can be used unilaterally, and does not impose an unnatural gait on the wearer. The exosuit technology is ideally suited to assisting the impaired gait of individuals poststroke who have residual walking capacity. This technology development-focused project seeks to build gait-restorative exosuits made of modular components that can be easily assembled to serve the heterogeneous needs of individuals poststroke. This project will optimize existing ankle, knee, and hip modules that have undergone >1000 hours of testing on >130 healthy and impaired subjects for use by persons poststroke in clinical- and community- settings. This work will be completed by a multidisciplinary team of engineers, clinicians, and researchers. Qualitative and quantitative data gathered from patients and other stakeholders will inform all development."
"9296198","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How synapses function in their native environment, during sensation and perception and in the context of network activity, are critical to understanding how they can transmit information and be modified by experience. Traditionally, electrophysiological studies have been carried out under experimental conditions that are profoundly different from the intact brain, where one of the most critical differences is the near absence of background activity in acute brain slices. Thus, the functional connectivity between neurons in active cortical circuits, across different brain states, remains unknown. We propose to investigate the properties of excitatory synapses, not in isolation, but as they function embedded in a dynamic neural network, using both in vitro and in vivo recordings. Analysis will focus on individual synaptic connections between pairs of pyramidal neurons in superficial layers of the rodent somatosensory cortex, a well-characterized exemplar of the mammalian neocortex. Our preliminary data indicates that under conditions of high network activity, excitatory synaptic connections onto multiple neuronal cell types can be effectively silenced by GABAb activation. We will identify the cellular source of GABA responsible for this suppression and examine how GABAb signaling is regulated in vivo. Understanding both the static and dynamic patterns of synaptic connectivity in the neocortex will be essential for understanding circuit function and plasticity in health and disease."
"9283609","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Univ of Chicago K12 Career Development Program in Omics of Lung Diseases will establish a new pathway for the further training of physician and non-physician junior faculty scientists in the integration and analysis of large data sets to gain new insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying lung diseases and translate these insights into tools for disease diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. Only junior faculty will be enrolled as Scholars in this 2-year training program, which requires at least 80% commitment. Each will engage in an individualized curriculum of classroom courses and hands-on training, and will apply these skills in a multidimensional, highly-mentored research learning experience. The pro- gram focuses on three respiratory health problems - asthma, childhood sleep disordered breathing, and pulmonary fibrosis - because of their enormous health and economic importance's and the deep and broad expertise at UC in these areas; and because each is paradigmatic of common but complex disease syndromes in which many different combinations of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors conspire to generate a series of closely similar clinical phenotypes that are collectively named as single entities. Recognizing the commonalities of seemingly disparate diseases, we include a fourth training pathway that emphasizes a systems biological approach that spans all three disease groups. An explicit goal of this program that its training opportunities and benefits will extend beyond the relatively few Scholars whose stipends it will provide, into the larger respiratory biology community at our University and in Chicago, and to young scientists pursuing omics/informatics approaches to common, complex diseases whose principal target organs are other than the lung (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, etc). We expect that at least 7 Scholars will be trained in this program, which leverages extensive data collections and other research and training resources already available at the University, and brings faculty into the study of respiratory disease who had not previously worked in this area."
"9402860","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite compelling experimental evidence linking inflammation to the pathogenesis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), anti-inflammatory clinical trials have systematically failed to demonstrate beneficial effects in patients. This failure is often ascribed to the interrelated prospects that pan-suppression of inflammation is deleterious or that anti-inflammatories also inhibit protective stress responses. Thus, identifying novel targets to treat ARDS requires an understanding of the basic biology underlying key molecules that drive both pro-inflammatory responses in immune cells and protective stress adaptation programs in non-immune cells. Preliminary Data show that, in addition to inducing pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages, Caspase-1 protease activation protects Pulmonary Microvascular Endothelial Cell (PMVEC) and Pulmonary Arterial Endothelial Cell (PAEC) barrier function in response to infection. Additional data presented herein support a model in which Caspase-1 degrades glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins in PMVECs and PAECs as a protective strategy that limits accumulation of advanced N-glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RS) induced by infection. Intriguingly, the model opportunistic pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and vasculotropic pathogen (Rickettsia prowazekii) used in these studies both deploy homologous secreted phospholipase A2 toxins (ExoU) that inhibit Caspase-1 activation. The proposed experiments will test the Hypothesis that Caspase-1 activation in PMVECs and PAECs elicits degradation of glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins as an adaptive stress response to protect barrier function. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms of Caspase-1 activation in PMVECs and PAECs by: 1.1) Defining the mechanisms by which PMVECs and PAECs sense infection at the level of Inflammasome signaling using a Split Venus fluorescence complementation reporter. 1.2) Determining mechanisms by which the ExoU secreted toxin inhibits Caspase-1 activation using phospholipase A2 signaling inhibitors. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate mechanisms of Caspase-1-induced stress responses in PMVECs and PAECs by: 2.1) Elucidating glycolytic and mitochondrial proteins degraded by Caspase-1 and validating targets by site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme function assays. 2.2) Determining whether Caspase-1 protects PMVEC and PAEC barrier function during infection. Molecular and pharmacologic approaches will be used to either down-regulate or up-regulate Caspase-1 followed by assessment of barrier function, AGEs, and RS. Inhibitors of glycolytic intermediates, AGEs, and/or RS will unveil their roles in barrier demise. Specific Aim 3 will correlate Caspase- 1 activation and mitochondrial function with ARDS patient outcomes by: 3.1) Measuring active Caspase-1 and mitochondrial respiration in immune cells and non-immune cells. 3.2) Correlating outcomes with patient mortality and ventilator-free days. Long-term impact on human health and translational potential lie in identifying targets for therapies to treat ARDS, which are currently lacking."
"9279217","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Twenty-five years after the discovery of the CFTR gene and identification of its functions, we lack answers to many crucial questions, current treatments are inadequate, and cystic fibrosis (CF) remains a life shortening, lethal disease. A major barrier to progress has been lack of a CF animal model other than the mouse. Project leaders in this PPG developed the ferret and pig models of CF to overcome this impediment. Remarkably, these models develop lung disease with many similarities to that of human babies with CF. In this Program four senior and highly accomplished investigators and their teams will seize the unique opportunity to use CF ferrets and pigs as tools to investigate novel episomal and integrating gene transfer vectors. They will test the efficacy of gene transfer in correcting key physiologic defects that arise from loss of CFTR function. Studies with gene transfer vectors will be complemented by novel transgenic ferret and pig models expressing CFTR in a cell type specific or inducible manner. Program scientists will use several novel surrogate endpoints developed in the PPG to probe relationships between CFTR function and correction of biological and pathophysiological endpoints to judge efficacy. They will be guided by how complementation of CFTR function modifies airway biology, including Cl- and HCO3 - transport, host defense and mucociliary transport. The Project Leaders have an outstanding track record of collaboration in CF research, and here they sharpen their focus to a common goal. Their research is highly creative and is supported by five cores that provide innovative services and infrastructure. Discoveries from this PPG will accelerate development of novel therapies for patients who suffer from this devastating disease."
"9378835","Project Summary Over the past 5 years, the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) has continued its upward trajectory in cancer research excellence and service to its catchment area. The WFBCCC catchment area includes the Piedmont and southern Appalachia, a region of 58 contiguous counties in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee. The majority of this region is rural and exhibits significant racial health disparities. Elevated age-adjusted smoking rates, obesity rates, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality are observed across the WFBCCC catchment area when compared with the rest of the U.S. To target these issues, the WFBCCC conducts cutting-edge basic, clinical, and population research on the prevention, detection and treatment of cancer, and translates this knowledge into strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of cancer. WFBCCC cancer research funding is $37.9 million, of which over $14.9 million comes from the NCI; this represents a 25.3% increase in total cancer funding since the last CCSG renewal. Center research space under the Director?s authority increased by approximately 65,000 square feet, and the WFBCCC clinical facilities have been dramatically enhanced with the completion of the new eleven- story Cancer Hospital in 2013. This building houses all oncology inpatients and outpatients. The Center?s 127 members span the basic, clinical and population sciences and are organized into 4 Programs with substantial inter-and intra-programmatic productivity. Faculty additions enhanced tobacco control, tobacco-related cancer research, and precision medicine. Substantial investment in faculty, technology, and informatics significantly expanded cancer genomics capabilities. Enrollment of patients into treatment trials reached an all-time high in 2015, with a large increase in the number of patients enrolled in investigator-initiated trials. WFBCCC population scientists initiated exciting new efforts in cancer prevention and survivorship. Clinical scientists completed practice-changing studies in patients with glioma and lung cancer. Groundbreaking observations in prostate cancer emerged from WFBCCC inter-programmatic collaborations. WFBCCC basic science Programs continued to make high impact observations that are being translated into human therapeutics. The WFBCCC requests continued CCSG funding for 4 scientific Programs; 7 Shared Resources; 2 clinical research components; administration and leadership; planning and evaluation; and developmental funds. With these funds, a talented faculty integrated throughout the Cancer Center will make advances in the prevention, early detection, and treatment of cancer in the WFBCCC catchment area and the nation."
"9407909","Project Summary HIV-1 poses a substantial health and economic burden, with more than 30 million people currently infected worldwide. The search for an effective HIV-1 vaccine remains a top priority, and a deeper understanding of how the immune system recognizes HIV-1 can help inform vaccine design. Lately, much effort has focused on understanding the antibody responses to HIV-1 infection. However, the polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses in an individual are very complex. Standard methods for mapping such responses include various experimental techniques, but more recently, computational methods were also developed. These computational methods, which we call NFP (neutralization fingerprinting), are based on analysis of serum neutralization data that is typically obtained in the very first stages of donor sample characterization, and are therefore an efficient technology for accurately mapping antibody specificities in polyclonal responses. The NFP algorithms have already become an important tool in the HIV field and are being used extensively by laboratories throughout the world, including Duke CHAVI-ID, CAPRISA, NIH VRC, and MHRP.  Here, we propose to develop next-generation NFP algorithms and apply them to address biological questions with important implications for understanding the interactions between HIV-neutralizing antibodies and the virus. Specifically, we will develop and apply novel algorithms for: (1) Antibody specificity prediction with significantly improved accuracy and reliability. These algorithms will immensely improve the utility of the NFP approach for prospective identification of antibody specificities in polyclonal sera. (2) Mapping broadly neutralizing antibody responses against novel epitopes on HIV-1 Env. We will use epitope- structural analysis and computational search algorithms to identify novel Env epitopes, and will screen donor samples for the presence of related NFP signals. Promising signals for novel antibody specificities will be characterized further through collaborations. (3) Population-level analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV-1. We will analyze large collections of samples from diverse HIV infection cohorts in order to determine common antibody specificities elicited in response to HIV-1, as well as patterns of potential association between features of the infecting virus sequence and the elicited epitope specificities.  The proposed NFP algorithms will be made available to the public, and will be useful in a number of high-impact areas in the HIV field, including mapping of antibody specificities in previously uncharacterized samples, identification of novel Env epitopes, and large-scale analysis of broadly neutralizing antibody responses within a cohort, or at a population level. Overall, this work will lead to a better understanding of the neutralizing antibody responses against HIV-1 and will build a more complete picture of the epitopes on Env. The proposed algorithmic framework should be generalizable to other important viruses, such as influenza and hepatitis C, and therefore has the potential for a far-reaching impact on public health."

Travel support for a sub-set of attendees will be awarded, giving special consideration to junior investigators (i.e., students, postdoctoral researchers). This Physics and Chemistry of Microfluidics GRC/GRS is significant, as the discussion-oriented forum provides a unique opportunity for scientists and engineers to focus on the role of technology in advancing biomedical science. The health-relatedness of this application lies in the fact that microfluidic and nanofluidic technologies are providing new tools to study biomolecular interactions that underlie health and disease processes. A detailed, even quantitative knowledge is critical for understanding the molecular basis of disease and developing new therapies. While a handful of sessions do not specifically address NIBIB and NIGMS programs (i.e., Energy), microfluidics and microengineering are powerful technologies that can be used to facilitate and dramatically improve basic and applied biomedical research; topical areas that comprise the major focus of the conference. Microfluidics and nanotechnology are highly multidisciplinary fields. Based on our previous successful GRC's (biennially since 2001), participants will have diverse backgrounds (bioengineering, chemistry, biology, physics, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, medicine, and materials science). Participants will represent academia, government, and industry with the majority of participants from the academic sector.

In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic Cl will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III]) reading comprehension subtest score and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGlnitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the Cl Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of Cl (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence al near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1-year post treatment.  This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and o retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP).  Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center.  Symptomatic Cl is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of Cl treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9279227","Project 3 Title: Gene Therapy for Lung Disease in a Ferret Model of Cystic Fibrosis Project Summary The development of gene therapies to the CF lung has met with many challenges over the past two decades. The greatest of these has been a lack of animal models that reproduce the human CF lung phenotype, which has been solved by the creation of CF models in ferret and pig. These models will provide insights into the basic cell biology of the disease and facilitate the development of effective treatments, including gene therapy. This proposed project will focus on evaluating two gene therapy approaches in the CF ferret model and on elucidating key aspects of airway cell biology that will direct choices of the gene therapy approaches used. CF ferrets have two lung infection phenotypes that will be useful in developing therapies for CF?rapid, lethal neonatal infections during the first 1-3 weeks of life; and slower, chronic bacterial infections thereafter, typically leading to death by 3-5 months of life. We will use these robust lung phenotypes to develop lentivirus- and recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-based gene therapies for CF lung disease. The preliminary data presented, and vectors chosen for study, in this project are the product of the first two years of an R01 award that will transition into this PPG. Important goals of this project include: 1) the development and analysis of miRNA detargeting approaches to regulate cellular expression patterns of a lentiviral CFTR transgene and limit the phenotypic consequences of ectopic CFTR expression in multi-potent airway progenitor cells, 2) the generation of rAAV-CFTR vectors that are capable of reversing lung disease in the CF ferret model and that are also compatible with both the packaging limitations of the rAAV genome and cellular expression patterns required for efficient complementation of CFTR function, and 3) identification of the cell types in the lung that must be targeted for effective complementation of CF lung disease. The third goal of the proposal draws on the unique ability of the Engelhardt laboratory to rapidly generate transgenic ferrets that express recombinant fCFTR in biologically relevant cell types within the lung. Thus, this proposal uses novel viral targeting methods to address cellular mechanisms relevant to improving gene therapies to the airway, while also tackling difficult cell biology questions about the pathogenesis and treatment of CF lung disease using gene therapy. This research is expected to significantly enhance the field's ability to develop effective therapies for CF lung disease."
"9343053","Abstract: Calpains are Ca2+-activated, neutral (non-lysosomal) proteases implicated in neurodegeneration following acute insults such as stroke and traumatic brain injury, as well as in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer?s disease. Calpain research in the CNS has focused almost exclusively on the classical calpains, Calpains 1 and 2. Calpain 5 (CAPN5), which lacks the penta-EF hand domain of classical calpains, is the 2nd most highly expressed calpain in the CNS. Calpain 5 has homology to other calpains in the cysteine protease domain and also has a unique C2 domain at the C-terminus. C2 domains are involved in binding to membranes and lipids. Very little is known regarding the functions and substrates of Calpain 5. The C. elegans orthologue of Calpain 5, Tra-3, regulates transcriptional activity involved in sex determination. Tra-3 is also required for neurodegeneration induced by TDP-43 toxicity and for necrotic death of sensory neurons following calcium overload. At the subcellular level, CAPN5 is found in nuclear and crude mitochondrial fractions, and associated with promeylocytic nuclear bodies. The purpose of this proposal is gain insight into the CNS functions of Calpain 5. Aim 1 will identify Calpain 5 binding partners and substrates using three complimentary techniques: tandem affinity purification; proximity dependent localization; and in vitro affinity capture, with each technique paired with mass spectrometry for protein identification. The binding partners and substrates will be evaluated under both basal and elevated intracellular calcium conditions. The role of the C2 domain in Ca2+ binding along with CAPN5 activation and localization will be evaluated in Aim 2. Aim 3 will explore the physiological functions of CAPN5, utilizing knockout cell lines generated using CRISPR/Cas-9 and conditional knockout mice. Preliminary data support the feasibility of each Aim. Together, these results will provide essential information for deciphering the CNS function(s) of CAPN5."

The overall goal of the CATS Scholars Program is to support the development of clinical and translational scientists who will effectively engage in team science, will engage the community, and will make substantive research advances that impact human health and patient care. The program builds upon 1) our prior expansion of vigorous mentoring and career development programs for clinical and translational scholars, 2) our proven ability to leverage the resources of the NIH funded KL2 program to expand career development opportunities for clinical and translational scholars at UIC, and 3) the integration of the CATS Scholars Program with the UIC Center for Clinical and Translational Science and with other CTSA Programs nationwide. The CATS Scholars Program serves as a mentoring and career development core for scientists who are at the junior faculty level and are committed to a career in translational research. CATS Scholars are appointed for a two or more year program that includes 75% protected time for research activity, a core curriculum, and individualized educational and career development activities. All Scholars are guided through the process of creating an individual career development plan that both sets goals and serves as the framework for their planned activities during the CATS Scholars period. The specific goals of the CATS Scholars Program are: 1) To provide a mentored career development experience that allows Scholars to develop the NIH/CTSA identified core competencies in clinical and translational research, 2) To provide scholars with unique training opportunities that will drive innovation in research, and 3) To systematically evaluate the program and provide for continuous improvement and alignment with NIH/CTSA goals. The specific skills that may be required of clinical and translational scientists, such as involvement in team science, interaction with community partners, and superior science communication (both written and oral), fall well beyond traditional training in how to perform biomedical research. The CATS Scholars program fills this need.

"9288564","Acid-base disturbances occur in a wide range of diseases, and lead to disturbances in arterial (a) and intracellular pH that can have devastating consequences for the patient. In response to such disturbances, the renal proximal tubule (PT)?which normally handles ~80% of the H+ secreted by the kidney?appropriately adjusts its rate of H+ secretion (JH). Previous work showed that the PT does not sense the pH on the basolateral (BL) side of the PT. Rather, PT JH markedly rises with increases in [CO2]BL or decreases in [HCO3?]BL. Nevertheless, mechanisms for sensing ?[CO2]BL and ?[HCO3?]BL and transducing these to ?JH are poorly understood. Important clues are that the basolateral CO2-evoked increase in JH requires that endogenously secreted ANG II bind to apical AT1A receptors, and is blocked by inhibitors that target a subset of receptor tyrosine kinases that include ErbB1 and ErbB2. New data show that the knockout (KO) of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase ? (RPTP?), normally present in the PT basal membrane, eliminates the ?JH produced by ?[CO2]BL and ?[HCO?]BL, and markedly reduces the ability of the whole mouse to regulate pHa during metabolic acidosis (MAc). Curiously, the extracel- lular side of RPTP? has a region?the carbonic-anhydrase?like domain (CALD)?that is ~40% identical to clas- sical carbonic anhydrases (CAs). The three aims of this proposal are a multidisciplinary approach to address, at three levels of integration, how PTs senses ?[CO2]BL and ?[HCO3?]BL and transduce them into ?JH, and the role played by these processes in pHa regulation of pHa during whole-body MAc and respiratory acidosis (RAc): At the molecular level, we ask (1) what is the mechanism of RPTP?? How do ?[CO2] and ?[ HCO3?] control RPTP??s dimerization, which controls its phosphatase activity? Does RPTP? interact with ErbB1 and ErbB2? And does the CALD lack of CA activity, and if so, why? At the cellular level we ask (2) how do RPTP? and putative down- stream elements function in isolated PTs? We will use viral constructs, injected into kidneys of RPTP? ?/? mice, to determine the roles of RPTP??s CALD and phosphatase domains. Are ErbB1 and ErbB2 required to transduce ?[CO2]BL and ?[ HCO3?]BL signals to ?JH? Do [CO2]BL and [HCO3?]BL control JH by modulating ability of luminal ANG II to signal at or downstream to apical AT1A? At the whole-animal level, we ask (3) are RPTP? and downstream effectors (ErbB1, ErbB2, ACE, and AT1A) essential in the whole-body responses to MAc and RAc? The approach, using KO mice, is to impose MAc or RAc and assess arterial blood gases, urine chemistry, and targeted transcription and protein profiles. Our work will produce major insights into how RPTP? senses and transduces changes in acid-base status, how downstream elements function in PTs, and the impact for the whole animal. Because RPTP? is expressed in a broad range of cell types, is closely related to RPTP? (mainly in CNS astro- cytes), and because RPTP??s CALD is similar to three orphaned CAs, the impact of our work will extend across a diverse range of organ systems and cell types. It will provide important insights clinical problems that include acid-base disturbances and to diseases linked to RPTP?, which include schizophrenia and cancer."
"9336956","ABSTRACT The purpose of this application is to continue the development of cascade guanidine hydroamination sequences, developed in our laboratory, to prepare highly substituted 2-aminoimidazoles and polyclic guanidine scaffolds and study their rich and diverse biological activities. Specifically, this proposal targets three important structures: (1) We have identified a new class of N2-acyl-2-aminoimidazoles as Zn2+ ionophores that selectively kill breast cancer cells. These compounds cause the active uptake of Zn2+ by cells, leading to Zn2+- dyshomeostasis. Studies will optimize our lead structure (named ZNA) to achieve a complex balance of pKa and pZn (?log [Zn2+]free) which underpins this scaffold's activity of inducing zinc dyshomeostasis and lysosomal membrane depolarization. These compounds are active in vivo and are well tolerated, providing an important therapeutic lead for the treatment of breast cancer. Since this mechanism of action is not receptor mediated, these compounds are active against the major breast cancer subtypes including ER?, HER2? and PR? or triple negative cells. (2) We have developed a powerful cascade hydroamination sequence to construct the bis- guanidine core of (+)-saxitoxin. An extension of this strategy will target the synthesis of zetekitoxin AB (ZTX) a more complex and potent member of the voltage gated sodium channel (Nav) inhibitors that shares this bis- guanidine core. ZTX represents a powerful tool to study ion channel physiology, however, only 0.3 mg of the purified compound exists in human hands. The frog that produces this compound is critically endangered and protected by the Panamanian government. Thus the extreme rarity of this natural product dictates that only total chemical synthesis can provide this compound to the community. (3) Lastly, we will target guadinomine B, a unique carbamoylguanidine containing natural product that we believe is actually the same as NA22598A1, as they are structurally similar and both isolated from Streptomyces spp.. If they are indeed the same, their ascribed activities as an inhibitor of type 3 secretion system mediated pathogenesis (guadinomine B) and inhibition of anchorage independent growth / metastasis (NA22598A1) suggests an overlapping biological target. We advance the hypothesis that this common target is a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and that their inhibitory activity relies on Zn2+ chelation by the carbamoylguanidine. If guadinomine B's target is indeed an MMP, this offers a new therapeutic strategy to prevent bacterial pathogenesis, critical to the treatment of human disease (e.g. meningitis, cholera, the plague), either with compounds inspired by these natural products or the abundance of well-developed MMP inhibitors.

"9387290","PROJECT SUMMARY: Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus. It is associated with neurological features such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly in the recent outbreak currently spreading through the Americas. Since there are no vaccines or specific antiviral treatments available for ZIKV, understanding its pathogenesis in humans is a high priority. Following mosquito infection, ZIKV is transported to the local draining lymph nodes, where primary amplification of the virus and key host defense responses are triggered. Although mosquito transmission is the primary means for infection, virus has been measured in seminal fluid, and sexual transmission has been reported on numerous occasions. In this proposal, we seek to study the early infection events that occur in humans in the draining lymph node as well as in the urogenital tract by developing ex vivo human lymphoid and cervical tissue models of ZIKV infection, respectively. In preliminary studies, we show that ZIKV replicates robustly in human lymphoid and cervical tissue in all donors tested, and ZIKV-infected cells can be detected. In this application, we will use two strains of ZIKV that may differ in their pathogenic potential in humans to: 1) determine the strain-specific replication kinetics following infection, 2) identify the ZIKV-positive cell population(s) within the tissues, and 3) evaluate the cellular immune response and cellular activation events in two distinct organ culture systems: lymphoid tissue (Aim 1) to mimic early infection in the draining lymph node, and cervicovaginal tissue (Aim 2) to mimic mucosal transmission. Understanding these viral and cellular aspects in a human system and how these differ between strains of ZIKV will not only provide the first glimpse into early infection events, but also lead to new hypotheses for in vivo susceptibility in humans."
"9334913","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of hypertension, stroke and coronary artery disease increases dramatically in patients with non- insulin dependent type 2 diabetes. Aberrant Ca2+ influx via L-type CaV1.2 channels (LTCCs) leading to enhanced vascular smooth muscle (VSM) contraction, myogenic tone and blood flow/pressure has been implicated in the chain of events contributing to hyperglycemia (HG)-induced vascular complications during diabetes. Yet, the mechanisms involved in this pathological alteration are unclear. We recently discovered exciting new data indicating that anchoring of protein kinase A (PKA) by the scaffolding protein AKAP150 (AKAP79 is the human ortholog) is required for stimulation of LTCC activity and vasoconstriction during HG and diabetes. This contrasts the conventional notion that increases in cAMP/PKA activity leads to VSM relaxation and vasodilation. Thus, the overall goal of this competitive renewal application is to address two fundamental gaps in knowledge raised by our novel observations: 1) could spatial confinement of sarcolemmal cAMP/PKA signals in VSM during HG promote vasoconstriction? and 2) what upstream mechanisms trigger cAMP/PKA signaling during HG/diabetes? Preliminary data indicate that spatially discrete and heterogeneous cAMP/PKA signaling foster LTCC potentiation and VSM contraction during HG/diabetes. We also provide compelling evidence implicating a novel AKAP150-anchored P2Y11 receptor (P2Y11), which is coupled to GS, as an essential component of PKA-mediated CaV1.2 phosphorylation, functional upregulation of channel activity, enhanced Ca2+ influx, activation of calcineurin (CaN)/NFATc3-dependent signaling and vasoconstriction in HG/diabetes. Compelling results reproducing these pathological changes in native human VSM/arteries from non-diabetic and diabetic patients underscore the translational significance of our data. Beyond an unexpected role for GS-coupled P2Y11 signaling in vascular physiology, the pathological induction of compartmentalized adenylyl cyclase (AC)/PKA signaling leading to VSM contraction during HG/diabetes is a highly innovative concept of our model. Two aims will be investigated to test the central hypothesis that a macromolecular complex involving the P2Y11, AKAP150, AC and PKA underlies CaV1.2 phosphorylation and LTCC-mediated Ca2+ influx in response to HG/diabetes. Aim 1 will examine the hypothesis that spatially confined AC/PKA signaling stimulates LTCCs to trigger PKA-mediated VSM contraction and vasoconstriction during HG/diabetes. Aim 2 will investigate the hypothesis that an AKAP150-anchored P2Y11 complex mediates compartmentalized AC/PKA activity, LTCC upregulation and vasoconstriction during HG/diabetes. Methods used to test these hypotheses will include optical techniques developed by our group, super-resolution microscopy, optogenetics, genetically encoded biosensors, state-of-the-art electrophysiology, molecular biology, telemetry and blood flow measurements. Experiments proposed in this transformative/translational study will provide invaluable mechanistic information that could lay the foundation for novel early intervention therapeutic strategies during diabetic vascular dysfunction."
"9312676","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although there is very high interest in the demography and welfare of families headed by lesbian and gay (LG) parents, there is currently very limited longitudinal research on LG families or the transition to LG parenthood. Most of the extant literature is descriptive, comparative, or limited to distinct subgroups of LG parents. Of this research, demography studies that examined trends in LG family structures have rarely considered the family and individual processes that may account for changing trends in LG family formation; meanwhile developmental studies of LG parents have rarely considered the ecological and cultural influences on family and individual functioning, nor systematically considered how family structure may impact the family dynamic. Lastly, no studies that I am aware of have integrated family demography and biosocial approaches to understanding how stress is related to ecological and individual or family decisions and behaviors in LG families. The current research will use both secondary data analyses of longitudinal national datasets such as the U.S. Census and American Community Survey to examine within-state changes in rates of LG family structures over the past 10 years and how these changes correlate with state-level sociopolitical climates and public policies pertinent to LG family formation. This will be followed by a pilot study that will explicitly examine how sociopolitical and ecological factors ar associated with decisions regarding family formation and LG family functioning as mediated by individual mental health, relationship stability, and stress load. I have outlined 3 training goals that are critical for the success of this timely and innovative research study. The first goal is t develop conceptual and methodological expertise in the study of family demography, with an emphasis on contextual influences on family formation for lesbian and gay parents. The second goal is to increase my knowledge and expertise in using established national datasets such as the U.S. Census and the American Community survey to conduct secondary data analyses pertinent to the study of LG families. The third goal is to conduct a multi-state pilot using a biosocial model of individual and family formation and functioning to understand how contextual factors are related to LG individuals' well-being, decisions regarding the timing, method, and location for family formation, and parental functioning in preparation of submitting an R01 proposal on this topic in the later years of this K01 funding period. I have established an extremely strong and accomplished mentorship team that will guide my training and collaborate on each phase of the proposed research. In consultation with my mentors and consultants I have established a training plan that includes (1) mentor-based supervised training and directed activities, (2) formal graduate level coursework and short courses, and (3) participation in relevant research seminars, colloquia and scientific meetings. This training and pilot research will provide me with the skills, experience, and preliminary data necessary to establish an independent research program on this highly significant and innovative topic."
"9211434","MISSISSIPPI CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN PERINATAL RESEARCH ADMINISTRATIVE, MENTORING AND EDUCATION CORE A SUMMARY  The major goal of the Mississippi Center of Excellence in Perinatal Research (CEPR) is to develop an innovative, independent and sustainable center of excellence in perinatal research and treatment spanning the spectrum from adverse pregnancy to subsequent outcomes in offspring. More specifically, perinatal research encompasses the study of disease states that may occur during gestation and early post-natal development that result in long term consequences in the mother and offspring across their lifespan. Studies will focus on the integrative relationships and health disparities in adverse pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and developmental programming of cardiovascular, renal, metabolic and behavioral diseases. This is an important area for research especially in light of the increasing evidence of long term health consequences brought about by adverse fetal environment and subsequent low birth weight during pregnancy both for the mother and offspring. An adverse perinatal environment is thought to account at least in part for the development of obesity, cardiovascular, renal, and behavioral diseases later in life for the offspring, and predispose the mothers for increased risk of these diseases with aging. Mississippi has one of the highest rates of preeclampsia, obesity, cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases and hypertension in the United States, leading to disproportionate levels of morbidity and mortality in our population. The incidence of preeclampsia is 10% in Mississippi, compared to 5% in the US. The prevalence of children with low birth weight in Mississippi is 12% in Caucasian children and 18% in African American children, compared to 5-8% in the other states. Studies that will provide novel insight into mechanisms responsible for the high rates of these diseases in Mississippi will require a paradigm shift in research that incorporates multidisciplinary integrated approaches, combining the efforts of basic, clinical and population scientists. A major goal of this proposal is to develop a research Center that will provide infrastructure and capacity for a multidisciplinary, diverse group of basic, clinical and population scientists working on the common synergistic theme of perinatal diseases and health disparities and to facilitate their collaborations. The specific aims of the Administrative, Mentoring and Education Core A include the following: 1. To provide overall leadership for development of infrastructure, mentoring programs and research core facilities that foster excellence in perinatal research spanning the spectrum from adverse pregnancy to subsequent outcomes in offspring and will lead to development of an innovative, internationally recognized Center of Excellence. 2. To develop, implement and monitor a Mentoring and Education Program that facilitates development of junior faculty investigators into independent, extramurally (NIH) funded researchers. 3. To develop and implement a Pipeline Grants Program for promising new investigators, with emphasis on recruiting and mentoring under-represented minority investigators. 4. To develop and implement educational programs that will facilitate collaborations and interactions among investigators from multiple disciplines in perinatal research at UMMC. 5. To develop and implement programs for recruiting, training, and mentoring a diverse group of undergraduate students and postdoctoral trainees to provide experience in mentoring for the junior investigators and so that the trainees become the next generation of perinatal researchers. 6. To implement formative and summative evaluation strategies for overall progress and effectiveness of the CEPR junior investigators, programs, and cores. 7. To provide high-level program administrative support and fiscal oversight of all research projects and cores. 8. To organize networking meetings and seminars related to the Center as well as meetings of the Executive Committee, Internal and External Advisory Committees. 9.To ensure that all Center programs, initiatives, policies and reporting mechanisms to UMMC and NIGMS are optimally developed, implemented, and administered within federal granting agency policies and deadlines."
"9276047","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is proposed to investigative, using experiments and computer simulations, the unassisted permeation of short peptides through phospholipid membranes. Peptide Passive Translocations (PPT) are relevant to key questions in biology: (i) PPT suggest transport mechanisms into and out of primordial cells; (ii) PPT participate in insertion of transmembrane helices and membrane machinery; and (iii) PPT are models for the design of efficient permeants for molecular delivery. Studying kinetics and thermodynamics of peptide-membrane processes using atomically detailed physics- based approaches will provide unprecedented insight into permeation and insertion events and to the way biological systems control concentrations gradients and transport. In particular the present study may provide useful guidelines for the design of efficient molecular permeants. However, these investigations are challenging since they are impacted by (i) subtle variations in properties of the membranes and permeants, requiring high accuracy; by (ii) interactions at length scales significantly larger than the permeant dimension requiring large scale simulations; and by (iii) exceptionally broad temporal scales from nanoseconds to hours. Novel experiments and theories will address these challenges. Experimental permeation rates are determined by time- resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy of tryptophan and FRET using chromophores placed strategically throughout the membrane-peptide system. Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Milestoning simulations of these systems, which closely mimic biological environments, will be conducted. We start our joint experimental-theoretical collaboration with a transmembrane helix, and continue to investigate the permeation of a single amino acid through a pure DMPC or DOPC membrane. We end with peptides crossing a membrane enriched with transmembrane helices, cholesterol (chol) or 6- ketocholestanol (6ket) molecules. The last system mimics true biological environments."
"9287930","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A long term goal in our lab is to determine the structure-function scope of bPNA. The objective of this application is to use bPNA to produce fluorogenic aptamers that are function as theranostic tools for study and treatment of HER-amplified cancer. The central hypothesis of this application is that bPNA hybridization with nucleic acid libraries can be used to integrate fluorogen-photosensitizers into affinity selection such that the fluorogen is a component of the recognition site that makes close contact with the ERBB receptor. Target binding thus activates fluorescence and exposes the aptagenic site to maximum damage by fluorogen-produced reactive oxygen species. Our rationale for this hypothesis is the finding that bPNA triplex hybridization can fluorescently label DNA and RNA aptamers. Our independent efforts are supported by the shared resources and expertise of the Center for RNA Biology at the Ohio State University as well as collaborators in clinical investigation of HER+ breast cancer, ERBB receptor biochemistry, SELEX, photoimmunotherapy on ERBB-dysregulated cancer and photo physical methods. These factors combine to create a setting conducive to the successful completion of the proposed investigations. The proposed research is creative and original because a new general method is described using bPNA hybrid structures that will seamlessly incorporate non-native groups (fluorogens) into affinity selection. This will allow selection for artificial functional groups atthe aptamer-target recognition interface. The bPNA-aptamer hybrid structures offer transformative advantages not previously known. This creative, original approach will yield the following expected outcomes: 1) a widely applicable procedure for inclusion of prosthetic groups in SELEX; 2) fluorogenic reporters of HER2, HER3 and heterodimer status, as well as a general protocol to report on any aptagenic site; 3) aptamer- directed inactivation of HER2 and HER3 in vitro and in cell culture. The proposed research will yield theranostic fluorogenic aptamers for diagnosis and treatment of HER-amplified breast cancer as well as establish a general protocol for aptamer-directed biosensors and photodynamic therapeutic reagents."
"9327774","PROJECT SUMMARY Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) includes serious threats to maternal health and survival that occur at delivery or postpartum. SMM, which includes postpartum hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, and other serious conditions, can be life-threatening and have long-term effects on a woman?s health as well as adversely impact her infant?s health and well-being. Over the past 15 years, the prevalence of SMM has doubled in the U.S., currently affecting more than 65,000 women each year. Additionally, the prevalence of SMM is highest in women of minority races and ethnicities, particularly women who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. However, the most important risk factors for SMM are not established and it is unknown what is contributing to racial/ethnic disparities and increasing trends in SMM. Our goal is to improve the understanding of SMM and its risk factors to provide evidence that supports efforts to reduce the prevalence of SMM and racial/ethnic disparities in SMM. The proposed project will use linked vital statistics, patient discharge, and U.S. Census data for over 4 million births in California from 2007 to 2014. We will test trends in SMM prevalence and calculate the population attributable risks for three key potential risk factors?advanced maternal age, prepregnancy obesity, and cesarean delivery?and their combination across the years of study (Aim 1). Additionally, we will examine a wide range of potential risk factors to identify those that are most important using a machine-learning/data-adaptive approach (Aim 2). Both study aims will be done in the overall sample and separately in racial/ethnic groups. Understanding SMM trends and determining the strongest predictors of SMM are critical steps to launch forward research of this pressing and understudied public health problem. Many factors may present crucial opportunities to prevent the development severe maternal morbidity?saving the lives of mothers and helping ensure a healthy future for their children."
"9281868","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare disease (affecting ~1/5, 000), caused predominantly by mutations in ENG or ACVRL1 aka ALK1 encoding TGF?MP receptors. Patients develop vascular malformations, including small mucocutaneous telangiectases and/or large visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in multiple organs. The penetrance and expressivity of clinical manifestations is highly variable between patients, even within a family. The rationale for the project is that investigation of the biological and molecular characteristics of cells circulating within blood, especially, but not onl, circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs), will provide important new knowledge about basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of HHT pathobiology, and contribute to development of prognostic HHT markers. The overarching hypotheses to be tested are: a) the cellular makeup of circulating bone marrow-derived cell populations is perturbed in the blood of HHT patients; b) there is an elevation of cEPC numbers in HHT that contributes to and correlates with disease pathology including telangiectases and AVMs; c) gene expression networks are perturbed in HHT cEPCs to alter their biological functions, and d) HHT genetic modifiers regulate cEPC numbers and biology. The extent to which cellular and molecular perturbations correlate with disease type (HHT1 versus HHT2) and disease severity will be tested, and molecular mechanisms investigated using cultured endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) from HHT bloods. Aim 1) multi-color FACS analysis will be utilized to assess perturbation in circulating cell numbers in HHT patients and HHT mouse models, focusing on cEPCs and monocytes. Aim 2) ECFCs will be isolated from blood of HHT patients and controls, and utilized to investigate alterations in clinically-relevant parameters of in vitro angiogenesis, and biologicl effects of siRNA knock down of HHT modifier genes. A bank of cEPC-derived iPS cells will be generated for use by the HHT community. Aim 3) Blood cell mRNA and miRNA transcriptomic profiles will be compared between wild type, Eng+/- and Alk1+/- mice. Blood gene expression networks will be generated from existing transcriptomic data available from genetically heterogeneous mouse (>100) and human (>100) populations. Finally, new transcriptomic data will be generated from human HHT1, HHT2 and control blood, to test the postulate that gene expression networks are rewired within HHT cEPCs and/or monocytes to alter cellular parameters that can be molecularly probed in Aim 2 in order to provide mechanistic insight into HHT disease mechanisms."
"9335388","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):     Sleep apnea is a systematic disorder. All tissues in the body experience hypoxia that occurs as a consequence of apneas. Thus, sleep apnea leads to multiple adverse consequences. Sleep apnea is heritable, although to date no convincing gene variants have been identified. There are also important individual differences in risks and consequences within patients. These individual differences suggest that sleep apnea is an ideal disorder to develop a PERSONALIZED approach to risk assessment, diagnosis and management. It is this overall concept that motivates this program of research. The program has 3 projects and 5 supporting cores. The first project-Mechanisms  of  Extreme  Phenotypes  in  Obstructive  Sleep  Apnea  (OSA)  (Project  Leader:  R. Schwab)-is focused on understanding the basis of extreme phenotypes. In this project the investigators study very obese individuals with and without sleep apnea. They ask the question-given that these individuals have the major risk for sleep apnea, what protects those without the disorder? Is it a difference in fat distribution, different physiological control mechanisms or a combination? The investigators also study lean individuals with and without sleep apnea and ask the same question-why? What role does craniofacial structure, different distributions  of  fat  and  ventilatory  control  system  instablity  play  in  the  development  of  apnea  in  thin individuals? This project is based on in-depth phenotyping. Project 02-Mechanisms for Individual Differences in Hypertension in Obstructive Sleep Apnea (Project Leader: S. Kuna)-addresses the basis of individual differences in blood pressure response to sleep apnea. The investigators propose that the largest effect of sleep apnea on blood pressure will occur in individuals whose BP is not controlled on anti-hypertensive medications, and that these individuals will benefit most from PAP treatment. They ask the question-why? The investigators propose that the individual differences in blood pressure response are related to individual differences in oxidative stress and catecholamine responses to sleep apnea. They predict that these proposed mediators are  driven by  genetic differences in  the  key  enzyme that  leads to  oxidative stress-NADPH oxidase-and propose sequencing of genes that regulate activity of this enzyme. The final project-Genetics of Sleep Apnea and Its Consequences (Project Leader: A. Pack)-continues the genetic theme, but proposes a new strategy to identify genes conferring risk for sleep apnea and its consequences. This strategy involves mice, in particular the genetically heterogeneous Diversity Outbred mice, a recently developed, state-of-the-art approach to genetic discovery through animal models that has already shown its ability to discover new genetic associations. High throughput phenotyping of these mice, together with genotyping with a genome-wide SNP chip, allows identification of small genomic regions that relate to the phenotype being studied. The phenotypes being assessed in Project 03 are: tongue fat (relevant to anatomy in Project 01), ventilatory responses to hypoxia/hypercapnia (related to physiological mechanisms in Project 01), and blood pressure response to cyclical intermittent hypoxia, akin to that which occurs in sleep apnea (relevant to Project 02). Thus all 3 projects work synergistically. All projects are supported by 5 cores: a) Administrative, b) Sleep Study and Recruitment, c) Magnetic Resonance Imaging, d) Molecular Assessment, and e) Biostatistics and Data Management."
"9279203","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A precise understanding of the sequence-stability relationship is of fundamental interest in protein biochemistry, as protein instability is a cause f a wide range of pathologies, and it would enable facile engineering of proteins for industrial and therapeutic purposes. Protein engineering and de novo design have broadly delineated the forces that stabilize proteins and have yielded some spectacular successes in designing new or stabilized proteins. However, we are still far from a precise physicochemical model of protein stability; there is still no reliable way to predict the thermodynamic consequences of an arbitrary mutation.  In the first five years of this project, we established a novel high-throughput dye binding method (HTTS) to measure protein stability, and applied it and a cell-based screen for function to the study of core, loop and surface variants of the well-studied homodimeric four-helix bundle protein Rop. This strategy enabled us to directly test hypotheses of protein design, by building large, targeted libraries of protein variants and sorting them for foldedness. We designed a Cys-free Rop as the scaffold for this work, which was used in Rop topology studies, and we designed an active, stable single-chain Rop. We developed a bacterial screen for the DNA binding activity of the core domain of the tumor suppressor p53, and used it to screen a small core library.  Here we propose to extend studies of Rop by drilling down into surprising discoveries about the stability effects of disturbances of the heptad repeat and the prevalence of Val residues in the core; a stabilizing i to i+2 electrostatic interaction in the loop; and the prevalence of Lys in selected variants in surface positions. These studies will be informed by collaborations in computational protein design. We also will explore more subtle effects at different positions in the heptad repeat, and repacking around low-propensity and unnatural amino acids. We are developing and innovative all-in vitro version of HTTS that couples gene synthesis, in vitro transcription/translation directly to HT purification and stability measurement giving us unprecedented control over our libraries. These studies can be combined with our Rop enrichment selection to directly compare fitness and stability with deep sequencing and HTTS. We will use the p53 screen for similar studies, especially focusing on the role of a loop in dynamics and stability. Finally, we are developing HT screening systems for Cra and Rosetta-designed proteins to interface our studies with statistical and computational protein design.  The throughput of biophysical characterization is poor, so only a small number of protein mutants have been examined in detail for most scaffolds. This prevents thorough study of effects such as sequence correlation or exploration of shallower energy surfaces. Here, we will continue to use the power of high- throughput approaches to test and refine protein design principles with statistical significance, both improving our knowledge of the sequence-structure relationship and enabling future design and therapeutic approaches.

"9281887","The neural crest is a multipotent embryonic cell population that contributes to diverse derivatives,  including peripheral ganglia, cartilage and bone of the face, and melanocytes. We have proposed and  tested a multistep gene regulatory network (GRN), comprised of a logical series of distinct regulatory steps  that act in concert to imbue the cranial neural crest its defining traits. However, there are significant  differences in developmental potential and migratory pathways of different neural crest populations arising at  different axial levels. Here, we propose to explore GRN differences along the neural axis, focusing on  premigratory neural crest cells from two distinct regions: cranial versus trunk. Our preliminary transcriptome  analysis reveals many transcription factors and signaling molecules specific to the cranial but not trunk  neural crest or vice versa. Our goal is to determine the position of these genes in the cranial versus trunk  GRNs. This systems level strategy will provide understanding of why NC GRNs produces a particular  regulatory state for use in preprogramming these cells to a different state. The aims are:  Aim 1: Multiplex perturbation analysis of GRN connections at cranial and trunk levels. With the genomewide  representation ofthe active transcriptome of premigratory cranial and trunk neural crest in hand, we will  perform loss-of-function experiments to perturb gene function and quantitate subsequent global  transcriptional changes in putative target genes in single embryos using Nanostring analysis.  Aim 2: Phylogenomic and funcfional analysis/dissection of neural crest enhancers. We will identify cisregulatory  elements that mediate expression of key GRN factors in cranial versus trunk neural crest  populations. We will perform multidimensional modeling that incorporates results of transcriptome data and  active enhancers with functional perturbation results into representational models of neural crest GRNs.  Aim 3: Reengineering ofthe trunk neural crest program to test skeletogenic potenfial. Using GRN  informafion, we will challenge the fate of trunk NC by reengineering their regulatory circuits and observing if  misexpression/deletion of key GRN subcircuits affects their identify and ability to contribute to cartilage."
"9275259","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With diagnoses at 1 in 68 live births in the United States, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been considered one of the most increasing child neuropsychiatric diseases. ASD is a neurodevelopmental disability characterized by social interaction deficits and repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. Twin studies and linkage analysis confirm that genetic abnormalities and environmental susceptibilities contribute to ASD. Human epidemiological studies support that maternal exposure to environmental risks like prenatal infection significantly increases the risk for ASD in offspring. Abnormal maternal immune activation (MIA) during early pregnancy results in deleterious outcomes in the central nervous system (CNS) of the developing fetus. As a critical maternal-fetal interface, the placenta also plays a key role in immune surveillance as well as fetal growth, and placental injury is strongly associated with risks for neurodevelopmental disease. We have identified a placental vulnerability to lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a compound that mimics bacterial infections) that is modulated by GABA receptor type A (GABAAR). Intriguingly, various GABAAR subtypes are expressed not only in CNS but also in immune cells and other tissues, where GABA signaling is found to modulate immune response. The most common GABAAR anomaly found in ASD cases is a maternally inherited copy number variation (CNV) at 15q11-13 which is implicated in ASD, Angelman syndrome, Prader Willi syndrome. My studies focus on novel ASD-risk mechanisms involving gene-environment interaction between one of the GABAARs, GABRB3, and MIA in an ASD mouse model. I hypothesize that a maternally inherited partial loss of GABRB3 and MIA could exacerbate fetal pathological brain phenotypes. I will determine if GABRB3 and MIA generate synergistic adverse effects on neural progenitor cell (NPC) functions in early development. Previously, we demonstrated that prenatal LPS challenge causes cortical patterning alterations in offspring with a pronounced effect on the abundance of Satb2-expressing upper layer callosal neurons and neuronal layer formation during early neocortical development. Preliminary data suggest that partial loss of Gabrb3 function greatly increases placental damage following LPS exposure. A short-term goal is to determine if GABAAR function in mother or maternal immune cells underlies this effect. In the long-term, I will assess whether GABAARs are valid drug targets in a mouse model of ASD. Confirmation that alterations in maternal GABAARs increase risk of ASD phenotypes may also lead to novel diagnostics that can identify mothers at risk during pregnancy. From this proposed study, I expect to find the key candidate molecules working downstream of GABRB3-mediated genetic predisposition combined with MIA. Importantly, administration of antagonists or neutralizing antibodies against these key mediator molecules may restore normal function of the GABA-MIA axis, which may potentially provide critical insight into therapeutic strategies to reduce risk of ASD."
"9294094","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) has opened unprecedented opportunities to simultaneously study local microarchitecture and global structural connectivity. Yet, nearly two decades after the initial presentation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), DW-MRI remains plagued by basic theoretical challenges to its interpretation in regions of complex tissues (e.g., crossing fibers). Understanding these complex regions with advanced DW-MRI methods is critical to quantitative assessment of the brain architectural organization, diagnosing connectivity abnormalities, and developing useful biomarkers. Although numerous potential acquisition and analysis techniques have been proposed, to date, there has not been a systematic characterization of the impacts of acquisition design and quality across advanced techniques.  The motivating hypothesis of this work is that different advanced DW-MRI methods are appropriate for different imaging contexts given practical image acquisition considerations (e.g., feasible scan time, hardware, propensity for patient motion). Investigators considering studies involving advanced DW-MRI are faced with two critical questions: (1) What is the expected performance (specificity/sensitivity) of possible advanced DW-MRI analyses given a particular imaging scenario? and (2) How can an imaging scenario be optimized to achieve target level of performance given a particular DW-MRI analysis scenario? The overall goal of this project is resolve these important long-standing questions. We will evaluate the motivating hypothesis through a series of three experiments:  First, we will perform the most extensive phantom study to date to map the empirical sensitivity and specificity of  advanced DW-MRI metrics. This study will generate scan-rescan data of known physical fiber structures.  Second, we will perform the most extensive scan-rescan study to date to map the in vivo reproducibility of advanced  DW-MRI metrics. This study will generate scan-rescan data across all three major scan vendors with neurologically  normal control volunteers who are age and gender stratified.  Third, we will collaborate with on-going clinical research studies to generate a large database of scan-rescan  validation data. This study will enable mapping of normal inter-subject variance, lead to the construction of a  normative database of advanced DW-MRI measures, and enable single-subject inference.  Together, these efforts will (1) provide a quantitative basis for biophysical interpretation of biomarkers derived from advanced DW-MRI in the context of noise and sampling strategies and (2) provide a solid theoretical and empirical basis for optimization of protocols within scan-time and hardware constraints. The data, analysis software, and visualization tools will be made freely available to facilitate continued improvement and innovation. These efforts will drive quantitative exploration for biomarkers based on advanced DW-MRI and, eventually, improve patient care."
"9276817","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a competitive renewal application in which in the previous cycle we demonstrated that both protein kinase C epsilon (PKCe) and resveratrol emulated ischemic preconditioning (IPC) in brain and that IPC, PKCe and resveratrol upregulate BDNF levels, which played a key role in neuroprotection. We also demonstrated that IPC and resveratrol preconditioning (RPC) induced neuroprotection via SIRT1 activation. SIRT1 activates hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2?) 1 and Akt 2, transcription factors involved in other preconditioning pathways 3,4,5 and is also known to play a role in epigenetics. Epigenetic changes have been suggested to play a key role in preconditioning 6,7. We now present evidence that RPC neuroprotection lasts at least 14 days and that SIRT1 brain levels are elevated during that time. Resveratrol has previously been shown to be neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia activating many pathways that protect mitochondria 8 and promote angiogenesis 9 to name a few. The main goals of the new funding cycle are to define the specific molecular targets of IPC that promote ischemic tolerance and to further define the molecular mechanisms of a chronic ischemic tolerant state. The specific aims are 1) to define the maximum window of neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia afforded by resveratrol preconditioning (RPC); 2) to define whether this extended window of neuroprotection by RPC against cerebral ischemia is SIRT1 dependent; 3) to determine mechanisms by which RPC promotes ischemic tolerance in the delayed window; and 4) to define the molecular underpinnings of the long-term neuroprotection conveyed by RPC."
"9473993","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Whether or not to surgically correct ambiguous genitalia to be more female- or male-typical with genitoplasty is an area of pediatric medicine that is highly controversial. Suboptimal outcomes such as poor post-surgical cosmesis and sexual dysfunction following outdated surgical procedures have driven intense controversy in the medical community over how, or if, genitoplasty should be used in the treatment of young children with ambiguous genitalia. To resolve this debate, a prospective study of outcomes of current genitoplasty procedures, including complication rates associated with these procedures, is needed of individuals who receive masculinizing or feminizing surgery during early childhood. Additionally, studies of parents who decide to proceed, or not, with genitoplasty for their young child are necessary to understand how these controversial decisions impact parents' reactions to surgical outcomes for their child. The overall goal of this proposal is to assess the outcomes of modern genitoplasty techniques with a consideration of the psychological outcome of parents who make the decisions to proceed with genital surgery for their child. This information is crucial for physicians to provide guidance to parents regarding the optimal approach for the management of ambiguous genitalia in young children, including the possibility that no surgery is best. The interdisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers included in the proposed studies spans the fields of psychology, statistics, pediatric endocrinology, and pediatric urology. The collective experience of our group optimizes our ability to translate findings from the proposed studies to a clinical setting in a timely manner."
"9274845","?    DESCRIPTION:  The importance of cryopreservation for tissue banking and transplant medicine is indisputable, being the only practical alternative for long-term storage of high quality biomaterials. While successful techniques for cryopreservation have been developed over the past five decades, they are generally related to small specimens, in the scale-range of cell clusters to small-organized tissues (m to mm range), with stem cells and corneas as examples. Cryopreservation of larger-size specimens (cm and above) has been accomplished only in cases where the mechanical functionality has a higher priority need than the recovery of biological functionality, with heart valves as an example. Nevertheless, the science and technology of cryopreservation have dramatically advanced in recent years, and the successful application of cryopreservation to large tissue structures and organs is closer than ever before. Cryopreservation success revolves essentially around controlling ice formation-the cornerstone of cryoinjury. The current research focuses on suppressing crystallization by the presence of highly viscous materials, known as cryoprotective agents (CPAs), in a process known as verification (vitreous in Latin means glassy). While vitrification is a well-understood phenomenon, its application to biological systems comes with the potentially harmful effects of toxicity of the CPA and structural damage due to thermo-mechanical stresses. In fact, these effects represent competing needs important for selecting CPAs and their concentrations, and represent a significant barrier to the development of cryopreservation technology. The current project seeks to alleviate this coupling by combining synthetic ice-modulators (SIMs) with the CPA cocktail, which influence the formation and growth of ice crystals. This project represents a holistic approach to the study of cryopreservation. The research team brings together expertise from the disparate fields of biology, chemistry, physics, thermal engineering, and solid mechanics, while combining modeling tools with experimental investigation. Substantial data has been presented recently on cryopreservation by vitrification with a selected set of SIMs, as they pertain to small blood vessel segments and rings. The current project targets scale-up cryopreservation of blood vessels as key building blocks for cryopreservation applications in bulky tissues, organs, and engineered tissue constructs. The relating technology is translational and the applied scientific and engineering tools are essentially the same, which signifies the potential impact of this study. Specific aims for this project are: (i) to measure key physical properties of the biomaterials, (ii) to perform cryomacroscopic investigation of relevant physical events such as crystallization and fracturing, (iii) to investigate the mechanical behavior of the materials, (iv) to evaluate viability and functional recovery of the specimen post cryopreservation, and (v) to model cryopreservation by vitrification while integrating the knowledge developed in the other specific aims. This modeling is deemed an essential tool for future technology developments and process optimization."
"9310337","Physical activity (PA), defined as any body movement that requires more energy than resting, has been shown to improve pain and function in persons with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Center for Disease Control and Prevention PA guidelines for adults of all ages including those with OA recommend at least 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous PA. However, adherence to PA guidelines is poor, particularly among persons with knee OA. Total knee replacement (TKR) is widely used to relieve pain and improve function in patients with advanced knee OA. Given the large investment in TKR and the rich evidence documenting the benefits of PA, the value of TKR could be increased substantially if TKR recipients became more physically active. In this application we propose key planning activities to design and develop the protocols for a multicenter clinical trial to address the innovative hypothesis that the period following TKR presents a window of opportunity to change fundamental attitudes and beliefs regarding PA. We hypothesize that small financial incentives coupled with regular supportive coaching will induce behavior change and facilitate adherence to PA guidelines. The planning activities include: (1) development of study protocols and regulatory materials to guide the study operations and its monitoring, (2) undertaking enrollment preparation activities to gather data on number of eligible subjects from potential centers and finalize selection of providers and centers, (3) selection of devices to objectively monitor PA to test and to select the monitor that fits the purpose of the study the best, (4) development of coaching intervention materials to standardize the intervention and test its delivery to optimize reliability, (5) development of the mechanisms, protocols, and schedules for the financial incentives intervention to optimize the timing and amount of the financial rewards for meeting PA milestones, (6) finalization of assessment tools to determine and assessment tools and monitoring protocols, and (7) creation of a data management plan to develop a standardized data capture plan and data monitoring system to optimize accuracy and minimize missing elements. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that immediate financial rewards can offset the delay in gratification inherent in a commitment to PA and that these rewards coupled with regular support and guidance from health coaching will further increase the rate of engagement in PA and improve compliance with PA guidelines. Successful completion of these planning activities will position the research team to execute successfully a highly significant and innovative personalized intervention built on the principles of health coaching and behavioral economics."

"9326005","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant signaling of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is heavily linked to the formation and progression of basal cell carcinomas (BCC), a skin cancer that affects 3 in 10 Caucasians. The standard treatment of BCC involves surgical excision of the entire tumor, but this procedure can leave heavy scarring. Researchers have been studying alternate therapy options that act by chemically inhibiting the Hh pathway. Most therapies so far inhibit smoothened (Smo), an upstream member of the Hh pathway, but the pathway later develops resistance. Thus, the proposed project aims to target Gli proteins, a set of zinc finger transcription factors (TFs) that act as the terminal step in the Hh pathway. Professor Meade's lab has developed a series of cobalt(III)-Schiff base (Co(III)-sb) complexes that are highly specific and irreversible inhibitors of zinc finger TFs. By conjugating Co(III)-sb to the Gli targe binding sequence (5'-GACCACCCA-3') to make Co(III)-Gli, highly specific and potent inhibition of Gli proteins is anticipated. This proposal additionally seeks to attach fluorescently modified Co(III)-Gli inhibitor to a gold nanoparticle (AuNP), making Au-Gli-Co. This will allow for: 1) topical delivery of the Gli inhibitor, 2) localized delivery, since Co(III)-Gli can be released fro the AuNP by inducing with light, and 3) facile visualization and tracking of the fluorescent active agent in vitro and in vivo.      The first objective of the proposal is to synthesize and characterize the unique Au-Gli-Co particle. Co(III)-Gli will be attached to the AuNP using DNA hybridization methods. It can become dehybridized (and therefore released) from the AuNP using near-infrared light, which causes AuNP plasmon resonance and generates heat. The second and third objectives are to validate Hh pathway inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Cellular experiments will be performed on two cells lines to determine the inhibitor's efficacy and specificity for targeting Gli. A 3D raft cultre model will be used to assess tissue penetration and cellular delivery. In vivo experiments will determine the ability of the agent to treat BCC tumors after topical application and laser activation. A mouse model that expresses Hh-mediated BCC tumors upon induction with tamoxifen will be used.      This proposal meets the long-range research and funding plans of the NIAMS. The project involves the development of a new skin cancer treatment with the use of small molecules, in addition to proposing an efficient and controlled system of transcutaneous drug delivery. It could have application in treating early or later stage BCC. Like many skin diseases, BCC tends to garner less attention than more aggressive cancers, but the successful implementation of this project would have significant implications in improving patients' quality of life."

"9401993","Our long-term goal is to develop novel antitumor therapies to treat recalcitrant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) by exploiting their unique over-expression of the two-electron, Phase II detoxifying enzyme, NAD(P)H:Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in combination with inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. In NSCLC, NQO1 is elevated 5- to 200-fold above associated normal tissues, while catalase levels are expressed at extremely lower levels in NSCLCs than in associated normal lung (or all other normal) tissue. We showed that unique and novel NQO1 bioactivatable drugs, (e.g., - lapachone (ARQ761 in clinical trials), are `bioactivated' by NQO1, resulting in massive H2O2-induced, apyrimidinic/apurinic (AP) site- and DNA single-strand break-mediated hyperactivation of poly(ADP- ribosyl) polymerase 1 (PARP1) that causes dramatic NAD+ losses (Huang et al., Cancer Res, 2012). However, co-administration of a PARP inhibitor dramatically enhances the antitumor activities of these drugs (Huang et al., Cancer Cell, 2016). We have discovered a much more potent NQO1 bioactivatable drug, isobutyldeoxynyboquinone (IB-DNQ) that is significantly more synergistic with PARP inhibition that -lapachone. We hypothesize that IB-DNQ will be a significantly better drug alone than ARQ761 (- lapachone) and result in significantly greater synergistic, NQO1-dependent antitumor activity in combination with PARP inhibitors against NQO1+ NSCLC cells. We propose to complete three specific aims to test this hypothesis.: Aim 1: To define the mechanism of action of PARP inhibition + IB-DNQ synergistic cell death (Yrs 0-5); Aim 2: To define the role of IB-DNQ-induced H2O2-related bystander effect in simultaneous NQO1+ programmed necrosis vs NQO1- apoptosis in matched NSCLC cells (Yrs 0-5); and Aim 3: To define the tumor-selective, NQO1+-dependent antitumor effects of the PARP inhibition + IB-DNQ regimen vs IB-DNQ alone in orthotopic NSCLC xenografts (Yrs 0-5). The aims will be performed using genetically matched NQO1+ vs NQO1- NSCLC cell lines by si/shRNA knockdown of NQO1+ human cancer cell lines and/or forced NQO1 over-expression to match known levels in polymorphic NQO1- human NSCLCs. We will also examine genetically match PARP1 si/shRNA knockdown vs normal NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. We assembled an outstanding research team to explore the metabolic, bystander, and efficacy effects of PARP inhibition + IB-DNQ treatments in orthotopic NSCLC xenograft models in this 5-yr grant. Our results should lead to the development of a clinical trial using this combination in 5 years."
"9306191","SUMMARY There is an urgent need for advances in neuroAIDS research that will lead to eradication of HIV in cART resistant reservoirs, including the CNS, and further contribute to improved diagnostics and patient care. Such advances require an interdisciplinary approach with participation of investigators in basic, behavioral and clinical research. The major goal of the Comprehensive NeuroAIDS Center Cores (CNAC) is to facilitate interaction between basic science, behavioral research and clinical medicine by providing a mechanism of support for translational investigations through infrastructural and financial support, as well as mentorship. Toward this end, the Developmental Core will provide support for pilot investigations, progress evaluation, guidance, and mentorship. This core application describes the progress during the current funding period, experience of the Core Leaders, the process to recruit and review innovative project applications, and the role the Core will play in mentorship of clinical and basic science faculty and trainees at various levels. It is anticipated that this core will play a pivotal role in enhancing and ensuring the success of neuroAIDS investigators, the advancement of neuroAIDS research and patient care, and the CNAC mission."
"9344666","PROJECT SUMMARY Accumulating evidence from clinical trials suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy is safe in most clinical settings. However, a low oxygen carrying capacity from moderate anemia may be deleterious in patients with cardiac ischemia. The potential for harm associated with anemia in patients with acute symptomatic coronary disease is supported by pathophysiological data that maintaining higher hemoglobin levels could benefit the ischemic heart by increasing oxygen delivery. Furthermore, results of the 110 patient MINT pilot trial found that all-cause mortality at 30 days was less frequent with a liberal transfusion strategy, 1 patient (1.8%), compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy, 7 patients (13.0%), (p=0.032). Systematic reviews of clinical trials evaluating transfusion strategies in patients with known ischemic heart disease document the absence of high quality data which has resulted in an ongoing controversy. The lack of high quality evidence to guide transfusions in patients with acute myocardial infarction has been cited in several major guidelines as well as by an NIH expert panel. Despite this, blood transfusions are being used as a negative indicator of quality of care by major organizations driving the adoption of restrictive strategies. The potential for adverse outcomes is real and immediate. In this multicenter pragmatic trial, we will activate 40 clinical centers and will randomly allocate 3500 patients at risk of myocardial ischemia with acute myocardial infarction and hemoglobin concentration less than 10 g/dL to be treated either according to a restrictive or liberal blood transfusion strategy. Our Primary Aim will be to determine whether a liberal transfusion threshold strategy (10 g/dL) is superior and will result in lower rates of either all cause mortality or acute myocardial infarction within 30 days following randomization as compared with a restrictive transfusion threshold strategy (8 g/dL). Our secondary aims will examine the effect of a liberal transfusion strategy compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy on adverse outcomes of transfusion related to volume overload, thrombotic risk and modified immunity. We will compare 30-day rates of congestive heart failure, thromboembolism, and pneumonia. We will also compare rates of 30-day death, myocardial infarction, and unscheduled revascularization, as well as hospital length of stay, and readmission to the hospital. We will contact the patients at 6 months to determine if the early effects on mortality are sustained or possibly enhanced. Relevance MINT is positioned to determine the threshold for blood transfusions in patients with acute myocardial infarction to minimize death and subsequent heart attacks. Given the high incidence of acute ischemic heart disease, the results of MINT can shape clinical practice."
"9276026","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Scarab Genomics was founded to improve E coli as an industrial organism by genome engineering. These strains have stable genomes since all prophages, transposable and IS elements, and the error prone repair systems were removed. A recA- version has always been provided as an option. The goal of the Phase I project was to ascertain whether the changes already introduced are sufficient to realize extended or continuous fermentation. Data gathered in Phase I show that we have indeed supported that hypothesis. Data obtained using serial transfer with shake flasks met our criterion for production stability of 21 days, but only when the cultures were not induced. This suggested the use of a two tank system with seed and production tanks. To confirm this we performed actual fermentations using Scarab funds. The results show that stable production of a test protein, CRM197 can be extended at least 33 days with no loss of productivity. This is more than enough to justify a 10 fold lowering of the cost of production with continuous flow rather than fed batch procedures that have been used in for manufacturing in E. coli. Continuous cultures were also analyzed by DNA sequencing and this was able to detect contamination as well as mutations and rearrangements. This analysis also revealed that the Scarab strain competed well against contaminants in contrast to standard strains BL21.  We are therefore proposing to take this system to the next level by developing a complete platform for continuous fermentation, called C-Flow. The FDA has recently encouraged adoption of continuous manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry, and several large companies have recently signaled readiness to implement the change. Our aim is to attack the bottom line of E. coli fermentation by offering a simpler and cheaper process that will produce consistently higher quality bioproducts than fed batch fermentation. Our proposal is to fully characterize the C-flow system and work towards commercializing it by developing a prototype that fits in a standard 6 ft hood. One particularly useful feature will support optimization of fermentation parameters without the need to restart fermentation so the best possible performance can be quickly and inexpensively achieved by a user. Other products such as pDNA will be tested in the C-Flow system."

There are three common themes  that unite the three research projects and the Outreach and Translation Core (COTC) of this Center: (1)  assessment of exposures during two critical developmental windows (prenatal and adolescent), (2)  investigation of joint effects of phthalate/BPA exposure and a high fat diet/obesity, and (3) investigation of  the role of oxidative stress and infiammation in mediafing effects. At the heart of the research effort will be  two human cohorts (Project 1)?a prospective pre-birth cohort currently in progress in Urbana, Illinois and an  adolescent cohort to be assessed as part of a long-standing prospecfive study in New Bedford,  Massachusetts. The Center will also include laboratory animal projects (Projects 2 and 3) which will model  the timing of exposures in these human cohorts, a COTC, and this administrative core which will provide  oversight, coordination and integration of all Center-related activities. The responsibilites ofthe  Administrafive Core will include organizing and scheduling monthly meefings ofthe Internal Advisory  Committee and monthly research team meetings ofthe Center investigators, organizing yearly meetings of  the Center scientists with the six-member External Advisory Committee, coordinating the career  development activities ofthe center, and facilitating interactions ofthe Pediatric Health Specialist with the  COTC to communicate research findings to the healthcare community.

"9407278","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This SBIR Phase I project will develop an innovative medical device useful for rapid automated characterization of myocardial performance in diabetes patients. Left ventricular systolic and diastolic myocardial impairment is the most common manifestation; and the systolic function is monitored with left ventricular ejection fraction measurement and the diastolic function is monitored with left ventricular filling pressure. These two measurements are available after reading and analyzing the echocardiographic examinations. The reported incidence of systolic dysfunction is approximately 2% and diastolic dysfunction is approximately 30% in diabetes patients without known heart disease. Even though the development of cardiovascular disease is the most common complication of type 1 diabetes, echocardiography is not routinely performed in patients with type 1 diabetes. Thus, the cardiologist and patients care provider need to collaborate to identify new non-invasive techniques to detect cardiac dysfunction at an early and potentially reversible stage, before the onset of the clinical signs and symptoms. The ability to use a device in any patient care setting by any healthcare professional, without the special requirement of an echocardiogram, would be of significant value. Towards this goal of early identification of cardiac dysfunction, AventuSoft is developing a novel portable medical device (HemoTag) to provide measurement of systolic function using heart sounds. Through this SBIR project, we will develop technology to include the rapid and automated measurement of diastolic function without requiring an echocardiogram. During this Phase I SBIR, the AventuSoft team will complete validation studies with diabetes patients to demonstrate a major clinical advancement by enabling the automated characterization of myocardial performance using HemoTag. At a fraction of the size and cost of current products, HemoTag can enable reliable, accurate and easy-to-use application by healthcare professionals, for the measurement of myocardial systolic and diastolic performance. It overcomes the limitations of cost, size and skilled personnel requirements of existing echocardiography devices. Phase II activities will focus on larger multi-center clinical studies, enhancing the technology for early detection, verification and validation testing requirements necessary for the FDA 510(k) premarket notification, and on productizing the system for commercial use. The benefit of this pioneering work is the development of a low- cost and portable device that will have great potential for early detection, diagnosis, and quantification of cardiovascular disease and cardiomyopathy complications in diabetes. HemoTag can help address the significant problems of patient safety though advancements in imaging equipment, make it more accessible and readily available as the technology does not require skilled specially trained operators."
"9269592","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In eukaryotes, the chaperone Hsp90 and its co-chaperones interact with and stabilize a number of crucially important cellular factors, including steroid hormone receptors, cellular kinases and transcription factors. Although a great deal is known about chaperone and co-chaperone structure, the structural basis for the interaction between Hsp90 and its clients remains unknown. The fundamental problem is that we still do not understand the physical state of the client protein when it is bound to the Hsp90 chaperone, and we have only a rough idea of where on the Hsp90 molecule the client protein makes contact. Part of the difficulty with obtaining data on these systems is that the client proteins ar generally extremely difficult to prepare in quantities suitable for structural analysis. Doubtless this is a major incentive for the cell to employ Hsp90 in their stabilization. We propose innovative methods of preparation of client protein-Hsp90 complexes, by addition of other necessary components of the chaperone cascade of the eukaryotic cell and by re-thinking the likely form of a high-affinity client protein. Our first aim will be to characterize interactions between a zinc-free form of the transcription factor p53 and the full-length Hsp90 dimer, using a set of structural measurements that can interrogate such a large complex. These measurements include small-angle X-ray scattering, room- temperature EPR, fluorescence methods and electron microscopy. The second specific aim will be concerned with the effect of co-chaperones on the system. Preliminary data show that there is a measurable interaction between the p53 DBD client protein and the p23 co-chaperone. NMR spectroscopy and other methods will be used to characterize this binary interaction, as well as the ternary interaction that we observe with the addition of Hsp90. In the third specific aim, we will examine the complex of the glucocorticoid receptor ligand-binding domain (GR-LBD) and Hsp90, adapting methods that have been used in the literature to demonstrate the presence of this interaction in mammalian cell extracts. A new preparation method for the complex includes the over-expression of a histidine-tagged GR-LBD protein together with the incorporation of accessory proteins from the chaperone cascade in the preparation of the complex. The successful conclusion of the proposed work will give important new insights not only into the specific nature of the chaperone-client protein complex, but also into the range of structural states sampled by proteins in their cellular environments: we have only recently begun to appreciate that protein conformational states other than the fully and stably folded states typified by traditional structural studies may be present and fully functional in the cell."
"9335921","The long-term goal of this project is to develop a detailed molecular understanding of the CLC (Chloride Channel) family of membrane proteins. The CLCs comprise two major classes of ion-transport mechanisms: half of CLC homologs are electrodiffusive ion channels (catalyzing downhill movement of chloride), while the other half are secondary active transporters that stoichiometrically exchange chloride for protons (harnessing the energy from movement of chloride to pump protons or vice versa). That both types of ion-transport are within one gene family suggests their mechanisms may be subtle variations on a single central theme. Indeed, CLC channels appear to act by a broken transporter mechanism. Here we propose a highly concerted approach composed of complementary computational and experimental biophysical and biochemical techniques to study the molecular details underpinning the mechanism of CLC-ec1 and CLC-0, model homologs for antiporters and channels, respectively. Our main goal is to elucidate the antiporter (unbroken) mechanism, taking advantage of high-resolution CLC-ec1 structures and the molecular dynamics simulations they allow, and of antiporter amenability to spectroscopic analysis. We will apply insights from studies of the unbroken transporter CLC-ec1 to electrophysiological analysis of the CLC-0 channel's broken mechanism to study conservation between channel and transporter mechanisms. AIM 1 will determine global structural changes associated with the CLC transport cycle. Here we will use EPR to measure distance changes between pairs of site-directed spin labels on CLC-ec1, evaluate changes in accessibility of spin labels, and use computational modeling to develop structural models for the inward- and outward-facing states. AIM 2 will determine how CLC conformational change affects water dynamics and water-wire formation involved in proton transport. These studies will help reveal how proton transport fits into the overall CLC transport mechanism. AIM 3 will characterize the chloride/proton coupling mechanism ? evaluating detailed models of how transport occurs, using a combination of kinetic and spectroscopic measurements on WT and uncoupled mutants, together with computational analysis to investigate in detail how binding and translocation of ions are coupled to protein conformational changes. Overall Impact: Revealing molecular details of CLC ion channel broken and antiporter unbroken mechanisms, and how they are alike and different, will help reveal how CLC function can go wrong, with implications for neurological diseases, hypertension, and diseases of kidney, muscle, and bone. Our methodology will be applicable to other large membrane proteins of medical importance where unraveling molecular mechanisms has similarly been stymied by limitations of crystallography."
"9334936","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2008 National Advisory Mental Health Council Workgroup on Research Training Report stated It is widely believed that MD/PhD investigators bring a unique perspective to their research programs because of the blend of clinical and research perspectives honed through graduate and medical education, residency and fellowship. In addition, MD/PhD investigators may be well-trained for translational research careers. (p10) The fields of neuroscience and genetics have developed such depth in t erms of knowledge base, research strategies and research techniques that PhD training (or its equivalent) may be a necessity for effective translational research and obtaining research funding. Unfortunately, the number of psychiatrist MD/PhD researchers is small. The NIH and NIMH substantially support Medical Scientist Training Programs and individual MD/PhD students, and have done so over many years. However, of those who train in MD/PhD programs only 5 -6% choose psychiatry training, and not all of those choose research careers after completing residency. In addition, the established method of combined MD/PhD training is inefficient, in that the period of intense research and PhD completion is followed by many years of clinical training. Thus there is a long separation from research, leading to a decline in research skills, distance from the knowledge base, and a need to retrain after residency. This results in few young investigators applying for R01 Awards. New models for training translational researchers are needed, and we propose a creative and innovative program for the production of superbly trained MD/PhD psychiatrist -researchers. The goal is to offer those individuals who, at the end of medical school, are ready to commit both to psychiatry and research, a training opportunity that will simultaneously promote both their clinical and research abilities. The program will integrate their clinical training with their PhD training, and their Ph research with post-residency research. The excellence of both clinical and research training at Mount Sinai, in addition to excellent financial incentives, make it very likely that excellent applicants will be attracted to the program."
"9284284","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Untreated bipolar disorder has severe consequences for the mother and there is increasing utilization of atypical antipsychotics as mood stabilizers and adjuncts to antidepressant therapy, with an associated increase in fetal exposure to these medications. Because of large differences in the pharmacokinetics of many drugs between humans and rodents, we have demonstrated that behaviorally active doses of many psychiatric drugs in laboratory animals do not reflect/model actual human clinical exposure and we have published on the need for clinically relevant and sustained drug administration in animal studies to mimic human exposures. Using a rat model, this study provides rigorous control of clinically relevant fetal exposure and will assess behavioral, gene expression and epigenomic changes in the offspring with an outcome that can inform clinical risks as well as identifying which medication may be the most appropriate clinical choice. Specific Aim 1 will provide animals with clinically relevant and verified drug exposure throughout gestation for the most commonly utilized atypical antipsychotics in the Emory University Women's Mental Health Program: quetiapine/norquetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone/paliperidone. Specific Aim 2 will provide a behavioral assessment of development (motor and cognitive) prior to weaning and as juveniles (postnatal days 23-35) with the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to atypical antipsychotic drugs alters normal development compared to vehicle controls. Specific Aim 3 will utilize our skills in gene expression (transcriptome) and epigenetic analysis (whole genome methylation patterns) in two brain regions (frontal cortex and hippocampus) likely to be important targets for healthy neurobiological functioning and relevant to the behavioral studies in specific aim 2. We will also assay leukocytes collected from these offspring which might provide biomarkers as windows into the brain. These data will provide important basic science information regarding medication effects on the developing brain which can translate, based upon known function(s) of specific genes, into areas of clinical assessment that may be most closely watched by pediatricians following these children. The focus of these studies on a single class of medications, with generally similar clinical efficacy, may directly guide physicians and patients in determining which medication may provide the least risk."
"9278309","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Extension and maturation of axons and dendrites are essential developmental steps that allow the nervous system to function. This development requires precise regulation of gene expression, with coordinated activation and inactivation of gene expression programs associated with growth, maturation, and function of neurons. Growth of neuronal processes or `neurites' must be precisely timed and regulated to generate functional neural circuits. Regulation of gene expression extends beyond transcribing DNA into mRNAs, and it has become increasingly clear that much regulation occurs post-transcriptionally in neurons. Regulatory steps include splicing, subcellular localization, and translational control of mRNAs. Stability of mRNAs plays a critical role in gene expression by modifying the amount of an individual mRNA available as a template for generating new protein over time. Stabilization and destabilization of mRNAs within growing neurites also impacts where new proteins are produced. Despite increased recognition of importance of this mechanism, we have little understanding of how neuronal mRNA stability is regulated. Recent work from the PI's and Co- PI's labs have uncovered a mechanism for modulation of mRNA stability in neurons. The RNA binding proteins KSRP and HuD compete for binding to GAP-43 mRNA. Both these RNA binding proteins are known to have multiple functions, and our data suggest that KSRP and HuD have antagonistic functions. For GAP-43 mRNA, KSRP binding destabilizes the transcript while HuD binding stabilizes the transcript. By initial CLIP analyses, KSRP and HuD can bind to overlapping cohorts of mRNAs and cytoplasmic KSRP appears to provide a governor to limit neurite length by destabilizing mRNAs. These data have led us to hypothesize that competitive interactions of HuD and KSRP with specific cohorts of ARE-containing mRNAs control the temporal and spatial pattern of neuronal protein expression during the initiation and termination of neurite outgrowth through changes in mRNA stability. We will test this hypothesis with three specific aims: 1) Does KSRP destabilize neuronal mRNA cohorts? 2) Do KSRP or HuD interactions alter stability of localized mRNAs? 3) Do KSRP and HuD compete for binding to a shared cohort of mRNAs with antagonistic functions? Completion of these aims will fill a gap in knowledge on mechanisms of neuronal mRNA stability and its contributions to brain development."
"9281882","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for renewal of a Program Project now in its 14'^ year. Here we propose to build in novel directions on the large success we have had in solving and authenticating gene regulatory networks (GRN) for development. GRNs provide causal explanations for developmental processes in the terms of the genomic regulatory code, in which all species-specific developmental processes are ultimately programmed. A developmental GRN serves as a conceptual, system-level logic map, which we have shown to possess direct predictive power. Thus GRNs bridge between functional genomic DNA sequence of regulatory significance and the biology of embryogenesis and body plan formation. They do this by specifying the regulatory interactions which causally drive the progression of regulatory states in diverse cellular territories. During recent years, this Program  has been responsible for the experimental solution of the most advanced developmental GRN yet available for any developing animal organism. This is the GRN underlying the specification of the endomesodermal territories of the sea urchin embryo. Recently proof of the principle that as a GRN approaches completion it indeed provides explanation of all the observed biological, functions has been obtained in this work. We now intend to capitalize on the growing suite of successful technological and conceptual approaches to GRN analysis that we have developed, to confront challenges that heretofore were inaccessible, or could not even have been defined. Current or soon to be completed sea urchin embryo GRNs include all but one of the major domains of the embryo, from the earliest zygotic genomic activity (at the beginning of cleavage) to just before gastrulation. In addition, in the current period of the Program Project, an advanced  GRN has been successfully constructed for the cranial neural crest of the chicken using the intellectual and technological approaches pioneered by this Program Project.  The DAVIDSON COMPONENT (Project I) of the sea urchin embryo GRN will now expand GRN analysis to Include the whole of the embryo in a single GRN model such that every input to every part of RENEWAL The only way medical practice will advance beyond elegant forms of band aids and single molecule drug targets will be by interventions at the level of organization that life system actually operate, particularly the control systems. This Project concerns the most advanced example of genomic control systems biology we have at present. Its successful conclusion will show what the structure of these systems is; how to think about intervening in them; and directly inform considerations of the role of developmentally active regulatory gene mutations in the many forms of human developmental genetic disease we have become aware of. The medical research community is well aware of these points and the PI's of this application are frequently asked by forward looking members of it for collaborations, consultations, symposium presentations etc."
"9285615","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenesis is an essential developmental process in which neural progenitors generate neurons. In the developing cerebral cortex, radial glia cells divide symmetrically to self-renew and asymmetrically to generate neurons and other progenitors. We lack a fundamental understanding of the cell biological mechanisms regulating radial glia divisions. In addition, we have a limited understanding of how radial glia divisions ar defined at the molecular level, including the role of post-transcriptional regulation. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the contribution of these essential levels of regulation for neurogenesis, by exploiting a novel mouse neurogenesis mutant. This mutant is haploin-sufficient for Magoh, which is a component of the exon junction RNA binding complex (EJC). Our previous NIH-funded studies demonstrated that Magoh mutants exhibit microcephaly, with brains 30% smaller than normal, largely due to reduced neural progenitors. We found that Magoh is essential for proper mitosis of neural progenitors and discovered that Magoh regulates Lis1, a microtubule-associated protein essential for neurogenesis. Moreover we have found that Magoh controls expression of key neural progenitor determinants. Together, our discoveries point to Magoh as a novel central regulator of neurogenesis, yet we lack a fundamental understanding of how Magoh functions in the brain. We propose Magoh has two critical functions in neural progenitors: to regulate proper mitosis and to act in a post-transcriptional regulatory module controlling expression of key neurogenesis genes. Our central hypothesis is that Magoh regulates asymmetric division of radial glia by influencing the mitotic spindle and mRNA metabolism. To address this hypothesis we will pursue the following aims: First we will determine the cellular mechanism by which Magoh regulates neuron and INP production. We will use conditional genetic analysis along with live imaging of radial glia divisions in live brai slices. Second we will define how Magoh regulates mitosis by elucidating its regulation of microtubules and Lis1. We will determine how Magoh regulates Lis1 levels and if Lis1 functions downstream of Magoh in mitosis. Third, we will define the key mRNA targets of Magoh in neurogenesis and determine the role of the EJC in their regulation. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have significantly advanced our understanding of how Magoh influences neurogenesis, by regulating both mitosis and mRNAs. Together, our proposed studies will broaden our fundamental understanding of the regulation of asymmetric division and the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders."
"9275300","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Tobacco and alcohol are the two most used and abused drugs in the world. Together, they are responsible for millions of deaths each year worldwide. Despite the enormous amount of research carried out to understand how these agents affect the lung, new information leading to significant advances at the clinic has been disappointing. Because of the high prevalence of tobacco and alcohol exposure in veterans, the Roman lab is exploring the mechanisms by which these agents affect the lung. Our research revealed that both alcohol and nicotine, an alkaloid present in tobacco, promote alterations in lung matrix composition that we have termed 'transitional' remodeling, a process characterized by subtle alterations in the relatively composition of the lung extracellular matrix. Although the exact mechanisms linking these events to lung disease remain incompletely understood, we believe that transitional remodeling renders the host susceptible to lung disease, and this belief is supported by published research performed both in vitro and in vivo. Considering the above, we set out to identify the cellular/molecular mechanisms responsible for these events. Using cultured primary lung fibroblasts, we found that nicotine induces cellular proliferation and matrix expression through the activation of specific 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (7 nAChRs). The importance of these receptors was confirmed in vivo showing that prenatal exposure to nicotine affects lung development and induces airway thickening and hyperreactivity in wildtype animals, but not in 7 nAChR knockout mice. Using the same culture model, we discovered that alcohol acts on lung fibroblasts via another set of nAChRs, 4 nAChRs. In rodent lungs, the expression of these receptors is increased by chronic alcohol exposure which, in turn, predisposes to acute lung injury. This work suggests that the cholinergic system plays an important role in lung homeostasis and response to injury, and points to nAChRs as potential targets for intervention. More recently, we found that nAChRs are activated through both ligand-dependent and -independent pathways. Specifically, while nicotine acts on 7 nAChRs in a traditional ligand-dependent fashion, alcohol works, at least in part, through induction of a particular form of oxidant stress (oxidation of the cysteine/cystine redox potential or Eh Cys/CySS) which, together with cysteine residues strategically located on the subunits of certain nAChR pentamers, activates nAChR signaling via ligand-independent mechanisms of action. Importantly, we have generated preliminary data to suggest that susceptibility to injury in aging might activate nAChRs through similar pathways thereby promoting transitional remodeling and increased susceptibility to lung injury. Considering the above, we propose that aging (as observed for nicotine and ethanol exposure) is associated with lung transitional remodeling via distinct nAChRs. nAChRs can be activated via ligand-dependent and -independent pathways, the latter triggered by oxidant stress induced by oxidation of the Eh Cys/CySS. Specifically, oxidant stress affects cysteines strategically located in the ? subunits of nAChRs which, in turn, triggers signal transduction and promotes lung transitional remodeling and increase susceptibility to disrepair after lung injury. To test this hypothesis, we propose experiments designed to: Aim 1. Investigate the role of specific subunit cysteines in nAChR activation in lung cells and in vivo. Aim 2. Determine the role of oxidant stress, especially, oxidation of the Eh Cys/CySS in nAChR activation both in vitro and in vivo. Aim 3. Examine the role of nAChR activation in lung disease related to aging and how this is affected by tobacco and alcohol exposure."
"9270561","This proposal aims to develop and test the feasibility of a novel school-based child sexual abuse (CSA) prevention program targeting 6th and 7th grade youth. The program will specifically address risk of adolescent CSA perpetration against younger children within the context of a universal prevention program. This study will proceed in three phases. First, a qualitative process be undertaken to ensure that the intervention is relevant and tolerable to students, parents, and educators. Second, a process will be undertaken in which feedback about a given module will inform changes to the next delivery of that module, minimizing the time needed to revise intervention components. Third, a pilot randomized control trial will be conducted within 6th and 7th grade classes at four urban schools to assess feasibility, acceptability, and early indicators of change. If successful, this project will lead to larger controlled trials to assess the effects of the prevention intervention on sexual abuse victimization and perpetration.  Aim 1. To iteratively develop and refine a new classroom-based universal intervention for the prevention of CSA perpetration that can serve as a stand-alone program or be integrated into existing school programs (e.g., sexual education or other prevention programs). Given the modal age of onset of juvenile sexual offending (approx. age 13), RBYC will target both boys and girls in 6th and 7th grade classrooms.  Aim 2. To preliminarily evaluate the immediate effects (pre-post design) of RBYC on targeted constructs, as well as retention of gains over a 6-month follow-up period. The intervention is expected to show positive effects on CSA-related knowledge, cognitions/attitudes, self-efficacy, and behaviors. This study will provide the basis for a larger, more rigorous RCT, if proximal outcomes prove favorable.  Aim 3. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of RBYC to youth, parents, and school personnel."
"9396105","Project Summary Asparaginase (ASNase) is one of the main drugs used for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The most common adverse reaction of ASNase is the development of an immune response that can compromise drug exposure and lead to worse treatment outcome. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that prevent or overcome the immune response to ASNase and retain sufficient drug exposure are urgently needed. PEGylated ASNase (PEG-ASNase) is the first-line agent used for ALL therapy, and it remains prone to immunotoxicity during treatment. Our preliminary results showed that: 1) ASNase-induced immune responses can decrease drug exposure through direct drug neutralization and by accelerating the pharmacokinetic clearance of ASNase; 2) therapeutic drug levels can be attained after sensitization to PEG-ASNase but may require drug doses higher than in nave patients to achieve similar therapeutic effects; 3) there is a higher risk of ASNase hypersensitivity among carriers of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 2 (NFATC2) rs6021191 variant, which leads to higher expression of this transcription factor involved in the regulation of immune responses; 4) both IgG and IgE antigen-specific antibodies are involved in the mechanism of ASNase hypersensitivity, which will be used to facilitate the development of a cell-based approach to monitor PEG-ASNase immunogenicity; and 5) we have established two mouse models of transplantable B cell ALL that can be used to study drug efficacy and toxicity. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that (1) pretreatment strategies that can overcome immune responses to PEG-ASNase by blocking the mediators of hypersensitivity and restoring drug concentrations can maintain the antileukemic properties of PEG-ASNase. (2) Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of NFATC2 can prevent or attenuate sensitization to PEG-ASNase. (3) IgG and/or IgE-mediated binding of peripheral blood cells (PBCs) to PEG-ASNase can be used as a biomarker of immunotoxicity. We propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses: 1) to determine whether combining pretreatment drugs that block the mediators of hypersensitivity and PEG-ASNase dose adjustments can overcome immune responses and retain antileukemic efficacy using two murine models of PEG-ASNase hypersensitivity and B cell ALL; 2) to determine whether inhibition of the NFAT pathway can prevent sensitization to PEG-ASNase and maintain antileukemic efficacy; and 3) to determine if sensitized PBCs can be identified through their binding to fluorescently labeled PEG-ASNase ex vivo using flow cytometry. The proposed work will identify strategies to overcome, prevent, and monitor the immune response to PEG- ASNase. The three aims are not interdependent but are logically related with a singular focus on improving PEG- ASNase therapy. The long-term goal of this project is to improve pediatric ALL survival by overcoming or preventing the drug-induced immune response and ensuring that patients receive adequate PEG-ASNase exposure during ALL treatment."
"9281759","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    PROBLEM: The protein interaction module called the Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM), which is found in many proteins including those involved in gene regulation, possesses the unusual ability to self-associate into an open-ended helical polymer architecture. Over a decade has passed since solving the first such SAM polymer structure suggested the intriguing possibility that these polymers could control chromatin architecture. In part due to technical barriers, key mechanistic questions regarding the function of SAM polymers have remained unanswered: 1) how are SAM polymers regulated? 2) how do SAM polymers control chromatin structure and influence gene expression? OBJECTIVE: This proposal focuses on a SAM-containing, chromatin-associated protein called Polyhomeotic (Ph). Ph is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG) of epigenetic regulatory proteins which play a critical role in development and have been implicated in cancer progression. Our aims are: 1) dissect the mechanism and regulation of Ph SAM polymerization activity; 2) determine the composition and stoichiometry of Ph oligomers in cells; 3) determine how Ph SAM polymerization affects chromatin binding and organization. By utilizing new technologies, our goal is to finally understand how the Ph SAM polymer controls chromatin architecture and gene expression. METHODS: We will utilize a broad spectrum of approaches to understand Ph SAM polymers. First, we will use structure guided mutations and biophysical methods (including analytical ultracentrifugation) to determine the molecular basis by which Ph SAM polymerization is regulated by other sequences in the Ph protein. This analysis will be extended using super-resolution microscopy, in vitro reconstitution, and mass spectrometry to dissect how Ph SAM polymerization can occur in the multi-protein PcG complexes in which Ph exists in cells. How these SAM-dependent polymers affect chromatin structure will then be determined using a combination of in vitro reconstitution and high resolution analysis of chromatin in cells (using chromosome conformation capture and next generation sequencing, restriction enzyme accessibility assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation). Finally, Ph mutants with disrupted or enhanced SAM polymerization activity will be tested for their effect on gene expression and cell growth in developing Drosophila and cell culture. SIGNIFICANCE: SAMs are found in many proteins spanning from chromatin regulators to membrane proteins. The conserved architecture of the SAM and possibly of the mechanisms that regulate it mean that our dissection of Ph SAM has general implications for SAM-containing proteins, and for possible therapeutic approaches based on modulating protein polymerization. Much of the work on PcG proteins and other chromatin regulators has focused on histone modifications. Our work on Ph SAM polymerization activity is revealing new mechanisms for regulating gene expression by controlling protein and chromatin architecture."
"9350744","Project 2 ? Project Summary Tumors consist of millions of interacting cells, but our understanding of how those cells collectively respond to therapeutic intervention is limited. This is because we have traditionally divided tumors from the ?top-down? into distinct cell types and then studied each population separately, focusing primarily on cancer cells. Yet, recent studies have revealed that a cancer cell's behavior can be strongly affected by the molecules in its microenvironment and its interactions with other cells (intercellular circuits). Unfortunately, our inability to thoroughly measure and analyze each of these influences within the context of a tumor has limited our capacity to fully grasp the mechanisms by which cancer cells evade therapeutic interventions in vivo. To develop a deep and functional understanding of how these extrinsic tumor microenvironmental factors influence the response of individual cancer cells to drugs, we need new approaches that are capable of deeply and controllably profiling tumor cells and their interactions during treatment at single-cell resolution. In particular, we need methods for: (1) identifying individual tumor-resident cells and the molecules they secrete; (2) tracking the phenotypic responses (e.g., changes in size, shape, structure, transcriptome) of cancer cells to controlled perturbations (drugs) in the presence of defined and physiologically relevant factors (signaling molecules); and, (3) examining how cancer cell behaviors are directly impacted by physical interactions with other cells in the tumor microenvironment. This degree of integration and control would enable discovery of the regulators of in vivo cancer cell drug responses at unprecedented resolution. Here, we aim to achieve these goals by combining three different, cutting-edge experimental platforms ? single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), suspended microchannel resonators (SMRs), and nanowells ? to systematically examine how the extracellular factors present in leukemias and colon and pancreatic cancers influence drug responses. First, we will identify the signals and non-malignant cells present in each tumor type by performing scRNA-Seq on primary biopsies from Core 1. With Core 2, we will generate an atlas of implicated cell types/states and putative signaling molecules that may influence cancer cell drug responses in vivo (Aim 1). Second, we will use SMRs and nanowells to systematically uncover how these soluble factors and tumor cells inform on cancer cell drug responses (Aim 2); we will similarly examine the impact of previously implicated environmental factors as well as other cancer cells (of the same and different intrinsic states; from Project 1). By analyzing and modeling our results with Core 2, we will uncover previously unknown microenvironmental synergies (e.g., cytokines, receptor-ligand pairing) that may modulate cancer cell drug responses in vivo. Collectively, these aims will afford an unprecedented view of the tumor microenvironment and shed light on current therapeutic bottlenecks, while suggesting potential new and more effect therapeutic inroads for treating cancer."
"9260421","Microfluidic Tissue Engineering of Small Airway Injuries This project brings together microfluidic, computational, and animal model expertise to evaluate the relative roles of solid- and fluid-mechanical stresses causing, or exacerbating, or predisposing injury of small airway epithelia. This proposal focuses on small airways because they are implicated as the first level of damage in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1, 2). These airways are subject to closure and reopening during the ventilatory cycle, and can be injured from the associated mechanics called atelectrauma. Since these airways are coated with a liquid lining, all closure and reopening involves the formation, propagation, and rupture of liquid plugs. Our previous work (3, 4) showed that fluid/surface tension forces from propagating and, especially, rupturing liquid plugs are a significant cause of lethal injury to airway epithelial cells cultured on microfluidic, lung-on-chip platforms. Animal models have also shown that a higher surface tension due to reduction in concentrations of pulmonary surfactants as the major cause of small airway atelectrauma (5), while plug ruptures with acoustical signatures are particularly associated with airway injury (6). Here, we propose to determine the mechanism of atelectrauma while separating out the contributions of elastic vs fluid/surface tension forces in experiment and computations. We hypothesize that fluid/surface tension mechanical forces in atelectrauma are a major contributor to ARDS. We will also test the role of atelectrauma in the exacerbation of additional insults such as, bacterial infection and acid aspiration, which are direct risk factors for the development of ARDS. Although low tidal volumes have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with ARDS, the benefits of the open lung ventilation concept remain controversial. One of the major reasons for the variable results of open lung ventilation stems from the lack of understanding of the best way to prevent atelectasis. Understanding the mechanism of small airway atelectrauma is essential for developing successful therapeutic interventions in ARDS. While our main goal is to clarify fundamental mechanisms underlying ARDS pathology, our findings have significant clinical implications. We have the potential to clarify whether personalized, appropriate levels of PEEP or recruitment maneuvers may prevent atelectrauma and thereby result in mitigation of lung injury in ARDS. The aims are designed to answer key questions such as: What is the relative contribution of stretch versus fluid mechanical stress in causing lung injury? How will combined insults of fluid mechanical stress together with acid aspiration or bacterial insult exacerbate lung injury?"

"9255254","The wiring diagram of brain circuits is one of the foundational and fundamental questions of modern neuroscience. Extracting a circuit-sized volume at synaptic resolution requires large-scale, high-throughput imaging of many thin sections of brain tissue. The immediate goal of researchers is to capture and map a cubic millimeter of cortex at synaptic resolution, requiring the collection and imaging of 25,000 tissue sections for a single dataset. The slow speed of tissue sectioning and imaging remains a major limitation to the field of connectomics, requiring many years to acquire a dataset of this size. A number of research intuitions (e.g. Harvard University, Janelia Research Campus, Allen Institute) are actively seeking solutions for higher- throughput imaging. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) offers fast, reliable sample sectioning and collection via Automatic Tape-collecting Ultra-Microtome (ATUM-SEM), as well as automated in-vacuum sample cutting via Serial-Block-Face (SBF-SEM) or Focused Ion Beam (FIB-SEM). However, SEM has intrinsically poor resolution and signal level, due to the serial nature of the scanning electron beam pixel collection. In comparison, camera-based transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allows fast, simultaneous collection of millions of pixels at higher resolution than SEM, but is limited by slow handling of individual sample supports. To overcome this throughput limitation, researchers at Harvard University are developing a tape sample substrate for TEM called ?GridTape?, comprising thin-film-covered slots in a tape form that is compatible with commercially available ATUM equipment. Sections are imaged via an in-column reel-to-reel TEM imaging stage. Harvard has chosen Luxel as their partner for the initial investigation and demonstrated ~70X speed improvement in pickup of thin sections of mouse and Drosophila melanogaster brains cut with an ATUM. The proposed project will optimize and scale up GridTape to meet the urgent unmet needs of large scale connectomics research. The technical challenges include reel-to-reel thin film lamination, film breakage, wrinkling, and image background noise. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) Develop a pilot manufacturing process for the production of GridTape prototypes having the number of imaging slots required by researchers (5,000-16,000) in a continuous length, with production throughput of 2,000 slots/day; (2) Optimize GridTape specifications to meet end-user requirements, reducing damaged slot rate to <1%; and (3) Connectomics field evaluation, acquiring datasets on GridTape prototypes have >10,000 slots and a quantitative comparison between GridTape and SEM datasets demonstrating pickup speed and imaging throughput at least equal to existing practice. Phase II will address manufacturing scale-up with greater slot counts and lower cost per slot."
"9274986","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent research reveals that aging acts not only in eukaryotes, but also in bacteria. This revelation challenges decades of evolutionary theory, which held prokaryotes apart as immortal cell lineages immune to aging effects. More current theory suggests that bacterial aging evolved in order to mitigate the consequences of accumulated damage. Through asymmetric segregation of damage upon division, an aging cell experiences deleterious effects via inherited damage, thereby rejuvenating its relatively damage-free counterpart. This model thus argues that selection for damage control drives the concurrent evolution of asymmetric reproduction and aging, and that aging should evolve as a common life history strategy. Recent observations find aging even in bacteria with morphologically symmetric division, indicating that underlying reproductive asymmetry may indeed occur in essentially all cellular organisms. We hypothesize that asymmetric reproduction in bacteria specifically drives aging via progressive accumulation of damage in aging cells. We will examine aging in the predominant model for asymmetric bacteria, Caulobacter crescentus and various asymmetry mutants. Epifluorescence microscopy will monitor protein aggregation and oxidative damage alongside measures of cell vitality, thereby exploring the proximal mechanism of bacterial aging effects. Varying damage rates using antibiotics and an oxidative stressor will evaluate the ability of specific mutants to segregate and tolerate accumulated damage. We predict that disrupting normal reproductive asymmetry will attenuate the aging process, while at the same time reducing population-wide fitness and increasing susceptibility to damage. Testing the hypothesized link between damage, aging, and asymmetry proves particularly difficult with existing methodology. Aging manifests itself as a decline in vital life history parameters (e.g., cell elongation rate, division rate, and survival) of old cells compared o their rejuvenated counterparts. Aging studies thus require detailed measurements of many cells and their lineages over multiple generations in order to achieve adequate statistical power. We are therefore developing microfluidic devices with integrated nanochannel arrays that permit observation of aging bacterial lineages over extended time periods. The nanochannels constrain growth of the bacteria along a single dimension, and microfluidic channels on each end of the nanochannels direct constant input of fresh media while washing away cells that grow beyond the nanochannels. Such a design permits direct, high-resolution observation of the youngest bacteria (enriched at the nanochannel center) and their immediate descendants over several generations - the key cells for aging studies. Although focused on Caulobacter for our initial studies, this microfluidic device design serves as a general platform to study aging and other epigenetic phenomena in diverse bacteria. The specific aims for the project are to measure aging and its effectors in C. crescentus, explore the connection between asymmetry and aging, and determine the plasticity of bacterial damage control strategies."
"9362733","Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) rearrangements are responsible for approximately 70% of infant acute myeloid, lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia and about 7-10% of adult cases. Leukemias bearing MLL rearrangement display a particularly poor prognosis with a significantly lower rate of survival. To date, no targeted agents have been approved and clinicians currently rely on relatively non-specific cytotoxic agents that are largely ineffective, thus, highlighting an unmet medical need. EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) and EZH1 are the two closely related enzymes that catalyze tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), a transcriptionally repressive post-translational modification. It has been shown that EZH2 and EZH1 compensate for one another and both enzymes are critical for sustaining MLL-rearranged leukemias. Therefore, we hypothesized that pharmacological targeting of both EZH2 and EZH1 would provide a novel, targeted therapeutic approach for treating MLL-rearranged leukemias. We previously discovered UNC1999, the only small-molecule inhibitor with high potency (IC50 < 50 nM) for both EZH2 and EZH1. We have shown that UNC1999 suppressed the proliferation of MLL-rearranged leukemia cells in both cellular and mouse cancer models. However, in vivo efficacy of UNC1999 is modest and its tumor-killing action is slow. To address this major weakness, we have applied the PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimeras) technology to generating bivalent inhibitors of EZH2 and EZH1 by linking UNC1999 to an E3 ubiquitin ligase-binding moiety. We have developed prototype bivalent inhibitors, which inhibited the EZH2/1 enzymatic activity, significantly reduced EZH2 protein levels while UNC1999 did not, were much more effective at inhibiting the proliferation of multiple tumor cell lines than UNC1999, did not exhibit toxicity in non-tumor cells, and were orally bioavailable. Based on these promising preliminary results, we propose to: (1) optimize bivalent inhibitors of EZH2 and EZH1 so that they have potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetic and other drug-like properties consistent with a drug candidate, and (2) evaluate bivalent inhibitors of EZH2 and EZH1 in MLL-rearranged leukemia cellular and mouse models. Our goal is to generate a drug candidate for the treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemias."
"9298703","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies have demonstrated that consuming high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)- or sucrose-sweetened beverages increased lipid/lipoprotein risk factors for CVD in healthy adults compared with iso-caloric amounts of glucose or low-fat milk. The longest of these studies, which utilized a 6-month intervention, also showed increased liver and muscle TG and increased visceral adipose deposition. Neither of these studies found differences in weight gain between subjects consuming HFCS/sucrose beverages compared with control beverages. These results suggest that it is not just excess calories and weight gain that mediate the effects of dietary sugar/fructose on the development of metabolic disease; rather, dietary sugar per se is also a contributor. However, it is not known whether consumption of excessive amounts of sugar can increase risk factors for metabolic disease in the absence of positive energy balance and weight gain, nor whether the adverse effects of sugar consumption are exacerbated by weight gain. This study will test the overall hypotheses that consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages increases risk factors for metabolic disease even when consumed with an energy-balanced diet that prevents weight gain, and that risk factors are increased to a greater extent when HFCS-sweetened beverages are consumed in a setting of positive energy balance that results in weight gain. We will also test the hypothesis, that under blinded, controlled, dietary conditions, consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages will increase energy intake and body weight gain more than consumption of aspartame-sweetened beverages. We will measure risk factors and processes associated with metabolic disease in 3 groups of young, healthy adults who will consume 1) 25% of energy requirement as HFCS-sweetened beverages with an energy-balanced diet; 2) 25% of energy requirement as HFCS- sweetened beverages with an ad libitum diet; or 3) aspartame-sweetened beverages with an ad libitum diet for 8 weeks. All diets, formulated to achieve a comparable macronutrient intake (55% energy as carbohydrate, 35% fat, 15% protein) among all 3 experimental groups, will be provided to the subjects throughout the entire study. We hypothesize that consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages with the energy-balanced diet will result in adverse metabolic effects, despite the absence of weight gain. Consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages with the ad libitum diet will result in increased energy intake and body weight gain compared with aspartame-sweetened beverages, and will also result in adverse metabolic effects that are more marked than with consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages with the energy-balanced diet. These results will demonstrate that consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages increases risk for metabolic disease both directly, via the adverse effects of fructose on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and indirectly, via the effects of HFCS-sweetened beverages to promote excess energy intake and body weight gain. These findings will have the potential to influence dietary guidelines and public health policy."

"9375267","ABSTRACT Unlike adults, young children exhibit increased susceptibility to a variety of bacterial pathogens that express capsular polysaccharides (PS) such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi). Vaccination of children is considered the most promising strategy for prevention of such childhood infections. However, purified bacterial PS vaccines such as the ViPS of S. Typhi do not induce an antibody response in young children. Conjugate vaccines (bacterial PS conjugated to protein carriers) induce B cell responses in young children but require many doses administered months apart for generating optimal levels of protective antibody. This makes adherence to vaccination schedules, particularly in remote areas difficult. In the case of ViPS conjugate vaccines for S. Typhi, recent clinical trials in several typhoid endemic countries have been disappointing. We have utilized the NOD/SCID/common cytokine receptor ? chain knockout (NSG) strain of mice and human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to create hematopoietically humanized mice (HISmice) to allow experimental analysis of human immune responses in vivo to infectious pathogens of relevance to humans. We have found that these mice are reproducibly and stably engrafted with human B lymphocytes in the blood, spleen, peritoneal cavity, mesenteric lymph node and gut associated lymphoid tissue. However, major subpopulations of the B cell compartment in these mice appear phenotypically immature. Moreover, while HISmice created via our current protocol produce robust antibody responses to some bacteria, but like young children they do not respond to ViPS and other purified capsular PS antigens. Others have found that HISmice, unlike conventional mice are susceptible to infection by S. Typhi. These observations lead us to hypothesize that HISmice generated via our current protocol fail to respond to PS antigen such as ViPS due to the fact that their B cell compartments mimic those of young children. We hypothesize that this is due, in part, to lack of efficient cross stimulation of human cytokine receptors on engrafting hematopoietic cells by host-produced murine cytokines. In this application, we propose to test this hypothesis in the case of interleukin-7 (IL7), using S. Typhi as a particularly relevant human pathogen. IL7 plays a central role in the development of B cells and B cell antigen receptor repertoire in mice and has been suggested to sub serve an analogous function in humans. We will exploit the recent development of adeno- associated virus (AAV) gene therapy approaches that allow facile expression of human cytokines in NSG mice. We predict that expression of human IL7 will yield HISmice with more mature and diverse B cell compartments capable of mounting robust immune responses to ViPS resulting in protection from S. Typhi challenge. As such, these studies will provide critical new data useful in the development of vaccination strategies for the prevention of S. Typhi and other childhood diseases caused by encapsulated bacteria."

"9396520","Project Summary Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Limited therapeutic success means that prevention strategies may be the most effective intervention for reducing the burden of lung cancer. In a phase II prevention trial, treatment with the oral prostacyclin analogue iloprost resulted in normalization of endobronchial dysplasia (a precursor to squamous carcinoma) in former smokers. About half of former smokers, but not current smokers, had improved endobronchial dysplasia in response to iloprost, suggesting the potential for targeted prevention in specific subjects. Iloprost requires the transmembrane receptor Frizzled 9 (Fzd9), not the prostacyclin receptor (IP), for its preventive activity in vitro. Fzd9 expression is decreased by cigarette smoke and increased by prostacyclin. Restoring Fzd9 expression in NSCLC cell lines inhibits transformed growth, suggesting that Fzd9 has a role in lung epithelium maintenance. Despite its importance in the lung and for iloprost activity, we do not understand Fzd9 regulation or how it interacts with iloprost. In Aim 1, we will induce Fzd9 expression loss in normal lung in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that loss of Fzd9 expression leads to abnormal growth in lung epithelial cells and is required for prostacyclin reduced tumor burden in vivo. In Aim 2, we will identify pathways that regulate Fzd9 expression and downstream signaling activity. We hypothesize that Fzd9 expression is controlled by transcription factors and miRNA identified in preliminary screening studies. We also hypothesize, based on preliminary data and in silico modeling, that iloprost directly binds Fzd9 to activate critical prevention signaling. In Aim 3, we will test Fzd9 as a predictive biomarker for response to iloprost. We expect that Fzd9 expression in baseline endobronchial biopsies from the iloprost clinical trial will predict response to iloprost treatment. Overall, these studies will define the role of Fzd9 in the mechanism of iloprost prevention and elucidate regulation of Fzd9. Identification of markers predicting a favorable response to prostacyclin will facilitate personalized prevention to maximize treatment benefit and allow for more intelligent trial design. Our proposal promotes the vital but less common approach to translational research, where clinical data is shared with basic scientists in an effort to understand the mechanisms behind clinical observations and improve future clinical studies. Interdisciplinary teams are key to our translational research. We have scientists and physicians with expertise in molecular and cellular studies, medicinal chemistry, animal models of lung cancer, clinical chemoprevention trials, lung pathology, and biostatistics. This project will have a broad impact as a model for prevention and translational research across disciplines."
"9369924","Abstract /Summary Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major global bacterial human pathogen, causing ~1 million deaths annually worldwide, due to pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Two strategies are used to combat such infections. Antibiotics can often cure such infections, and vaccines are used to reduce the circulating populations of the most dangerous serotypes. However, both strategies are failing at an increasing rate. Antibiotic resistant strains are continually arising and spreading globally; vaccination effectiveness is also under challenge, as serotypes not targeted by current vaccine formulations are continually arising and rapidly replace the targeted ones. The cause of these failures is transfer of multiple foreign genes into the bacteria, but the mechanisms creating the new infectious and resistant strain types are unclear. Transfer events are of two types, named as micro- and macro-recombination events. The micro events, involving dozens of hundreds of base pairs, are consistent with the known properties of gene transfer by transformation in pneumococcus. However, the more numerous, and more significant, events involve transfer of multiple blocks of tens of thousands of nucleotides, sometimes all from a single donor strain. These macro-recombination events are difficult to reconcile completely with any known mechanism of gene transfer - whether conjugation, transduction, or transformation. This exploratory project would use microfluidics to create numerous small chambers (droplets) within which attacker-target interactions can be studied and characterized for the first time at both the cellular and molecular levels, by both identifying the participant cells and tracing all gene exchange events at full genome resolution. Medical Relevance. Most pathogenic streptococci share the mechanism of gene transfer by natural genetic transformation. Genetic transformation is an important path for genetic flexibility in pneumococcus, where it is documented as key to vaccine escape and creation and spread of drug-resistance genes. Because Streptococcus pneumoniae is a model organism for the study of DNA uptake, this work on the mechanism that transfers unexpectedly large blocks of genes between strain or species will have broad impact on understanding and targeting many similar peptide regulated gene exchange systems among Gram positive bacteria that are often associated with the ability of these bacteria to cause disease."
"9389605","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Despite the implementation of surveillance programs for early diagnosis of hepatocelllular carcinoma (HCC), most patients are currently diagnosed at intermediate or advanced stage of the disease for which there are no curative interventions. These patients either receive transarterial chemoembolization or the molecular therapy, sorafenib. While these therapies have proven to prolong survival for some patients, many fail to receive any benefit due to treatment toxicities, poor liver function or drug resistance. The long term survival for HCC patients remains poor, with a 5-year survival rates <12%. Novel therapies against HCC are urgently needed as the incidence of HCC is steadily increasing in the United States. In recent years the natural omega-3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been shown to possess promising anticancer properties and its consumption has been implicated in reducing the risk of HCC. The effects of dietary DHA on established solid tumors is nominal. To address this issue, our lab has recently engineered a novel low-density lipoprotein (LDL) based nanoparticle that is reconstituted with unesterified DHA (herein referred to as LDL-DHA). Therapeutically, we have shown that the LDL-DHA nanoparticle is able to selectively kill rodent HCC cells at doses that do not harm primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, in a syngeneic rat model of HCC, locoregional delivery of LDL-DHA nanoparticles (achieved via surgical exposure and catheterization of the hepatic artery) is able to induce extensive necrosis (>80%) of HCC tumors and impede the tumor growth (3 fold) without injury to surrounding normal liver. This therapeutic selectivity is germane to HCC, as the background liver disease in intermediate and advanced HCC is often prone to treatment induced injury. The goal of the present proposal is to evaluate the utility image-guided minimally invasive locoregional LDL-DHA therapy for the management of HCC. To address this goal we will examine the following specific aims: 1) Optimize tumor targeting efficacy for catheter-based locoregional delivery of LDL nanoparticles to HCC under fluoroscopy guidance; 2) Investigate the efficacy of fluoroscopy-guided locoregional LDL-DHA treatment in inducing tumor necrosis in HCC; 3) Evaluate the role of amide proton transfer magnetic resonance imaging as a novel molecular imaging approach to quantitatively assess tumor response to LDL-DHA therapy. At the completion of this project, we expect that the combined work of these Aims will: (i) optimize the minimal invasive image-guided locoregional delivery of LDL-DHA nanoparticles to achieve maximum tumor uptake and tumor eradication; and (ii) to noninvasively quantify tumor response and forecast long term patient outcome following LDL-DHA treatment. The LDL-DHA treatment strategy will be significant because it offers a new method of treating HCC without secondary injury to the surrounding liver. Ultimately it is our endeavor to bring this technology to human patients, where it is anticipated to have an important impact on the current management of unresectable HCC by providing patients with a safe and viable approach to treating this aggressive cancer."
"9294091","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social attention is the process of perceiving visual features, such as motion patterns, that specify other people, their distinct characteristics, and their social group memberships, and it is vital to our ability to observe, understand, and participate in social interactions. The proposed experiments will provide the first comprehensive examination of infants' social attention and categorization by describing conditions under which 3- to 12-month-old infants categorize point-light displays produced from recordings of adults from different social groups. This is a formative time in perceptual and cognitive development, and it is characterized by rapid developmental change in perception and learning of environmental structure, including social information. This research will bring new findings and new theoretical perspectives to longstanding debates about the origins of social knowledge and social learning that stem from typical developmental trajectories of visual attention to social stimuli. The short-term objectives of the proposed research are to discover how developing perceptual and cognitive skills yield discrimination, categorization, identification, and learning f biological motion in infancy. The long- term goals are to clarify theories of social categorization and social development and to contribute to characterization of developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, for which there may be specific deficits in social attention. Such an understanding may lead to assessment tools more closely tailored to early diagnosis and treatment than are presently available."
"9306188","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurologic complications and related diseases, including HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders or HAND, remain one of the most devastating clinical manifestations of HIV-1 infection even after treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Accordingly, it is now well recognized that a novel strategy is needed to eradicate AIDS and its associated co-morbidities as current antiretroviral therapies have failed to eliminate HIV-1 from the infected host. Here, we seek support to continue operation of a highly needed Comprehensive NeuroAIDS Core Center (CNAC) that was established in 2011 at the Temple University School of Medicine in partnership with Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia to provide infrastructure for performing innovative research in the neuroscience of HIV-1/AIDS. The central theme of CNAC, in the second round of funding, will be to foster an environment for performing translational research in neuroAIDS by offering expertise and service in molecular and cellular biology as well as the genetics and virology of HIV-1 infection of the CNS using in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo systems provided by the various cores. It is our goal that CNAC promotes research toward understanding mechanisms responsible for HAND and provide new paths for the eradication of infected cells and viruses and the treatment of AIDS/CNS disease. Accordingly, more emphasis will be on cell- and viral-based methodologies and the assessment of the impact of HIV-1 on cell function pertaining to CNS diseases. To accomplish our goal, the CNAC will provide expertise in neural cell cultures, viral reagents, microelectrode array, gene editing strategies, and high end proteomics/metabolomics through its Basic Science Core I (BSC I). Basic Science Core II (BSC II) will provide expertise and facilities in the employment of animal models for studying HIV-1 brain interaction and behavioral testing/training and histological training and related services. The Clinical and Translational Research Support Core (CTRSC) of the CNAC, with greater than 2,000 patients participating in two well-characterized/controlled cohorts at Temple University Hospital (North Philadelphia) and Drexel's Hahnemann Hospital (Center City Philadelphia) will support development and maintenance of cohesive IRB protocols, offer expertise in cognitive performance and neuropsychology, virology/immunology and immunoactivation, and viral genetics/genomics and bioinformatics. Through the Developmental Core, the CNAC will offer a unique opportunity for training and mentoring of junior investigators and clinical investigators, and attract and develop physicians/scientists in the field of neuroAIDS. The CNAC will provide infrastructure by i) providing start-up funds through its Developmental Core, ii) offering intellectual support and technical services through its state-of-the-art basic science cores and iii) access to an expansive well-operating clinical core, for conducting innovative research toward the development of intelligent, effective, and safe genetic and cellular/immunologic strategies toward a cure of AIDS. Further, the funding through CNAC will create an environment for the development of collaborative research in neuroAIDS at Temple, Drexel and other medical institutions in the greater Philadelphia area, and extend its collaboration with other AIDS research centers in Philadelphia and the nation."
"9280974","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of new approaches to treat rapidly evolving viral infections is an important area of research. This project will pursue general methods for the development of drug therapies that lead to inhibitors that avoid resistance in the context of AIDS, yet broadly applicable to infectious disease and cancer. We will continue to develop and improve the substrate envelope hypothesis, will develop and apply inverse computational design methods for small-molecule ligands, will study failures of the substrate envelope hypothesis to improve the approach, and will develop alternative approaches related to the substrate envelope hypothesis in the context of HIV-1 protease through a collaborative effort with experimental groups expert in organic and medicinal chemistry, enzyme assays, protein crystallography, and virology. Because essentially all therapies developed for infectious disease and cancer are limited by the selection of resistant variants, strategies for avoiding or a least delaying resistance that are generally applicable would have tremendous impact on drug development. This project will understand and improve the substrate envelope and related approaches in the well studied HIV-1 protease, but the methods developed will be broadly applicable to target-based infectious disease and cancer drug resistance. The substrate envelope hypothesis maintains that inhibitors that reside within the volume shared by substrates are less susceptible to resistance mutations, because such mutants must still process substrates. Preliminary work has demonstrated some success and shown some limitations of the substrate envelope hypothesis, and the proposed project will further test and develop the substrate envelope hypothesis in the context of HIV-1 protease. Extensions of the substrate envelope hypothesis include other modes of being substrate-like besides the geometric criteria of occupying the common substrate volume. Our previous work includes successes and failures of the substrate envelope hypothesis. The failures are molecules we designed that when synthesized bind wholly within the substrate envelope but fail to bind robustly across a panel of drug-resistant variants. By studying these molecules and substrates bound to wild type and drug-resistant variants, we will seek a mechanistic understanding of failures of the substrate envelope hypothesis, which will use to develop improved versions of the substrate envelope hypothesis. Finally, advances in deep sequencing technology make it possible to consider mapping the functional mutational space of candidate targets, and using the functional mutational space as a guide to the development of inhibitors that are not susceptible to resistance mutations. This project will develop and study methodology for using the functional mutational space as a basis for the design of inhibitors that avoid resistance. We will compare the success of this approach to the substrate envelope approach, noting that the new approach is applicable to targets whether they are enzymes or not, whereas the current state of the substrate envelope hypothesis is applicable to enzymes only."
"9436576","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will analyze three key, interrelated social determinants of HIV/AIDS and STIs-mass incarceration, housing stability, and subsidized housing policies -and the mechanisms through which they intersect to shape HIV-related sexual risk behaviors and race disparities in these behaviors. To date, research on the association between mass incarceration and HIV/AIDs and STIs has focused on incarceration's effects on relationship stability. Less attention has been paid to its effects on housing stabilityas a linking mechanism. Yet, extensive research has established housing stability as a social determinant of HIV/AIDS, though it rarely includes attention to mass incarceration. Nor has attention been paid to how policies that limit access to subsidized housing based on drug use and criminal history may impact on housing stability. At a time when subsidized housing increasingly represents the only available affordable housing option for the poor, such policies likely affect housing stability, not only among those directly involved with the criminal justice (CJ) system but among their loved ones as well. Thus, there is strong rationale to investigate the intersecting impacts of mass incarceration, housing stability, and subsidized housing policies on HIV/AIDS. Toward this end, this project has three specific aims: (1) To analyze variation across the US in the degree of restrictiveness of subsidized housing policies as it relates to rates of HIV/AIDS and STIs, and race disparities in these rates. This will be done through systematic coding of policies according to their degree of restrictiveness, and analysis of how policy variation is associated with disease rates; (2) To understand from the perspective of vulnerable populations how mass incarceration-including history of CJ involvement (personal, family, and sexual partner) and exposure to 'hyperpolicing-housing stability, and experiences with subsidized housing policies intersect to impact HIV/AIDS/STI related sexual risks, and produce race disparities in these risks. This will be done through analysis of longitudinal qualitative and quantitative data collected from individuals recently involved in the CJ system and/or living in or seeking subsidized housing; and (3) To examine from the perspective of various stakeholders, including policymakers, program implementers, landlords, CJ personnel, and housing and legal service providers, how subsidized housing policies are interpreted and implemented locally and why they are interpreted and implemented in this way. This will be done through analysis of semi-structured interviews with these stakeholders."
"9353225","The Transition from Childhood into Adulthood among PSID Children, 2017 and 2019  In this project, we will continue and expand the collection and distribution of data on young adults in families participating in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). PSID is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative sample of U.S. families that began in 1968. It has collected data on the same families and their descendants for 39 waves over 47 years (as of 2015). In the 1990s, PSID began collecting rich and detailed data on children born into these families and, starting in the mid-2000s, has closely followed these children's transition into adulthood through the PSID Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS). Young adults in PSID families become members of the Core PSID themselves and receive the full interview when they form their own economically-independent households?and are followed by the study for the rest of their lives. In Research Project 1, we will collect two waves of the PSID Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS) in 2017 and 2019. We will undertake a major expansion of the TAS study sample and will substantially revise the TAS questionnaire, adding new and revised content on topics such as childhood health, fertility-related behavior and pregnancy intentions, and computer skills. Interviews will be undertaken with approximately 3,273 young adults in 2017 and 3,378 in 2019. A major portion of the sample will comprise of young adults who previously participated the original Child Development Supplement (CDS), which began collecting detailed and extensive data on children in PSID families in 1997 on a cohort of approximately 3,600 children aged 0?12 years, or in the new PSID Child Development Supplement (CDS-2014), which is collecting information on all children in PSID families who were born after the launch of the original CDS in 1997. Many of the respondents from the original CDS cohort will have participated in one or more prior waves of TAS, and this study will allow us to continue tracing their transition into adulthood. The specific aims of this Research Project are to collect approximately 70 minutes of information in 2017 and 2019 from all PSID youth aged 18?28 years and to document and distribute these data through the publicly available and free PSID Online Data Center and promote the use of the combined CDS-TAS data archive. These data are vital for our understanding of the contemporary transition from adolescence into adulthood in the U.S. within its intergenerational family context. By augmenting the panel information in the CDS and Core PSID, this project will provide a rich CDS-TAS-PSID panel of children from birth and preschool through primary and secondary school and then through entry into the world of work or of higher education in conjunction with early family formation. Although a full and detailed panel from birth to young adulthood is valuable in its own right, the information on these children will grow further as they continue in the Core PSID through their full life course."
"9303423","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technological development of nanomaterials has been underway for decades. Only in the past decade has serious attention been paid to their potential unwanted health and environmental effects. Many nanomaterials do not readily dissolve or disintegrate in biological and environmental milieu. As a result, they can persist where they are sequestered (in mammals, mostly in mononuclear phagocyte system organs such as the liver, spleen and bone marrow) for months, possibly years, often associated with inflammatory/oxidative stress responses, including granuloma. These unwanted effects have been seen with nanoceria (nanoscale cerium dioxide). On the other hand, nanoceria has been shown to be an effective anti-inflammatory/antioxidant in numerous cellular, cell, and whole animal models of inflammation/oxidative stress. Nanoceria's pro- and antioxidant effects result from its auto-catalytic redox behavior (oxidation from Ce (III) to Ce (IV) and reduction back to Ce (III)). The first specific aim of this project will determine if nanoceria can produce inflammatory/pro- oxidant effects in the absence of elevated inflammation/oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects when inflammation/oxidative stress is elevated, and determine the lowest observed adverse dose and lowest observed beneficial dose. Four nanoceria will be studied: a 5 and a 30 nm nanoceria extensively studied for their distribution, persistence and effects in the rat (preliminary findings) and a third that others have demonstrated produces beneficial inflammatory/pro-oxidant effects. These three will be synthesized and extensively characterized in-house. The fourth will be NM-212, a commercial nanoceria that is being extensively studied by the inhalation route by others. Due to the very low oral and pulmonary absorption of nanomaterials, nanoceria will be delivered by intravenous injection to establish sufficient levels in multiple organs to study its biodistribution, persistene, biotransformation, and effects. Preliminary findings indicate that nanoceria undergoes some bioprocessing in mammalian cells over months to a more stable form. This appears to occur via dissolution and formation of very small nanoceria particles. These very small nanoceria particles have a greater enrichment of Ce (III) on their surface; therefore they are expected to have enhanced anti-inflammatory/antioxidant properties. This biotransformation suggests enhanced benefit over time associated with nanoceria's persistence and bioprocessing. The second specific aim will test the hypothesis that the distribution, form, and effects of nanoceria change over time due to its bioprocessing in the liver to smaller, more antioxidant forms. The third specific aim will identify factors that contribute to nanoceria dissolution and precipitation and mediate its bioprocessing and precipitation in the liver. The proposed studies will identify nanoceria doses that maximize its efficacy relative to its unwanted effects, elucidate nanoceria's long term fate in a model mammal, the rat, and provide the insight into its biotransformation that may enable safer by design nanoceria for use as a therapeutic agent with prolonged anti-inflammatory/antioxidant activity."
"9294153","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The past few decades heralded an era of high carbohydrate (CHO) diets, some of which are now known to worsen lipid profiles and increase risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both diet composition and meal frequency affect lipid synthesis and kinetics, but the specific mechanisms remain unsettled. We will test the hypothesis that the conversion of CHO to fat (de novo lipogenesis [DNL]) is a major determinant of postprandial triglyceride (TG) and lipoprotein fluxes leading to higher levels of serum TG and dyslipidemia. We propose to perform controlled metabolic studies that use diet composition and meal frequency to modulate postprandial DNL and assess its impact on TG and apolipoprotein (apo) B fluxes, lipid profiles and lipoprotein particle distribution. We will do so by measuring th individual contributions of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL; from the liver) and chylomicrons (chylos, from the intestine) to overall postprandial lipoprotein-TG production and clearance in overweight and obese volunteers, a population that is at risk for CVD. We will compare the effects of 7 days feeding with two isocaloric diets (randomly assigned) that are either high in sucrose or high in fat on postprandial DNL, VLDL-TG and chylo-TG, and apolipoprotein B100 and B48 fluxes using stable isotope tracers and sophisticated mathematical modeling. Using a randomized crossover design in participants assigned to each diet, we will also compare the magnitude of differences between successive 7-day periods of consuming small frequent meals (nibbling) and ingesting 2 daily meals, with each participant serving as his/her own control. Participants will be housed in a metabolic ward and fed constant weight-maintaining diets to assure dietary adherence and control activity. Liver lipid storage will be measured by magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, visceral fat by MR imaging, and lean and fat mass by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. To further link the dynamic fluxes to atherogenic risk, the composition of VLDL and chylo remnants, lipoprotein particle sizes, small dense low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein will be measured using proprietary HPLC methods and gel electrophoresis. We anticipate that these novel studies will allow us to identify, for the firs time, the mechanisms by which meal composition and frequency affect postprandial apoB and TG fluxes and associated lipid profiles. These findings could inform efforts to develop evidence-based interventions and dietary guidance to mitigate CVD risk."
"9130893","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical and experimental literature have rapidly converged to demonstrate that sleep and circadian dysfunction play an integral role in the onset and maintenance of a broad spectrum of chronic diseases. Sleep dysfunction is especially common among patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, which is the leading contributor of disease burden in the United States, more than twice as much as cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological data demonstrates that sleep disruption precedes and often predisposes people to anxiety, depression, and PTSD, suggesting that these complex traits are highly intertwined. Addressing the complexity of sleep and stress phenotypes requires novel approaches that leverage and integrate multiple forms of data. My proposal focuses on identifying causal molecular networks common to sleep and stress traits in order to investigate novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. With an exhaustive phenotypic assay (479 sleep and stress traits) and an integrated multi-scale computational approach, we will leverage the complexity of these traits to probe how molecular pathways naturally interact as a coordinated unit, rather than how they react when they are artificially manipulated. By integrating genetic, gene expression, and co-expression data from F2 mouse populations (>100 mice), we can use Bayesian reconstruction to identify molecular subnetworks that act as causal regulators of stress and sleep phenotypes. Because of the complexity of sleep and stress traits, it is imperative that we understand individual genes in the context of polygenic networks and treat phenotypes as emergent properties of these networks. By understanding how these molecular networks act as sensors and drivers of phenotypes, we can then appropriately consider targets for pharmacological interventions and utilize novel computational strategies for repurposing drugs. We anticipate that this work will provide the foundation for future in vivo studies related to depression, anxiety, stress susceptibility (PTSD),  and sleep."

"9276129","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synaptic connectivity constitutes an integral part of neuronal identity. The recent reconstruction of the connectome of the C.elegans male and its comparison to the long known connectome of the hermaphrodite (a derived female) reveal a sexually dimorphic dimension of neuronal identity: Some defined neuron types that are present in both hermaphrodites and males show sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity patterns. We propose to dissect the regulatory programs that specify sexual dimorphic identity, as manifested by dimorphic synaptic connectivity features. Specifically, we propose here to (1) reliably and easily visualize sexually dimorphic synaptic connectivity patterns in transgenic animals using GFP-based reporter systems; (2) study aspects of the establishment, maintenance and autonomy of these dimorphic synapses and (3) identify molecules through a candidate gene approach and unbiased profiling approach that genetically program these dimorphic patterns of connectivity and identity. We expect that our studies will provide novel insights into the currentl little explored sexual dimension of neuronal identity."
"9384928","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The threat of nuclear accidents or attacks makes it critical to develop medical countermeasures. Preclinical studies have shown a relation between vascular dysfunction and chronic organ radiation damage, but little is known about the underlying protective mechanisms. Hence, to identify targets for mitigation, research is needed to elucidate pathways involved in radiation-induced vascular dysfunction and vascular protection. Radiation-induced endothelial dysfunction is associated with detrimental alterations in the protein C pathway. Loss of endothelial surface thrombomodulin (Thbd) leads to reduced levels of activated protein C (APC), a critical component in plasma that has anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory properties and that enhances endothelial cell survival. We have previously shown that recombinant APC is an effective mitigator of acute radiation injury when administered 24 h after total-body irradiation in a mouse model. We will further explore the paradigm that the protein C pathway plays a central role in radiation-induced vascular dysfunction and that APC is an effective mitigator of both acute and late radiation toxicity in multiple organs. In vitro studies with wild-type and recombinant APC using irradiated human endothelial cells in culture will determine which structural features of APC and which endothelial APC receptors are critical for enhancing post-radiation endothelial function. In vivo studies with wild-type mice, Thbd-deficient mice, and mice with enhanced vascular responses to radiation in the small intestine, heart and brain?three organ systems critical in the endogenous levels of APC will determine the role of the Thbd?protein C pathway in both the acute and the late delayed response to radiation. Gene expression profiling focused on endothelial cells extracted from mice will identify radiation-induced changes in the translatome and the effects of APC on those gene expression profiles. Plasma samples from the same mice will be used to identify metabolite profiles indicative of radiation injury and reflective of how APC alters host responses. Such metabolic data may lead to novel biomarkers, as well as enlightening us about how radiation and radiomitigation affect various metabolic pathways. In summary, these studies will provide novel insights into mechanisms by which the Thbd?protein C pathway components, i.e., APC and its endothelial receptors, achieve endothelial radiomitigation. Studies of endothelial gene expression profiles will provide insights into which endothelial regulatory systems are significantly altered by radiation and rescued by APC. Basic knowledge from this project will provide key data required for thoughtful development of countermeasures addressing radiation-induced endovascular injury."
"9285852","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Both clinical and experimental studies have suggested that inflammation is a key player in the progression of traumatic brain injury (TBI)-associated pathologies and neural repair. Uncontrolled inflammation can lead to exacerbated tissue damage and can hinder the repair process. While the role of local inflammation originating in the injured brain has been examined in some detail, the contribution of systemic inflammation to TBI outcome is less established. It has been demonstrated that systemic inflammation is mediated, in large part, by the spleen, which is regulated by the efferent component of the vagus nerve. Previous studies have shown that stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce BBB permeability, cerebral edema and improve learning after TBI, suggesting a role for systemic inflammation in TBI outcome. However, the mechanism(s) by which vagus nerve activity exerts these effects is not understood. Recent studies have shown that this effect requires splenic nicotinic alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR). We propose to test the hypothesis that loss of alpha 7 nicotinic cholinergic signaling worsens, while augmentation of alpha7nAChR signaling improves, inflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and cognitive outcome. Three Specific Aims are outlined to test our hypothesis. Aim1: To examine if alpha7nAChRs regulate TBI-associated inflammation. Aim 2: To test if alpha7nAChR signaling regulates BBB permeability and cerebral edema following TBI. Aim 3: To determine if post-TBI administration of alpha7nAChR agonists improves learning and memory and offers neuroprotection. The results from these studies will not only test a novel mechanism underlying TBI pathology, but will test the therapeutic potential of mechanism-based agents as a treatment for TBI."
"9293319","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of protein-protein interactions and defining the protein composition of distinct subcellular structures are frequently essential to uncovering the mechanisms underlying human health and disease. Yet these activities often present considerable methodological barriers. Current approaches to investigate candidate protein-interactions include yeast-2-hybrid analysis and complex purification schemes that, despite being powerful tools in this endeavor, inherently possess considerable limitations in their application. For example, the yeast-two-hybrid method to assess protein interactions introduces a highly artificial test environment. Complex purification is limited to interactions that are strog enough to survive solubilization or may require chemical crosslinkers. Characterizing the protein constituency of specific subcellular compartments requires isolation to considerable purity, frequently a difficult or insurmountable task. We have developed an approach called BioID that uses a biotin ligase tethered to bait proteins to label neighboring proteins in live cells, facilitting their isolation and identification. When applied to lamin-A, a nuclear envelope constituent with limited solubility, over 50% of the proteins identified by BioID are known to interact with or predominantly reside in close proximity to lamin-A. The remaining candidates likely represent proteins whose distribution is only partially NE-associated and/or are poorly characterized. These results provide a compelling proof-of-principle for the potential of BioID to screen for relevant protein interactions. This project is designed to define the capabilities and limitations f BioID in the following ways: 1) Determining the broad potential of this method to identify candidate protein interactions and testing its application to monitor temporospatial differences in protein behavior. 2) Applying BioID to map the protein constituency of distinct subcellular domains that have proved refractory to traditional approaches. 3) Defining the efficacy of BioID in diverse subcellular domains. By expanding our understanding of BioID with the results of these studies, we will provide the research community with fundamental knowledge of the capabilities and limitations of this method. This will enhance the efficiency of application of BioD to a broad array of projects relevant to human health and disease."
"9378819","Viral skin infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with millions of individuals infected worldwide with the poxvirus molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). The related poxvirus Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used to immunize hundreds of millions of people during the smallpox eradication program, and remains a backbone of the many widely used viral vaccine vectors. The goal of the immune system is to restrict virus spread until an adaptive immune response can be mounted that will clear the virus. Interferons (IFN) are a family of protein cytokines that upregulate IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) to restrict virus replication and spread and also activate the immune response via recruitment and activation of innate and effector immune cell populations. The IFN family consists of Type I, II and III, each using separate receptors. All IFN receptors signal through the Janus kinase (JAK)/ Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathway. STAT1 signals via interactions with a number of other STAT proteins to transduce signals after receptor binding of IFNs. After IFN receptor signaling, STAT1 is phosphorylated and subsequent nuclear translocation leads to activation of a large number of ISGs. Deletion of STAT1 can dramatically reduce the immune response to IFN in vitro and in vivo, and mice lacking STAT1 often succumb to systemic challenge with virus, including VACV. Because of the tight linkage of IFN signaling and STAT1, the lethal phenotype of STAT1-deficient mice upon virus challenge is most often assumed to be due to lack of the action of IFN. Our preliminary data demonstrate that peripheral dermal infection with VACV, which is normally restricted to the site of infection, causes death of mice lacking STAT1. Importantly, our preliminary data also indicate that ablation or depletion of all three IFNs did not confer lethal susceptibility to dermal VACV, indicating that the lethal phenotype of STAT1-deficient mice is likely a product of IFN-independent STAT1 signaling. A role for STAT1 has been implicated in other signaling pathways, such as those mediated by CD117 (c-kit), IL-27R, IL-21R and a number of Toll-Like Receptors (TLR). Our system, where we have a non-lethal infection in IFN-deficient animals, but a lethal phenotype in STAT1-deficient mice, offers us a unique opportunity to probe the IFN-independent role of STAT1 in protective antiviral immunity. We will examine the IFN-independent role of STAT1 in 2 Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will compare the host range of VACV, along with the innate and adaptive anti-VACV immune responses, in mice lacking STAT1 or all three IFN receptors. Using this strategy we can identify IFN- independent STAT1-mediated events that may be responsible for protection against lethal VACV challenge. In Aim 2, we will examine STAT1 phosphorylation in mice lacking all three IFN receptors, as well as target genes where expression in induced in a STAT1-dependent, IFN-independent manner. At the conclusion of the proposed investigation we will have identified cells, immune processes and target genes that can provide the basis for a future RO1 proposal investigating IFN-independent STAT1-mediated antiviral immunity."
"9259158","Child maltreatment is a critical public health concern. Individuals maltreated in childhood are at risk for a number of serious psychiatric and medical problems over the lifespan. The idea that maltreatment heightens risk for disease via immune dysfunction has been fueled by the results of numerous studies showing that, among adults exposed to maltreatment in childhood, biomarkers of systemic inflammation are elevated. Yet the extent to which systemic inflammation is present during childhood or adolescence is unclear. Findings are mixed, with some studies showing support for the relation between maltreatment and inflammation in youth, and others showing null results. There is some empirical evidence, however, that when social support is considered, the variance in systemic inflammation among youth is better explained. Among adolescents recently exposed to a negative life event, those with little social support had significantly more systemic inflammation compared to the adolescents with adequate social support. These findings provide evidence of social support as a protective factor for youth exposed to normative life events. How social support operates for youth with non-normative, chronic, and potentially life threatening trauma is unknown. This is a significant omission in the field given that youth with severe and/or chronic maltreatment are at greatest risk for health problems. Further, these youth may be removed from their homes, placed in multiple foster placements, and reunited with biological caregivers several times over the course of their childhoods, resulting in fluctuating social support conditions. Capturing the pattern of shifting social support is essential to understanding how psychosocial factors relate to systemic inflammation in foster youth, a transient population whose lifetime exposure to maltreatment greatly exceeds what is typical, putting them at risk for poor health now and later in life. The proposed study will utilize a longitudinal structural equation modeling framework to test the interaction of maltreatment and social support over time on inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein) in foster youth (aim 2). Participants will be drawn from a larger, longitudinal R01, entitled ?Studying Pathways to Adjustment and Resilience in Kids? (SPARK) and will include 220 youth ages 10 to 18 years. Participant recruitment and data collection will be conducted in coordination with the sponsor's new R01, which will also utilize previous SPARK families. The current study will improve on past methodological weaknesses by including empirically-derived measurement models and examining correlates of the constructs of interests for inclusion as covariates (aim 1). Findings will address a major gap in the literature and contribute a crucial missing piece to the question of how maltreatment confers risk for expensive and devastating mental and physical health problems over the life course."
"9387685","Project Summary  Skeletal muscle repair is a critical process for the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulatory T cells are requisite to this process. Regeneration occurs in response to acute traumatic injury, exercise induced damage, chronic degenerative diseases and infection. Myopathies, including muscular dystrophy, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and aged skeletal muscle show Tregs deficiencies in either numbers or function in patients, supporting the role of Tregs in regeneration. Surprisingly, little is known about the skeletal muscle immune response and regulation to Toxoplasma gondii infection, even though this is a primary site of encystment. We showed infection with T. gondii elaborates extensive muscle damage and prolonged disruption of macrophage homeostasis Infection of the skeletal muscle with T. gondii i) causes skeletal muscle damage and myositis, ii) disrupts resident skeletal muscle macrophage populations that are necessary for tissue repair, iii) ablation of Tregs rescues skeletal muscle regeneration and the pro-regenerative M2 population and iv) infection impairs Treg de novo generation and suppressive function. These data are the basis of our proposal. The overarching hypothesis for this proposal is that the chronic inflammatory environment induces a pathogenic program in skeletal muscle Tregs that promotes immunopathology. Using this model, we will dissect the factors and cell targets of Tregs that impair the regenerative process from proceeding. The goal of the current proposal is to define the mechanisms by which Tregs modulate the immune response to T. gondii in the skeletal muscle. We aim to (1) define the mechanisms that lead to the impairment of Treg function in infected skeletal muscle and (2) determine if Tregs directly promote the polarization, migration or survival of M1 macrophages in infected skeletal muscle during T. gondii infection."
"9308651","Abstract The purpose of this study is to determine whether quantitative, multiparametric breast MRI performed prior to biopsy can biologically characterize a common pre-invasive malignancy, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which typically presents in asymptomatic women as suspicious calcifications on mammography. Unfortunately, the appearance of these calcifications cannot distinguish DCIS from benign breast pathology, and current pathologic tests cannot reliably distinguish clinically important forms of DCIS from those that behave indolently. This leads to unnecessary biopsies and therapies, including surgeries and radiation treatment. Recent advanced pathologic and multigene assays of DCIS and its microenvironment hold promise for improved risk assessments but have limited validation to date and are prone to sampling error due to lesion heterogeneity. Our prior studies support the use of quantitative MRI measurements of vascular permeability (Ktrans, signal enhancement ratio [SER]), cellular density (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] and tissue diffusion [Dt]), and microperfusion (perfusion fraction [?]) to characterize DCIS biology. We hypothesize that the use of these quantitative MRI features will provide an accurate, non-invasive biological risk assessment of DCIS lesions. To test this hypothesis, we will assess whether quantitative MRI markers of vascular permeability and cellularity can accurately exclude the presence of DCIS-associated malignancy and whether more advanced MRI markers of biology can further distinguish between aggressive from less aggressive forms of DCIS in a prospective observational clinical trial of 150 women presenting with suspicious mammographic calcifications at the University of Washington. All participants will undergo a pre-biopsy, 3 tesla high spatiotemporal resolution dynamic contrast enhanced and multi-b value reduced field of view diffusion weighted breast MRI. Quantitative MRI features, including SER, Ktrans, ADC, Dt, and ?, will be measured for each lesion and the surrounding (peri-tumoral) stroma. We will assess whether these MRI signatures can determine which calcifications identified as suspicious on mammography actually harbor DCIS, and whether these imaging features correlate with pathologic markers of proliferation (Ki-67) and inflammation (cox-2) within DCIS lesions. We will also explore whether these quantitative MRI features in the peri-tumoral region correlate with prognostic microenvironment markers of inflammation (TNF?) and angiogenesis (VEGF). Finally, we will assess whether a multivariate model using these markers can accurately predict risk of recurrence based on a multi-gene assay (Oncotype DX DCIS score). If successful, this study could lead to larger clinical trials that use MRI features to 1) decrease unnecessary biopsies of calcifications that in fact represent benign pathology and 2) provide accurate assessments of DCIS risk of progression to invasive disease and recurrence after treatment that could help facilitate individualized and targeted therapies. This will address an important public health goal: decreasing overdiagnosis and overtreatment of early breast cancer."
"9326794","Project summary Prostate cancer is a leading cause of male mortality worldwide, for which radical prostatectomy (removal of the entire prostate) is the standard-of-care. After surgery, the excised prostate is submitted for histopathology, a process that is time-consuming and expensive due to the large volume of the whole RP specimen. A large number of these prostate slices do not contain any abnormal tissue, for which the laborious downstream histopathology processes of chemical fixation, tissue embedding, sectioning, staining, slide mounting, and microscopic evaluation are unnecessary and wasteful. As a result, nearly 90% of all US prostate pathologists utilize partial-sampling strategies (in contrast to a total-sampling of all slices) to reduce the histopathology workload. Currently these methods are ?blind?, and consist of simply attempting to identify prostate slices with grossly identifiable tumor (for which less than a third are visible), or simply analyzing every other prostate slice. While these methods reduce time and labor costs, they yield less accurate pathological results than a total- sampling of the entire prostate, and have been shown to lead to inferior patient outcomes. Therefore, there is great interest and value in an ?intelligent? method of triaging the number of normal prostate slices sent for a full pathological work up while maintaining the same pathological quality provided by a total-sampling.  Our proposed solution is to enable intelligent pathology by rapidly imaging the surfaces of each prostate slice using a novel light-sheet microscopy (LSM) approach, which will accurately triage normal prostate slices with no tumor tissue from the full pathological makeup (primary goal) and also enable a preliminary estimate of tumor size, location, grade, and margin status (secondary goals). Previous microscopy systems with a narrow depth of focus have had limited clinical adoption due to the need for elaborate tissue- flattening and alignment procedures when imaging the irregular surfaces of freshly excised tissues. In contrast, the proposed LSM system will have a wide depth of focus that will enable high-resolution imaging of this irregular surface over a large field of view without the need for time-consuming flattening and alignment.  The system performance will initially be characterized and validated with tissue phantoms, including comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we will image freshly excised prostate slices, which will be compared with conventional H&E histopathology in a pilot study to obtain a preliminary assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of the LSM system. Our project team has a diverse set of expertise that includes the development of novel microscopes and contrast agents for the assessment of diseased tissues, as well as prostate pathology and research. This team will ensure the successful development of a wide-area LSM system for rapid imaging and pathology of freshly excised prostate tissues. Finally, with the help of a comprehensive mentoring committee, the candidate will be trained in all aspects of this work to succeed in a biomedical optics and cancer imaging research career."
"9317730","Abstract In the United States, 20% of children live in food insecure or marginally secure conditions, defined by limited or uncertain access to food (1, 2). Even at the lowest levels of severity, food insecurity is paradoxically associated with increased body mass index (BMI) (3) and populations that experience food insecurity are at greater risk for substance abuse issues (4-8). Further progress in delineating the role of food insecurity on substance use and obesity in humans is handicapped by co-occurrence of other aspects of adversity such as neglect, abuse and maternal mental illness. Here we propose to further develop our mouse model of food insecurity in which meals are delivered to mice in an irregular pattern for a brief developmental window. We compare these mice to stably food restricted and ad libitum fed controls. Because dopamine neurons fire phasically in response to unpredicted events (reward prediction error), we hypothesize that uncertainty may be an important variable independent from scarcity. We posit that cumulative experience of unpredictable food delivery will alter maturation of dopamine neurons and downstream circuits, altering reward and decision- making behavior. Our initial experiments show that adult male mice that experienced food insecurity P21-40 are less flexible in a reversal task compared to mice that experienced a history of regular food restriction or ad libitum fed controls. Females show no effect of treatment on flexibility in reversal but a treatment related increase in adult ad lib weight. Here we propose to test if there is a sensitive period for exposure to food insecurity by moving exposure to different ages (Aim 1) and to evaluate the impact of treatment at different ages on adult reward integration (Aim 1). We will also use pre-pubertal ovariectomy to test the role of pubertal hormones in the observed sex difference (Aim 1). We will next (Aim 2) determine if food insecurity enhances vulnerability in the context of substance use by measuring ethanol consumption in an intermittent access two bottle choice paradigm (which can elicit binge drinking) and aversion resistant ethanol consumption in which the only available ethanol is adulterated with quinine (a model of compulsive drinking). Here we will also test both sexes to investigate sex differences. We will also investigate if inflexibility in a cognitive test of reversal will predict later insensitivity to quinine adulteration of ethanol. Our major goals for the end of the grant period are: 1) To have established when it matters most to the developing brain to experience food insecurity, a question highly relevant to policy and public health. 2) To have tested the hypothesis that early food insecurity predisposes individuals to show greater binge or compulsive substance use in the context of ethanol, a causal link that is impossible to isolate without large confounds in humans. A future R01 will investigate neurobiological changes in the dopaminergic system and its cortical-striatal targets that may mediate observed changes in behavior."

"9211437","PROJECT 1: IMMUNE MECHANISMS LINKING OBESITY TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYPERTENSION DURING PREGNANCY. RESEARCH SUMMARY  Preeclampsia (PE), characterized by new-onset hypertension during pregnancy, is estimated to affect 1 in 20 of all pregnancies in the U.S. It is a leading cause of maternal death and a major contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity. Unfortunately, the only effective treatment is premature delivery to remove the ischemic placenta. Strikingly, the incidence of PE has increased by 40% over the last several decades as a result of a significant increase in risk factors such as obesity. The % of reproductive-age women who are overweight or obese has increased almost 60% in the last 30 years. Despite the fact that obesity is the leading attributable risk factor for PE, the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby obesity and obesity-related metabolic factors such as leptin increase the risk for the development of this maternal disorder are unclear. However, growing evidence suggests that pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines are important mechanisms responsible for the marked increase in risk of developing PE in obese pregnant women.  In obese PE women, there are increased circulating and placental populations of CD4+ T helper cells, but whether the cells drive the development of hypertension during obese pregnancies are unclear. The central hypothesis to be tested is that obesity and chronic excess of the specific obese-related metabolic factor leptin (hyperleptinemia) drive increases in CD4+ T helper cells that elicit the development of hypertension via TNF? signaling. The ultimate goal is to uncover mechanistic targets using novel animal models to develop cutting-edge treatment strategies to prevent the pathogenesis of PE, such as in the growing obese population in the following specific aims: AIM 1: To test the hypothesis that hypertension during obesity or chronic leptin excess is mediated by TNF? during pregnancy. AIM 2: To test the hypothesis that obesity or chronic leptin excess increases T cell activation-mediated hypertension and CD4+ T helper cell counts and their secretion of TNF?. AIM 3: To test the hypothesis that CD4+ T helper cells from obese or chronic leptin excess hypertensive pregnant rats are pro-hypertensive via TNF? signaling."
"9295017","Fetuses and adolescents are exposed to bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, and high fat diets daily. This is of concern because such exposures can alter the development and function ofthe gonads, leading to infertility and/or premature reproductive senescence. The mechanisms by which BPA, phthalates, and high fat diet adversely affect gonadal development and function are unclear, but likely involve oxidative stress and epigenetic modifications. Preliminary studies indicate that BPA causes abnormal gonadal development, BPA and phthalates inhibit growth and induce death of ovarian cells through oxidative stress pathways, and high fat diet reduces female fertility in mice. The proposed studies will expand these findings by testing the hypothesis that BPA, phthalates, and high fat diet exposure interact to increase oxidative stress in developing and adolescent gonads, leading to infertility, early reproductive senescence, and transgenerational effects on fertility in the offspring. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be completed: 1) determine if high fat diet and BPA/phthalate/phthalate mixture exposure increase oxidative stress in the gonads of female and male mice, 2) determine if high fat diet and BPA/phthalate/phthalate mixture exposure destroy germ cells and cause epigenetic changes known to reduce germ cell quality in the gonads of female and male mice, and 3) determine if high fat diet and BPA/phthalate/phthalate mixture exposure cause infertility and early reproductive senescence in the first and subsequent generations in mice. To complete these specific aims, gonads or mice will be exposed to BPA, diethylhexyl phthalate, or phthalate mixture during embryonic, neonatal, and adolescent life. At selected times, the gonads or mice will be subjected to measurements of oxidative stress and inflammation, epigenetic changes in DNA methylation status, fertility, and age at reproductive senescence. Collectively, the proposed work will determine the mechanishis by which the selected chemicals and high fat diet adversely affect the development and function ofthe gonads and whether chemical/diet-induced gonadal toxicity at different stages of development leads to infertility and premature reproductive senescence in adults and their offspring."
"9314867","PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal describes a five-year research and training plan that will facilitate the transition of Dr. Robert Guzy, MD, PhD to an independent academic researcher. Dr. Guzy is a cell and molecular biologist and adult pulmonologist at the University of Chicago, and is building a career as a physician scientist with an interest in lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis. He has a strong background in basic science research and medicine and has completed post-graduate training in Internal Medicine and Pulmonary/Critical Care Medicine. The primary training goal of this K08 proposal is to provide the framework and support necessary for Dr. Guzy to 1) extend his experience with murine models of lung injury, 2) build a fund of knowledge in macrophage biology, 3) develop expertise in translational studies, 4) develop expertise in transcriptomics, and 5) transition to independent scientific investigation in pulmonary disease.  This work will be carried out at The University of Chicago under the supervision of Dr. Gokhan Mutlu, MD. The University of Chicago is renowned for its strength in many research disciplines, including translational pulmonary medicine. Dr. Mutlu is an international leader in lung injury research and macrophage biology, and has a highly successful track record of mentoring. An advisory committee with diverse expertise will provide career guidance and scientific feedback. A detailed career development plan is proposed that includes a timeline for development of new skills, preparation of manuscripts for publication, and an eventual R01 application in a pathway to independence.  The proposed research plan will focus on mechanistic studies of FGF2 signaling in lung injury. Preliminary studies performed by Dr. Guzy demonstrate that FGF2 is expressed in macrophages in response to lung injury in mice and humans. Furthermore, mice lacking FGF2 (Fgf2-/-) have increased mortality and deficient alveolar epithelial recovery in response to bleomycin. This study proposes a model in which macrophage-derived FGF2 is required for recovery from lung injury by directly promoting proliferation of lung epithelium and subsequent differentiation into mature alveolar epithelial cells. This will be approached with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine the requirement of macrophage-derived FGF2 expression in response to lung injury. Aim 2: Determine the requirement of FGFRs in Type 2 AECs for recovery after lung injury. Aim 3: Determine the capacity for FGF2 to provide an enhanced reparative signal after lung injury.  In total, these studies will be critical for developing a mechanism of FGF2/FGFR-mediated epithelial recovery after lung injury, and will be the basis for future applications of FGF2 to promote recovery in patients with ARDS. Additionally, results of this project will serve as a foundation for future NIH R01 applications and a career as an independent pulmonary physician scientist."
"9274840","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The yeast mitotic spindle is less complex than its counterparts in larger eukaryotes and has been intensively studied using genetics, biochemistry, cell biology and ultrastructure approaches, providing an opportunity to develop an understanding of its function and regulation at a level that is not currently achievable in any other organism. The studies proposed here are critical for attaining these goals. The understanding of mitotic mechanisms that will result from studies in yeast will provide a framework for elucidating mitotic mechanisms in humans where mitotic errors contribute to cancer and birth defects. The following aims will be pursued: 1. Phospho-regulation of microtubule (MT) dynamics and nucleation Protein kinases direct every phase of mitosis. Because the Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC) undergoes programed cellular localization changes central to its mediation of sundry mitotic events, the hypothesis that CPC phosphorylation by Ipl1 and Cdk1 regulates interactions with specific docking proteins will be tested biochemically and genetically. Having identified the MT-nucleating -TuSC as a Hrr25 target, Hrr25's role in -TuSC assembly and nucleation regulation will be investigated biochemically. 2. Spindle disassembly pathways and control of MT dynamics as cells exit mitosis, the mitotic spindle must be disassembled rapidly. Synthetic-lethal screens and real-time, live cell imaging of spindle disassembly in mutants identified three mechanistically distinct subprocesses necessary for efficient disassembly. Understanding spindle disassembly and the CPC's role in this process will be increased by investigating microtubule dynamics regulation biochemically. Leveraging the ability to purify biochemical quantities of assembly-competent yeast tubulin, CPC, Ipl1, Hrr25 and She1, MT regulation will be reconstituted and a newly developed yeast extract system will enable complementary studies in the full complexity of the cytoplasm. Since She1 is a key CPC target for spindle disassembly, an in-depth analysis of She1's biochemical activities on MTs will be performed. 3. Spatiodynamics of checkpoint activation/inactivation Errors in kinetochore-MT attachments are detected by the spindle checkpoint. An innovative, image-based approach to monitor spindle checkpoint activation and inactivation at single kinetochores will determine whether the checkpoint is active in every normal cell cycle, how and when the PPI protein phosphatase Glc7 is recruited for checkpoint inactivation, and why kinetochores do not detach during their retrieval to the spindle due to lack of tension. In total, these studies will advance understanding of fundamental aspects of mitotic spindle function and regulation. The principles established are expected to apply generally across diverse phyla."

"9331631","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a revised submission for a K23 award by Dr. Girish Nadkarni at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Nadkarni is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient oriented clinical research of chronic kidney disease. This project will try to improve risk prediction and stratification for kidney disease progression in minority populations at baseline high genetic risk due to Apolipoprotein1 (APOL1) variants. Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Girish Nadkarni's career development into an independent investigator in the field of leveraging biomarkers, genomics and ?big data? approaches for renal research. Dr. Nadkarni's career goal is to accurately risk stratify patients for renal functional decline for future targeted enrolment into clinical trials evaluating novel interventions. To achieve these goals, Dr. Nadkarni has assembled a mentoring and advisory team led by a primary mentor, Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor and Director of Clinical Research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and a co-mentor Dr. Erwin Bottinger, Professor of Medicine and former Director of The Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine. His advisory team consists of Dr. Emilia Bagiella, Professor in the Division of Biostatistics at Mount Sinai and an expert in longitudinal analysis; Dr. Eimear Kenny, Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics and Genomics and an expert in statistical and population genetics; Dr. Avi Ma'ayan, an Associate Professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics and an expert in bioinformatics and Dr. Judy Cho, the incoming director of the Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine and an expert in translational genetics. His proposed training plan focuses on four areas (1) Advanced Statistical and Epidemiological Methodology; (2) Biomarker Methodology; (3) Computational Bioinformatics and Programming and (4) Focused mentorship and career development. Environment: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research and is one of the top 20 medical schools in NIH funding. ISMMS was also named as one of the The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies In Big Data due to its computing resources and the BioMe Biobank, whose primary architect is Dr.Bottinger and is currently led by Dr. Cho. Research: Ethnic minorities are at higher risk of both development and progression of chronic kidney disease. This has been linked in part to risk variants in the APOL1 gene that are present in up to 14% in populations of African descent (including African Americans [AAs] and Hispanic Latinos [HLas]) but are absent in non- Hispanic Whites. Although APOL1 high-risk genotype is, in general, associated with faster eGFR decline, only about 50% progress to ESRD and patients within this group have differing rates of renal functional decline. Thus, risk stratification within this group is poor, limiting early intervention. With a large proportion of vulnerable ethnic minorities at increased risk, innovative methods for predicting renal function decline within this genetically high-risk group are urgently needed. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) Establish associations of clinical predictors, lifestyle factors and laboratory parameters with longitudinal eGFR decline in AA/HLas with APOL1 high-risk genotype; (2) To develop a novel plasma biomarker panel assessing inflammation, injury, vascular insult and fibrosis, for risk prognostication of longitudinal eGFR decline in self-reported AA/HLas with APOL1 high-risk genotype; and (3) To conduct comprehensive, external validation of the highest performing plasma biomarkers and traditional predictors and derive risk clusters using validated predictors for longitudinal eGFR decline in self-reported AA/HLa's with APOL1 high-risk genotype. Aims 1 and 2 will be conducted using the largest cohort of participants with APOL1 risk variants ever assembled (n=809). Aim 3 will be conducted using four external cohorts, the Vanderbilt BioVU cohort, the Genetic testing to Understand and Address Renal Disease Disparities (GUARDD) study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC). These approaches integrating genetic, biomarker and electronic medical record clinical information, will form the basis for future work investigating targeted enrolment of high-risk patients in pragmatic, randomized controlled trials for early interventions, which will be proposed in an R01 application before the end of the K award period."
"9281540","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to understand how the Beclin 1/vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 34 (VPS34) complex contributes to breast cancer progression and to determine how to sensitize tumor cells that are deficient in Beclin 1/VPS34 function to drugs that promote tumor cell death. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer related mortality. Despite the availability of targeted therapeutics, the overall survival rate for stage I metastatic disease remains 23%. Therefore, there is a need to develop novel approaches for the treatment of advanced stage breast cancer. The applicant hypothesizes that one such approach could exploit Beclin 1/VPS34 function in breast cancer progression. Beclin 1 is monoallelically deleted in 40% of human breast cancer and there is an inverse correlation between Beclin 1 expression and poor prognosis in ER negative subtypes of breast cancer. In addition, low Beclin 1 expression serves as an independent predictor of patient survival. Beclin 1 interacts with and activates VPS34, the mammalian Class III phosphatidylinositol, to regulate multiple membrane trafficking pathways including autophagy, growth factor receptor trafficking and cytokinesis. The individual contribution of each of these trafficking pathways to cancer is unknown and needs to be investigated to understand the impact of Beclin 1 loss on breast cancer progression. Previous studies in the applicant's lab have shown that loss of Beclin 1 expression is associated with a sustained increase in AKT and ERK signaling downstream of the IGF and EGF receptors. In addition, loss of Beclin 1 expression in breast carcinoma cells leads to increased invasion. These preliminary findings suggest that VPS34 inhibitors, which are currently in clinical trials, may negatively impact tumor treatment. The work that the applicant proposes here will explore how the Beclin 1/VPS34 complex contributes to breast cancer progression. The applicant hypothesizes that inhibiting the Beclin1/VPS34 complex will lead to the upregulation of specific pathways that promote tumor growth and progression and that targeting these pathways in tumors with low Beclin 1 expression or in combination with VPS34 inhibition will suppress tumor cell viability. The goal with this proposal is to dissect out the roe of each Beclin 1/VPS34 complex in breast cancer progression with respect to tumor growth, metastasis, and tumor metabolism both in vitro and in vivo (Aim 1). Furthermore, mechanisms that sensitize breast cancer cells to death upon Beclin 1/VPS34 inhibition will be identified as a means to target Beclin 1 deficient tumors and optimize VPS34 inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents (Aim 2). The studies in this proposal will enhance our understanding of the role of Beclin 1 in breast cancer and can give insight into novel therapies for advanced stage breast cancer disease."
"9283228","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The meniscus is a semi-lunar and wedge-shaped fibrocartilaginous structure between the distal femoral condyle and the proximal tibial plateaus in the knee joint. Meniscus plays indispensable roles in joint congruence, shock absorption, and stress transmission. Meniscus injuries do not heal spontaneously. Clinically, over one million patients undergo meniscectomy each year in the United States. Allograft transplantation from cadavers is the primary clinical substitute of resected meniscus, but suffers from donor shortage, pathogen transmission, immunorejection and tissue mis-match. Meniscectomy, with or without allograft transplantation, alleviates pain at best, but significantly increases the incidence of osteoarthritis later in life. By 2020, a total of 67 million Americans will suffer fro arthritis. Not surprisingly, regeneration of knee meniscus is an aspiring goal in orthopedic medicine, but has encountered multiple barriers. No regenerative therapies exist for meniscus injuries at this time. One of the critical barriers of meniscus regeneration is our insufficient knowledge of meniscus cells, known as fibrochondrocytes whose origin and lineage derivation are poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrate that 1) fibrochondrocytes were derived from adult stem/progenitor cells by step-wise induction with two recombinant human growth factors that are both necessary and sufficient for induction of fibrochondrocytes in vitro and in vivo; 2) spatiotemporal release of these two growth factors induced de novo formation of multiphase fibrocartilage tissues in anatomically correct bioscaffolds that replaced partially resected knee meniscus in vivo in a preclinical model. Host endogenous cells were recruited into anatomically correct, microporous scaffolds and produced primarily type I collagen in the outer region, type II collagen in the inner region and blended type I and II collagens in the intermediate zone of the regenerated meniscus tissues. The overall objectives of this proposal are to optimize strategies for the recruitment of host endogenous cells and differentiation into fibrochondrocytes in our existing pre-clinical model of meniscus regeneration, without cell transplantation. Our overarching hypothesis is that spatiotemporal delivery of specific bioactive cues regulates the recruitment and fibrochondrogenic differentiation of endogenous cells, including stem/progenitor cells, towards meniscus regeneration. No regenerative therapies exist for fibrocartilage defects in intervertebral disks, tendon-bone junction and the temporomandibular joint. The planned studies will identify fibrochondrocyte populations that are pivotal for meniscus regeneration, and may have implications for the regeneration of other fibrocartilage structures. The planned cell recruitment strategies may be applicable in the regeneration of other tissues."
"9274980","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Despite their broad medical importance as dominant mechanisms underlying the rapid dissemination of antibiotic resistance and infection by many bacterial pathogens, there is a fundamental lack of mechanistic understanding how type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) translocate macromolecular substrates to bacterial or eukaryotic target cells. The VirB/VirD4 system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and closely-related plasmid conjugation systems in Escherichia coli serve as important models for detailed structure-function studies of T4SSs. The long-term goal of work in this laboratory is to describe in complete molecular terms the T4SS machine biogenesis pathway, the basis for substrate recognition and transfer across the cell envelope, and the nature of the machine - target cell contact. New structural information has shown that the T4SSs of Gram- negative bacteria are composed of a large outer membrane-associated complex (OMC; also designated as the core complex) and an equally large inner membrane complex (IMC), with a narrow stalk connecting the two substructures. This structure raises new questions about the substrate secretion pathway and the mechanisms mediating assembly of conjugative pili. We hypothesize that T4SSs function either as substrate channels or as pilus biogenesis systems and that a combination of intra- and extracellular signals regulate these alternative outcomes. We propose two specific aims: 1) Define the nature of substrate-receptor docking and the contributions of channel ATPases to substrate processing and delivery across the inner membrane and ii) Define the pilus biogenesis pathway and the regulatory checkpoints governing substrate transfer and pilus nucleation and extension across the outer membrane. For Aim 1, recent findings drive our refined studies exploring the roles of translocation signals in the substrate - receptor binding, as well as experiments testing the contributions of two ATPases to chaperone release and substrate unfolding prior to translocation. For Aim 2, recent structural advances and biochemical findings support tests of specific models for pilus nucleation at the IMC and extension through the central chamber of the OMC. A combination of intracellular signals, including substrate binding and ATP energy, is postulated to induce conformational changes in the OMC for activation of substrate transfer at the expense of pilus production. These studies interface with ongoing collaborative efforts to obtain high-resolution T4SS structures and donor-target cell mating junctions. The work is innovative, in concept by exploiting a highly efficient conjugation machine that we have now shown to translocate effector proteins, and in approach through incorporation of state-of-the art in vivo assays to define dynamic steps in substrate translocation and pilus assembly. The work is expected to stimulate new basic research directions and provide a critical knowledge base for applied studies aimed at suppressing antibiotic resistance spread and disease progression by many clinically significant pathogens."

"9421014","Abstract Bariatric surgery is currently the most efficacious and durable intervention for severe obesity. Many comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) generally remit or resolve following bariatric surgery. Yet, some patients experience suboptimal weight outcomes following surgery, often resulting from substantial weight regain following successful weight loss. Unfortunately, weight recidivism is also often associated with reemergence of obesity-associated comorbidities. The most commonly performed procedures in the U.S. are the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and the laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG). Both procedures involve significant anatomical and physiological changes that lead to changes in behavior and biology. The etiological contributors to weight loss following surgery are not well understood, and it is therefore difficult to predict which patients may experience suboptimal post-surgical weight outcomes. Changes in eating and physical activity behaviors, mood, and the microbiome have all been reported to occur following bariatric surgery and have an association with weight change. Weight change likely involves complex interactions between behavioral and biological variables. The longitudinal relationship between changes in the gut microbiome and post-surgery weight trajectory has not been explored thoroughly, and the associations between the microbiome and other variables that impact weight have been similarly understudied. Therefore, we propose to conduct a prospective, 24-month longitudinal study of patients planning to undergo RYGB or SG and aim to identify correlates and predictors of observed weight loss trajectories over 24 months following bariatric surgery. In particular, this application is designed to examine the relationships between empirically supported behavioral and biological variables following surgery and their combined impact on weight outcome. These data will extend the current literature by collecting behavioral and biological data, by carrying out longer term follow-up of participants enrolled, and by studying a larger sample size. Novel data collection in this protocol will include intensive measurement of problematic eating behaviors and compliance with diet and exercise regimens post-surgically, which may be altered in parallel with, or in response to, changes observed in the gut microbiota. Identifying post-surgical predictors of weight loss and comorbidity resolution will allow for the development of interventions that can be tailored to individual patients based upon his/her risk profile which can then be implemented early to optimize surgery-related outcomes."
"9279220","CORE A ? ANIMAL MODELS PROJECT SUMMARY Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF affects multiple organs, including lungs, pancreas, intestine, liver, sweat glands, gallbladder, and the male genital tract. Airway infection and inflammation currently cause most of the morbidity and mortality. Although several therapies have improved the lives of patients, current treatments are inadequate and CF remains a lethal disease. Our knowledge about the pathogenesis of the disease, its progression, and the state of the neonatal lung is inadequate. These gaps in our knowledge have hindered attempts to develop better treatments and preventions for CF lung disease. A major impediment to addressing these issues has been limitations of current animal models. Although mouse strains carrying null and missense CFTR mutations have made enormous contributions, CF mice do not develop the airway or pancreatic disease typically found in humans. We recently generated CF ferrets and pigs that replicate many of the key features of human CF disease including intestinal obstruction, exocrine pancreatic destruction, micro-gallbladder, vas deferens abnormalities, focal biliary cirrhosis, congenital airway structural abnormalities, and airway and sinus infection with time. The goals of the Animal Models Core will be to (1): Provide Program investigators with non-CF and CF ferrets and pigs, and to build new genetically engineered CF ferret and pig models that express CFTR in a regulated fashion; (2) Assist projects in carrying out vector delivery, the harvesting of biologic samples from live animals (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood), and the care and analysis of study animals; (3) Facilitate studies by monitoring disease progression with high resolution computed tomography sinus and lung imaging, and measuring mucociliary transport. The Animal Models Core will function seamlessly through already established interactions with the Project Leaders, Pathology Core, In Vitro Models and Cell Culture Core, Vector Core, and the Administrative Core. The success of the Animal Models Core is ensured because of the commitment, experience, and expertise that the personnel bring to the Core."
"9330926","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Over 80% of African Americans report experiences of discrimination in the past year; perceived discrimination is linked to health disparities including poor adherence. Poor adherence may contribute to the high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in African Americans. We propose an innovative approach using values affirmation to overcome the threat of discrimination to increase patient activation, improve adherence and thereby reduce disparities in hypertension outcomes. Our proposal is based upon our pilot study demonstrating a brief values affirmation exercise done immediately before a clinic visit resulted in improved communication between African American patients and providers during the visit and suggested improved medication adherence 6-months after the visit. We propose to advance our prior work and fill gaps in the evidence by conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing a values affirmation exercise to a control exercise among 1100 patients with hypertension from three health systems. The primary outcome is 6-month change in adherence to antihypertensive therapies with the secondary outcome of change in blood pressure. We will also explore possible mechanisms of the intervention effect and formally evaluate for dissemination.  ? In aim 1, we will compare the effects of the values affirmation exercise to a control exercise on  antihypertensive medication adherence in African American patients across three clinical settings. We  hypothesize patients randomized to values affirmation will have greater adherence change at 6-months  compared to controls and the effect will be partially moderated by patient factors (prior experiences of  discrimination), independent of provider factors (implicit racial bias, past disparities training, self-  efficacy caring for minority patients) and mediated by patient activation.  ? In aim 2, we will compare the effects of values affirmation exercise in African American patients to its  effects in white patients with hypertension. We hypothesize that values affirmation will improve  adherence to a greater degree in African American patients suggesting the intervention is targeting  perceived discrimination related to race.  ? In aim 3, we will formally evaluate the intervention for widespread dissemination using the RE-AIM  (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) framework. We hypothesize the  intervention will have favorable characteristics for widespread dissemination within primary care.  The project is innovative, as it will use a novel intervention that has not been widely applied in the healthcare setting. Since values affirmation is not specific to hypertension or African Americans, this study will be the first to provide evidence for a low-resource intervention that has the potential to reduce healthcare disparities across a wide range of health care conditions and populations."

An advisory Committee, which will include 3  members from outside institutions, will meet with this group regularly to provide advice about all aspects of  management. This committee will meet four times a year with the Core Directors Committee that will meet  monthly. A major principle of management will be that the Core Facilities must serve as engines of  technological innovation; the anticipated changing menu of core offerings will require ongoing evaluation by  the Core Directors and Advisory Committees. Another major principle is that the Core budgets will depend  on user fees to cover most supply costs associated with Core services. This principle will allow the funding  of several technicians who will provide services not othenwise easily obtained by Center investigators. Dr.  Marie Demay will head a committee charged with the management of the Pilot and Feasibility Program. Ms.  Moulton and Ms. Maclaughlin will manage the content of a Center website that will be used to coordinate and  advertise Center activities and will also be interactive to allow fiscal management of all Research Cores and  to allow the Cores to identify and track samples and Center investigators to communicate with each other. A  seminar series will be planned to expand upon a currently existing series in a way that will expand the scope  of the series and provide another setting for teaching by Core staff and feedback to the Cores from the  research base. Ongoing evaluation of all programs through the polling of the research base and continually  finding ways to foster collaborations will be major goals of Center leadership."
"9303352","It is highly desired to develop new non-invasive imaging approach for detecting bacterial infection with improved specificity and spatial-temporal resolution. Although to date there are a number of molecular imaging approaches have been demonstrated for bacterial infection in the preclinical animal models, there is clearly a gap between the demand of clinically-compatible imaging methods and conventional tagging strategies, which often require the use of metallic or radioactive contrast agents. To address this gap, we are developing a ?non-labeled? (i.e., not radioactive, and not paramagnetic- or super-paramagnetic-) approach for detecting bacteria. In this approach bacterial cells are directly detected through their endogenous molecules using an innovative MRI technology called Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST). The long-term goal of our research is to exploit this endogenous bacteria-specific CEST MRI signal to detect pathogenic bacteria and monitor the progress of bacterial infection. As initially demonstrated in solid tumors, we showed that CEST MRI could detect a therapeutic bacteria C. novyi-NT, a genetically modified bacteria strain currently in the Phase I clinical trial for treating solid tumors. Based on the preliminary data, we hypothesize that CEST MRI that detects the germination and proliferation of C. novyi-NT can be used as a non-invasive imaging biomarker for predicting the success of bacteriolytic therapy on glioma, a highly lethal brain tumor type. We plan to test our hypothesis through completing the following two specific aims: 1) To improve the specificity of bacterial CEST contrast using newly developed CEST technologies, and 2) To test and validate the optimized bacterial CEST MRI detection in the C. novyi-NT cancer therapy. We anticipate that accomplishing these aims will result in a highly translatable MRI technology specifically for bacterial detection, which could be used immediately as an imaging biomarker in the clinical trials of C.novyi-NT bacteriolytic therapy. More importantly, the knowledge gained from this project will enable a further expansion of using the proposed CEST MRI methods to the detection of many other types of bacteria, which will be enormously useful for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of bacterial infection in deep organs, such as brain, which are currently difficult to detect."
"9278186","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Splicing of pre-mRNAs provides a major source of transcript diversity for cell differentiation and development. The process of splicing requires a splicing machine known as the spliceosome that comprises ~100 proteins and five small nuclear (sn)RNAs. The early stage of spliceosome assembly on pre-mRNA splice sites is a key regulated step that often goes awry in human genetic diseases and cancers. Yet, exactly how the spliceosome selects and excises the correct splice sites from amidst thousands of competing pre-mRNA sequences remains poorly understood at the molecular level. The overall goal of this project is to understand how an essential complex comprising U2AF65, U2AF35, and SF1 proteins can accurately target 3' splice sites, leading to spliceosome assembly. Specific aims of this proposal will test the following central hypotheses concerning the critical early stages of pre-mRNA splicing: Hypothesis #1: Our 'panoptic' understanding of U2AF65 recognition of 3' splice site RNAs - emerging from our new structures of intact U2AF65 as well as past work on core domains- can be used to understand pre-mRNA splice site mutations from specific human diseases. Hypothesis #2: We will expand our prior results and preliminary data to test the spliceosome subunit SF3b155 as a molecular hub coordinating phosphorylation-sensitive assemblies comprising U2AF65, the cancer-related factor paralogue CAPERa, and the p14 subunit, which in turn contacts the branch-site nucleophile of the spliceosome. Hypothesis #3: Our innovative SF1/U2AF65/U2AF35/RNA preparation positions us to locate the protein and RNA subunits in the complex, and to test the structural and functional effects of U2AF35 mutations that frequently cause myelodysplasia, hematological malignancies and lung cancer. Our overall approach entails a multi-front attack on all aims using a multidisciplinary strategy. Our core biophysical technologies entail X-ray crystallography, fluorescence anisotropy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and small-angle X-ray scattering with purified proteins. To meet challenges and propel the field in new directions, we will utilize a powerful combination of innovative methods including protein and RNA labeling, Forster resonance energy transfer, small-angle neutron scattering, and site-specific photo-crosslinking followed by LC-MS/MS. These tools are complemented by strong collaborations to study splicing factor functions in nuclear extracts and in living cells. Our research is grounded in the fundamental structure and function of 3' splice site recognition yet will broadly impact the field's understanding of aberran splicing, which is a dominant cause of blood disorders, neuromuscular diseases, leukemias and cancers."
"9275556","Clinical trials of pharmacotherapies to slow progression of the hereditary neurodegenerative disorder Huntington's disease (HD) have not identified effective drugs. Partly because of this and because reducing levels of the pathogenic mutant huntingtin protein is likely to be the most effective treatment, gene therapy is being pursued by many investigators and clinicians, typically using either antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against mutant huntingtin mRNA, or RNA against mutant huntingtin mRNA that interferes with its expression (RNAi). Because ASOs and RNAi delivery constructs (typically AAV expressing RNAi) cannot cross the blood-brain-barrier and because efficacy of any one treatment wanes with time, direct CNS delivery several times a year will be required to maintain efficacy. Such repeated injections pose safety risks and concerns about achieving high enough levels in the critical brain areas for therapeutic benefit. We have been testing an alternative approach using systemic delivery of DNAzymes in R6/2 HD transgenic mice, and found they have considerable efficacy and promise. DNAzymes are synthetic catalytically active DNA molecules that bind to and cleave targeted mRNA. They possess a central catalytic domain consisting of a specific sequence of 15 deoxynucleotides, and two variable flanking domains that can be designed to hybridize a DNAzyme molecule to a specific target mRNA. After mRNA cleavage, DNAzymes dissociate from the mRNA, and the cleavage products are further degraded by intracellular RNases. DNAzymes possess advantages over other gene therapies because: 1) they are catalytically active, leading to a better dose-response efficacy; 2) they are stable and cross the blood-brain barrier, and thus can be delivered repeatedly by systemic injections, thereby avoiding the need for direct CNS injection; 3) systemic administration yields DNAzyme delivery to both peripheral organs and brain, thus treating peripheral and central manifestations of disease; and 4) therapy can be discontinued in the event of adverse side effects. In the proposed studies, we will further develop systemic DNAzyme therapy as an HD treatment, by characterizing the extent and duration of its effectiveness using the rapidly progressing R6/2 mouse model expressing truncated mutant human huntingtin (Aim 1) and the more slowly progressing BACHD mouse model expressing full-length mutant human huntingtin (Aim 2). Studies in both mouse lines will evaluate how long the mutant huntingtin holiday lasts after a one-month daily intraperitoneal delivery period (out to a month post in R6/2 mice and two months post in BACHD mice), and assess benefit by extent of mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein knockdown in brain and peripheral organs (qPCR and Western blots), behavioral testing (rotarod and open field), and brain neurochemistry and pathology. We will also evaluate any possible DNZ6 toxicity or inflammatory effects, and determine the extent to which the DNAzyme(s) we test knock down human WT huntingtin in vitro and endogenous mouse WT huntingtin in vivo."
"9070496","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the project is to understand the role of NOTCH3 signaling in the genesis of pulmonary hypertension. The long-term objectives are to apply these discoveries and enable the translation of these findings into clinical practice. Recently, we have shown that human pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by overexpression of NOTCH3, a receptor of the NOTCH gene family, and HES-5, a downstream effector in the NOTCH pathway, in small pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. We have found that the severity of pulmonary hypertension in humans and rodents correlates with the amount of NOTCH3 or HES-5 in the lung. We have demonstrated that mice with homozygous deletion of Notch3 do not develop pulmonary hypertension in response to hypoxic stimulation and that pulmonary hypertension can be successfully treated in mice and rats by administration of a gamma-secretase inhibitor drug that blocks the cleavage and activation of Notch3 in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells. Building on these results, we have demonstrated a mechanistic link from NOTCH3 receptor signaling through HES-5, to small pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and a shift to an undifferentiated smooth muscle cell phenotype. Recently, we have found evidence of signal integration and regulation between NOTCH3 and BMPR pathways in vascular smooth muscle cells from individuals with pulmonary arterial hypertension, with the discovery that HES-5 binds to specific ID proteins, which function as downstream effectors of BMPR-2 signaling. Thus, we hypothesize that the NOTCH3-HES-5 signaling pathway is crucial for the pathologic remodeling of small vessels in the lung in pulmonary hypertension and that targeting this pathway may be a useful strategy to treat this disease. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) determine whether different forms of pulmonary hypertension are linked by the same pattern of overexpression of NOTCH3 and HES-5 in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and examine whether the proliferative/anti-apoptotic capacities of these cells in patients with different World Health Organization Classifications of pulmonary hypertension is dependent on constitutive expression of NOTCH3 and HES-5. We will also examine NOTCH ligand expression on pulmonary vascular endothelium from patients with different World Health Organization forms of disease, 2) investigate NOTCH downstream signaling as a key regulator of downstream BMPR signaling in pulmonary hypertension, by determining if modulation of levels or function of ID proteins by HES-5 in vascular smooth muscle cells is obligate for this disease, and 3) develop a therapeutic approach targeting the Notch signaling pathway to treat pulmonary hypertension, using two independent methods: gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment and Notch3-specific antibody treatment in rodent and pig models of disease. Information gained from these proposed experiments should elucidate a molecular mechanism for pulmonary hypertension and suggest possible treatment strategies for this disease."
"9495099","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been proven effective in reducing HIV infection in high-risk men who have sex with men, heterosexually active women and men, and injecting drug users and approved by the FDA in 2012, uptake has been limited. Significant impediments to PrEP implementation include: system barriers (lack of a medical home and organizational models for implementing PrEP); provider barriers (difficulty identifying those likely to benefit from PrEP, inexperience with PrEP, and concerns about adherence and risk compensation); and user barriers (lack of awareness of PrEP, inability to access providers comfortable with prescribing PrEP, and concerns about stigma and side effects). Cost is not a barrier in New York State, where PrEP is covered by many insurance plans, including Medicaid and is provided to the uninsured.  Primary Care for PrEP (PC4PrEP) is a new multilevel structural intervention that will address these diverse barriers to PrEP uptake in underserved communities in the Bronx, NY, a U.S HIV epicenter. It has 4 components: (1) designate a home for PrEP in primary care clinics; (2) train and support primary care providers (PCPs) to prescribe and manage PrEP, and create provider norms that promote the value of PrEP; (3) identify high-risk individuals in primary care clinics using a new PrEP Eligibility Tool; and (4) identify high- risk out-of-care individuals (in collaboration with a community-based organization (CBO) that conducts outreach and HIV testing in HIV-risk groups) and link them to PCPs who can provide PrEP. We will conduct a Phase 2 clinic-randomized futility trial of PC4PrEP in 6 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and 6 non- randomized community HIV testing sites to determine whether PC4PrEP shows promise for increasing the rate of new PrEP prescriptions, assess its effect on outcomes at each stage of our conceptualization of the PrEP Cascade, and assess challenges to PrEP adoption. The Specific Aims are to (1) assess whether PC4PrEP shows promise, measured as the rate of new PrEP prescriptions per clinic per year; (2) through a phased implementation of PC4PrEP components, determine the incremental contribution of each component; (3) evaluate the effects of PC4PrEP on measures of the PrEP Cascade; and (4) assess challenges to PC4PrEP adoption through (a) in-depth interviews with PCPs and support staff about PC4PrEP; (b) in-depth interviews with selected patient-provider dyads to understand their communication about PrEP; and (c) a nested longitudinal qualitative study of patients who initiate PrEP that will include exploration of risk compensation and self-reported adherence augmented by an objective measure of adherence, dried blood spot assays for tenofovir disphosphate. If shown effective, PC4PreP will be highly transferable to other primary care clinic/CBO partnerships in high HIV incidence communities. It is consistent with CDC Guidelines and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in integrating PrEP into primary care practices and is responsive to the 2014 NYS Health Department guidelines, which position PrEP as a first-line intervention for high-risk groups."
"9298708","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks to follow the participants in Study of Novel Approaches to Weight Gain Prevention (SNAP) (Grant #U01-HL090864), a randomized clinical trial that has successfully reduced weight gain in young adults through 3 years. SNAP is the first weight gain prevention trial to show positive effects over an extended time period in this age group. The SNAP-Extension (SNAP-E) will cost-effectively determine whether the effects of the intervention can be maintained over 3 additional years (through a total of 6 years). Young adults, ages 20-35, gain on average 2 pounds per year, increasing their risk of developing obesity and obesity related co-morbidities. Previous efforts to prevent this weight gain have had limited success. SNAP is a randomized controlled clinical trial involving 599 participants, age 18-35 with a BMI of 23- 30, comparing weight changes over an average follow-up of 3 years in a control group and two innovative interventions. Both interventions are based on a self-regulation model, involving frequent self-weighing and changes in eating and activity if weight gain occurs. However, one intervention focuses on making small consistent changes in eating and exercise behavior to prevent weight gain; the other emphasizes periodic larger changes in eating and exercise, with a goal of producing a buffer against anticipated weight gains. SNAP has had excellent retention to date and has shown that both interventions significantly reduced weight gain relative to control through 3 years. Although weight changes in the two interventions do not differ from each other at 3 years, they have had very different weight change trajectories, raising questions about long- term efficacy. Continuing to follow these participants is critical to determine whether the skills imparted during these interventions and the resulting beneficial effects on weight gain are maintained longer term and whether there are differences in outcomes for large and small change approaches. In SNAP-E we will provide minimal intervention for the Small and Large Change groups using remote technology and will follow all participants at 6 month intervals using Smart Scales and on-line questionnaires. There will be one final clinic assessment at Year 6, with measures of body composition, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, dietary intake and objective assessment of physical activity, all implemented using procedures that were used throughout SNAP. The primary hypothesis of SNAP-E is that the magnitude of weight gain from baseline to 6 years will differ among the three arms. Secondary hypotheses compare the groups on dichotomous measures of weight gain, on CVD risk factors, and on weight control behaviors. Preventing weight gain may be a more effective public health approach than treating obesity. SNAP is the first study to show long-term benefits of an intervention on weight gain in young adults. Continuing to follow these participants in SNAP-E provides a cost-effective and unique opportunity to answer important questions about weight gain prevention."
"9366516","Project Summary/Abstract:  Therapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) is a very common and often dose-limiting side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Clinically TIPN is a predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy characterized by numbness, tingling, and often, neuropathic pain. These symptoms can persist for years after cessation of treatment, and so TIPN can significantly diminish patient's quality-of-life both during and after treatment. Moreover, the development of TIPN often necessitates reducing drug dosage or switching regimens, and therefore limits the effectiveness of anti-cancer therapy. Currently, there are no effective treatments for TIPN. Axon loss is a hallmark of this neuropathy, suggesting that mechanistically distinct chemotherapeutics may feed into a common axonal degeneration program. We have demonstrated that genetic inhibition of this core axonal degeneration program blocks the development of TIPN in a mouse model of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy. Now we seek to identify small molecules that can block this axonal degeneration program that could serve as a) chemical probes for the study of axon degeneration and b) therapeutic lead compounds for the development of new treatments to prevent or treat TIPN and other disorders characterized by axon loss. We have developed an assay to identify such inhibitors, and now propose to optimize this assay for a high-throughput screening format. We will use this high-throughput screening platform to conduct a pilot screen and develop a series of counter screens to eliminate false positives and to assess various parameters of identified compounds to prioritize them for further validation. These assays will also serve to characterize mechanistic features of the hits and cluster them based on chemical properties and mechanism of action for biological assays. Finally, we will test the therapeutic potential of identified compounds by examining their activity in cultured neurons using phenotypic axon degeneration assays. If successful, this project will yield a reliable and efficient high-throughput screening platform and follow-up testing funnel for the identification of novel therapeutic candidates for the development of therapies for TIPN and other disorders of the injured and diseased nervous system."
"9379762","Eukaryotic cells are organized with separate membrane-bound organelles with distinct lipid compositions. The lipid compositions are maintained through vesicular transport as well as the less-understood, lipid-transfer protein (LTP)-mediated, nonvesicular transport. It is important to gain a better understanding of lipid transfer process, as perturbations of lipid trafficking contribute to human pathologies including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes. Viruses, as obligate intracellular parasites, have evolved strategies to manipulate the cellular membranes for entry, genome replication, virion production, and exit. Uncovering these strategies will not only reveal key viral replication steps for antivirals development but also provide mechanistic insights on fundamental cellular processes. Enveloped viruses typically acquire their outer lipid bilayer by budding from cellular membranes, a process that is similar to the formation of cellular transport vesicles. Poxviruses, however, are unusual in that their primary envelope is not acquired by budding but through extending of open-ended crescent membranes. The origin and biogenesis of the crescent membranes have puzzled virologists for over half a century, albeit recent studies suggest that the crescents may derive from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in a manner that is independent of vesicular transport from the ER. Five viral proteins, collectively termed viral membrane assembly proteins (VMAPs), have been found to be essential for the biogenesis of crescent membranes. The A6 protein of vaccinia virus is a key member of the VMAPs, which we discovered and have studied intensively. In recent studies, we achieved a breakthrough in structural analysis of the A6 protein by solving the crystal structures of both its N- and C- domains. Even more importantly, our structural and biochemical studies indicate that the C- domain is a novel lipid binding protein with an unusually high binding capacity for glycerol-phospholipids and that the N-domain regulates lipid binding. These led us to the innovative hypotheses that A6 is a lipid-transfer protein (LTP) and that poxviruses obtain their primary envelope by mimicking or hijacking the cellular LTP-mediated nonvesicular lipid transport process. We propose the following exploratory studies to test our novel hypotheses. Aim 1. To determine the specificity and stoichiometry of the lipids bound by A6 Aim 2. To determine the role of lipid binding of A6 in viral membrane biogenesis Aim 3. To determine the structural basis by which A6 N-domain regulates C-domain for lipid binding."
"9257760","Abstract Many behaviors operate in a Bayesian framework, where actions are guided by a complex interaction between current sensory information and past experience, or ?priors?. When current sensory information is weak, it is advantageous to allow the prior to guide behavior. However, the value of prior experience lessens as sensory information strengthens. Our goal is to determine how Bayesian behavior arises from the operation of a neural circuit. Smooth pursuit eye movement is an example of a relatively simple sensory-motor behavior that operates in a Bayesian-like manner. Smooth pursuit is a visually-guided voluntary eye movement that can be separated into two primary components: visual drive and visuomotor gain. It is appealing to think of these two components from a Bayesian perspective: the visual drive arises from the middle temporal visual area (MT) and represents the likelihood function derived from sensory data; the visuomotor gain is controlled by the smooth pursuit region of the frontal eye field (FEFsem) and represents the prior. The two concepts and their neural instantiations are integrated within the pursuit system to drive the ultimate eye movement. Both components have been studied independently, but our goal is to study their integration. The dorsolateral pontine nucleus (DLPN) and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) both receive convergent input from cortical areas of pursuit and have cells with a range of visual and visuomotor signals. Therefore, we will record from single neurons in the DLPN and NRTP of awake behaving rhesus monkeys to study the integration of visual and visuomotor signals in the pursuit system. To better understand the relationship between the integration of visual and visuomotor signals and the emergence of Bayesian-like behavior, we have developed a behavioral paradigm that allows us to rapidly adapt priors for target speed. We can control tightly the adaptation of the prior by adjusting the statistics of the target speed, and we can control the expression of the prior by adjusting the strength of the visual motion signals. This will reveal how the integration of visual and visuomotor signals in the pons changes as a function of the state of the prior and the strength of sensory information. To directly study the role of FEFsem in the integration of these signals, we will pair our pontine recordings with simultaneous recordings of multiple single units in the FEFsem. Neuron-neuron correlations between the responses of pontine and FEFsem neurons will reveal functional connectivity between the areas and move towards a description of how the pursuit circuit works as a system. By gaining a better understanding of how the pursuit system integrates priors and sensory information, we will develop general principles of sensory-motor brain circuits."

In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic 01 will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III]) reading comprehension subtest score and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the 01 Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of 01 (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence at near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1 -year post treatment.  This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and to retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the OITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DOO] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DOO at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center.  Symptomatic 01 is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of 01 treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."

Their research programs utilize collaborative and multi- disciplinary approaches employing state-of-the-art techniques in cell biology, microbiology, molecular biology and comparative pathology. By observing strong, interactive programs in multiple departments at UCSD and throughout the research community in San Diego, the trainees will have an outstanding opportunity to pursue an agenda for successful professional development. This training program will be administered by faculty associated with the UCSD Center for Veterinary Sciences and Comparative Medicine. As a result of this training program, trainees will gain a comprehensive understanding of hypothesis-based research and gain knowledge and skills required for productive careers in academics that will address the national needs for the development of skilled scientists in mouse pathobiology and comparative medicine relevant to human health."
"9412579","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to continue and improve upon a residency training research track with the explicit goal of recruiting MD/PhD and medical graduates with a track record in conducting research. The program provides early exposure to clinical research to stimulate interest in translational research among our basic science trainees. There are 7 months of exposure to translational research in both inpatient and outpatient clinical research settings, and 14.5 months of protected time for a mentored research project. These months will be augmented by intensive mentoring, overseen by the PIs, functioning as meta-mentors, as well as preceptorships focused on ethics, statistics, research design and principles of translational research. All this will be attained while meeting ACGME requirements so that graduates will be board eligible. We already have early evidence that such a 4-year program permits research track residents to jump start their research career while still residents, rendering them better prepared for research fellowships and the K award process, ultimately leading to careers as independent investigators. Because the program leads to board eligibility, we offer our trainees a no-risk path towards enhanced likelihood of success as independent investigators. This approach is intended to remedy the current state of affairs wherein MD, PhDs often are faced with re-starting their research after a hiatus created by the need for clinical training. We anticipate educating physician-scientists to enhance the pipeline of translational investigators, a key goal of the NIMH."
"9306973","Contact PD/PI: FITZGERALD, GARRET A NRSA-Training-001 (234) Core J: Institutional Training Core PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal and significance of the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) TL1 proposal is matched to both a national and societal need to dramatically enhance clinical and translational science (CTS). A key component of this goal is to train the next generation of research leaders of this domain. As expressed throughout our CTSA proposal, Penn is committed ?all-in? to the advancement of translational science, led by the Institute for Translation Medicine and Therapeutics (ITMAT), and within this to achieve the overarching TL1 goal of arming our trainees with the awareness, skills and resources that will position them to excel in the conduct of CTS. Ten pre-doctoral and ten post-doctoral slots are requested to support TL1 Scholars who will enroll in either Certificate (1year) or Master degree (2-3year) programs developed specifically for CTS. The structure of Penn's TL1 builds synergistically upon and integrates seamlessly with Penn's outstanding graduate and post- graduate programs, but recognizes that translational science requires a distinctive, additional knowledge and skill set. Pre-doctoral Scholars will be selected from Penn's PhD, MD/PhD and VMD/PhD research programs and MD, VMD, DMD and MNS clinical training programs. Similarly, post-doctoral Scholars will be selected from Penn's outstanding clinical (MD, VMD, DMD) residents and fellows, and research (PhD) fellows. The primary objectives of the TL1 program are: ? Recruit talented and committed trainees by promoting awareness and individual assessment; ? Develop mentored personalized trainee educational plans targeted both to discipline specific skills and  professional competencies; ? Develop fundamental scientific skills and conduct mentored research in clinical and translational science; ? Advance training programs in emerging areas of translational science; ? Augment aligned professional skill sets of trainees to bolster career progression Scholars are supported by innovative cross-discipline bridges, by creating new knowledge paradigms for translation, by providing outstanding translational research facilities and cores, and through active advising and mentorship ? always with an eye toward the highest ethical standards, the essential tenants of translation, what unites our trainees as colleagues, and what distinguishes our training program and the TL1 award as a singular entity, rather than a mere collection of elements. The TL1 minimizes time-to-degree by effective use of elective units and off-hours online instruction. The TL1 emphasizes the development of individual professional development plans to support diverse career preferences. Importantly, the program is also coupled to a robust diversity and inclusion effort, and a dedicated mentoring program. In summary, Penn's TL1/CTSA approach speaks directly to each of the five key CTSA goals and builds upon existing excellence with rigor, breadth, flexibility and individuality. The educational program is led by talented and experienced Co-Program Directors and the TL1 award is seamlessly integrated with the CTSA-U and KL2 award components. Importantly, the TL1 award is the only dedicated mechanism at Penn to support pre and post-doctoral scholars in CTS.

"9320978","Project Summary: This project represents an interdisciplinary approach to modeling the neural and physiological dynamics of prosocial behavior. Advances in wireless electronics, wearable sensors, computing power, machine learning, signal processing, robotics, information theory, and neuromorphic engineering combined with innovative behavioral design and social neuroanatomical theory make possible the launch of a novel and integrative effort to model the dynamics underlying prosociality. Leveraging the expertise of our highly collaborative cross-functional team we aim to: (1) characterize the physiological (brain/autonomic) signatures of committing a prosocial act; (2) characterize the physiological signatures of experiencing/receiving a prosocial act; (3) quantify the extent to which the physiological dynamics of the recipient, while experiencing a stressful behavioral epoch, predict their social decisions as the actor; and (4) develop the iRat as an ?ethnodroid?, designed to elicit social behaviors through its own behavior while acting as a videographer in close proximity to the rats. Success in achieving all or even a subset of the target capabilities will demonstrate the power of this innovative approach in a virtually limitless array of medical applications. Results of the proposed project will serve as a game-changing springboard for the development of models of coordination and regulation of the brain and body towards efficacious sociality. The work will provide a foundation for future development of techniques to modulate the system for the purpose of restoring balance, regulation, and prosociality towards improved mental and physical health, in addition to interventions aimed towards preventative health. A byproduct of the work will involve technological advances for measuring physiological signals in a relatively unobtrusive fashion and in the development of contextual robotic tools for assessing social behavior. Such advancements will spur additional research programs. Nationally and Internationally, the development and display of prosocial behavior has been associated with more functional family relationships, with stronger mental health, with higher success in school, with greater physical health, and with better empathic responding. Thus, engaging in the proposed research and understanding the predictive dynamics of the system can allow the development of quantitative metrics for diagnosis, treatment and understanding of stress-related mental health disorders ? that modulate or are modulated by ? social dynamics."
"9270049","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of our research is to develop powerful mass spectrometry (MS)-based instrumentation and methods for characterizing the structures of biomolecules. Of particular interest are molecules for which structure determination is intractable by conventional techniques such as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) and large protein complexes. Technological advances such as those proposed here hold great promise for determining molecular mechanisms associated with disease onset and progression for a diverse array of health conditions ranging from cardiovascular disease to cancer.  During the proposal time period we will design and construct a prototype instrument that couples new gas-phase separation capabilities with novel ion fragmentation techniques for the characterization of protein ion structures. Specifically, a compartmentalized drift tube will be coupled to a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. The new instrument will be outfitted with surface-induced dissociation (SID) and metastable atom activated dissociation (MAD) capabilities. The new instrument will enable gas-phase hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments with top-down protein ion structure characterization for specific conformers. The dual fragmentation process will enable the determination of accessible exchange sites for specific protein complexes according to select ion conformations. Finally, the modified drift tube will allow the determination of such sites for structures arising from ion activation within the drft tube device.  The optimized instrument will be used to study a number of peptide sequences associated with the Huntington (htt) protein. These initiatory studies will test the role of the poy- proline region of htt on the aggregation process. Specifically, IMS-HDX-SID/MAD-MS will be used to examine structures of the 17-residue N-terminal region (Nt17), the N-terminal region with poly-glutamine (50 residues), and the full exon 1 model (Nt17Q50P10KK). Here, we will investigate poly-proline binding sites on Nt17 as well as its influence on the types and structures of toxic oligomeric species formed in solution for the different peptides. The successful demonstration of the instrument will not only provide valuable knowledge regarding molecular mechanisms associated with the progression of HD but also will lay the foundation for studies of a wide variety of disease processes."
"9324175","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking remains the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, resulting in death for 1 out of every 2 smokers. While smoking rates have declined to about 18% among the general population, smoking rates still remain disproportionately high among individuals in the criminal justice system (i.e., 70-80%). Despite this high rate of smoking, few interventions have been tested in this population. We were the first to investigate providing 12 weeks of bupropion to a sample of community corrections smokers and then randomizing them to either four sessions of smoking cessation counseling or no counseling to quit. No significant differences were found between our two groups, indicating no additional benefit from more intensive smoking cessation counseling. However, while only 5.8% were abstinent at the 6 month follow-up, abstinence rates were quadrupled among the minority of those who were adherent to medication. Developing interventions to increase medication adherence has been cited as the most important means to reducing disparities; however, the few interventions that have investigated increasing adherence have been psychoeducational only and have yielded poor results. But evidence from our previous work demonstrated that smokers who had previous experience using bupropion had higher subsequent cessation rates and this relationship was mediated by improved medication adherence. Thus, exposure to medication is very likely the critical factor in improving subsequent adherence. The current application proposes a randomized controlled trial to maximize medication adherence with this population of smokers by testing an In Vivo NRT experiential intervention. Participants randomized to the In Vivo intervention will try a nicotine patch in Session 1, try nicotine gum in Session 2, try combination nicotine replacement therapy (cNRT) in Session 3, and discuss any problems with use of cNRT for a quit attempt in Session 4. During each 30-minute session they will discuss their expectations for the medication as well as the In Vivo session effects of these medications on withdrawal symptomatology, including urge to smoke. Between sessions, participants will be given medication to use during that week to make practice quit attempts and to become familiar with the medication. Participants randomized to the control group will receive four 30-minute sessions of standard behavioral counseling. All participants will receive cNRT for 10 weeks. Follow-ups will occur up to six months post-intervention. Primary outcomes include 6 month point prevalence abstinence and abstinence across time as well as medication adherence. If successful, this intervention could provide an easily transportable, novel, and tailored intervention to increase medication adherence and improve smoking cessation rates among smokers in the criminal justice system to reduce health disparities and save lives."
"9314068","Project Summary/Abstract This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development application (K23) will provide protected time for Dr. Pilar Sanjuan to develop a focused program of experimental alcohol research and its application to the study of neural mechanisms of emotion regulation underlying alcohol problems. The aims of the 5-year career development plan are tightly integrated and will increase her knowledge and experience in the areas of 1) collecting and analyzing objective neural (fMRI) and psychophysiological emotion regulation data, 2) utilizing advanced quantitative analysis and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) technology for real-time collection of longitudinal data in the field, and 3) grant writing and professional development. The career development plan includes structured meetings with mentors; five graduate level courses in neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and bioethics; and relevant conferences and workshops to develop substantive expertise and training in quantitative/research methods and uses of statistical software. Specific plans are described to consolidate knowledge gains associated with the career development aims through secondary analyses of extant fMRI and EMA data sets. These activities will culminate in the development of an R01 proposal using preliminary data from the associated study in the third and fourth years of the funding period, thus facilitating the transition of Dr. Sanjuan from clinical psychologist to independent neuroscientist. The proposed study will have 3 components and is sequenced to support career development aims: (1) a laboratory-based design to identify emotion regulation and craving neural networks associated with subjective distress and psychophysiological reactivity during emotion regulation in problem drinkers, (2) a field-based design using EMA to determine the relationship of problem drinking with subjective distress, alcohol craving, and drinking to cope, and (3) a lab-to-field analysis to assess the efficacy of laboratory-based neural activation to predict real life craving and drinking to cope measured via EMA. fMRI and psychophysiological assessments will be used to examine neural underpinnings of emotion regulation and EMA methods will be used to examine the real life emotion regulation to drinking to cope relationship. Dr. Eric Claus will be primary mentor and has recognized expertise in cognitive neuroscience, especially alcohol-related neuroimaging. Drs. J. Scott Tonigan and James Gross will serve as secondary mentors supporting the candidate in selected areas including laboratory study of emotion regulation, grant writing, human subjects protections, and data analysis. Drs. Marsha Bates and Matthew Pearson will serve as consultants to assist Dr. Sanjuan to consolidate knowledge gains in applying psychophysiology and EMA methods and analyses in the context of alcohol research."
"9346921","Successful management of HIV over time demands continued engagement with the healthcare system. South Africa bears a substantial degree of HIV disease burden, with well over 7 million people living with HIV at the end of 2015. In the province of KwaZulu-Natal, approximately 40% of women enrolled in antenatal care are living with HIV, the highest prevalence of HIV among pregnant women in the world. In addition to focusing on preventing mother to child transmission (PMTCT), pregnancy is a unique time to engage women in lifelong HIV care. There are many consequences of failing to remain in HIV care postpartum. For example, women who are not retained in HIV care postpartum may or may not complete infant specific PMTCT behaviors, increasing the risk of transmitting HIV to their infant. Failing to optimize the health of mothers has the potential to lead to increased rates of HIV related orphanhood, the risks of which have been well documented and include greater risk of HIV acquisition, adverse mental health outcomes, and economic insecurity. Women not on treatment risk transmitting HIV to male partners. Lastly, opportunities to provide complementary health care (e.g., contraception) are missed. While some studies have examined adherence to postpartum PMTCT guidelines, few of these focus on continued engagement in HIV care by the mother, and very few of them examine engagement in care beyond six months postpartum. Thus, the goal of this application is to study the trajectory of women living with HIV during the postpartum period in order to identify risk factors for falling out of care, and to learn about facilitators of care that may inform subsequent intervention development. Our study will occur in two phases. In Aim 1, we will collect data from 500 women living with HIV for a period of 2 years after delivery in order to identify who is most likely to remain in or fall out of HIV care during the postpartum period. We will collect HIV RNA and self-reported contact with a health care provider every three months (visit constancy) as co-primary outcomes. Our assessment of barriers and facilitators is informed by a socio-ecological model of HIV care that has been modified based on our prior work with this population. We will then conduct individual, in-depth interviews with a subset of women and their male pregnancy partners from Aim 1 for Aim 2; (1) women who achieved suppressed HIV RNA for at least two consecutive assessments (N=12-15, based on thematic saturation), (2) women who did not achieve suppressed HIV RNA for at least two consecutive assessments (N=12-15, based on thematic saturation), and (3) women who move from suppressed HIV RNA to unsuppressed HIV RNA (or the reverse; N=12-15, based on thematic saturation). We also will interview a subset of the male partners of each of these female participants (N= 12-15 per each group). This project builds upon and existing and successful team of collaborators based in Durban, South Africa, and Boston, MA. The information learned from this project will lead to interventions to better support HIV care among postpartum women, by informing us who is most at risk for falling out of care, and on what factors intervention is needed."
"9265379","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):Abstract This Geroscience training program in the Biology of Aging is an unique cooperative venture of the University of Southern California's Leonard Davis School of Gerontology (USC) and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging (Buck). In 2012, in a truly joint venture, we created the very first dedicated Biology of Aging Ph.D. program in the USA. Students take courses at both institutions (some in a fully interactive, on-line format) and undertake first-year lab rotations at both campuses before selecting a mentor and lab at USC or the Buck. Faculty at the USC Davis School have been training Ph.D. students in the Biology of Aging since 1964, but such students were previously admitted via faculty joint appointments in other schools/departments at USC: over 50 doctoral students have been trained in this way. Similarly, most Buck faculty had prior university appointments where they established extensive Ph.D. training records, and many have continued to train Ph.D.'s from other universities after joining the Buck. This application requests support for four (4) pre-doctoral geroscience students in the USC-Buck Biology of Aging Ph.D. program. We also request support for two (2) post-doctoral geroscience scholars in the biology of aging, specifically at the USC Davis School of Gerontology. This request complements, but does not duplicate, existing funding at either institution. The bi- institutional nature of our USC-Buck Ph.. Program in the Biology of Aging is unique, and allows us to broadly foster a pipeline of investigators engaged in basic and translational research in aging biology throughout California. This collaborative effort has been in existence in various ways for several years (before formal approval in 2012) and has proven to be an important force in advancing the aging research agenda both at USC and at the Buck. Students have access to more than 100 scientists performing aging research, more than 40 focused on the cellular and molecular biology of aging. Students regularly rotate from USC to the Northern California Buck campus and are key to creating a unified research culture and collaborations. Joint classes and seminars are held at both campuses and broadcast using Adobe-Connect, allowing for active participation of all members at each campus, including active Q&A sessions during and after such lectures. Thus, this T32 Geroscience application, while involving two institutions, is in fact a wholly integrated unified program in which the Buck Institute scientists already hold USC faculty appointments and share scientific, educational, and cultural goals. A special feature of our program, that is no provided to students in traditional biochemistry/molecular biology programs, is exposure to the full range of Gerontological specialties: including social, psychological, demographic, economic, and public policy. This occurs through interactions with students and mentors in our highly successful Gerontology Ph.D. program which has long been supported by an NIA training grant, joint seminars, colloquia, and interdisciplinary research projects. Thus, our Biology of Aging Ph.D. students are provided with a truly comprehensive background in aging sciences, and learn to value the relationships between each of these sub-disciplines."
"9325010","Project Summary/Abstract: Networks of small nuclei in the meso and diencephalon (thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, etc.) and their connections to the cortex are critical to understanding consciousness and the onset of sedation during anesthesia. Yet despite their importance for daily survival, the functional connections among nuclei and between nuclei and cortex remain poorly understood. Ultra high field MRI at or above 7 Tesla (7T) provides several benefits for studying deep brain nuclei in humans, including improved image Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and improved contrast (CNR) for susceptibility based structural (SWI) and functional (BOLD) imaging as well as greater T1-dispersion. In addition to problems stemming from their small size, the study of nuclei at 7T is impeded by both static and dynamic variations in the background magnet field (B0) at these locations. These B0 variations cause image artifacts such as ghosting, signals voids, blurring, and geometric distortion. ?B0 order and cannot compensate dynamic ?B0. In the current project, we propose a comprehensive field Innovation: Standard B0 shim coils on commercial MRI scanners can only compensate static up to 2nd monitoring and control system to null high spatial order static and dynamic field variations at 7T. The system will use integrated RF-shim coil elements for maximum shimming and RF efficiency, NMR field probes for field monitoring, and feedback control for real-time shim updating. We are the first to combine these technologies in a unified system capable of largely overcoming the obstacle of ?B0 in 7T MR imaging. Validation: We use the proposed system to (a.) reduce the standard deviation of B0 inhomogeneity on a slice-optimized basis over the whole brain; (b.) stabilize the phase of EPI time-series data; (c.) mitigate ghosting in multi-shot EPI; (d.) image and identify known functional networks between the brainstem and cortex in single subjects; and (e.) test a hypothesis based on animal models about the action of the anesthetic dexmedotomidine on a brainstem circuit involving three specific nuclei. Clinical benefit: By providing a new tool for studying the activity of brainstem nuclei during sedation, this project paves the way for future efforts to improve our understanding of neural circuits, develop safer site-specific anesthetic drugs, and potentially reduce post-operative delirium and cognitive impairment.  Training: I am fortunate to be a part of the exceptionally rich neuroimaging environment at the MGH Martinos Center, one of the premier environments in the world for developing and validating the proposed field control technology. My K99/R00 proposal is designed to help me pivot from a MRI physicist into an independent investigator with enough background in neurobiology to ask clinically significant questions involving deep brain circuits and then develop targeted high-field MRI technology to answer them. To this end, I will require additional training, coursework, and mentorship in the K99 phase focusing on fMRI, neuroscience, physiology, and pharmacology. Structured training will include coursework, tutorials, workshops, neuroimaging seminars, and clinical exposure. The training plan includes the following: 1. Continued MR physics and hardware mentorship from Dr. Lawrence Wald 2. Training in functional MRI data acquisition and analysis, guidance by Drs. Jonathan Polimeni and Marta  Bianciardi on ultra-high field fMRI data, and help from Drs. Randy Buckner and Vitaly Napadow in  functional connectivity analysis. 3. Courses on neuroscience and physiology as well as guided study of brainstem nuclei and associated  circuits in the arousal pathway, led by Drs. Emery Brown, Brian Edlow, and Vitaly Napadow. 4. Coursework in pharmacology and mentorship by Dr. Brown in designing and conducting anesthesia studies  and understanding drug action on the brainstem in the broader context of human physiology. 5. Annual conference attendance including ISMRM and HBM. 6. Participation in the BrainMap neuroimaging seminar series and MGH Radiology Grand Rounds. 7. Career guidance from my primary mentors, including advice on grant-writing and the faculty job search. I am confident that this foundation will enable me to collaborate effectively with neuroscientists and clinicians in neuroimaging studies that depict brainstem anatomy and function in unprecedented detail.  Transition to independence: My strong background in hardware and MRI physics, combined with my training and mentorship plan, will enable the success of this project and my subsequent transition to independence. I will emerge from the K99 phase with a combination of engineering and neurophysiology knowledge that neither of my mentors possesses, allowing me to separate from them and occupy a niche bridging technology and brainstem neurophysiology. Using technology developed and validated in Aims 1, 2 and 3.2, and leveraging early clinical findings of Aim 3.2, I will submit an R01 grant during the R00 phase. The grant is expected to be a more in-depth use of sedative drugs with neuroimaging to probe the role of deep brain nuclei in supporting consciousness. Given the compelling need to better understand these nuclei, and the enormous potential of 7T MRI for enabling this understanding, I anticipate that I will emerge in the R00 phase a highly competitive candidate for faculty positions either at MGH or elsewhere."
"9302323","Project Summary  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder associated with increased suicide risk, educational dropout, unemployment, relationship instability, and the development of other psychiatric disorders. An estimated 3 billion dollars are lost in workforce productivity each year to this disorder. The majority of individuals in the US will experience a traumatic event in their lifetime, yet not all develop PTSD. There is evidence that genetic and epigenetic factors account for 30 ? 70% of these individual differences, but the mechanisms by which they exert this influence are not well understood. In the long run, understanding these mechanisms will greatly inform both how to identify those at risk for certain clusters of PTSD symptoms, and how to tailor individual treatments for the best recovery outcomes.  Previous research has identified negative alterations in mood and cognition, specifically negative alterations in self-cognitions (e.g., shame, perceived worthlessness, incompetence) as a strong predictor of PTSD risk, status, and severity. Negative self-processing is associated with alterations in the neural correlates of self-referential processing (e.g., midline cortical structures) and autobiographical memory systems (e.g., medial temporal lobe structures, MTL). Negative self-cognitions are also associated with altered stress response physiology in the hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal (HPA) axis system. Previous research in the training lab has identified a candidate gene, FKBP5, that is involved in the modulation of HPA axis function and MTL memory systems. Polymorphisms in FKBP5 are also associated with increased risk for PTSD. Additionally, the DNA methylation status of promoters involved in HPA axis regulation, including those for both FKBP5 and the glucocorticoid receptor gene, NR3C1, is known to be associated with PTSD treatment outcome and response.  Using functional magnetic resonance imaging approaches, the present research aims to examine the relationship between traumatic experience and the neural mechanisms of negative self-referential processing, and determine how this relationship changes during PTSD extinction. Also, this proposal aims to better understand how the epigenetic profile of both FKBP5 and NR3C1 predicts, and perhaps changes, in response to recovery from PTSD (and negative self-cognitions) along with its neural correlates. This understanding will help identify individuals who will respond most optimally to a specific empirically based PTSD treatment, Cognitive Processing Therapy, while further connecting genetic biomarkers of risk with neural intermediate phenotypes underlying PTSD symptomatology."
"9276698","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computations based on atomistic models play an increasingly important role in understanding biomolecular systems as well as in drug development. Improvements in these models involve extensions of the underlying functional form of the potential energy as well as additional optimization targeting a wider range of experimental and quantum mechanical data. During the last funding period we made significant advances in the development of empirical force fields (FF) for proteins and lipids, with improvements to the CHARMM additive models and the production of polarizable models for proteins, lipids and ions based on the classical Drude oscillator model. The Drude FF has already been implemented in CHARMM, NAMD, ChemShell QM/MM and the OpenMM GPU suite, and is currently usable for MD simulations on the order of one microsecond as well as with Temperature and Hamiltonian Replica-Exchange sampling methodologies. In the proposed study we will investigate how the explicit treatment of electronic polarization contributes to the structure, dynamics and biological functions of proteins, lipids and ligand binding. In Aim 1 we will apply the polarizable FF to investigate the physical forces driving the folding and conformational properties of peptides and proteins as well as evaluate and further optimize the protein model targeting a range of properties. These will include quantum mechanical data, NMR observables, pKa shifts and aqueous solution data on ionic and polar neutral species representative of biomolecules, including osmotic pressure and density experimental data measured as part of this study. Membrane and protein-membrane complexes will be studied in Aim 2 using the polarizable FF with emphasis on the permeation of small species, translocation of cell penetrating peptides, and interpretation of experimental data from solution and solid state NMR, scattering, voltage-sensitive membrane-bound chromophores and 2D-IR spectroscopy. Information from these calculations will allow for additional optimization of the lipid FF and its extension to unsaturated and anionic lipids, cholesterol and sphingomyelin. Aim 3 will investigate protein-ligand interactions including the forces driving the binding of ions and drug-like molecules. The impact of electronic polarization on these interactions will be investigated with the goal of achieving a more accurate representation of ligand binding. The energy function will be extended to account for charge transfer in the case of ion binding if it is deemed necessary. Additional efforts will include development of an automated parameter optimization utility for drug-like molecules. Upon completion of the proposed study we will have an improved understanding of the physical forces driving protein and membrane structure and dynamics based on a highly optimized state-of-the-art polarizable empirical FF that will be available to the computational chemistry community, including the capability to apply the polarizable model in drug discovery."
"9162624","Abstract Despite the successful progress in the treatment of primary breast cancers resulting in a decrease in cancer mortality rates, metastasis remains the principle cause of death among women afflicted with the disease. Primary tumors consist of heterogeneous populations of cells co-existing as an ecosystem, which evolve over the course of tumor progression to enable certain cells to locally invade and disseminate from the primary site and eventually colonize within a distant organ. At present, it remains unclear how diverse cell populations interact and behave in complex cellular landscapes within tumors and over the course of metastatic progression. My preliminary data demonstrate that noncanonical ?-catenin-independent Wnt signaling through the atypical receptor Ror2 inhibits canonical ?-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling in vivo. Moreover, these different modes of Wnt signaling demarcate distinct tumor cell subpopulations in vivo and mediate key aspects of tumor progression and metastasis. While current data implicate a hyperactive canonical Wnt state within basal-like breast cancers, which exhibit poor prognosis, it is unclear how canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways cooperate within complex cellular landscapes. Within this proposal, I will utilize a transplantable syngeneic TP53 null genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of breast cancer, which by gene expression profiling collectively exhibit characteristics that mirror human breast cancer subtypes, and then extend these studies to human-in-mouse patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. In addition, this proposal leverages unique approaches to actively monitor Wnt pathway changes in vivo using sophisticated Wnt pathway reporters. My preliminary data demonstrate that depletion of Ror2 within multiple TP53 null basal-like models alters the canonical Wnt signaling landscape in vivo, accompanied by changes in cellular adhesion and migration of tumor cells. Further, I have identified a spatiotemporal change in Wnt pathway activation between micro- to macro-metastatic colonization within the lung. It is my central hypothesis that the noncanonical and canonical Wnt pathways are highly integrated within the tumor landscape and coordinately regulate the plasticity of heterogeneous populations of tumor cells within Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBCs) to drive tumor progression and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, I will investigate how Ror2-mediated noncanonical Wnt signaling and canonical Wnt signaling direct states of adhesion and migration, respectively, within the primary and metastatic sites. Furthermore, I will determine how context-dependent changes in the mode of Wnt signaling direct the transition from micro- to macro-metastatic colonization within the lung. Together, these studies will identify novel insights into the balance and spatiotemporal regulation of Wnt pathway dynamics in metastatic progression of breast cancer and have the potential to recognize Ror2 as a therapeutic target of macro-metastatic disease."
"9279146","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the cell cycle, regulatory mechanisms are in place to ensure that the genome is copied and properly inherited by daughter cells. In contrast, little is known about whether regulatory mechanisms are present to ensure inheritance of cytoplasmic organelles. A vital organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) produces virtually all secretory proteins, transmembrane proteins, and proteins of the secretory pathway organelles. The ER is also the birthplace of cellular lipids. Proper inheritance of the ER is thus critical forthe cell.  We have now identified a cell cycle regulatory mechanism, the ER Stress Surveillance pathway or ERSU that ensures the proper inheritance of a functional ER during the cell cycle. ERSU is distinct from any other previously described signaling pathway including the well-known UPR pathway. When ERSU is activated by ER stress, compromised ER can still enter the daughter cell, but cannot anchor at the bud tip and so retracts. We find that ERSU is a novel cell cycle checkpoint that then halts the cell cycle until functional ER is available. In our initil analysis, we have identified critical ERSU pathway components including WSC1, a cell surface signaling protein, and SLT2, a MAP kinase. Deletion of either gene eliminates ERSU: bad ER is now anchored and inherited, but renders the daughter bud non-viable.  We will investigate the ERSU pathway as follows: In AIM I, we will define the ER initiator(s) of ERSU. We have strong preliminary evidence that lipid synthesis enzymes are key to initiation. Interestingly, lipids are known to play a role in many mammalian health-related signaling pathways including asthma, as we have recently reported. In AIM 2, we will dissect the mechanism by which ER inheritance is blocked in response to ER stress. We will use a recently developed live-cell assay that allows us to view ER inheritance while it is under stress. ER entry, anchoring, and the fate of the daughter will be examined both in wild type cells and in our increasing number of ERSU pathway- defective mutants. We also will drill down at the molecular level by examining specific ER-anchoring components for ERSU-induced alteration. In Aim 3, we will for the first time probe the cell cycle boundaries of ERSU and, indeed, of the UPR. We will study the relationship between cell cycle stages and ERSU. For example, can ERSU be induced at any phase of the cell cycle? A failure to regulate ER functional capacity is increasingly recognized as a contributing factor to the pathophysiology of many human diseases, including certain cancers. Thus, knowledge of the cellular mechanism that assures inheritance of a functionally competent ER will be invaluable towards the development of previously unrecognized strategies for therapeutic intervention."

"9281754","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobile genetic elements or transposons are found in the genomes of all organisms. These elements can move via DNA or RNA intermediates. About 50% of the human genome is made up of transposable elements with ~ 2.7% corresponding to DNA-based transposons. Many of these putative transposons or transposase-related genes are uncharacterized. Our previous studies have focused on the P element family of DNA transposons in Drosophila. P element transposase functions as a tetramer, using GTP as a cofactor for transposition. N-terminal domain of the transposase corresponds to a C2CH THAP DNA binding domain, which is a member of a prevalent family of DNA binding domains found exclusively in animal genomes. One THAP gene, called THAP9, is homologous to the Drosophila P element transposase and is present in primates, Xenopus, zebrafish and Ciona, but is absent from rodents. Recent work from our lab has shown that the human and zebrafish THAP9 genes can mobilize the Drosophila and zebrafish P element transposons in human and Drosophila cells. This proposal is focused on understanding what role the human THAP9 gene may play in human embryonic stem cells and how the Drosophila P element transposase protein recognizes and assembles with the transposon ends, donor DNA, target DNA and GTP/Mg2+ to form an active protein-DNA complex. These studies are aimed at gaining mechanistic insights.  Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression in metazoans and is a conduit through which genomic sequence is transferred to proteomic information. Most eukaryotic genes are split and have the potential for alternative splicing, dramatically increasing proteomic diversity. Many human and mouse disease gene mutations affect the splicing process. Splicing silencers are a major type of RNA control element generating tissue- or cell type-specific alternative splicing patterns. Our previous work has focused on characterization of the tissue-specific Drosophila P element pre-mRNA exonic splicing silencer element. Recent work from our group has focused on how the action of the RNA binding proteins, PSI and hrp48. Using this information, we want to identify new Drosophila cellular splicing silencer elements that are controlled by these two splicing factors. The PSI protein also interacts with U1 snRNP and PSI mutant Drosophila strains that abolish this interaction exhibit male courtship behavior defects and altered pre-mRNA splicing of the Drosophila male-specific fruitless pre-mRNA isoforms. We want to investigate how the PSI protein controls fruitless pre-mRNA splicing and how it controls binding of U1 snRNP on the Drosophila transcriptome. U1 snRNP has distinct roles in U1 snRNP binding sites in PCPA (premature cleavage and polyadenylation), splicing at intron 5' splice sites and at potential new splicing silencers."
"9279224","1. ABSTRACT (PROJECT 1) Gene transfer is a potential strategy to treat CF airways disease, yet we still lack answers to important questions to any gene transfer approach. What percentage of CF airway epithelial cells must be targeted and at what expression level is needed to correct relevant ion transport defects? What are the key CF host defense defects? Can we rescue those defects? Will targeting airway surface epithelia in vivo rescue host defense? Clinical CF lung disease? Our program made advances in three areas that allow us to answer these questions. First, we developed a model of CF in pigs. Within months of birth, they develop features of CF lung disease. Second, we discovered that loss of CFTR impairs two key respiratory host defense mechanisms, mucociliary transport (MCT) and antibacterial activity in airway surface liquid (ASL). Impaired CFTR-mediated HCO3- secretion that results in abnormally acidic ASL causes both of these defects. Third, we developed viral vectors: AAV evolved to infect airway epithelia, and GP64-pseudotyped FIV that can deliver CFTR cDNA to airway epithelia. Our preliminary data indicate that these vectors generate airway epithelial HCO3- secretion and correct the acidic ASL pH. Now is the time to answer questions that have nagged the field since we first began thinking about gene therapy. Here we propose three specific aims that will inform strategies for CF gene transfer. Aim 1. What factors determine whether gene transfer to pig and human CF airway epithelia in vitro rescues anion secretion and host defense properties? We will investigate the relationships between transduction and expression data (the % of cells expressing CFTR, the level of CFTR expression) and the physiological consequences. Aim 2. Will CFTR gene transfer to CF airway surface epithelia correct ASL pH, bacterial killing, and MCT defects in vivo? Aim 3. Will gene transfer to airway surface epithelia prevent the airway inflammation, infection, and remodeling associated with early CF lung disease? These data may help us understand the relative importance of the CF host defense defects, will suggest whether targeting surface epithelia has clinical benefit, and will guide future gene transfer approaches."

"9276702","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Since the Institute of Medicine's seminal 2001 publication, Crossing the Quality Chasm, many have written about the 'research-practice gap' - whereby efficacious health innovations consistently fail to be adopted within real world practice settings. Addressing this gap is particularly important in the realm of maternal-child health, where implementing evidence-based practice has been more elusive than in other fields. The purpose of this K24 mid-career award is to apply the principles of dissemination and implementation science to family-based mental health, and to promote the adoption and spread of evidence-based interventions for maternal depression. Over the past nine years, Dr. Silverstein has developed and demonstrated the efficacy of Problem Solving Education (PSE) as a depression prevention strategy for low-income mothers. This K24 outlines a five year plan, whereby Dr. Silverstein will learn the theory and practice of dissemination and implementation science; conduct new research that embeds early implementation studies within a series of ongoing, R01- funded trials of PSE; and expand the reach and scope of his mentoring capacity. Dr. Silverstein's K24 career development activities include structured meetings with a team of experts in the fields of dissemination and implementation science, applied health services research, and child development; a two-year 'fellowship' with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement; and participation in didactic courses focusing on organizational behavior and innovation spread. This career development plan comes at a critical time in the course of Dr. Silverstein's research trajectory. Within the timeframe of the proposed K24, he will complete three depression prevention trials in diverse community-based and hospital settings. This presents a unique opportunity to compare the capacity of each setting to support essential program processes necessary for PSE's implementation and sustainability. The proposed K24 research plan includes 1) a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis to identify performance gaps in PSE's implementation across study settings; 2) a series of qualitative interviews with stakeholders in each setting to provide insight into barriers and facilitators to PSE's implementation; and 3) a pilot test of an implementation strategy to promote fidelity to the PSE model in the neonatal intensive care unit - the site of a recently NICHD-funded multisite trial of PSE. Lastly, Dr. Silverstein will leverage his K24 research plans to expand the scope and reach of his mentoring capacity. His specific mentoring objectives are to assemble interdisciplinary mentoring teams with other researchers across the Boston University campus to guide junior investigators in conducting their work; expand the scope of his mentoring content to encompass dissemination and implementation research; and expand the reach of his mentoring to accommodate additional postdoctoral and junior faculty mentees. Dr. Silverstein's ultimate goal is to conduct - and to guide junior investigators in conducting - research that leads to the sustainable implementation of effective, generalizable programs for children and families."
"9353224","Administrative Core  The Administrative Core of this Program Project will provide centralized managerial leadership to ensure successful coordination among and financial administration of the overall project and each of its components. An overarching goal of this Core is to create an environment that supports progress for the data collection and research projects by defining and managing timelines and work priorities and alleviating the burden of administrative tasks for the leaders of the Research Projects. This Core has two specific aims. The first is to establish optimal coordination among the three individual Research Projects. The second is to ensure smooth financial coordination of all projects and cores. These two aims will be achieved through five sets of activities: (1) establishing regular, effective formal and informal communication, including regular face-to-face and video/teleconference calls, among all of the project investigators; (2) establishing a shared and integrated workplan across all Research Projects and this Core that identifies critical project timelines, milestones, and responsibilities; (3) establishing and ensuring smooth management of sub-contractual and consulting arrangements between University of Michigan and external institutions of the Program Project investigators and consultants; (4) effectively monitoring the budgets and expenditures of the Research Projects and the Core that comprise this P01, communicating financial information among the project investigators, and ensuring fair and efficient resource allocation; and (5) coordinating reporting across the project investigators and activities so that we can provide timely progress reports to NICHD on the status of the P01 as a whole, as well as its Research Projects and Core. The activities of this P01 will be housed within the administrative structure of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) Project, which has developed over almost 50 years to promote interdisciplinary and collaborative data collection and research with the support of numerous federal sponsors.

"9282606","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intermediate neurogenic progenitors (INPs) are a relatively new type of neocortical progenitor cells whose properties, daughter neuron fates, and functions in the regulation of neurogenesis remain unclear. This project will characterize molecular and cellular properties of INPs, define their contribution to cortical areas and layers, and study the regulation of INPs by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The central hypothesis of this project is that INPs regulate not only overall neurogenesis, but also more subtle aspects of neuron differentiation such as regional identity and laminar fate. These studies will be accomplished using a variety of mouse alleles, including a novel genetic lineage tracing system to identify cortical neurons derived from INP cohorts. The first Aim of this project is to characterize the INP transcriptome, and define proliferative and clonal properties of INPs. The second Aim is to determine the contribution of INP daughter neurons to cortical areas, layers, and cell types. The third Aim is to determine how Eomes, a transcription factor that is specifically expressed in INPs, regulates molecular and developmental properties of INPs. The fourth Aim is to determine how fibroblast growth factor signaling affects INP proliferation and differentiation. Together, these focused studies will provide a coherent understanding of INPs, their roles in corticogenesis, and their possible contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders and therapies. Ultimately, our understanding of diseases such as autism and intellectual disability will be advanced, as will our ability to better diagnose and treat these disorders."
"9275983","?    DESCRIPTION:  Diagnostic blood testing is the most ubiquitous clinical procedure in the US, with over 1 billion tests performed annually. The traditional method of blood testing involves performing a venipuncture, transporting samples to a centralized lab, analyzing the samples using large benchtop instruments, and relaying the results to the clinician. This is a labor intensive, time consuming, and expensive process, and unexpected delays often arise due either to difficulties in performing the venipuncture or the time needed to transport and analyze the sample. Particularly in the hospital emergency department (ED), rapid changes in a patient's condition necessitate immediate response, and thus delays can be life threatening. Point of care (PoC) blood testing has emerged as a way to potentially reduce turnaround times, and several devices based on capillary blood draws have achieved commercial translation. However, in comparison to centralized testing, the quantity of available assays remains limited for existing PoC testing, and the accuracy of results obtained with capillary blood remains controversial. Venous blood draws via a venipuncture allows for the collection of a larger volume of blood, yielding more dependable results as the specimen comes directly from the circulation. However to date, no fully automated venous access devices are available, either as independent units, or coupled with POC testing platforms. To address these current limitations, our group is developing a portable, automated device that performs venipuncture and provides quantitative diagnostic results in 15 to 30 minutes at the point of patient care. The portable device will operate by imaging a patient's veins, autonomously introducing a needle into a selected vein, drawing blood into microfluidics chips, and performing on-board blood analysis via an integrated optical imaging platform. A single device will be able to support the throughput of most emergency departments; in this way, the proposed device would serve as an all-in-one portable STAT lab for rapid, automated emergency diagnostics. Outside of emergency medicine, the device could furthermore have strong impact in areas such as ambulatory and outpatient facilities, pediatric and geriatric care, as well as military use."

"9275001","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks to develop and apply innovative bioinformatics methods of analysis to integrate very large publicly available data sets with novel data sets derived from state-of-the-art transcriptomic and metabolomic technologies. In so doing, we plan to generate a powerful systems biology approach to characterize a disease for which there is no cure, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our group has already proven that integrating publicly available datasets can uncover fundamental and unanticipated mechanisms of disease and can enable new diagnostics and treatments for conditions as varied as acute rejection and cancer. The strong relationship between inflammation and metabolism in pulmonary vascular pathobiology will be evaluated through the generation of new integrative omics (IO) datasets. In Aim 1 we will apply big-data analysis techniques to publicly available PAH data sets, most of which are transcriptomic, to develop a common PAH module. We will also incorporate additional public datasets as they become accessible. In Aim 2, we will generate the transcriptomes (by RNA-seq) and the metabolomes (by mass spectrometry) of vascular cells (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts) and inflammatory cells (T cells, B cells and macrophages) isolated from explanted human PAH lungs at the time of lung transplantation and from unused donor control lungs. The IO data sets thus generated will be used to find common aberrant pathways in different vascular and inflammatory cells that could be targeted therapeutically in PAH. Companion studies in rodents will focus on the relationship of the pathways identified to the evolution of PAH. Aim 3 combines data from Aims 1 and 2 and extends our topology--*based impact factor pathway analysis method to account for interactions between metabolites and genes, as well as between pathways. We anticipate, based upon compelling preliminary data, that dominant processes will emerge from these analyses that we can prioritize for hypothesis testing. Animal models that best approximate central PAH pathways implicated in Aims 1 and 2 will be developed to test relevance to human PAH in the final aim. These models, as well as cultured cells from patients with PAH, will be used to explore therapies, beginning with those that repress critical pathways. As these studies extend from unbiased data analyses, we anticipate fresh pathophysiologic insights into PAH, and opportunities to repurpose existing drugs or to design new ones to reverse the disease."
"9273922","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal outlines a 5-year career development plan and research strategy through which the Candidate will bolster her clinical epidemiology expertise with implementation and behavioral science research capacity and develop and pilot an intervention for HIV-1 risk reduction among African HIV-1 serodiscordant couples desiring to conceive a child. Career development plan. As an Epidemiology PhD student, the Candidate became internationally recognized for her work on hormonal contraception and HIV-1 risk and the use of sophisticated statistical methods to address questions at the interface of HIV-1 prevention and reproductive health. The Candidate also used mixed-methods to explore the willingness of HIV-1 serodiscordant couples to use antiretrovirals for HIV-1 prevention and the results from this study have pushed the HIV-1 prevention field to consider how best to implement this new prevention strategy. The Candidate is currently a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Washington working with Dr. Jared Baeten. Dr. Baeten will serve as her primary mentor during K99 phase and a mentoring team with expertise in implementation science, behavioral science, reproductive health, qualitative data analysis, HIV-1 prevention clinical trials operations, antiretroviral adherence measurement and analysis, and biostatistics has been assembled to provide career guidance, ensure the establishment of research independence and the success of the research project. Through coursework, tutorials and seminars during the K99 phase, the Candidate will acquire skills enabling her to design interventions that are efficient and feasible, understand how to conduct monitoring and evaluation to improve intervention effectiveness, and learn from an iterative development process to ensure scalability and maximum applicability. These new skills will allow her to establish a research niche in effectiveness evaluations of reproductive health and HIV-1 prevention interventions. In the short term, her goals are to address questions aiming to reduce HIV-1 risk when couples desire fertility, how pregnancy or hormonal contraception may influence HIV-1 risk and/or disease progression, or best practices to promote long term HIV-1 risk reduction, including the implementation of antiretrovirals for HIV-1 prevention. Her long term goals are to pursue studies of multi-purpose prevention tools that have high efficacy to prevent pregnancy and HIV-1 infection. An enriching institutional environment at the Department of Global Health and the International Clinical Research Center within the University of Washington will support her career advancement. Research plan. There is a critical need for a risk reduction intervention for HIV-1 serodiscordant couples with fertility desires that is relevant for low-resource settings. Heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant partnerships, i.e. where one partner is HIV-1 infected and the other uninfected, face a difficult dilemma when considering their desire to have children: forego condom use and attempt to conceive but risk HIV-1 transmission or continue condom use and relinquish childbearing desires. Currently, many African couples choose to conceive despite the HIV-1 transmission risk and without knowledge of methods to reduce their HIV-1 risk. Antiretrovirals, when used as antiretroviral treatment (ART) by HIV-1 infected partners to suppress HIV-1 viral levels or as pre- exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by HIV-1 uninfected partners, provide substantial (75-96%) protection against HIV-1 infection. These medications could form the cornerstone for a risk reduction intervention that would also include restricting unprotected sex to the most fertile days and the continued use of condoms during less fertile periods and once pregnancy is achieved. Through the proposed K99 period, the Candidate and her team will use existing data to 1) develop a pregnancy prediction model and scorecard to identify HIV-1 serodiscordant couples most likely to become pregnant and 2) estimate the efficacy of PrEP and ART to reduce HIV-1 transmission among HIV-1 serodiscordant couples with high pregnancy likelihood. Building on results from the K99 aims, in the R00 phase the Candidate and her team will 1) conduct mixed-methods data collection among participants in an established longitudinal cohort to determine the components of a feasible and accessible safer conception intervention and 2) design and pilot the new safer conception intervention among 40 research-nave HIV-1 serodiscordant couples. The final result of this research will be a coordinated, client- centered, evidence-based, risk reduction intervention to minimize the HIV-1 risk that couples face during peri- conception periods."
"9335452","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vast majority of pharmacogenomic studies have been conducted on exclusively European decent populations, thereby precluding the discovery and translation of African American specific genetic variation into precision medicine. This imbalance in discovery and translational science has hindered our ability to deliver precision medicine to 1 in 7 Americans. Currently several academic medical institutions are incorporating Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines into practice. Without accounting for new variants found exclusively in African Americans, clinical recommendations based solely on genetic biomarkers found in European populations could result in misclassification of drug response in African Americans. Furthermore, there are several well-established, clinically actionable pharmacogenomic associations (such as the antiplatelet agent, Clopidogrel) that completely lack discovery efforts in African Americans. Without both discovery and translational efforts in African Americans, precision medicine for all will not be a reality. A such, we formed a Transdisciplinary Collaborative Center (TCC) dubbed ACCOuNT (African American Cardiovascular pharmacogenetic Consortium) to discover novel genetic variants in African Americans related to clinically actionable cardiovascular phenotypes and to incorporating African American specific SNPs into clinical recommendations, which can be delivered to physicians at the point of care. We have partnered with academic institutions, patient organizations, and African American community leaders in both Chicago and in the District of Columbia (DC) to developed our focused effort in precision medicine. The TCC will consist of four cores (Administrative, Consortium, Implementation, and Data Analysis and Harmonization) as well as two research projects focused on discovery and translation of genetic findings. The primary aims of this proposal are: 1) Establish an African Ancestry pharmacogenomics research network to facilitate genomic research and to establish a public genomics resource for continued translational research; 2) Establish mechanisms to support implementation, diffusion, and continuing evaluation and improvement of precision medicine in African Americans; and 3) Engage community leaders in African American pharmacogenomic research. Our proposed TCC will be focused on closing this gap in precision medicine by undertaking discovery projects centering on SNP discovery in African Americans and clinical translational initiatives that will assess the impact of genetic biomarkers on clinical outcomes in  African Americans in an inpatient setting. This model will establish a pipeline in which basic sciences discovery can pass quickly into clinical translational studies, which will in turn supply the needed clinical outcomes for implementation. We have incorporated patient centered approaches to each of these initiatives and have begun to work within African American communities on the design, recruitment and dissemination of this important work."
"9296085","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last ten years there has been a remarkable renaissance in vitamin D research. Two key concepts have underpinned this renewed interest in the health benefits of vitamin D. First is the continuing debate on the worldwide prevalence of vitamin D-insufficiency, and how optimal vitamin D status can be safely achieved through conventional exposure to sunlight and dietary intake. Second is the potential for vitamin D to promote health benefits beyond its classical effects on the skeleton. Following a recent data review, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has issued statements aimed at addressing some of the key questions concerning our new perspective on vitamin D and human health. The Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin D for all age groups was elevated based on bone responses to vitamin D. However, the IOM report also recognized the need for further research to better define 'non-classical' health benefits of vitamin D. The long-term impact of these recommendations is crucially dependent on one question - how does one define vitamin D-sufficiency and -insufficiency? The proposed project describes a new paradigm for quantifying optimal vitamin D and its relation to human health. The overall aim is to demonstrate that vitamin D activity is not simply defined by total serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) but instead depends on the bioavailability of this metabolite to target cells and its subsequent conversion to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) via the enzyme 1?-hydroxylase (CYP27B1). The proposal hypothesizes that the ability of 25D to access target cells is influenced by its association with the serum vitamin D binding protein (DBP), with 'free' rather than 'DBP-bound' 25D being the bioactive form of this metabolite. The overall objective of the proposal will be to investigate the impact of DBP on the bioactivity of 25D using both mouse and human models. Studies using transgenic, knockout, and humanized mice will investigate how variations in the concentration and vitamin D metabolite binding affinity of DBP affect the response of these mice to 25D and 1,25D under conditions of vitamin D-sufficiency and -deficiency. Data from these experiments will then be related to studies in humans, where DBP concentration and binding affinity are strongly influenced by genetic variations in the DBP gene. Human studies will incorporate analysis of DBP and free 25D/1,25D in a large patient cohort with multiple measures of vitamin D function, but will also involve a pilot supplementation study utilizing parental vitamin D or 25D. These analyses will employ a new mathematical algorithm for determining serum free 25D and 1,25D and will use novel assay technology to physically measure serum levels of free 25D. This model not only puts forward a new paradigm for defining optimal vitamin D status but also aims to highlight a more 'personalized' perspective on vitamin D health that will incorporate both classical and non-classical actions of vitamin D.   ."
"9328164","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    My long-term career goal is to elucidate the cellular and molecular basis governing the maintenance and function of neural circuits under physiological and pathological conditions. To understand how the nervous system copes with injury thus offers a unique opportunity to tap into these questions and defines the objective of this proposal-to identify and delineate novel factors regulating axon regeneration, and develop effective strategies to promote axon regeneration based on these new targets. To lay a solid foundation for achieving this goal, I joined the laboratory of Dr. Yuh Nung Jan, a world-renowned pioneer in studying neural circuits assembly and function. I initiated my postdoctoral research by establishing a Drosophila sensory neuron injury model that resembles the mammalian injury model at the phenotypical and molecular level, to screen for novel regulators of axon regeneration. My studies have already led to the identification of the RNA processing enzyme Rtca as an inhibitory factor for axon regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Successful completion of the proposed studies will validate the novel concept of targeting the Rtca pathway in treating neural injury and neurodegenerative diseases, and spur my future independent research to uncover the repertoire of molecules governing regeneration.  Damage to the adult CNS, such as spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to persistent deficits due to the inability of mature axons to regenerate after injury. Under pathological situations such as multiple sclerosis (MS), the second most common neurological disorder leading to disability in young adults, the failure of damaged axons to regenerate contributes to non-reversible neurologic dysfunction. Currently, only a few therapies with limited efficacy are available, highlighting the urgent need to identify novel molecular targets and develop targeted therapies. To this end, I have focused my postdoctoral research on building a platform to take advantages of the power of fly genetics in discovering novel factors together with the mammalian injury model to study their homologs and functional recovery. I propose two directions to go after the regeneration regulators: in specific aim 1, I will determine the interplay between axon degeneration and regeneration, test the hypothesis that perturbing degeneration delays regeneration; in specific aims 2 and 3, I will determine the mechanisms underlying dRtca/Rtca's regulation on axon regeneration using fly and mouse injury models, and test the hypothesis that removal of dRtca/Rtca enhances circuit reassembly and functional recovery.  My extensive study has already resulted in a recent first author publication in Genes and Development in 2012 (cover article), with two co-first author papers in revision in Neuron and Nat Neurosci. I have generated many novel reagents (e.g. the Drosophila injury model, transgenic and knockout fly strains, and knockout mice), and assembled an extraordinary advisory team consisting of co-mentors (Dr. Michael S. Beattie, Professor in Residence of Neurological Surgery at UCSF, Director of Research of UCSF Brain and Spinal Injury Center (BASIC); Dr. Jacqueline C. Bresnahan, Professor of Neurological Surgery at UCSF and President of the National Neurotrauma Society), and consultant (Dr. Jonathan S. Weissman, Professor of Cellular Pharmacology and Biochemistry at UCSF, an HHMI investigator and a member of the National Academy of Science). I have also established close collaborations with members of the BASIC at UCSF, which specializes in animal models of brain and spinal cord injury. The culture of BASIC is highly collaborative, and includes both basic and clinical research projects in neurotrauma. I am therefore uniquely poised to undertake the novel studies proposed in this application with great translational potential.  Research proposed in my K99 mentored phase (year 1 and 2) is mainly focused on studying the regulation of axon regeneration by degeneration and dRtca in flies, as well as establishing the mice injury model. I will carry out these proposed experiments with the supervision of Dr. Yuh Nung Jan and support from my advisory team. In the R00 independent phase (year 3 to 5), I will focus on characterizing the roles of four new factors, which came out from my degeneration screen, in modulating regeneration in flies, as well as studying the function of Rtca in regulating regeneration in mice, with the continual support from my advisory/collaborative team. At the completion of this project I expect to have (1) established mechanistic links between axon degeneration and regeneration, (2) determined the molecular mechanisms of how removal of dRtca/Rtca promotes CNS axon regeneration in flies and mice, and (3) identified additional new regulators of axon degeneration/regeneration.  My proposed research is highly innovative because our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms is still far from complete for axon degeneration/regeneration, and my studies will bring in new approaches to systematically uncover novel regulators, with the potential to provide new therapeutic targets. With a Ph.D. background in developmental neurobiology, and postdoctoral training in bioinformatics, mouse genetics and surgery, I possess a unique skillset and hence am in a highly advantageous position to accomplish the proposed novel studies. Dr. Jan has extended his full support towards my career goals and has encouraged me to take these projects to my independent lab in the future. The proposed studies build logically on my prior and ongoing works as evidenced by my recent publication, and will undoubtedly prepare me to lead a novel and strong independent research program in the near future."
"9274968","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career Development Plan: I have a background in evidence review as well as in epidemiology of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) associated musculoskeletal complications, experience in the assessment of physical performance through my work on a study of exercise in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, and experience in designing and analyzing pilot trials in CKD patients to characterize their musculoskeletal health. In this K23 I will prospectively study muscle loss (sarcopenia) in a cohort study in order to identify its clinical indicators and biomarkers in patients new to dialysis. I will perform assessments in a prospective cohort study and augment this hands-on-training with advanced coursework in epidemiology and biostatistics techniques, basic tools for biomarker measurements and clinical trial design. I will attend national meetings on Musculoskeletal Health and Nephrology. I have a multidisciplinary mentoring team made of scientists in musculoskeletal physiology, muscle mass and physical performance assessment, biomarkers and in the conduct of clinical trials in CKD. Dr. Sharon Moe, my primary mentor has an enviable track record of successfully mentoring junior faculty in nephrology and extramural support in translational research in musculoskeletal disease in CKD. Indiana University (IU) has a wealth of resources for research in this field: 1) investigators in the field of musculoskeletal disease i multiple departments and schools 2) specialized graduate level courses and journal clubs, and 3) the availability of high quality equipment and facilities. I have a commitment from the Chairman of the Department to protect 75% of my time for research career. Research Plan Summary: Dialysis patients have significant sarcopenia which is associated with increased hospitalizations and mortality. My global hypothesis is that patients undergoing dialysis have impaired skeletal muscle regeneration that leads to progressive mobility impairment and/or mortality. I define progressive mobility impairment as a decrease in gait speed of 0.1 m/s over 1 year. To test this, I will utilize data from 100 patients enrolled in the IU cohort of an ongoing, multi-center study of incident dialysis patients, called LUCID. In Aim 1, I will evaluate muscle mass and strength measures that identify the subset of dialysis patients that develop progressive mobility impairment and key covariates and confounders of that relationship. In Aim 2, I will study the relationship between circulating biomarkers of skeletal muscle regeneration and i) sarcopenia and ii) progressive mobility impairment. In Aim 3 I will utilize the entire US LUCID cohort (n=750) and determine whether levels of circulating markers of muscle regeneration increase the ability to predict mortality in incident dialysis patients, when combined with known risk factors. These translational research studies will enhance my understanding of the pathophysiology of sarcopenia and quantify its clinical changes to identify patients that will benefit from future interventional trials, targeting sarcopenia that I plan to conduct. My long ter goal is to improve musculoskeletal health in patients with kidney disease."

"9279280","Abstract  The neural circuitry underlying premonitory urge and tic suppression is particularly important given the role of voluntary tic control in improved quality of life and enhanced effectiveness of empirically supported behavioral treatments such as Habit Reversal Training (HRT) for individuals with Chronic Tic Disorders (CTDs), including those with Tourette's Syndrome. Despite a building research base, the etiology and pathophysiology of CTDs remain poorly understood, with existing findings confounded by small sample sizes, developmental effects due to wide age range, medication usage, and uncontrolled psychiatric comorbidity. In the current project, we propose to apply an innovative approach (mobile brain/body imaging [MoBI] to characterizing the neural substrates underlying premonitory urge and tic suppression in CTDs. The MoBI approach involves the simultaneous recording and integration of high-definition motion capture video, cortical activity (electroencephalography; EEG) and muscle movements (electromyography; EMG). Use of this leading edge technology will advance our understanding of the neural substrates underlying urge suppression and may allow identification of putative biomarkers for premonitory urge and tic suppression. The current study proposes to use the MoBI approach on a sample of 175 children aged 8-12 years old, 125 with CTDs and 50 age-matched healthy control (HC) peers. We will use several paradigms to model the neural substrates underlying voluntary and involuntary movements and test whether CTDs involve quantitative or qualitative deviation in motor network circuitry relative to HC peers. Successful application of the MoBI approach to the problem of discovering and testing brain-based biomarkers for CTD is highly innovative in the context of current research, and also has clear potential for advancing clinical CTD research and practice."
"9290966","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD) is caused by deleterious mutations in GBA1/Gba1 and the resultant defective activity of acid ?-glucosidase (GCase). nGD is a prototype lysosomal storage disease (LSD) that displays generalized neuronal death in central nerve system (CNS). Effective therapeutic interventions have had major effects on the CNS manifestations of nGD due to i) the inability of GCase to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB), ii) the rapid denaturation of GCase at serum pH, and iii) the inability f the membrane associated GCase expressed at wild-type levels in cells to be secreted in sufficient amounts for metabolic cross- correction. We identified two receptor-binding peptides (Rp) from apolipoprotein E that can facilitate protein delivery across the BBB and into many CNS cell types via the low-density lipoprotein receptor superfamily (LDLRf). Also, we demonstrated the therapeutic potential with CNS metabolic correction and concordant normalization of neurological deficits in an enzyme-deficient LSD murine model after long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)-mediated gene therapy using a lentiviral vector (LV). Importantly, we show that carboxy terminal addition of the myc-tag to GCase does not alter the enzyme's structure, activity or stability. Moreover, we showed for the first time that megakaryocytes are capable of over-producing lysosomal enzymes and packaging them into platelets for cross-correction of enzyme-deficient cells. Finally, we developed viable nGD mouse models that mimic acute and chronic human nGD. Based on these strong preliminary data and the great unmet medical need for CNS therapy in nGD, we will test the hypothesis that fusion of Rp to GCase will enable the modified GCase to transcytose into the CNS with wide CNS cell distribution via the LDLRf, so that synergistic CNS benefits can be achieved from continuous production of GCase-Rp through protective depots, i.e., platelets and macrophages. The overall goal of the project is to develop a novel therapeutic approach utilizing LDLRf-mediated transcytosis for protein delivery across the BBB via LV- mediated gene transfer into HSC with lineage-restricted expression in protective depots for the treatment of the CNS manifestations and essential correction of the visceral disease in nGD. We will assess various GCase-Rp for LDLRf-mediated CNS delivery, develop lineage-restricted expression systems for sustained and targeted protein generation via protective depots, and evaluate protein bio-distribution and therapeutic benefits in nGD mouse models. This project aims at a major unmet medical need for efficient BBB transcytosis systems with broad distribution of the therapeutic macromolecules to many CNS cell types for the treatment of a wide variety of CNS diseases. The approaches developed in the studies have general and significant applicability to neurodegenerative diseases including other LSDs, and Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases."
"9384648","Abstract Regulatory T cells (Tregs) express FOXP3, a transcription factor encoded on the X-chromosome. Tregs are critical to prevent autoimmunity and maintain immune homeostasis and tolerance. Nave CD4+ T cells can be converted into ?induced? Tregs (iTregs) in culture, but compared to endogenously generated Tregs, iTregs rapidly lose expression of Foxp3 upon cell division or after adoptive transfer. The stability of Foxp3 expression has been linked to the DNA methylation status of an intronic enhancer, Foxp3 CNS2: endogenously generated Tregs are almost fully unmethylated at CNS2, whereas nave CD4+ T cells and iTregs activated in vitro with TGF? plus retinoic acid (RA) are almost fully methylated. We discovered several years ago that TET-family dioxygenases alter DNA modification status by oxidizing 5- methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). 5hmC can be further oxidized by TET proteins to 5- formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). All three oxidized methylcytosines interfere with the main- tenance function of DNA methyltransferase 1, thus effecting ?passive? replication-dependent DNA demethy- lation during the course of cell division. Additionally, the DNA repair enzyme thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) can excise 5fC and 5caC, which are then replaced with unmodified C through base excision repair. We have recently shown that TET enzymes promote CNS2 demethylation in Tregs. By activating nave T cells in the presence of TGF?, RA and the TET activator Vitamin C, we can generate exceptionally stable human and mouse iTregs, in which the stability of Foxp3 expression appears equivalent to that of endogenous Tregs. Vitamin C promotes TET-mediated CNS2 demethylation, whereas RA increases Foxp3 stability without CNS2 demethylation. Our goal in this application is to investigate the role of TET methylcytosine oxidases in T cell lineage specification at a molecular and kinetic level, with a focus on iTreg differentiation. Using state-of-the-art technologies and essential reagents developed in our laboratory, we will explore the role of TET proteins at early and later stages of iTreg differentiation (Aim 1); investigate the importance of TDG in DNA demethylation during iTreg cell differentiation (Aim 2); and define the roles of RA and Vitamin C in maintaining Foxp3 stability in dividing iTregs (Aim 3). Our studies have strong clinical relevance, since iTreg cells generated in culture have the potential to be useful in transplant medicine and to cure autoimmune disease. Our proposed studies will enhance our understanding of the very fundamental question of how DNA modification regulates gene transcription, particularly with respect to the stability of expression of lineage- determining transcription factors, which in turn determines the plasticity of cellular lineages. Potentially, our data will also help identify novel candidates for therapeutic intervention in immune-related disorders, including cancer immunotherapy, transplant rejection and autoimmune disease."
"9334217","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 20 million Americans and contributes to sarcopenia, which includes muscle loss (atrophy), muscle weakness and/or reduced mobility. Sarcopenia is clinically important as it contributes to increased fall risk, morbidity and mortality. Although, the pathophysiology of sarcopenia in CKD remains unknown, sarcopenia in CKD is likely due to aberrant signaling for muscle metabolism, catabolism, and regeneration. We propose that central components of these to sarcopenic alterations are impaired skeletal muscle mitochondria and increased myostatin. The overall goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that exercise or myostatin blocking therapy prevents atrophy, but exercise is needed to improve skeletal muscle metabolism and function in CKD. This goal will be accomplished through a combination of pre- clinical experiments using our established model of progressive CKD (the Cy/+ rat), pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions. We will assess mitochondrial function using high resolution respirometry, aerobic capacity via VO2max assessment, muscle strength and fatigue assessed by electrical stimulation and maximal voluntary grip strength, muscle mass, and overall physical activity levels. The interdisciplinary mentoring team and I are perfectly positioned to undertake this translational work based on our clinical and preclinical expertise in CKD, myostatin and skeletal muscle. In aim 1 we will assess the efficacy of moderate and high intensity AEROBIC exercise in improving skeletal muscle metabolism and aerobic capacity in CKD rats. In aim 2, we will assess the efficacy of moderate and high intensity RESISTANCE training on skeletal muscle size and strength in CKD rats. In aim 3 we will assess the efficacy of myostatin blocking therapy compared to optimal exercise in increasing muscle mass, muscle metabolism and function. The current proposal will develop a number of skills required to be a successful, independent translational research. While my long term goal is patient implementation, building a solid basic science skill set will allow for parallel studies that provide a mechanistic understanding. If these studies show efficacy in benefiting skeletal muscle function and/or mass, these treatments could be rapidly translated into the clinical setting."
"9330159","ABSTRACT The aim of this proposal is to develop an atomic-level understanding of the mechanism of lactose/H+ symport by the lactose permease of Escherichia coli (LacY), an important model for the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS), the largest family of membrane transport proteins. The MFS contains many members that have clinical significance such as the vesicular monoamine transporter, as well as the GLUTs, which facilitate glucose transport into many different cells in the body. Like channels and ABC transporters, symporters are also highly relevant to human health (e.g. transport across epithelia, synaptic function) and disease (e.g. depression, epilepsy, diabetes, multidrug resistance). Also notable, at least two of the most widely used pharmaceuticals in the world [serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and gastric proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)] are targeted to membrane transport proteins. Also important, the innovative methods developed by the PI to study LacY have been applied directly to such important human membrane proteins as GLUT1 and G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). However, despite a number of structures of MFS members, including 7 of LacY, the mechanism of this dynamic protein is not completely understood. It has been demonstrated that sugar binding to highly dynamic protonated LacY triggers a global conformational change in which sugar- and H+-binding sites gain alternating access to either side of the membrane. Sugar binding and dissociation drive this conformational change through an induced-fit mechanism, while the proton electrochemical gradient enhances the rate of deprotonation. Therefore, LacY behaves much like an enzyme except that the transition state(s) involves the protein rather than the substrate. X-ray structures of LacY inward- and almost occluded outward-facing conformations provide the structural basis for studying the alternating access mechanism. The alternating access mechanism has been documented unequivocally by applying pre-steady state kinetics, as well as multiple biochemical and spectroscopic approaches pioneered in this laboratory, and by using kinetic data obtained in real time for several steps in the transport cycle. Thirty-one Camelid nanobodies now in our possession allow stabilization of LacY in different intermediate states that will provide an in-depth understanding of structural changes underlying the symport mechanism. It should be emphasized that the approaches and the methodologies described here for LacY are already being applied to other membrane transport proteins and can be applied to membrane proteins in general."
"9360651","Abstract C. difficile infection (CDI) is the most common infection patients develop while admitted to hospitals, resulting in an annual three billion dollar cost to the US healthcare system. This bacterial infection of the colon is created by the use of antibiotics which kill commensal bacteria, creating an environment in the large intestine which is conducive to the development of CDI. The conventional treatment for most cases of CDI remains metronidazole or vancomycin, two antibiotics which like all other antibiotics also have indiscriminate effects on the bacteria of the gut. These antibiotics are associated with recurrence rates of CDI ranging from 15-25% following the initial episode of CDI. While the incidence of CDI has increased, and as recurrence rates for CDI have continued to rise, the incidence of life threatening forms of CDI now occur in up to 10% of patients with this infection. While this disease has evolved, the conventional therapies available for CDI have remained virtually unchanged for the previous 20 years. The key to improving CDI treatment is to avoid the disturbances to the bacterial component of the microbiome imposed by conventional antibiotics. Our group has published the first and only paper describing the successful in vitro application of bacteriostatic antisense antibiotics targeting C. difficile. Our previous work utilized dequalinium analogues as cationic bola-amphiphiles (CABs) which are used to complex with and deliver antisense phosphorothioate gapmers into C. difficile to inhibit translation of mRNAs important for bacterial survival. The objective of this study is to develop a new class of antibiotics which are antisense in their action, targeting C. difficile while limiting effects on other bacteria. This current study proposal will accomplish this goal through two aims which use methods well established from the scientific community and quite familiar to our group. In our first aim, our multidisciplinary team will synthesize new CABs which have never been described in the literature and which are rationally designed based upon our team of experts who have a rich experience with nanocarriers. We will develop CABs which are excellent at complexing with our antisense gapmers, which are not toxic to colonocytes and which have minimal to no effect on non-difficile bacteria. In our second aim, we will then develop CAB-gapmer nanocomplexes against C. difficile, with the goal of creating antisense antibiotics which are bacteriostatic against C. difficile in vitro, which have little to no effect on other gut bacteria as tested in vitro, and which have no toxicity to colonocytes. Our overall goal is to create a group of well-characterized antisense nanocomplexes which have been thoroughly tested in vitro, allowing for their subsequent testing in CDI animal models following the conclusion of this project."
"9309878","Every year more than 20% (55 million) of the adult American population suffers from major depression. (MDD). While effective treatments are available, depression remains under-diagnosed and under-treated, in part due to cost and availability of treatment. In the current application in response to NIMH NOT-14-007 we propose a clinical trial to study potential novel biomarkers of depression treatment response rather than to test efficacy of an efficient, cost-effective form of computer-augmented cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) which already has proven efficacy. We present pilot data supporting CBT-induced improvements in functional connectivity and task-induced activation in MDD. We also have found in previous work that this model of CCBT, known as Good Days Ahead (GDA), has efficacy for MDD that is not inferior to conventional individual CBT therapy across 8 and 16 weeks of treatment, despite reducing average therapist contact from 16 hours to less than 5 hours. We now propose that this new variation of cognitive therapy, which substitutes intensive, computer- administered skills training for hours of therapist contact, will engage the same brain targets we have previously seen with CBT. We hypothesize that it is rehearsal time during which an individual actively engages in corrective skills training that ?mends? the brain connectivity and promotes recovery. We will recruit a total of 60 patients with MDD and 40 matched comparison healthy participants from the outpatient clinics of the Hospitals of the University of Pennsylvania. To take into account the impact of nonspecific factors, half of the MDD participants will be randomized to receive CCBT immediately after baseline assessments and half will first receive 8 weeks of Depression Care Management (DCM) (a clinically responsible alternative to a traditional wait-list control group that includes support and clinical management) before subsequently receiving CCBT. Aim 1: Compare baseline resting state functional connectivity and task-induced activity between MDD and controls. Aim 2: Assess CCBT treatment effects on resting state functional connectivity and task- induced activation in MDD comparing CCBT-treated participants to DCM ?treated participants. Exploratory Aim: 1a:Predict the effects of baseline imaging measures on treatment outcomes; 1b: Predict the effects of baseline executive function on treatment outcomes."

"9281849","ABSTRACT Project 1 Recent evidence supports the potential of adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8)-mediated liver-directed gene therapy as an effective therapeutic intervention for a variety of metabolic disorders. The long-term objective of this project focuses on the clinical development of AAV8 vector-mediated gene transfer for the treatment of two Mendelian disorders of lipid metabolism with limited therapeutic options: homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) and familial lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency (FLD). HoFH is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the LDL receptor and characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia, poor response to traditional therapies, and development of severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in childhood or adolescence. FLD is an autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations of the gene encoding for LCAT, an enzyme that esterifies free cholesterol carried by lipoproteins to cholesteryl ester. FLD patients are characterized by markedly low plasma HDL-C and increased plasma FC levels. FLD patients develop chronic renal dysfunction that usually progresses to renal failure by the 4th decade of life. The liver is the primary site of expression of both the LDL receptor and LCAT. Thus, the development of liver-directed gene therapy represents a viable therapeutic approach to both of these diseases. A first generation AAV8 clinical candidate for the treatment of hoFH was identified during the previous cycle of this P01. As a result of the extensive body of work performed, including efficacy and pre-clinical IND-enabling studies, Project 1 is now ideally positioned to initiate clinical studies. In Specific Aim 1, we will perform a phase 1, single ascending dose study in hoFH patients to assess safety of the AAV8-based vector encoding the LDL receptor that has been previously developed by our team. Assessment of safety will include a careful follow-up of laboratory parameters (including immunologic responses) and reported adverse events. In Specific Aim 2, we will measure LDL-C and other lipid parameters before and up to 1 year after the administration of the vector, and conduct lipoprotein kinetic studies before and 3 months after the administration of the vector to directly measure changes in apoB clearance in vivo. The development of an AAV8 vector-mediated gene therapy for FLD will follow a similar approach. Project 2 of the current P01 demonstrated that hepatic expression of human LCAT in FLD mice was able to restore a normal lipid phenotype. In this next cycle, Project 2 will extend this work to optimize the LCAT transgene and establish a mouse model of FLD renal disease to test the effect of AAV8-mediated LCAT gene transfer on renal function. Once a clinical candidate vector is identified by Project 2, we will conduct a study in a murine model of FLD to determine the minimal effective dose of the clinical candidate vector (Specific Aim 3), and the necessary IND-enabling studies in mice and NHP models (Specific Aim 4). Our goal is to be in a position to initiate a clinical trial of an AAV8-based vector encoding LCAT in patients with FLD by the end of the funding cycle."

"9306193","SUMMARY Basic Science Core II (BSCII) focuses on in vivo and translational aspects of basic neuroscience and encompasses animal models and their behavioral testing, histology, microscopy, neuropathology, and neuronal functional studies. The BSCII assists investigators with animal models and behavioral testing allowing them to overcome the challenges of developing and characterizing new rodent models, particularly with behavioral phenotypes, which may be outside their areas of expertise. The core offers several models of neuroAIDS, including immunodeficient mouse models of HIV encephalopathy, in vivo HIV-1 infection using humanized mice, transgenic models including the HIV Tg26 transgenic mouse and the GFAP-Tat Tet-inducible transgenic mouse, inducible and tissue specific transgenic, knockdown, or knockout models, cell transplantation models, viral vector delivery, etc. Expertise in behavioral testing for cognitive changes in learning and memory, as well as peripheral neuropathies are provided. Expertise in the core includes experience in breeding and phenotyping of neurological models, and neurobehavioral testing which can be particularly challenging for investigators without prior experience. Assistance is also provided with histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of human autopsy and biopsy clinical samples from patients with neurological disorders, including AIDs, PML, neurodegenerative diseases, and CNS neoplasia, tissues harvested from experimental animal models, cell cultures and access to neuropathological consultation. The core provides study design and data interpretation, and microscopy services, including Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) accessioning of tissue samples and nucleic acid extraction for downstream molecular biological applications, quantitative microscopy and imaging, and data analysis. We also offer state-of-the-art microelectrode array (MEA) studies for neuronal function in cell culture and whole animal systems. A key component of the core is to provide the necessary training to the investigators and their staff to gain the proficiency needed to independently conduct any of the routine core functions. These services assist investigators in the neuroAIDS community with an array of histopathological and in vivo translational resources."
"9350738","Overall ? Project Summary  Despite tremendous advances in our understanding of cancer pathogenesis, the treatment of individual patients with either conventional chemotherapy or targeted agents remains highly empiric. Current efforts to predict drug efficacy are generally focused on genetic and transcriptional markers of pathway activation or drug binding, such as resistance mutations that sterically hinder small molecule binding or activate parallel or orthogonal signaling pathways. These markers exist in a very small fraction of all cancers, such that most patients are treated with little or no understanding of whether they will respond to an individual therapy. This results in many patients receiving ineffective and/or unnecessarily toxic therapies. There is a desperate need to change this paradigm. The ideal for characterizing therapeutic sensitivity would allow for: real-time decision making, identification of rare subpopulations with therapeutic resistance, analysis of very small samples (e.g. MRD), and maintains viability individual cells for downstream assays to characterize phenotypic, genotypic, transcriptional and other determinants of sensitivity. The overall goal of our U54 application is to address this need using new strategies for predicting therapeutic response in which paired phenotypic and genomic properties are measured at the single-cell level. Phenotypic properties will include both physical parameters (e.g. mass, mass accumulation rate) and molecular markers (e.g. protein secretion, surface immunophenotype) that are rapidly affected by effective therapeutics and precede longer- term phenotypes (e.g. loss of viability). Because these properties are measured for each single cell, clonal architectures based on therapeutic response will be established across each tumor sample by incorporating molecular and physical parameter data from large numbers of cells. In settings of deep treatment response, pre-treatment and MRD samples will be compared to define the effects of therapy on clonal architecture. The cells that exhibit particular functional properties (e.g. phenotypic non-responders) will be isolated and analyzed for genomic determinants of these properties. These data will then be incorporated into mathematical models to design and optimize therapeutic approaches that overcome the heterogeneity within individual tumors responsible for treatment failure. By pursuing this approach, our center will establish a framework that enables an iterative cycle between novel single-cell measurements from clinically-relevant specimens and computational approaches that result in testable predictions."
"9295016","The potential for prenatal, early childhood and adolescent exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) to adversely impact neural and reproductive development is a growing public health concern. Phthalates and BPA are EDCs that are used in many consumer products, and are regularly detected in human urine. Both chemicals are known to disrupt neural and reproductive development in animal models, but little is known about their potential to interfere with these developmental processes in humans. Additionally, a large percentage of reproductive age women and adolescent children in the US consume diets high in saturated fat (HFD) and are either overweight or obese. Recent evidence suggests that maternal obesity during the prenatal period or child obesity in the adolescent period may be linked to impaired neurological and reproductive function, but little is known about the potential for a HFD or obesity  to interact with EDC exposure to increase risk. Project 1 has 4 aims that will address these critical public health questions: (1) it will assess sources of exposure to phthalates, BPA and other EDCs during the prenatal and adolescent periods; (2) it will use novel methods developed in our Formative Children's Center to assess the impact of exposure to EDCs during either the prenatal or adolescent period on child physical, behavioral and cognitive development; (3) it will assess the potential for HFD/obesity during either the prenatal or adolescent period to interact with chemical exposure to influence physical, behavioral and cognitive development; and (4) it will investigate the association between prenatal exposure to phthalates, BPA and other EDCs and markers of oxidative stress or inflammation in maternal and cord blood, as well as the potential for increases in oxidative stress and inflammation to mediate the impact of exposure on outcomes. A significant strength of conducting this research in the context of the proposed Center is that Projects 2 and 3 will conduct parallel rodent studies that will assess similar developmental endpoints in mice and rats exposed to phthalates or BPA either prenatally or during adolescence, allowing comparison of exposure-outcome relationships in animal and hurnan studies."
"9282634","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before a heart attack, and predict risk in millions of patients annually. This is currently limited by the need fo visual interpretation, which is highly variable and depends on the physician's experience. The long-term objective of this program is to improve the interpretation of this widely used heart imaging technique-achieving higher accuracy for disease detection than it is possible by the best attainable visual analysis. This proposal builds on our prior work in conventional myocardial MPS, and focuses on fast, low-radiation MPS imaging (fast-MPS) obtained by new high-efficiency scanners. Specifically, we aim to: 1) develop new image processing algorithms for a fully automated analysis of fast-MPS. The algorithms will include better heart muscle detection by training with correlated anatomical data and a novel approach for mapping the probability of abnormal perfusion for each location of the heart muscle; 2) enhance the diagnosis of heart disease from fast-MPS by machine- learning algorithms that integrate clinical data, stress test parameters, and quantitative image features; 3) demonstrate the clinical utility of the new algorithms applied to automatic canceling of the rest portion of the MPS scan, when not needed. The new system will be more accurate than the clinical expert analysis in the detection of obstructive coronary disease. By immediately indicating whether a stress scan is normal, the system will allow for the automatic cancellation of the rest imaging portion when it is not needed (estimated in over 60% of all MPS studies). Our research will demonstrate that the computer decision regarding rest-scan cancellation is safe for the patient, both from a diagnostic and prognostic standpoint. This will lead to a wide adoption of low-dose stress-only imaging for MPS studies, which would reduce the amount of radiation that patients are exposed to, and allow for significant healthcare savings. It will additionally lead to a paradigm shift in the practice of nuclear cardiology, which will ultimately result in better selection of patients who need intervention, and reduce the number of deaths due coronary artery disease."
"9281090","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The is a multipurpose panel survey following more than 34,000 individuals in 288 communities throughout China across nine exams from 1989 to 2011. This in-depth multipurpose survey has collected a diverse set of sociodemographic, economic, and health data. In the 2009 survey biomarkers derived from fasting blood on all respondents aged 7 year and older, toenail biomarkers on all respondents aged 2 and older and genome-wide association [GWA] data on a subsample of 9,600 respondents were obtained. The 20-year span of coverage and the geographic scope provide substantial temporal and spatial variability across contextual, household, and individual levels. We propose to further enhance the value of this unique survey by adding a follow-up survey to collect a second wave of fasting blood and other biomarkers to provide incidence data across cardio metabolic, toxicological and other outcomes, and to complete GWA on the remaining 9,000 individuals with blood samples and in all children aged 0 to 7 years using buccal swabs. Furthermore, we will continue the collection of all sociodemographic data. We will conduct biomarker analysis on the fasting blood samples to replicate the set of 26 biomarkers (CVD, nutritional, inflammatory markers); extract and store DNA from all individuals' buffy coat and buccal swab samples; blood spots for scholarly community use; and work with our Chinese collaborators to get GWA and toenail analyses funded for the new CHNS2014 specimens. This will encompass 37 trace element biomarkers, including micronutrients and chemical pollutants (e.g. arsenic, lead), and GWA for any individuals without GWA data. Furthermore, a blood spot and biomarker data base will be established for future users, including -80 degree storage of CHNS2014 blood samples and blood spots as well as 2009 blood spots. The spatial data collection allows users to propose further spatial data collection and/or linkage with extant data with CHNS communities. The resulting data resource will be unparalleled. Currently there are 15,284 unique users with over 1,219 journal publications. The release in Dec. 2012 of the fasting blood results will enhance usage as will the cleaned toenail and GWAs data, both handled in year 1 of the proposed grant. The second wave of biomarker data will provide data to examine incidence in a variety of cardiovascular-, nutrition-, and toxicological-related outcomes, coupled with continued heterogeneity in social, economic, and health status across time in modernizing China. The multilevel data structure allows clustered research at the individual-, household-, community-, and province-levels."
"9278142","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies investigate the role of activin receptor signaling cascades in mediating the long-lasting changes in the brain's reward circuits, which contribute to the complex behavioral abnormalities that comprise an addicted state. To date there is no effective pharmacotherapy for addiction to stimulants, such as cocaine, highlighting the dire need for further understanding of how such drugs of abuse re-wire the brain. Neuronal plasticity is considered a neural substrate of the long-term addicted state, but there is a scarcity of mechanistic evidence that explores the molecular mechanism of cocaine-induced structural plasticity. Guided by exciting preliminary data demonstrating that in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) of animals of self-administering cocaine, activin receptor expression and signaling is increased, this application will test the following hypotheses: (Aim I) cocaine self-administration regulates the activin receptor-Smad pathway. Consequently, following cocaine self-administration the activin-smad pathway regulates both (a) actin dynamics and (b) Smad gene targets; (Aim II) Activin-Smad pathways are key molecular mechanisms underlying cocaine-induced dendritic spine plasticity of NAc neurons following cocaine self-administration; (Aim III) Activin receptor and Smad signaling pathways directly mediate cocaine seeking and craving as measured by reinstatement behaviors. This application presents an opportunity to determine, for the first time, the causal role for TGFBeta/activin-smad signaling cascades in facilitating drug seeking behaviors by examining cocaine-induced plasticity on cellular (i.e. structural) and behavioral levels (i.e. reinstatement). The findings from the work in this application will elucidate mechanisms by which chronic cocaine exposure induces long-term changes in plasticity of NAc neurons, and provides new directions for the development of novel therapies for cocaine addiction."
"9272007","The major goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) is to gain insight into the regulation of hypoxic  adenosine responses in acute and chronic settings in order to advance novel adenosine-based therapies for  the treatment of lung disease. The Project Leaders of this PPG have made substantial contributions to the  understanding of adenosine signaling and the regulation of different injury processes, including acute and  chronic lung disease. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies are actively developing adenosine-based  therapies to treat various disorders including lung disease. However, confusion over the beneficial and  detrimental aspects of adenosine signaling has hindered these efforts. The experiments planned in the  Component Projects of this PPG will address aspects of adenosine signaling in acute and chronic disease  states with a focus on lung disease, and they will interact scientifically to understand organ and stage-  specific aspects of adenosine signaling. It is hoped that the knowledge gained will help guide the  development of specific adenosine-based therapies. However, we feel that this goal will be facilitated further  by establishing mechanisms that promote interactions amongst the Project Research Teams, The Cores and  Advisory Board Members. Thus, a major goal of this Administrative Core will be to provide administrative  assistance to facilitate scheduled monthly meetings, Bi-Annual Project Leader Conferences, and a yearly  PPG Scientific Retreat. These activities will focus on the exchange of data and ideas to understand the  differences and similarities of the hypoxic adenosine response in different environments, and promote the  importance of this pathway to the greater scientific community. Other goals of this Core include providing  the administrative structure to assure the successful use of the Scientific Cores and the exchange of data  and research material, monitor scientific progress of the Projects, address concerns, monitor compliance  issues, and facilitate the presentation and publication of scientific results. By achieving these goals, this  Administrative Core will contribute to the overall success and significance of this PPG.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Acute and chronic lung diseases are the third leading cause of death behind cancer and cardiovascular  disease. This is due in part to an incomplete understanding of injury responses in the lung. This  Administrative Core is highly relevant to the betterment of human disease in that it will seek to facilitate  interactions that are geared towards understanding novel mechanisms of lung disease that may lead to new  treatments for these deadly lung disorders."
"9315597","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive osteoclast activity causes bone loss and is a significant health issue because it can lead to osteoporosis, tumor-associated bone disease, and other conditions characterized by reduced bone mass and strength. An antibody to the Lrp5/6 antagonist sclerostin is a promising new anabolic therapy because it enhances bone formation. Rodent and human studies indicate that this therapy also reduces osteoclast- mediated resorption. The mechanism(s) by which enhanced Wnt activity suppresses bone resorption is unknown. Our studies reveal that targeted deletion of Lrp5/6 in osteoclast precursors (pOC) reduces osteoblast numbers and bone formation rates, supporting a role for Wnt/Lrp in pOC recruitment of osteoblast lineage cells. This response is not seen with targeted deletion of ?-catenin in pOCs, indicating ?-catenin- independent impacts of Wnt/Lrp signaling on osteoclast lineage cells. The focus of this project is to investigate the mechanisms by which Wnt/Lrp influence pOC differentiation and recruitment of osteoblast lineage cells. Wnt3a suppresses pOC differentiation when it binds to Lrp5/6. However, when Lrp5/6 receptors are not present, Wnt3a enhances pOC differentiation. Our preliminary data reveal that in these instances, Wnt3a acts more like Wnt5a and signals through Ror2 to activate noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. Mice lacking Ror2 in pOCs have osteopetrosis, with reduced osteoclast numbers. Surprisingly, this severe reduction in osteoclast lineage cells had no impact on osteoblast numbers, suggesting that Ror2 signaling suppresses osteoblast recruitment. Our preliminary data reveal that Wnt3a treatment of pOCs represses Rank expression and stimulates expression of the enzyme SPHK1, increasing production of its product, the chemokine S1P. In contrast, Wnt5a stimulates Rank expression and suppresses SPHK1/S1P production. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are two competing Wnt pathways that control osteoclast differentiation. The canonical arm is activated by Wnt3a, which signals through Lrp5/6, suppresses differentiation and promotes S1P production. The noncanonical arm is activated by Wnt5a and Ror2 to stimulate osteoclast differentiation and suppress S1P levels under normal conditions, but Ror2 is also engaged by Wnt 3a when Lrp5/6 levels are low. Our Specific Aims to test our hypothesis are to: (1) Determine the mechanisms of Lrp and Ror2 regulation of SPHK1 and Rank, (2) Examine Ror2 and SPHK1/S1P expression in murine and human osteoclast lineage cells, and (3) Evaluate osteoblast lineage cell recruitment in murine and human models of aging. These studies will significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which Wnts control bone metabolism and provide important new avenues to enhance bone anabolic influences of Wnt signaling while suppressing catabolic influences. These new therapy directions will improve strategies to prevent and treat osteoporosis and pathological bone loss in conditions such as arthritis and tumor-induced osteolysis."
"9281886","Many model systems study early development of animals with the goal to understand the normal mechanisms of morphogenesis. This is important because early in development the cells of the embryo exhibit a series of dramatic cell rearrangements that establish the primitive body plan of the animal. This complex sequence is quite robust yet is thought to t)e the source of many unexplained human birth defects. A number of approaches have attempted to understand and reduce those defects, but perhaps the best research direction in the long run is to thoroughly understand how embryos normally transect these early developmental stages. In this project the goal is to understand in a model system, the sea urchin, how the earliest gene regulatory network controls cellular processes that contribute to morphogenesis, patterning and reprogramming. The control machinery of development are the transcriptional networks that regulate all cellular activities. Among the best-understood gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is the one that governs specification of early sea urchin development up to the beginning of gastrulation. This project will take advantage of that knowledge to examine how the next steps of development are controlled. The idea is that sub-circuits of the endomesoderm GRN control morphoregulator molecule expression, and these in turn control the cell biological processes that conduct morphogenetic movements, pattern the skeleton, and control a capacity for cellular reprogramming in the embryo. Three specific aims will be pursued. The first will be to use the GRN, transcriptomes, gene candidate lists, and perturbations to identify the morphoregulators that control the several phases of archenteron invagination. The second aim will be to examine how the GRN controls release of signals from the ectoderm in such a precise manner that enables the skeletogenic cells to produce a correctly patterned skeleton. The third aim will examine how the state of the GRN is able to shift as it reprograms. There the goal will be to identify a repressor of reprogramming, and also to record the state changes as the GRN shifts from one specification state to another. Each of these aims draws upon the advanced state of understanding of the sea urchin gene regulatory network."
"9285863","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is a debilitating disorder with a poor prognosis that affects nearly 6 million Americans. Major depression and inadequate self-care are common and interrelated behavioral problems in HF that diminish quality of life and increase the risks of hospitalization and death. Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that both of these problems are difficult to treat. Stepped care for major depression is a promising approach that has not been tested in patients with HF, and previous HF self-care trials have not addressed depression despite the fact that it has been found to be a significant barrier to self-care. The purpose of this randomized, single-blind, parallel groups, controlled clinical trial is to test a stepped care intervention for major depression in patients with HF and o determine whether HF self-care outcomes can be improved by treating depression before intervening in self-care. Outpatients with HF and comorbid major depression (n=180) will be randomly assigned to an 18-week stepped care intervention (SC) or to usual care (UC) for depression. The initial step in the SC intervention will be individual cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The therapy will be augmented with an antidepressant medication at Week 6 if the early response to CBT is inadequate (<10% improvement in depression), and the antidepressant regimen will be modified at Week 12 if there has been <50% improvement by then. The antidepressant options will include sertraline, escitalopram, bupropion, and mirtazapine, and the choice will be guided by clinical evaluation. The CBT treatment plan will also be modified at Weeks 6 and 12 as needed, and will include a module for treatment of residual insomnia when indicated. The schedule of CBT sessions will be tapered if remission and relapse prevention criteria are met before 18 weeks. All participants in both arms will receive an individually tailored, nurse-directed HF self-care intervention between Weeks 18 and 24. Follow-up assessments will be conducted through Week 52 to evaluate maintenance of gains, and medical records will be obtained throughout the follow-up period to document hospitalizations and deaths. The outcomes will include remission of depression, improvement in HF self-care, and all-cause hospitalizations. Additional outcomes will include change in the severity of depression and anxiety, HF-related quality of life, fatigue, sleep quality, and social functioning.If this RCT demonstrates that stepped care is efficacious for major depression in patients with HF, and that treating depression before intervening in self-care improves self-care outcomes, it will help to establish this approach as an evidence- based clinical intervention for outpatients with heart failure. It will also help to pave the way for Phase III multicenter trial with a primary composite end point of hospitalization or death."
"9274355","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia, which is characterized by maternal hypertension and systemic endothelial vascular dysfunction, occurs in 3-8% of pregnancies and is associated with significant neonatal morbidities. Among infants born premature, preeclampsia is independently associated with a high risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), as well as an increased risk of other systemic complications. Even late preterm infants born to preeclamptic women have higher respiratory morbidity, greater rates of respiratory distress syndrome, increased rates of NICU admission, longer neonatal hospitalization, and increased respiratory support needs compared to normotensive pregnancies. The pathogenesis of preeclampsia relates to overproduction of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1 (sFlt-1), which inhibits VEGF signaling. The excess sFlt-1 in maternal serum, as well as in amniotic fluid, correlates with the severity of preeclampsia. In addition, neonatal cord bloo from pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia has increased sFlt-1, reduced VEGF levels, and decreased numbers and function of angiogenic circulating progenitor cells (CPCs). Therefore, the anti-angiogenic environment of preeclampsia likely impairs angiogenic processes in the fetus and infant. We hypothesize that the anti-angiogenic environment in pregnant mothers with preeclampsia impairs pulmonary and vascular development in the infant. The overall objective of our study will be achieved in the following Specific Aims: SA #1: A) Determine whether preeclampsia impairs infant lung development, as evidenced by reduced pulmonary diffusion capacity and airway function. B) Examine whether impaired lung function is related to the angiogenic environment in cord blood, as evidenced by fewer CPCs, decreased CPC: nonCPC ratio, reduced VEGF, and increased sFlt-1. SA #2: A) Determine whether preeclampsia impairs infant systemic vascular function, as evidenced by reduced capillary density, increased vasoreactivity, and increased blood pressure. B) Examine whether impaired systemic vascular function is related to the angiogenic environment in cord blood, as evidenced by fewer CPCs, reduced CPC: nonCPC ratio, reduced VEGF, and increased sFlt-1."
"9293893","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of this project is to understand how the dysregulation of certain keratinocyte functions, by altering the cells' interactions with te skin microbiome, can impair epidermal barrier function, leading to features resembling those of atopic dermatitis (AD) and the development of high serum levels of IgE. Mouse RabGEF1 was discovered as a negative regulator of mast cell activation, and mice globally deficient in RabGEF1 rapidly develop AD-like skin [pathology]. However, conditional deletion of Rabgef1 specifically in mouse keratinocytes is sufficient to drive AD-like skin [pathology] and the development of high levels of serum IgE (as is also seen in AD patients). Moreover, the severe skin disease observed in RabGEF1- deficient mice critically depends on keratinocyte-intrinsic expression of MyD88, an adaptor molecule that mediates signaling by several Toll-like receptors (TLRs). [Expression of RabGEF1 protein] is markedly decreased in lesional skin from patients with AD as compared to healthy skin, whereas MYD88 mRNA expression is significantly increased in lesional skin specimens from AD patients. Since skin is continuously exposed to microorganisms that are a rich source of TLR ligands, we will evaluate to what extent the skin microbiome and keratinocyte TLRs can contribute to the MyD88-dependent AD-like skin [pathology] observed when keratinocytes lack RabGEF1. We will use RabGEF1-deficient mouse and human keratinocytes to analyze in vitro the molecular mechanisms by which RabGEF1 regulates MyD88-dependent signaling pathways. Finally, we will assess how keratinocyte-restricted [complete or partial] reductions in RabGEF1 expression can influence systemic sensitization to allergens via the skin, with the later development of allergic inflammation in distant organs such as the lung. We propose three specific aims to test the General Hypothesis: The development of skin pathology with features of atopic dermatitis, and elevated serum IgE, in RabGEF1-deficient mice reflects the ability of RabGEF1 to maintain skin [barrier and immune] functions by down-regulating pathways initiated by MyD88-dependent signaling in keratinocytes. Aim 1: Define the contributions of MyD88, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and the skin microflora in the AD-like skin [pathology] induced by keratinocyte-specific Rabgef1 deletion in vivo. Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms by which RabGEF1 negatively regulates MyD88-dependent functional responses and signaling in keratinocytes. Aim 3: Determine the mechanisms by which RabGEF1 deficiency in keratinocytes influences skin sensitization to allergens and the development of the atopic march. This project will clarify how an intrinsic impairment in keratinocyte function due to diminished RabGEF1 can contribute to AD-like skin [pathology]. Ultimately, pursuing such work may enable the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for the prevention or treatment of AD and perhaps other atopic or inflammatory disorders."
"9268671","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIH K23 proposal described a 4 year training and research plan for the candidate, a physician scientist with a long term goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise in neonatal clinical trials with a focus on neonatal resuscitation, optimization of oxygen (O2) therapy in the newborn and prevention of oxidative stress related morbidities. To accomplish these goals, the candidate and his mentors put forth an integrated plan encompassing a novel research idea and training in oxidative stress pathophysiology and clinical trials with a focus on neonatal resuscitation. Premature infants have high incidence of various morbidities leading to poor neurodevelopment and mortality. Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathophysiology of many of these morbidities. The use of high O2 concentrations, even for brief periods during delivery room (DR) resuscitation exacerbates the generation of reactive O2 species which can overwhelm newborn antioxidant capacity and may damage various organs. In preterm infants, multiple small clinical studies have shown that a reduction in the O2 load in the DR decreases oxidative stress and improves clinical outcomes. However, definitive evidence from appropriately powered randomized controlled trial is lacking. Studies have demonstrated that in healthy term newborns it takes at least 5 minutes after birth for the oxygen saturation (SpO2) to rise from around 50% to greater than 90%. These are called the transitional goal SpO2. In previous studies, the candidate has demonstrated the feasibility of initiating resuscitation of a preterm neonate in the delivery room with 21% O2 and adjusting the O2 amount based on the transitional goal SpO2. As a natural extension of this work, now the candidate is focusing on what the optimal transitional goal SpO2 should be in preterm infants. Preliminary data from his previous work show that the current recommended transitional goal SpO2 (Ox50) may be too high and results in excess O2 exposure and oxidative stress in preterm neonates. The candidate hypothesizes that a low target O2 saturation strategy (Ox10-25) will result in successful resuscitation of preterm neonates with less O2 exposure and reduction in oxidative stress compared to the currently recommended high target O2 saturation strategy (Ox50). To test this hypothesis, a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of Ox10-25 versus Ox50 in 24-28 weeks gestational age infants will be conducted. The following three specific aims are proposed. To determine if Ox10-25 neonates will have decreased DR O2 exposure and early oxidative stress (Aim 1), will require less DR ventilatory support (Aim 2) and in turn will have reduced incidence of adverse clinical outcomes (Aim 3). This will be the first clinical trial evaluating two different transitioal SpO2 targets for preterm resuscitation in the DR. Preliminary data from this study will be used to design a larger clinical trial powered for neurodevelopmental outcomes which will form the basis of the candidate's R01 application toward the end of the K23 award. This study will provide critical information to optimize O2 therapy in the DR and has potential to improve clinical outcomes in preterm neonates."
"9275295","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse during pregnancy is known to cause abnormalities in developing embryos and lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). However, the specific mechanisms by which alcohol mediates these injuries have yet to be determined. Stem cells during embryogenesis are under highly orchestrated molecular interplays among intrinsic stem cell factors that regulate stem cell potency and timely lineage specifications. In addition, there is evidence for the important roles of extrinsic factors within he stem cell microenvironment in ensuring proper fetal development. During embryogenesis there are significant intercellular communications between the mother and the developing embryo. Amniotic fluid serves as an important medium in the trafficking of molecular information between the mother and the fetus. It was also shown that amniotic fluid contains secreted exosomes with extracellular RNA (ExRNA) from both maternal and developing fetal tissues. Furthermore, alcohol was shown to significantly affect exosomal protein and RNA content in adult tissues. Thus, maternal alcohol consumption can significantly affect the microenvironment surrounding the developing embryo, including the biogenesis and the content of exosomal ExRNA. This exploratory application proposes to define the effect of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy on the biogenesis of amniotic ExRNA in the animal model of fetal alcohol exposure. Our central hypotheses are: (1) Maternal alcohol consumption alters the biogenesis of amniotic exosomes and ExRNA and (2) Maternal alcohol use alters the bio-function of amniotic exosomal ExRNA in fetal stem cell development. Two related Specific Aims are proposed to address these hypotheses: (SA1) To characterize the effect of alcohol on the biogenesis of amniotic exosomal ExRNA, and (SA2) To assess the effect of amniotic exosomal ExRNA in stem cell development. Defining the effect of maternal alcohol consumption on amniotic ExRNA content may be used to develop clinical tools to monitor the effects of alcohol on the pregnancy progress and fetal development. More importantly the identification of ExRNA species associated with FASDs will be beneficial towards development of biomarkers for early detection and interventions to prevent or mitigate EtOH's teratogenic effects."
"9325031","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of highly efficient and accurate approaches to structure-based virtual screening (VS) continues to represent a formidable challenge in the field of computational drug discovery. Outstanding and widely recognized research problems in the field include the relative computational inefficiency of most approaches, which limits the size of molecular libraries used for virtual screening; the low hit rate; and the inaccurate prediction of ligand binding affinity and pose. The proposed studies address these challenges by using innovative and computationally efficient approaches to VS that fully integrate concepts from the complementary fields of cheminformatics and molecular simulation to devise an integrated two-step VS methodology. Building upon our experience in cheminformatics and QSAR modeling, we aim to develop novel, computationally efficient cheminformatics approaches to pre-process very large (on the order of 107 compounds) chemical libraries available for biological screening, and eliminate up to 99% of improbable ligands. Only the remaining 1% of probable ligands will be evaluated by slower but accurate ensemble flexible docking approaches relying on molecular simulation techniques. The cheminformatics step will also produce important information on privileged protein-ligand interactions that will be used in a live-processing step to guide the structure-based virtual screening and avoid oversampling of ligand poses. Moreover, post- processing cheminformatics methods will be implemented to filter out decoy poses from docking calculations. The ultimate goal of our hybrid methodology is to arrive at a small set of high-affinity computational hits in receptor-bound conformations that can be validated experimentally. We will pursue this goal following three specific aims: 1) Develop novel cheminformatics-based virtual screening approaches to eliminate both improbable ligands and improbable poses, as well as generate information on preferred protein-ligand interactions; 2) Develop new, efficient flexible ensemble docking methods guided by the preferred protein- ligand interactions to select the most probable ligands and predict their binding poses; 3) Apply the developed hierarchical virtual screening workflow to several therapeutic targets and test high-confidence computational hits in experimental assays. All computational tools resulting from this project will be made publicly available. This proposal is innovative because the proposed VS platform will result from a unique marriage of disparate approaches for VS, combining their corresponding strengths. This proposal is significant because the implementation of this project will enable substantial improvement in the efficiency, accuracy, and experimentally-confirmed impact of structure-based drug discovery tools."
"9302774","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapidly increasing utilization of X-ray computed tomography (CT) has heightened concerns about the collective radiation exposure to the population as a whole, and about potential risks to patients undergoing recurrent imaging for chronic conditions or persistent complaints. These concerns have motivated a great deal of attention to practical radiation-dose-reduction strategies. Current dose reduction approaches, such as iterative reconstruction or improved detector technology, each offer only moderate dose reductions up to 30- 40% below the prior state of the art.  We will pursue more-than-incremental improvements in radiation dose by changing the current paradigm of CT data acquisition and image reconstruction: a reduced number of X-ray projections will be acquired, in an angularly subselected pattern associated with random-appearing or incoherent artifacts which will then be removed by compressed-sensing (CS) reconstruction algorithms. Several groups have shown the potential of CS to reconstruct undersampled CT data in simulations, but no practical means of incoherent undersampling has yet been demonstrated in the challenging physical environment of a rapidly rotating CT gantry.  In this project, we will develop and evaluate novel approaches for rapid and incoherent interruption of the X-ray source on the CT gantry which, when combined with our sparsity-based CS reconstruction algorithms, will enable reconstruction of high-quality images from a markedly reduced number of projections. In particular, we will investigate a novel moving multihole collimator design which will block X-rays directed towards different subsets of detectors at different gantry angles.  We have already shown these approaches to be capable of order-of-magnitude dose reductions in preliminary simulations in both phantoms and human subjects, but in order to evaluate our methods in actual practice, we will work closely with Siemens Medical Solutions, who will dedicate an experimental test bay at their CT plant in Forchheim to develop a practical test system as a prelude to functional clinical scanner prototypes. Successful completion of the aims of this study will lay the groundwork for a paradigm-changing approach to CT data acquisition and reconstruction, enabling heretofore inaccessible dose reductions. Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Validate the dose-reduction potential of incoherent interrupted-beam acquisition and sparse reconstruction using realistic simulations carefully designed to incorporate the physics of the modified acquisition process. 2. Evaluate achievable dose reduction with preserved image quality using retrospective undersampling of clinical scan data (using the model from Aim 1), and compare with gold-standard dose reduction methods. 3. Develop a test system for interrupted-beam CT acquisition in collaboration with our industry partner, and evaluate performance in phantoms."
"9390217","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent approval of anti-cancer immunotherapeutic drugs by the FDA validates that stimulation of the immune system of a cancer patient is an effective way to control or prevent metastatic disease. However, the approved immune checkpoint blockade inhibitors are effective only in a subset of melanoma patients, and a majority of the cancer patients do not respond to the drugs. Moreover, cancers such as breast cancers do not respond well to these drugs, suggesting additional immune stimulatory approaches such as therapeutic vaccination need to be developed. One of the major problems in developing vaccination-based immunotherapies for cancer is the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Recent deep gene sequencing studies demonstrated extensive intratumoral and interpersonal heterogeneity in gene mutations in tumors. Therefore, developing a therapeutic vaccine using a single antigen/peptide or patient-derived autologous/allogeneic tumor cell lines, which may not represent the heterogeneity of tumors, would not result in an immune response against the breadth of tumor antigens. Therefore, to induce immunity against the specific antigenic signature of a patient, use of an optimally adjuvanted vaccine based on whole autologous tumor tissue is highly desirable. We have developed an adjuvanted whole tumor tissue based vaccine for cancer immunotherapy using tumor membrane vesicles (TMVs) prepared from whole tumor tissue and modifying them by incorporating immunostimulatory molecules (ISMs) such as B7-1 and IL-12 using a novel protein transfer method. This method immobilizes ISMs onto TMVs via a glycolipid anchor (GPI), resulting in simultaneous delivery of TMVs along with biological adjuvants to APCs for enhanced uptake and optimal immune cell activation. Based on promising preclinical data in mice, Emory University and Metaclipse Therapeutics Corporation have entered into an agreement to advance this immunotherapy approach to clinics targeting triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This subtype of cancer is highly heterogeneous and target antigens vary from patient to patient, thus making it an ideal target for our personalized immunotherapy. Metaclipse was awarded an NIH Phase I SBIR grant to further validate the technology in a TNBC model and is currently conducting studies required for IND filing. In this partnership grant application we propose to: 1) Perform preclinica studies to make recommendations on the use of the TMV-based, patient-specific immunotherapy in combination with standard-of-care treatments, 2) Investigate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the yield and biological activity of the TMV-based immunotherapy prepared from mouse tumor tissue and human tumor tissue derived from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models as well as TNBC patients and 3) Evaluate the TMV-based immunotherapy approach using human TNBC tumor tissue and human GPI-ISMs in a PDX model engrafted with a human immune system. The knowledge obtained from the proposed collaborative studies between Emory University and Metaclipse will aid in designing a clinical trial strategy for TMV-based immunotherapy in TNBC patients."
"9355470","ABSTRACT The overall goal of this application is to develop a compelling rationale and workable methodology for the treatment of diffuse alveolar damage with transplanted human epithelial stem/progenitor cells capable of long term engraftment and improved organ function. Stem/progenitor replacement therapy is envisioned as a meaningful therapeutic adjunct in several clinical situations dominated by diffuse alveolar damage with epithelial loss: severe, acute lung injury, e.g. due to influenza or other causes of ARDS, as well as acute exacerbations of chronic fibrotic lung disease. Recent studies discussed in the application indicate effective alveolar regeneration, and thus improved lung function, requires both a first phase of expansion and migration of stem/progenitor cells to re-establish alveolar barriers followed by a second phase of differentiation of new barrier cells into mature type II (AEC2s) and type I alveolar cells. To develop a translational program for alveolar regeneration by transplantation of healthy lung epithelial stem/progenitor cells, three basic objectives are advanced: (1) Further delineation of the signaling programs by which endogenous human distal lung epithelial stem cells can be activated following major injury to establish new alveolar barriers and then differentiate to AEC2s. (2) In vitro development of pools of human distal (small airway and alveolar) epithelial stem cells, both endogenous and iPSC-derived, suitable for transplantation and directed differentiation in mice. Distal basal-like cells from human iPS cells using gene edited cells reporting surfactant protein C, cytokeratin 17 (Krt17), and NKX2.1 will be used to develop a workable protocol for directed differentiation after transplant. (3) Employ models of lung repair/regeneration approachable by transplantation as tools to assess the regenerative potential of human epithelial stem/progenitor cells. Macaque iPS cells suitable for transplantation into influenza-infected monkeys will be used as a primate model for therapy. It is anticipated that functional improvement in gas exchange and alveolar histology can be achieved in primates, providing both a rationale and methodology for stem/progenitor cells as adjunctive therapy after severe acute lung injury in humans."
"9455469","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Medication non-adherence is common and a serious threat to patient safety, individual health and well-being. Currently, healthcare professionals lack evidence-based guidelines regarding the relative efficacy of medication management strategies (including devices and technologies). Further, most medication management and adherence tasks are performed at home, however, the role of the home environment in supporting medication management is poorly understood. A better understanding of the current medication practices of visually impaired persons served by VA Healthcare, and the relative efficacy of these practices as they are employed in the home context, will allow greater specificity in targeting real-world interventions. OBJECTIVE: The overarching objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of medication management strategies currently employed in the home environments of visually impaired veterans relative to age and regimen matched non-visually impaired veterans. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) identify the number and types of medication management strategies used in the home-environment, and 2) compare the extent to which these strategy-types and strategy-combinations predict adequate medication management and adherence among visually impaired and matched non-visually impaired veterans. We hypothesize that greater frequency of strategy use supported by the home-environment will predict greater likelihood of adequate medication management (DRUGS score >95%) and adherence (Morisky >6; CMG <20%) among the visually impaired participants (n=40) than non-visually impaired matched comparisons (n=40). RESEARCH PLAN & METHODS: We will evaluate the efficacy of medication management strategies via multiple indicators of medication adherence using both performance-based assessment and administrative data analysis with interview and self-report measures. These measures will allow us to capture capacity (i.e., skills for managing medications), actual adherence behavior (i.e., refill adherence) and self-reported adherence as outcomes. In addition we will assess strategy use in the home environment by recording strategy types (what is used), their implementation (how used), locations in the home in which they are applied (where used) and routine and time based links to location (when used). We will measure demographic, psychosocial, visual and cognitive predictors of adherence to identify important covariates of strategy use and efficacy. Veterans with visual impairment (n=40) and age and regimen matched Veterans without visual impairment (n=40) will be enrolled to complete 2 study visits of approximately 2 hours each. Potentially interested participants will respond to posted flyers or a letter by phone. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Interventions that promote adherence are likely to increase the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the health system. The multivariate approach in this study, will allow us to collect the efficacy data needed to inform an evidence-based medication management toolkit comprised of patient-centered strategies that are targeted to users based on individual, interpersonal and environmental characteristics and will be tested in a subsequent controlled trial proposal with veterans newly diagnosed with vision loss. Targeted interventions to support the health self-management of veterans with visual impairment, particularly medication management and adherence, will optimize health, independence and ensure the best possible quality of life."

"9389744","Project Summary/Abstract The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has key regulatory roles in epithelial wound healing, cell growth and cell survival in many mammalian cell types. EGFR is hijacked by many human viruses, including human papillomaviruses (HPVs), to promote their infectious entry into host cells. Yet, specific mechanisms by which EGFR activation leads to virion internalization are poorly understood. HPV types 16 and 31 interact with EGFR and the EGFR-interacting partner, the annexin A2 tetramer (A2t), at the HK plasma membrane. Our scientific premise is based on findings from our lab and from other groups: functional inhibition of EGFR or A2t proteins significantly reduces HPV entry and infection in HKs. Our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that EGFR signaling promotes the translocation of A2t to the external cell membrane to initiate the infectious entry of HPV into host cells. We will define the role that EGFR and its signaling plays in promoting HPV uptake in HKs, and determine whether EGFR is directly involved in onco-HPV internalization. We will also examine how A2t cooperates with EGFR signaling to facilitate infectious entry of onco-HPV. Epithelial wounding plays an important, but poorly understood, role in papillomavirus infections in vivo. Notably, EGFR and A2t are activated in epithelial wound settings. We will use infectious entry assays (detection of viral transcription or pseudo-genome expression) coupled with biochemical and genetic cell manipulations to define the mechanisms of HPV infection of normal host HKs. Quantitative multi-parameter confocal, super-resolution and video microscopy will permit us to visualize the fate of HPVs and localize the viruses with cell proteins under genetic and biochemical conditions that prevent infectious entry. We will combine the techniques described above with cell culture and mouse models of infection where epithelial wounding can be induced to examine how wounding contributes to HPV infections. Three inter-related SPECIFIC AIMS will address our central hypothesis. In Aim 1 we will determine function of EGFR in onco-HPV entry into HKs. In Aim 2 we will define how the interplay between EGFR and A2t promotes the uptake of onco-HPVs into HKs. In Aim 3 we will assess the roles of EGFR and A2t in HPV entry in keratinocytes using in vitro and in vivo wound models. Hypotheses regarding specific aspects of HPV-HK interactions, EGFR and AnxA2 activities and HPV entry are posed. Whether our theories are supported or refuted, we will increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HPV-host cell interactions, the biology of HK uptake, and EGFR regulation in HKs, each of which are poorly understood. This fundamental science program may also inform strategies for preventing persistent onco-HPV infections, a major risk for morbidity and malignant progression. As EGFR and AnxA2 are important for other virus infections, our results may be applicable to these pathogens as well. Lastly, we will gain needed insight into the cooperative functions of EGFR and A2t, both of which are dysregulated in many human diseases, including squamous cell cancers. !"
"9335837","Project Summary Esophageal adenocarcinoma is the most common esophageal malignancy in Western world and the malignancy that is rising the fastest in the United States ? approximately 7% per year over the past 30 years. It has very poor prognosis with less than 15% of patients alive 5 years after diagnosis. Worldwide, 482,300 new esophageal cancer cases and 406,800 deaths occurred in 2008. In order for patients to survive, it is essential to diagnose this malignancy at an early, dysplastic stage. Our group has developed an endoscopic polarized spectroscopic scanning (EPSS) instrument which gives real time in vivo information on the location of invisible high grade dysplasia. This, compatible with existing commercial endoscopes, multispectral imaging instrument is based on the technique of light scattering spectroscopy (LSS), capable of identifying pre-cancer in various epithelial-lined organs, such as esophagus. The EPSS imaging instrument scans the entire esophagus in a matter of minutes providing the physician with real time diagnostic information for guiding biopsy.  At the same time, in order to establish unbiased characteristics of the EPSS method and to provide gastroenterologists with accurate quantitative histological and biochemical information needed to visualize invisible dysplasia in esophageal epithelium important technological improvements and additional clinical studies are required. For this competitive renewal program we will build a significantly improved portable EPSS instrument capable of scanning the entire esophagus order of magnitude faster then the existing instrument, depth resolving epithelial structure, and continuously projecting quantitative histological and biochemical as well as diagnostic imaging information on the endoscopy video in real time.  Compared to state-of-the-art wide-field techniques, EPSS is distinguished by its ability to locate dysplasia in tissue that shows no visible abnormalities or lesions when observed with white light or fluorescence. By elucidating microscopic subcellular structure with macroscopic spectral measurements, EPSS can locate dysplastic tissue independent of any visual cues. We conclude that EPSS offers great promise for the early detection of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus. If the EPSS technique were to be used to guide biopsy routinely, unnecessary biopsies would be avoided and focal dysplastic spots would be biopsied that otherwise would be missed."
"9280982","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid remodeling of the microtubule cytoskeleton is essential for normal cell division, motility and morphogenesis. A unique and intriguing class of proteins involved in this remodeling are the microtubule severing enzymes, so named because of their ability to generate internal breaks in the microtubule lattice, in vitro. The studies outlned in this research proposal will elucidate the cellular functions and biophysical mechanisms of action of members of a still poorly understood subfamily of microtubule severing enzymes, termed fidgetins. The founding member of this subfamily, fidgetin, has long been known to be important for mammalian development, yet the mechanistic basis of its developmental functions remains unclear. In a recent study, we showed that human fidgetin is a microtubule severing enzyme and minus-end depolymerase. We have now found that fidgetin and the closely related protein fidgetin-like 2 perform fundamental but distinct roles in the regulation of human cell migration. Fidgetin localizes to the centrosome and normally promotes cell motility. Cells depleted of fidgetin display severe reduction in motility rates. In stark contrast, fidgetin-like 2 associates with microtubules at the cell edge and normally functions to suppress cell movement. Cells lacking fidgetin-like 2 display a several fold increase in their rate of movement. Moreover, we have found that depletion of fidgetin-like 2 promotes wound healing and neovascularization in animal models. We will pursue the following two specific aims that, together, test the central hypothesis that fidgetin and fidgetin-like 2 recognize and modify distinct microtubule subpopulations thereby controlling different parameters of cell movement: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that Fidgetin normally promotes cell motility by selectively severing and releasing microtubule minus-ends from centrosomes. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that Fidgetin-like 2 normally suppresses cell motility by shearing the plus-ends of dynamic microtubules positioned at the cell edge. Our research plan combines complementary state-of-the-art biophysical and cellular approaches to systematically determine 1) how fidgetin and fidgetin-like 2 catalyze the removal of tubulin from the microtubule lattice, 2) how these activities are harnessed in cells to model MT arrays, and 3) how the modeling of cellular MTs by fidgetin or fidgetin-like 2 is translated into altered cell motility. Work will be carried out under the co-direction of David Sharp, an expert cell and molecular biologist, and Jennifer Ross, an expert single molecule biophysicist. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide fundamental insights into the basic mechanisms of microtubule regulation of cell motility, which is a central process in human development and health, and also foundationally establish a body of knowledge for the potential development of novel therapeutic paradigms to enhance tissue regeneration and repair through the manipulation of cell movement."
"9294086","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overall goal is to develop the computational infrastructure to enable pH to be treated the same level as temperature and pressure in molecular dynamics simulation studies of biological molecules. These tools and methods need to be robust and straightforward to employ. Our work to date in this area has had a significant impact on the field; others have implemented similar methods, and key applications demonstrate the utility of direct incorporation of pH effects into molecular simulations. Our specific aims are directed toward the establishment of a robust methodology for explicit solvent constant pH simulations and are driven by applications to nucleic acids and to a specific protein system where we will explore pH sensing elements in the chaperon activity of a conditionally disordered protein. Aim 1 is to develop novel and robust explicit solvent CpHMD methods for nucleic acids. Nucleic acids present special challenges to implicit solvent models because of strong electrostatic fields from the nucleic acid polyanion and the significant influences of their ion atmosphere. Explicit solvent, with explicit ions, provides an alternative to the implicit solvet models. New developments in CpHMD will extend the approach to use an explicit solvent representation and will improve the precision, accuracy and robustness of the methodology. Our developments will be benchmarked against RNA and DNA measured pKa values for key bases, predominately the bases A and C, and through explicit collaborations with experimental colleagues. Aim 2 will apply CpHMD to explore the role of pH in mediating DNA/RNA conformation and base-base interactions. We will examine a number of specific cases, pH-mediated conformational switching in the SARS-CoV coronavirus, in the U6 intra-molecular stem loop of the splicosome, and the role of pH in the catalytic mechanism of the hairpin ribozyme. These applications address fundamental questions regarding the role of pH-driven protonation equilibrium in structure, dynamics and function in nucleic acids. Collaborations with the Al-Hashimi and Walter groups at Michigan and with Victoria D'Souza from Harvard provide both experimental benchmarks for our calculations and enable additional experiment and analysis to be informed from the calculations. Aim 3 aims to apply CpHMD to delineate and redesign the pH sensing mechanism in the Bacterial pH stress response protein chaperon HdeA. With the Bardwell group, we have redesigned the pH response elements in HdeA to produce a constitutively active and intrinsically disordered protein at pH 7. This provides a basis for exploration of the interactions within the largely disordered, but chaperon active, protein and the interactions it makes with its substrates. Collaboration with the Bardwell and Al-Hashimi groups will combine, coarse-grained simulations with CpHMD and NMR to explore the nature of the active disordered ensemble and how its members interact with substrate molecules."
"9292053","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent research suggests that chronic early life stress may pose serious threats to child well-being and set individuals on pathways towards increased physical and mental health problems in adulthood. In addition to being a key health input across the life course, chronic stress is produced through individuals' responses to their environments and thus reflects the interaction of social contexts with biological processes. Improving population health and reducing health disparities necessitates that we understand these socio-biological interactions, particularly during the early stages of the life course when physiological changes may become biologically embedded.  This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in Population Research application addresses this critical research need by proposing a training plan and research agenda that will build on my sociology, family demography and child health background to become an independent, innovative researcher in the area of social contexts, chronic stress and health during childhood. To achieve this goal, I propose formal training and mentoring in the biology of stress, collection and analysi of stress biomarkers, child development, and multilevel modeling. My highly-qualified team of mentors and advisory committee members come from the fields of sociology, demography, epidemiology, nursing, and psychology, reflecting the need for a multi- disciplinary approach in conducting research that integrates biological and social processes.  I will use my training and mentoring in these new areas to answer important research questions about how family contexts are associated with chronic stress in children, and the implications of chronic stress for child health and health disparities in the U.S. In the past four decades, there have been large and pervasive shifts in children's family contexts towards unmarried and unstable parental unions, which are often accompanied by socioeconomic disadvantage. Research suggests that these contexts contribute to child health and development disadvantages and the reproduction of social inequalities across generations. However, there has been little attention to assessing chronic stress as a pathway through which family contexts affect child health.  The expected outcome of this project is paradigm-shifting research that incorporates biological mechanisms into our conceptualization and empirical tests of family context effects on child well-being. Importantly, the conclusions will go beyond a comparison of married vs. unmarried mother families to consider diverse family structures and processes as they impact child stress and health. Using multilevel and population-based data will advance our understanding of the influence of larger social contexts (i.e., neighborhoods and social status) on these processes and will provide generalizable results. These are critical next steps in child health, family demography, and stress research that will set the stage for future research and policy development aimed at reducing chronic stress and health disparities in children."

"9337502","SUMMARY Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has increased the life expectancy of human subjects infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but many now suffer from an increased frequency and earlier onset of vascular events whose mechanisms are not yet clear. We reported reduced endothelium derived relaxation factor (EDRF) and nitric oxide (NO) in isolated living subdermal microvessels from otherwise risk-free young women with well- controlled HIV. The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding blood vessels normally enhances EDRF/NO. However, HIV and ART both can induce lipoatrophy and adipose inflammation and might thereby impair the augmented EDRF/NO response from PVAT. We found that incubation of vascular cells with HIV Tat protein or tenofovir (component of ART) increased cellular senescence signaling and microRNA-34a. How dysfunction of the endothelium, PVAT and miRNAs contribute to premature microvascular aging is unknown, but our results suggest it may entail increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) which we have detected in the blood vessels and PVAT of HIV positive subjects. We will test the hypothesis that HIV infection and/or ART generate ROS to transcribe specific miRNAs that engage the cellular senescence pathway in microvascular endothelium and PVAT. This impairs endothelial function and NO generation and limits their augmentation by adiponectin and other adipokines release from PVAT. We propose to recruit five groups of women from the Washington DC Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) program or Georgetown University Hospital HIV Clinic: HIV negative, young (21-45 years, group 1) and old (50-80 years, group 2) controls and HIV positive women receiving ART, young (21-45 years, group 3) and old (50-80 years, group 4), or young HIV negative women who are receiving pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP, group 5; Aim 2 only). Aim 1 (ex vivo, group 1-4) will evaluate the specific pathways and molecules that mediate accelerated age-dependent endothelial dysfunction in the microvessels and PVAT of HIV positive women and will seek the mediators and adipokines responsible. Aim 2 (in vivo, group 1-5) will use non-invasive iontophoretic application of acetylchonline and measurements of cutaneous blood flow using Laser Doppler Flowmetry ( LDF). It will assess endothelial function in dermal blood vessels to evaluate the separate effects of aging, HIV and ART (using HIV negative women receiving ART for PrEP). The two aims will incorporate a novel concept from preliminary cellular and clinical studies that specific microRNAs provide a biological clock of cellular senescence with which to calibrate rapid microvascular aging in HIV. This will be the first study to explore premature aging in microvessels and its external regulation by PVAT and microRNAs in HIV positive individuals and may identify candidate targets for subsequent clinical trials intervention."
"9323301","Chronic pain affects -100 million adults in the US, and is inadequately treated with drugs, that are often toxic and have side effects (e.g., addiction). Electrical stimulation in targeted nerve fibers is a promising new therapy, but has had suboptimal efficacy and limited long-term success as its mechanisms of action are unclear. Complementary therapies, such as acupuncture and massage that also involve neuromodulation as a mode of action, have not been quantitatively assessed. Critical to advancing pain therapy is a deeper mechanistic understanding of how a nociceptive signal is processed and modulated in spinal dorsal horn (DH), the first central relay station of nociceptive signaling. There are 3 major functionally distinct subsets of neurons in the DH that play different roles in pain transmission. Excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons form important local pain circuitry that modulates activity of projection neurons that send ascending pain signals to the brain. It is critical to understand the specific roles for each neuron subset and the therapeutic actions of neurostimulation, tactile inputs, and drugs. For example, do they respond differently to different therapies? Can certain patterns of stimulation selectively inhibit or excite any subset neurons to maximize pain inhibition? These fundamental questions could not be easily addressed in a quantitative manner before this study. First, experimental barriers limit probing the DH to uncover the circuit topology, because it has been difficult to differentiate different subsets of DH neurons while simultaneously studying their physiological properties. Computational models of the DH, on the other hand, can predict how changes in sensory inputs influence pain transmission, but current models are hand-tuned, assume a fixed circuitry, nonlinear, high dimensional and thus intractable for sensitivity analysis - rendering a computational barrier. We will break these barriers and will construct a tractable data-driven computational model of the DH that enables powerful predictions on how different treatments alter neuronal activity in the DH. State-of-the-art electrophysiological techniques and powerful mouse genetic approaches will delineate the effects of sensory stimuli and stimulation on various subsets of DH neurons, and these data will be used to estimate the parameters and circuit topology of a mechanistic model of the DH. Model reduction will then be applied to generate a tractable characterization of the DH enabling sensitivity analysis. Developing and validating this innovative model will allow predictions that may differentiate various pain treatments and integrative approaches that can be readily tested in animals. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Chronic pain affects about 100 million adults in the US, but remains inadequately treated. Critical to advancing pain therapy is a deeper mechanistic understanding of how a nociceptive signal is processed and modulated in spinal dorsal horn (DH), the first central relay station of nociceptive signaling. We will combine state-of-the-art electrophysiological techniques and mouse genetic approaches with system identification tools to construct a tractable computational model of the DH that will enable powerful predictions on how different treatments alter neuronal activity in the DH."
"9324241","Project Summary/ Abstract  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) afflicts 14% of the US adults and represents a foremost challenge facing public health. CKD patients suffer a higher prevalence of co-morbidities and an estimated 17% of 2010 Medicare costs were directly attributable to CKD patient healthcare. Patient management is further confounded by contraindications against the use of intravenous contrast media routinely used with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that physicians rely upon to diagnose irregularities in the structure and perfusion of vasculature and soft tissue. The prevalence of co-morbidities and the risk associated with contrast media both increase with decreased renal function. Thus as patients grow increasingly vulnerable physicians are forced to make key patient management decisions with limited radiologic information.  Iodinated CT contrast media can cause acute and irreversible kidney injury to renally impaired patients, termed contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Gadolinium (Gd) used in MR contrast media is directly linked to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in renally impaired patients.  We hypothesize that rationally designed Mn-chelates can provide an MR contrast alternative to Gd that is compatible for use in renally impaired patients. Rational molecular design can promote magnetic relaxation, limit Mn release, and promote non-renal clearance and complete whole body elimination. Furthermore, Mn is biogenic and free Mn2+ is rapidly excreted via the biliary pathway. Should a small amount of Mn release occur, dissociated ions would be incorporated within the endogenous labile Mn pool, or otherwise be excreted.  We invented a rationally designed Mn-based contrast agent, termed Mn-PyC3A, that provides relaxivity equivalent to clinically used Gd contrast agents, dissociates 20x more slowly than the clinically used Magnevist, and undergoes rapid, whole body clearance via mixed renal and hepatobiliary paths. In this proposal we will prepare a small, focused library of Mn-PyC3A derivatives to optimize the efficacy and safety properties of this alternate contrast agent. We will characterize these Mn-chelates in vitro with respect to relaxivity, stability, and cell toxicity. We will then perform pilot studies in mice to evaluate in vivo efficacy, biodistribution and clearance. Stable, high relaxivity Mn-chelates will be evaluated in mouse models of cancer and compared with clinically used Gd contrast. For the Mn-chelate that shows the best combination of tumor enhancement, whole body elimination, and in vivo stability, we will evaluate acute dose toxicokinetics in normal rats and in rats with impaired renal function. The output of this work will be a validated alternative to Gd that is poised for an investigational new drug application and clinical translation."
"9278245","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be the most heavily-impacted risk group in the US HIV epidemic. Studies suggest that the majority of incident HIV infections among MSM are attributable to sex with a main male sex partner; however, HIV prevention interventions that target male-male couples are lacking. Because of this, Couples HIV Voluntary Counseling and Testing (CVCT), an intervention that has been repeatedly shown to reduce HIV transmission within heterosexual couples, has been adapted to US MSM couples. CVCT for MSM couples is now available in 11 US cities. The FDA recently approved home-based HIV testing: however, critics have pointed to the lack of counseling involved, particularly for those who receive a positive HIV test. The proposed activities include an innovative combination of home-based HIV testing and CVCT. The activities investigate the utility of home-based HIV testing combined with a video-Skype operated CVCT session, operated by a remotely located CVCT counselor. Through the screening of 1300 online recruited MSM couples from across the US and the enrollment of 600 in a RCT, the study aims to examine the impact of home-based HIV testing PLUS a video-Skype operated CVCT session (experimental condition) versus home- based HIV testing alone (control) on reductions in sexual risk-taking, formation of and adherence to agreements around sex, relationship functioning for the management of HIV risk in relationships among MSM couples. The proposed activities examine the impact of the intervention on self-reported sero-concordant negative couples (n=300) and self-reported sero-discordant couples (n=300). As a secondary aim, the activities propose to investigate the impact of home-based HIV testing plus a video-Skype operated CVCT session on timely linkage to care for those receiving a preliminary positive HIV result. Couples will complete baseline, 3 month and 6-month follow-up questionnaires, detailing recent sexual risks, scales to measure dyadic communication and coping around HIV risk management, and agreements around sex outside of the relationship. The researchers hypothesize that adding a Skype-operated couples-focused counseling session to home-based testing will act to increase coping mechanisms and communication for the effective management of HIV risks in relationships and will lead to reductions in sexual risk taking both within and outside of the relationship and for those receiving a HIV positive test result will increase timely linkage to care. CVCT provision through Skype offers an inexpensive opportunity for a couples-focused intervention to be taken to a wider audience and to provide a mechanism for those under-taking home-based HIV testing to receive counseling."
"9327251","PROJECT ABSTRACT  Our goal is to identify significant interactions between the host immune response and the metagenome in sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis, a disease of unknown etiology, represents an unmet challenge in healthcare. Sarcoidosis is difficult to diagnose, treatments are ineffective, and in the United States it disproportionately afflicts African American women. The disease primarily affects the lungs, but can target the heart, skin, liver and other organ systems as well. Although the etiology remains unknown, dysregulation of T cell subsets in the immune response has been described.  Our preliminary data reveal changes in the microbiome and immune regulatory elements as well distinct populations of miRNAs in sarcoidosis providing evidence for the involvement of both the microbiome and immunoregulation. Our hypothesis is that host-microbe interactions are key determinants of aberrant T- lymphocyte function in sarcoidosis.  Aim 1 will investigate the role of the metagenome in sarcoidosis. Our preliminary data identifies distinct taxa in the metagenome of bronchoalveolar lavage samples from sarcoidosis subjects. We will use metagenomic shotgun sequencing to identify and quantitate the bacteria, viruses and fungi in sarcoid subjects and perform linear regression analysis to identify significant taxa that are associated with covariates in the metadata. We anticipate that our investigation will identify the composition of the metagenome and also identify biologic functions that are diagnostic of sarcoidosis.  Aim 2 will analyze interactions between the host immune response and the metagenome. To investigate the regulatory T cell response in sarcodosis, we will perform RNAseq to identify modulated mRNA and also miRNA. The differentially expressed genes will be used in conjunction with the results of Aim 1 to identify mechanistic functions and to construct predictive models of sarcoidosis.  Overall, we will address the interface between the microbiome and T-lymphocyte regulation using a systems biology approach to elucidate key mechanisms of host-microbe interactions contributing to pathology.

"9385521","PROJECT SUMMARY Radiation exposure from a large-scale nuclear incident could have catastrophic consequences. Significant morbidity and mortality may result from damage to the vascular endothelium. Endothelial cells are central to all organs, and radiation-induced endovascular injury may result in both acute and delayed organ toxicity, such as acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis, and impaired hematopoiesis. These outcomes result from several pathological effects on the endothelium, which begin with endothelial barrier disruption and vascular leak. Endothelial integrity and barrier function are regulated in large part by the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2. Tie2 activation by its agonist ligand, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), promotes vascular integrity, preventing vascular leak induced by inflammation. In contrast, Ang-2, a Tie2 antagonist, inhibits the stabilizing effects of Ang-1, thereby promoting vascular leak in a variety of pathological conditions, such as sepsis and chemical- induced lung injury. Importantly, Ang-2 expression is increased in endothelial cells after exposure to radiation, suggesting that decreased Tie2 activity is an important factor in radiation-induced endovascular injury. In addition to Ang-2, Tie2 is negatively regulated by vascular endothelial-protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP). Our group has tested a highly selective small molecule inhibitor of VE-PTP, AKB-9785, which acts as a pharmacological Tie2 activator, and shown that it promotes endothelial barrier function in preclinical models. By targeting this pathway, we may increase Tie2 activity, prevent vascular leak after radiation, and improve outcomes. In addition to Tie2, platelets also regulate endothelial barrier function by occupying gaps in the endothelial lining; releasing soluble factors (including Ang-1) to enhance barrier function; promoting the growth of endothelial cells; and maintaining the endothelial ultrastructure. Paucity of platelets (i.e., radiation-induced thrombocytopenia) may mediate vascular leak and other downstream effects. Though thrombocytopenia may be addressed via transfusion, donor platelets are limited in supply and may not be available in a mass radiation event. To meet this need, we have developed fibrinogen-coated nanoparticles (FCN) as a novel therapeutic strategy. Imaging studies suggest that FCN bind to endothelial cells, serving a physical presence (i.e., plugging gaps), and recruit the remaining platelets to sites of need. Thus, FCN may have both direct effects (improved hemostasis) and indirect effects (Ang-1/Tie2 activation) on the endothelium, and preliminary studies in murine models of radiation-induced thrombocytopenia suggest that FCN improve survival. While AKB-9785 and FCN may appear to target different pathways, the role of Ang-1 is an important point of overlap. Therefore, we propose to further characterize the acute and delayed effects of radiation on endothelial cells in the lung and bone marrow, focusing on the endothelial Tie2 signaling pathway and thrombocytopenia as likely mediators of radiation damage. We also propose study to novel countermeasures (AKB-9785, FCN) targeting these pathways to mitigate the effects of radiation-induced endothelial injury."

"9306194","Summary Despite the gains in clinical management, HIV-1 infection is still a life-long disease characterized by reservoirs harboring proviral DNA in a latent/persistent state and occasional clinical complications associated with long- term infection. Because of these therapy-refractile reservoirs, the course of HIV-1 disease is subject to a number of comorbidities, including substance abuse, the aging process, and a host of secondary infections and clinical conditions. Another pressing problem in the HIV-1-infected population is the development of HIV- associated neurologic disorders (HAND) with associated cognitive impairment following HIV-1 brain penetration, which likely serves as a critical reservoir that develops in a vast majority of individuals despite therapy. Given these observations, investigators within and outside of CNAC have been using the Clinical and Translational Research Support Core (CTRSC) resources to address questions relative to: (1) development of a genetic-based strategy directed toward the elimination of HIV-1 to cure HIV/AIDS, (2) understand the genetic makeup of the virus that remains in an ART-controlled patient and in the cellular reservoirs including the brain, (3) design of gRNAs to deliver precise and personalized excision technology, (4) how ART is changing the presentation and severity of neuropsychological impairment, (5) biomarkers that may link to and be underlying mechanisms of HAND, and (6) how selected immune modulators may alter viral reservoir formation and/or affect immune activation and inflammation that underlie chronic HIV disease and HAND. The CTRSC will coalesce resources at two major Universities to build the expanded research support enterprise now designated the Drexel/Temple CNS AIDS Research and Eradication Study (CARES) Cohort. The Drexel/Temple CTRSC will involve the use of the Drexel/Temple CARES Cohort as well as the extensive experience of CTRSC investigators in bridging both the basic science and translational research during the past decade at Drexel and Temple to serve investigators within and outside the CNAC. Because of the unique two-site design for patient recruitment, a parallel leadership structure has been developed and used to oversee research support activities in the CTRSC. The Core Aims will be focused on (1) Clinical Medicine and Database Management; (2) Cognitive Performance and Neuropsychology; (3) Virology, Immunology, and Immune Activation; and (4) Viral Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics. Overall, efforts will focus on providing patient samples and a well-characterized clinical data management system with a wealth of biologic, immunologic, virologic, and genomic data that will facilitate NIH-supported investigations at Temple/Drexel, as well as the projects funded by the Developmental Core. The CTRSC will also provide clinical samples as well as cellular and molecular reagents and bioinformatic information to facilitate research support provided in the Basic Science Core."
"9403602","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. Most CRCs either are inherently insensitive to therapeutic treatment or acquire resistance upon relapse. Intrinsic and acquired therapeutic resistance is one of the most significant obstacles in the treatment of CRCs. Mcl-1, a pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein, has recently emerged as a key mediator of therapeutic resistance of CRCs. However, none of the previously described Mcl-1 inhibitors are suitable for clinical development owing to insufficient in vivo efficacy or undesirable pharmacokinetic properties. Utilizing integrated screening approaches and structure-based design, we have recently developed a new class of Mcl-1 inhibitors with novel chemical structures. The lead compound, 483, is highly selective for Mcl-1 and has potent activity against Mcl-1-mediated drug resistance in CRC cells. It also exhibited promising pharmacological properties and completely overcame Mcl-1-mediated drug resistance in vivo. Based on these findings, we propose to test the hypothesis that the 483 class of Mcl-1 inhibitors can be further developed to improve CRC therapy by targeting drug-resistant CRC cells. Aim 1: Design and synthesis of novel Mcl-1 inhibitors with improved activity and properties; Aim 2: Biophysical, biochemical, structural and functional characterization of novel Mcl-1 inhibitors; Aim 3: Determine the efficacy and mechanism of action of novel Mcl-1 inhibitors in CRC cells; Aim 4. Analyze the pharmacological properties and in vivo efficacy of novel Mcl-1 inhibitors. These studies may provide a major advance towards our long-term goal of developing a novel class of therapy for human cancer by targeting Mcl-1."
"9271207","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will focus on the consequences of, and possible treatments for brain dysfunction in young children with T1 diabetes (T1D). Animal and human research data suggest that both hypo- and hyper-glycemia can be deleterious to brain development, structure and function, with specific brain regions and neural circuits (e.g., fronto-parietal) appearing to be especially vulnerable. In particular, chronic hyperglycemia can affect white matter (WM) volume, myelin glycosylation and specific neurocognitive metrics. However, tight glycemic control in young children with T1D has been limited by risk of hypoglycemia and consequent cognitive impairment. We have compelling new data on brain and cognition differences between 4-9 y/o children with T1D and nondiabetic controls; differences that are strongly associated with hyperglycemia. These results raise important questions about the short- and long-term trajectory of brain development in childhood T1D, pathogenic mechanisms, and the possible impact of targeted interventions. Many of these questions will be addressed with state-of-the-art research methods in this multicenter RO1 in 2 distinct, yet complimentary protocols. Protocol #1 is a longitudinal, natural history study in a large cohort of very young children with T1D and controls for whom we have multi-modal MRI and neurocognitive data at baseline and 18 months. Our aims are to determine: 1) if abnormalities in total and regional GM and WM volumes and WM microstructure change over time, and whether changes are associated with measures of glycemic control; 2) if subjects with T1D show abnormalities in blood oxygen level dependent functional MRI activation of fronto-parietal networks associated with visual-spatial working memory and response inhibition, and if are there abnormalities in functional connectivity of resting state networks; 3) if there are longitudinal changes in normalized scores for IQ, executive, visual-spatial and memory functions in the T1D group, and whether changes are associated with measures of glycemic control. Unsedated structural MRI, DTI and fMRI will be performed twice 2 years apart, using identical 3T scanners, along with age-appropriate neurocognitive testing, and continuous glucose monitoring quarterly. Project #2 is an exploratory study -planned to start in year 3 using children who complete protocol #1 and are >10yrs. Our aim is to determine if substantial tightening of glycemic control overnight and more scrupulous avoidance of nocturnal hypoglycemia using nighttime closed loop (CL) devices for 3 months: (a) alters total and regional GM and WM volumes and WM microstructure as well as task-related and resting- state BOLD activation; and, b) improves specific neurocognitive metrics reflecting vulnerable neural circuits in T1D compared to standard treatment. Our highly qualified group of investigators has a well-established infrastructure, research tools and track record of productivity to successfully perform these studies. This innovative proposal will considerably expand our knowledge on the trajectories of brain and cognitive development in very young children with T1D, an area not well studied and of great contemporary importance."
"9197321","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Golgi complex is the central sorting station for nearly a third of all proteins in eukaryotic cells, but how cells regulate the flow of material through this organelle remains unknown. Protein and membrane traffic into and out of the Golgi is controlled by Rab GTPases that function by recruiting effectors to generate, transport, and tether transport vesicles. The master regulators of these essential Rab pathways are the Rab-GEF proteins that must decide whether to activate their substrate Rabs. The TRAPP complexes are GEFs that activate Rabs at the Golgi, but it is unknown how the timing and magnitude of TRAPP complex activity is regulated. In the budding yeast model, there are two essential Rabs that control Golgi traffic: Ypt1 (Rab1), and Ypt31/32 (Rab11). The TRAPPI complex is the established activator of Ypt1 at early Golgi compartments. The GEF for Ypt31/32 is unknown, and is the subject of controversy. The TRAPPII complex has been proposed to serve as the GEF for Ypt31/32, although firm evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. The uncertainty surrounding the GEF for this critical trafficking pathway is hindering progress in the field. Using a biochemical approach, we have now obtained data that will resolve this controversy. By purifying the TRAPPII complex and performing physiological Rab activation assays, we have discovered that TRAPPII functions as a bone fide GEF for both Ypt1 and Ypt31/32. Importantly, robust GEF activity for Ypt31/32 is strictly dependent upon the presence of membranes, thus explaining why it was not observed previously by other groups, and implying the existence of an autoinhibitory mechanism. Our long-term goal is to uncover mechanisms governing the regulation of Golgi function. The goal of this project is to determine the mechanisms regulating the activation of Ypt1 and Ypt31/32 by the TRAPP complexes. In order to achieve our research goals, we propose the following three aims: 1) Dissect the mechanistic basis for TRAPPII activation of two different Rab GTPases. In vitro assays will be used to investigate how TRAPPII can activate two different substrates, and to ask why membranes are required for activation of Ypt31/32 but not Ypt1. We will then use yeast genetics and cell biology to characterize the functional consequences of perturbing TRAPPII activity in vivo, in order to understand how the TRAPPII complex is regulated in the context of Golgi trafficking. 2) Determine the mechanism and functional significance of TRAPPIII function at the Golgi. Emerging evidence points to TRAPPIII as the physiological GEF for Ypt1 at the early Golgi. We will investigate how TRAPPIII GEF activity is regulated and what role it plays in the cell. 3) Characterize the dynamics of TRAPPII and TRAPIII association with the Golgi. We will determine whether known interacting partners directly regulate the activity and dynamics of TRAPP complexes. We will also determine whether the TRAPP complexes are regulated by crosstalk with other Golgi-localized GTPases. In sum, these studies will lead to a comprehensive model for the regulation of the essential Golgi Rab trafficking pathways."
"9273908","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying digital communication provides a window into the secret world of adolescent peer culture (Greenfield & Yan, 2006, p. 392). According to large, national surveys, 80% of online teens (12 - 17) use social networking sites (Madden et al., 2013). Youth ages 12 - 17 report sending an average of 60 text messages per day (Lenhart, 2012), and many claim that their social lives would end or be seriously impaired if they could not have access to text messaging (54% of girls and 40% of boys, CTIA, 2008). This proposed renewal of our ongoing longitudinal study, NICHD R01 HD060995, Social Aggression: Growth and Outcomes, will investigate how social aggression unfolds in digital communication and relates to psychosocial adjustment, how qualities of parent-child and child-friend relationships observed in middle childhood predict the development of social aggression online and offline through late adolescence, and how digital communication relates to adolescents' adjustment more broadly. This longitudinal study of a diverse sample examines social aggression and victimization across 10 years with multiple measures and informants, including observations of parent-child and child-friend interactions yearly from ages 10 - 13 and archives containing the content of participants' text messaging communication (for 4.5 years) and Facebook communication (for 2 years). This study offers the rare opportunity to examine relations among adolescents' offline relationships, socioemotional adjustment, and digital communication, from early through late adolescence.  This application requests support for conducting state-of-the-art statistical analyses, performing additional coding of our digital communication data, investigating possible ethnic differences in social aggression and digital communication, and exploring the possibility of de-identifying the large archive so that it can be shared with other investigators. Because qualities of relationships and adjustment were assessed yearly by multiple informants, we will be able to investigate how social aggression (and victimization) and adjustment contribute to each other across the age range of middle childhood through late adolescence using autoregressive latent trajectory and growth-mixture models. Analyses using the dyadic growth curve and the one-with-many design will then examine how relationship dynamics with parents and friends in middle childhood relate to the long-term development of social aggression and victimization. To explore how other specific social processes (e.g., deviant peer talk, co-rumination, prosocial behavior, and provisions of support) in digital communication might relate to psychological adjustment, we propose to conduct additional coding of digital communication, using both Linguistic Interpretive Word Count (LIWC) software and our fine-grained microcoding systems. We will consult with an expert in data anonymization to explore possibilities for de- identifying the large archive of digital communication so that it could studid by other investigators."
"9321455","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: The proposed career development award is designed to support the transition of Dr. Russell Butterfield to an independent physician-scientist and leader in study of the congenital muscular dystrophies. Dr. Butterfield's PhD work in genetic analysis of complex traits to identify susceptibility loci for autoimmune disease gave him a solid foundation in genetics and computational biology. His clinical training in child neurology and neuromuscular disorders has given him a firm foundation in clinical research. His recent work cataloging genotype-phenotype correlations in collagen VI related muscular dystrophies (COL6-RD) and storing patient samples will provide the necessary patient resource to pursue further studies. He has developed computational skills in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data, including RNA-Seq and exome sequencing. Dr. Butterfield has assembled a strong mentoring team with Dr. Gabrielle Kardon as Primary mentor, and Drs. Robert Weiss and Carsten Bonnemann as co-mentors. With the guidance of his mentors, Dr. Butterfield has designed a career development plan to encompass a 5-year period that will build on his previous experience in genetic analysis and develop new skills in gene-targeting, mouse model development, and cellular and molecular biology techniques, and proteomics. During the award period he will receive formal training in gene targeting, microscopy, mass spectroscopy and proteomics, mouse phenotyping, research administration, and leadership. His mentors provide expertise and experience that is both distinct and complementary. They are internationally recognized experts with long and successful track records of funding and trainee mentorship. The work proposed here will fill the gaps in his training in cellular and molecular biology and genetic manipulation of model organisms. In addition, this research will allow him to position himself as a leader in the congenital muscular dystrophies and as a successful independent investigator Research: COL6-RD are inherited disorders of collagen VI characterized by progressive muscle weakness and a combination of distal joint laxity and proximal joint contractures. COL6-RD are increasingly recognized disorders accounting for up to 30% of patients with congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). Children with COL6-RD have life-long neurologic, orthopedic, and pulmonary complications necessitating complex, multispecialty care. There are no treatments. Phenotypic heterogeneity is the hallmark of COL6-RD with a spectrum of severity in patients from the very severe Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) to the milder Bethlem myopathy (BM). Factors controlling severity in COL6-RD patients are largely unknown. Dr. Butterfield's research plan incorporates 3 related aims with a goal to identify factors that control phenotypic heterogeneity in COL6-RD and develop a mouse model that reflects the heterogeneity seen in human COL6- RD. In the first aim, Dr. Butterfield will identify factors intrinsic to the collagen VI genes such as allele specific expression that control severity of human COL6-RD. In the second aim, he will foucs on the genetic modifiers outside the collagen VI genes with a particular focus on LTBP4, a regulator of TGF-? signaling in the extracellular matrix (ECM). LTBP4 has been shown to be a regulator of severity in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and it has been suggested that it may be a modifier of muscular dystrophies common to all muscular dystrophies. In Aim 3, Dr. Butterfield will characterize a novel mouse model for COL-RD. We have designed this mouse model with a dominant negative glycine substitution in the triple helix of Col6a1 flanked by loxP sites, allowing conditional conversion of the dominant negative allele to a null allele. This unique design will allow identification of factors controlling phenotypic heterogeneity in COL6-RD by comparison of dominant negative, null, and haploinsufficient mice in the same model and allows testing of genetic modifiers in a model that more closely reflects human COL6-RD. These studies will provide critical insights into the phenotypic heterogeneity seen in patients with COL6-RD, identify targets for the development of therapies, and provide an important model for future studies of the molecular pathogenesis."
"9347506","ABSTRACT Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of brain and spinal cord motor neurons. Since Riluzole was approved in 1995, over 30 late-phase clinical trials have failed and no additional medications have been approved for ALS. While death from ALS averages 3 to 5 years from onset of symptoms, disease progression displays wide heterogeneity. A typical year-long clinical trial can have 20 to 25% of the patients die from the disease while another similar percentage progresses very slowly if at all. Several meta-analyses of ALS trial data indicate that ALS clinical trials are prone to statistical uncertainty and would benefit from tools that increase statistical sensitivity. It is clear that current statistical tools are inadequate to address the drug development challenges posed by this disease and many other diseases that characteristically exhibit high heterogeneity in disease progression. Using the recently available ALS PRO-ACT data set, our team was recently declared a winner of the DREAM Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life Challenge. Since the contest, we have significantly improved the algorithm, built several additional models and begun to create drug development tools. The goal of this grant is to validate our clinical trial randomization tool and develop a prototype interface for use and testing at clinical trial sites. This prototype will serve as a platform for building a suite of tools based on disease progression predictions of individual patients that will eventually be used for drug development in multiple indications. The key innovation of this work, as it applies to randomizing patients for inclusion in different arms of a clinical trial is that it stratifies patients not by a set of features at the beginning of a trial, but rather by predicted outcome at the end of the trial as if patients in the treatment arm had not received the intervention being tested. An improved trial arm balance will provide a better test of the efficacy of the intervention. This work will focus on the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Demonstrate that, compared to traditional randomization strata, randomization strata defined by predictive algorithms significantly improve the balance of outcome features at the end of a trial period. Aim 2: Work with our clinical partner to develop a prototype platform that will enable an ALS predictive algorithm to be used by on-site investigators for randomization in future clinical trials. The randomization tool is the first in a series of planned tools based on patient level disease progression predictions. These tools will radically change the way early ALS clinical trials are enrolled, simulated and analyzed and will enable the development of similar tools, not only for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson?s and Alzheimer?s, but also for multiple other diseases including diabetes, hospital-acquired infections, heart disease and cancer."

"9272431","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino adolescents have among the highest rates of functionally impairing depressive symptoms, including the highest rates of suicidal behavior. A significant and growing percentage of Latino youth live in poverty, which further increases their risk for depressive symptoms. Although coping skills programs have proven beneficial for preventing or reducing risk for depressive symptoms, low-socioeconomic status (low-SES) Latino youth have among the lowest rates of utilization of conventional mental health services, greatly limiting the effectiveness of these coping programs for this population. Thus, these youth could benefit from alternative approaches to prevention and intervention. A key first step in improving prevention efforts involves the identification of indigenous, accessible, and culturally acceptable processes that support coping and reduce risk for depressive symptoms. Bilingual language development is one such factor that is highly prevalent, but occurs at varying levels of exposure, usage, and proficiency, in low-SES Latino youth. Bilingualism supports the development of executive function (EF), and higher EF has been linked to more adaptive coping and lower levels of depressive symptoms. However, no research has examined associations between bilingualism and depressive symptoms in Latino youth. Therefore, the purpose of the current R03 is to examine the link between degree of bilingualism and the development of depressive symptoms, as well as the potential mediators (EF and coping) of this link, in a sample of low-SES Latino adolescents. We will assess degree of bilingualism, EF, coping and depressive symptoms at baseline and 12 months later in 80 bilingual Latino youth ages 10-13 years old. We focus on this age range because levels of depressive symptoms spike by middle adolescence, making early adolescence a crucial period for prevention and early intervention. Assessments will include youth and parent reports of all variables as well as testing of youth language proficiency and EF. The Specific Aims of the proposed project are to 1) determine the prospective association between degree of bilingualism and development of depressive symptoms over one year in low-SES Latino youth, and 2) assess executive function and coping as potential mediators of the association between bilingualism and development of depressive symptoms over one year. The successful completion of this project will lead to a multi-wave, multi-site R01 proposal to identify pathways from bilingual language development to mental health outcomes in a diverse population of youth. The long-term goal of this line of research is to reduce disparities in depressive symptoms and their health consequences affecting low-SES Latino adolescents and similar high-risk, underserved youth populations."
"9298706","African Americans have the highest rates of hypertension in the world. Effective therapies and awareness of hypertension in African Americans have declined this past decade contributing to further racial disparities in cardiovascular (CV) disease rates and mortality compared to Caucasians. Further, the traditional recommendation for lifestyle management of hypertension with diet and aerobic exercise is based on data obtained from studies involving mostly Caucasians. There are no exercise prescription guidelines for improving blood pressure specific for African Americans and the management of hypertension in this population continues to be problematic. A recent study in our laboratory showed divergent effects of resistance exercise training on blood pressure and arterial function in African Americans compared to Caucasians indicating that resistance exercise may exert more beneficial effects than aerobic exercise on early vascular risk. Thus, the goal of our research program is to determine novel exercise interventions, designed to optimally target arterial function and lower blood pressure in African Americans with pre and stage 1 hypertension. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that is that African Americans with pre-hypertension and stage 1 hypertension will show greater benefit from resistance exercise training on arterial function and blood pressure and retain the benefit longer than aerobic exercise. Conversely, in Caucasians, aerobic exercise will improve arterial function and reduce cardiovascular risk more than resistance exercise. Aim 1 will test the comparative effectiveness of 8-weeks of resistance or aerobic exercise training and de-training on blood pressure in African Americans with pre- and stage 1 hypertension compared to Caucasians. This will be tested with a prospective, randomized, 8 week resistance vs. aerobic exercise training intervention followed by 8 weeks of detraining in African American and Caucasian adults (18-45 years old). Aim 2 will test the comparative effectiveness of 8-weeks of resistance or aerobic exercise training and de-training on 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure and arterial stiffness in central and peripheral arteries in African Americans compared to Caucasians. Aim 3 will determine the effectiveness of 8-weeks of resistance or aerobic exercise training and de-training on arterial function in conduit and resistance arteries of pre- and stage 1 hypertensive African Americans compared to Caucasians. This will be determined in large (brachial artery FMD) and in small (dilation of isolated resistance arteries to acetylcholine and flow) arteries obtained from subcutaneous fat. In vivo determination of arterial function and physiologic approaches of resistance artery functioning are highly relevant to the pathogenesis of hypertension. These studies will serve determine the site and source of improved vascular health after resistance training in African Americans and Caucasians. Relevance: This study will provide clinically important data on how blood pressure can be optimally lowered by exercise and may show that resistance exercise training is the lifestyle intervention of choice for blood pressure lowering in African Americans."
"9264541","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While several recent studies have reported on distinct ligand-dependent GPCR conformations, it remains unclear how these conformations elicit differential downstream responses. In contrast, deciphering G protein selection from functional response is complicated by the myriad of factors that regulate GPCR signaling, including relative abundance and availability of GPCR, G proteins, localization to different membrane surfaces or micro-domains, and the influence of regulatory proteins such as scaffolds, kinases, arrestins and the cellular endocytic apparatus. The proposed research addresses these limitations with a novel class of FRET-based SPASM sensors developed by the PI to systematically modulate protein-protein interactions in live cells. Research will focus o four GPCRs, b2-adrenoceptor (b2-AR), a2A-adrenoceptor, melanocortin4 receptor and b3-adrenoceptor, whose differential G protein selection has important functional consequences in the progression and treatment of heart failure, obesity and diabetes.  Studies in aim 1 utilize sensors that detect the interaction between a GPCR and a peptide derived from the Ga subunit c-terminus, a known determinant of GPCR-G protein pairing. FRET-based measurements will be combined with established approaches to test the hypothesis that GPCRs adopt functionally distinct conformations in a ligand-dependent manner to trigger differential downstream responses. In preliminary studies, specificity of sensor measurements was tested with b2-AR and led to the identification of a functional Gi conformation triggered by the beta-blocker metoprolol. Studies are structured to dissect distinct events in the GPCR-G protein interaction followed by stimulation with canonical and biased agonists.  A clear understanding of the GPCR-G protein interaction and G protein selection from FRET/BRET studies is limited by the lack of control over relative concentration. Studies in aim 2 will leverage the SPASM technique to delineate the sequence of events prior to and after ligand stimulation. Key questions addressed are: (1) is the ligand-free GPCR basally associated or pre-coupled to a G protein? (2) Does the GPCR dissociate from the G protein following ligand-stimulation? (3) Does G protein selection correlate with the inherent binding affinity of a GPCR for a G protein? (4) To what extent is biased signaling influenced by the local concentration of GPCR and G protein? Systematic variation of the concentration of the GPCR-G protein interaction using the SPASM technique will be used to assess the specificity of FRET and downstream responses.  The proposed research has the potential to create a new technical and conceptual platform for future studies on ligand-driven signaling initiated by any GPCR. The extensive validation of the SPASM sensors is an integral part of this study, which in turn will pave the way for their use in live-cell drug screens to identify small molecules that bias GPCR signaling towards therapeutically desired outcomes."
"9250229","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High grade gliomas are uniformly lethal, and resistant to surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The precise cellular and molecular mechanisms by which glioma cells disperse through the brain and grow to form macroscopic symptomatic tumor masses remains poorly understood. Herein we propose to test novel cellular, molecular and mechanistic hypotheses concerning glioma growth, and how to translate this knowledge into new anti-glioma therapeutics. Preliminary work from my laboratory, using confocal, electron and multiphoton microscopy has shown that glioma cells and human glioma stem cells disperse through the brain in vivo by traveling preferentially along the perivascular compartment, a potential migration network surrounding the brain microvasculature. As glioma cells move throughout the perivascular network they dislodge glial endfeet from blood vessels and compromise adjacent brain tissue; this is later replaced by tumor cells. We have also generated preliminary data that a glycan binding protein, galectin-1, is essential for this growth mechanism. Down regulation of galectin-1 abolishes glioma growth in the brain in vivo, without affecting growth in vitro. These new data have several clinical consequences: (i) lymph drains from the brain through the perivascular compartment; its obstruction by gliomas would contribute to glioma-induced edema; (ii) human glioma tumors grow to large size before causing symptoms; glioma cell replacement of atrophied brain tissue could explain protracted and indolent tumor growth, and the delayed changes in total brain volume; (iii) inhibition of galectin-1 could represent a novel treatment of human gliomas. This proposal will (I) test the hypothesis that rodent and human glioma cells, and glioma stem cells grow preferentially along the perivascular space; (II) test the hypothesis that galectin-1 mediates glioma perivascular invasion and growth, and that inhibition of galectin-1 can be used as a novel therapeutic strategy; and (III) test the hypothesis that inhibition of galectin-1 will enhance specific anti-glioma immune responses. By progressing from glioma pathophysiology to molecular mechanisms of glioma migration to experimental therapeutics, we aim for our work to lead to novel early phase clinical translational trials for the treatment of human gliomas. Of note, our first clinical trial for gene therapy of human gliomas is approaching the start of patient recruitment (it was approved by FDA on 4/7/11 [IND 14574] and very recently by the University of Michigan IBC and IRB). Therefore, our laboratory is in a strong and realistic position to guide our research towards the translational implementation of novel clinical trials for this currently deadly human cancer."
"9380403","Abstract: Since angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, antiangiogenic therapies have been explored as a strategy for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, with current therapies, half of the patients do not respond at all, and only every third patient gains a survival benefit. New insights into the biology of tumor neovasculature are therefore urgently needed to improve antiangiogenic therapy. We apply a multidisciplinary bioengineering approach to explore a new promising target for antiangiogenic therapy. By integrating novel tools for in vitro evaluations and in vivo imaging, we are able to gain unprecedented insight into the biological role of prostate- specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in tumor vessels. The expression of PSMA in tumor neovasculature was already described 19 years ago, yet still little is known about its biological role. We hypothesize that PSMA plays an essential role in angiogenesis of tumor vessels and is therefore a potentially promising therapeutic target. [Our preliminary data has shown that active, angiogenic endothelial cells as well as pericytes expressed high levels of PSMA] and that inhibition of PSMA's enzymatic activity severely impaired the formation of new vessels. Here, we are pairing our new biological insight with innovative technologies to further explore the role of PSMA in tumor neovasculature toward a new antiangiogenetic therapy. To examine the biological role of PSMA in tumor vessels, we will utilize significant bioengineering advancements that will allow us to make direct observations that were previously not possible: (i) A novel cell culturing system for the visualization of PSMA expression over time in EC [and co-cultured other cells such as pericytes; (ii) A prototype microfluidic system to grow a fully vascularized tumor on a chip, allowing us to directly observe the role of PSMA in tumor vascularization; and (iii) A prototype high-resolution optoacoustic scanner to globally interrogate the vasculature and molecular signatures (such as PSMA) in a developing tumor in vivo. Using these tools, developed by a unique consortium of distinctive experts, we will obtain valuable insights into tumor angiogenesis that were not previously possible. Ultimately, we will explore PSMA inhibition as a promising antiangiogenic therapy. We propose to test our hypothesis with three specific aims: In Aim 1, we will explore the role of PSMA in angiogenesis with a new culture method and the microfluidic chip system. We will assess the interplay of PSMA with other markers of angiogenesis and evaluate PSMA inhibition to impair angiogenesis. In Aim 2, we will use the new optoacoustic scanner to explore the role of PSMA in a living, developing tumor. In Aim 3, we will explore the inhibition of PSMA as a novel anti-angiogenetic therapy and monitor tumor development with optoacoustic imaging. Ultimately, this proposal will lead not only to a deeper understanding of PSMA biology but also to a new anti-angiogenetic therapy approach for cancer. [We will also have established novel methods to study tumor vasculature and the tumor microenvironment in a unique way.]"
"9284282","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The placenta mediates the transfer of respiratory gases, water, ions, and nutrients between mother and fetus, provides an immunological interface for fetal allograft survival, and secretes a vast array of signaling molecules to optimiz pregnancy physiology. Placental dysfunction evolves when one or more of these processes are dysregulated. The maladapted placenta predisposes to clinical syndromes characterized by sub-optimal fetal growth, known as intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR), or hypertensive disorders such as preeclampsia (PE), which jeopardize both the fetus and mother. Current methods for assessing placental transport and secretion in vivo are limited, and assessment of oxygen status in the human fetus currently depends on indirect measures, such as monitoring heart rate and biophysical parameters that are affected by hypoxia. The overall goal of this grant is to develop and validate robust, non-invasive imaging technologies for placental function assessment that will readily translate to human studies. We propose to apply state-of-the-art, non-invasive imaging modalities to compare and contrast transport functions, metabolism, and oxygen concentrations during placental development of control C57BL/6 pregnant mice with three mouse models of pregnancy pathology, which simulate hypoxia, IUGR, or PE. We will extend our pre-clinical studies for the direct measurement of placental oxygenation in the mouse models and pursue proof-of-principle studies to determine oxygen transport and hemoglobin saturation in the human placenta in situ in control, uncomplicated pregnancies and pregnancies with IUGR, between 32-37 weeks' gestation. Finally, we propose to use phage display in preclinical mouse placental models, with validation in ex vivo human term placentas from normal, IUGR and PE pregnancies, with the goal of discovery novel peptide imaging targets that may serve as markers of pregnancy disorders or that may offer a means for targeted drug delivery to the fetoplacental unit. We will accomplish our goal of imaging placental function and development by developing and validating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and positron emission tomography (PET) methods to probe mouse placental function, transport, and metabolism. Experiments in the pre-clinical models will include mapping of perfusion, oxygen saturation and transfer, and placental fluid dynamics by MRI, and measurement of fetoplacental nutrient transport and metabolic function, using hyperpolarized 13C MRS and PET. A proof-of-principle study in normal and IUGR pregnancies will assess the clinical translation of the oxygen saturation/transfer method for the direct measurement of oxygen content in maternal and fetal blood within the human placenta. The success of this proposal will yield new, practical, non- invasive approaches for determining placental function and metabolism."
"9285607","Identification of the structural, architectural, cellular and molecular basis for the skeletal phenotypes that  result from genetic/pharmacologic interventions and disease states is essential for translating scientific  discoveries into therapeutic innovations. The goal of the Skeletal Phenotyping Core is to provide costefficient,  state ofthe art, quality-controlled skeletal phenotyping services to fulfill the unmet needs of junior  investigators who are transitioning to an independent career in skeletal biology, of established investigators  who are new to skeletal biology and of established skeletal biologists. A key part ofthe mission ofthe  Skeletal Phenotyping Core will be education, mentoring and incorporation of novel and innovative services to  meet the needs ofthe constituent investigators. Consultation regarding experimental design, specimen  handling and data analysis will be provided by Core directors, to insure that the maximal amount of data can  be obtained from each specimen/subject. The Core will host didactic teaching sessions, hands-on  workshops and seminars designed to educate investigators and to foster collaboration among investigators.  A special focus ofthe Core will be mentorship of junior investigators and of those investigators new to  skeletal biology. This infrastructure and these activities will 1) enhance the productivity and expand the  scope of research being conducted by the Core investigators, 2) promote innovation and incorporation of  novel technologies into core services 3) foster synergy across a large and diverse community interested in  skeletal research, ultimately leading to levels of success greater than the sum of the individual investigators'  projected achievements. This will be achieved by the following specific Aims: Aim 1: Provide efficient, high-quality, state-of-the-art skeletal phenotyping services that are not readily supported by individual research grants; Aim 2: Provide shared resources, training, and educational services to support new investigators in skeletal biology and to facilitate collaboration among core investigators."
"9297381","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this collaborative project among investigators led by Drs. Michael Boehnke at the University of Michigan, Steven McCarroll of Harvard University and the Broad Institute, and Carlos Pato at the University of Southern California, is to use high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify genes and pathways that contribute to the risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and to construct a data resource for future genetic studies of these and other psychiatric disorders. This proposal builds on active collaborations among our groups on these important disorders and more generally on our experience in building genome variation resources, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, that are used throughout human genetics. Our research team combines strengths in high-throughput genetics and genomics, development and application of innovative computational and statistical analyses that maximize the benefits of new technologies, and leadership of large scientific consortia. In four Specific Aims, we propose whole genome sequencing (at ~30x coverage) and statistical analysis of 10,000 well-phenotyped and re-contactable individuals from the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (GPC), equally divided among schizophrenia cases, bipolar cases, and psychiatrically normal controls, and comprised of equal numbers of European-Ancestry (EA), African-Ancestry (AA), and Latino individuals. We will carry out association analysis comparing schizophrenia cases to controls, bipolar cases to controls, and the combined cases to controls in the resulting sequence data, and by collaboration and meta-analysis with other investigators with relevant sequence data that become available. We will also use these sequence data as part of a reference panel to impute into tens of thousands of other genomes in the broader Psychiatric GWAS Consortium (PGC) data to allow association analysis based on substantially larger numbers of individuals. Finally, we will share data and methods to support similar studies of other psychiatric phenotypes and more broadly across the scientific community. The successful completion of these aims will provide new insights into molecular etiology that could catalyze breakthroughs in the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."
"9211440","PROJECT IV: PRENATAL SCREENING AND MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR CRITICAL CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE IN MISSISSIPPI, A RURAL AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATION SUMMARY Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the leading cause of infant deaths due to birth defects, occurring in nearly 40,000 newborns in the U.S. each year (~1% of all live births), and are one of the most common reasons for the use of health services among children with chronic conditions. Twenty five percent of CHDs are critical CHDs (CCHD), defined as those requiring surgical or catheter intervention in the first year of life for survival. In Mississippi (MS), the incidence of some CCHDs is higher than in other similar U.S. populations. The origins of most CHDs are thought to be multifactorial, involving genetic and environmental factors yet to be identified. Thus the reasons for the increased incidence of CCHDs in MS are unknown.  Mississippi has one of the highest rates of obesity in the US, especially among African Americans. There have been few studies done evaluating the role of maternal obesity and the incidence of CCHD. Whether obesity and concomitant type II diabetes contribute to the increased incidence of CCHD in MS is not clear. Thus the studies proposed in this application will test the hypothesis that obesity and type II diabetes contribute to the increased incidence of CCHD in MS.  Another potential reason for the increased incidence of CCHDs in MS may be undiagnosed consanguinity (blood relation between parents) among affected couples. According to 2012 US census data, approximately 72% of MS residents were born in MS. Limited migration among residents of MS compared to other states suggests that some level of unknown consanguinity might be prevalent. Thus the studies in this application will test the hypothesis that undiagnosed consanguinity among parents contributes to the elevated incidence of CCHD in MS.  Improvement in prenatal screening is another challenge for MS. Because many MS residents live in rural areas with limited access to specialized health care during pregnancy, the need to improve prenatal screening of CCHDs is imperative. Thus development and standardization of novel methods of fetal sonography screening are needed to improve in utero detection of CCHDs and development of novel and cost- effective telehealth-based protocol for echocardiographic (ECHO) prenatal CCHD screening could improve detection rate of CCHDs in underserved areas. The specific aims of this project include: 1) to test the hypothesis that maternal obesity and type II diabetes (DM) contribute to the increased incidence of CCHD in infants in MS; 2) to test the hypothesis that undiagnosed consanguinity among parents in MS contributes to the increased incidence of CCHD in MS; 3) to test the hypothesis that a standardized scoring system utilizing a limited number of sonographic images obtained at routine obstetric evaluation can reliably identify fetuses with CCHD or features suggestive/high risk of CCHD, indicating a need for full echocardiographic evaluation.

"9353442","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transport of proteins throughout the cell is a highly regulated process that is a fundamental aspect of cell biology. The endosomal protein recycling pathway is one important cellular transport process which promotes the rescue of proteins destined for degradation in the lysosome by recycling them back to the Golgi or plasma membrane from endosomes. A major contributor to this fundamental cellular process is the WASH protein. WASH is part of the WASP family of actin nucleation promoting factors and specifically promotes actin assembly on endosomes to facilitate protein recycling. Importantly, WASH and endosomal protein recycling have been linked to a number of human diseases, including hereditary sporadic paraplegia, Alzheimer's, autism, and cancer. Furthermore, this cellular process is required for the transport of lethal pathogenic toxins, such as cholera, ricin, and anthrax to their site of action. Therefore, understanding the function and regulation of WASH has important implication on human health. WASH is held in an auto-inhibited state due to its incorporation into a multi-subunit complex, referred to as the WASH regulatory complex or SHRC. Recently, we described how WASH is activated by ubiquitination. Non- canonical K63-linked ubiquitination of WASH by the MAGE-L2-TRIM27 E3 ubiquitin ligase is an essential event in WASH activation, generation of endosomal F-actin, and endosomal protein recycling. Utilizing a number of in vitro biochemical and cellular approaches, this project aims to determine the mechanisms and signaling pathways regulating WASH activity through post-translational modifications. These studies are important for our understanding of WASH-mediated endosomal protein recycling, breaking critical barriers to treating human diseases associated with manipulation of this cellular process, and advancing our scientific knowledge of this fundamental cellular process."
"9281043","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondria are abundant and critically important subcellular organelles whose organization and ultrastructure are complex but unexplained. This multi-PI multiscale modeling proposal seeks to use a combination of mathematical modeling and biological experiments to test the overall hypothesis that the nanoscopic ultrastructure of cardiac mitochondria accounts for the ultimate success of mitochondrial function. Mitochondria in rat cardiac ventricular myocytes will be used in the planned modeling and biological experiments. Our preliminary experiments and published data indicate that the planned work is feasible and that the three PIs can succeed in this ambitious and challenging proposal.  Freshly isolated rat cardiac ventricular myocytes and those in short-term (1-3 days) culture will be prepared in the Lederer lab and imaged with electron microscope (EM) tomography by the Mannella team and analyzed quantitatively and interactively by the three PIs. Living cells will be examined by the Lederer team using confocal and super-resolution Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM). The quantitative spatial and functional data obtained from EM tomography and live cell imaging will be used to inform and constrain the multi-scale 3D modeling of mitochondria centered in the Jafri lab. The planned iterative approach to biological experiments and mathematical modeling will enable this investigation to define the structural basis for mitochondrial function for the first time. Finally, the proposed investigation seeks to include modeling of mitochondria under control conditions, when mitochondria are stressed by simple interventions and when mitochondria are altered by pressure-overload heart failure. This work therefore will not only provide fundamental new information on how mitochondria function but will also lay the foundation for novel therapies in mitochondrially involved diseases."
"9314307","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug metabolism, programmed cell death, DNA biosynthesis and repair, respiration, and photosynthesis all occur via electron-transfer (ET) reaction mechanisms. As such, the malfunction of ET pathways is an underlying cause of numerous human diseases. Since ET is a process common to all forms of life, a molecular-level understanding of the ET pathways in pathogenic organisms may be exploited for therapeutic advantage as well. The long-term objective of our research is to understand, at the molecular level, how biological structure and dynamics control the rates of critical ET reactions. Theoretical progress from our laboratory over two decades has found that protein structure and dynamics determine ET reaction mechanisms and rates, and we have established useful methods to predict these rates. We have also come to understand that structured water can play an essential role in mediating electron flow. In the last grant period, we found that very long- range multi-step electron hopping establishes ET pathways in some anaerobic bacteria. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to understand the mechanism that couples long-distance electron transfer, in the proximity of a water filled protein cleft, to substrate catalysi in monooxygenases, and (2) to understand a new mechanism for micron to centimeter distance charge flow in bacterial appendages. The former reactions are essential for the processing of hormones and neurotransmitters in higher eukaryotes and the latter reactions are essential for metabolism in some anaerobic bacteria. In the case of monooxygenase function, we will use theoretical methods to understand the origins of the very effective coupling of the ET reaction to catalysis, namely the close synchronization of electron delivery over long distances to the chemistry of covalent bond formation. In the case of long distance ET along bacterial charge transfer conduits, also known as bacterial nanowires, we will employ a new theoretical framework to describe flickering resonant transport, a mixed incoherent-coherent regime of ET, and will assess viable mechanisms in these fascinating micrometer-to-centimeter distance regime ET reactions. Reaching our aim of establishing molecular- level predictive theories of biological ET could lead to new strategies to address the malfunction of electron transfer pathways, to understand the origins of oxidative stress, and to disrupt the essential redox chains of pathogenic organisms. The research described here will be carried out using a combination of approaches from statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics. The hallmark of our research has been the close collaboration of our theoretical research program with cutting-edge experimental groups, and this essential strategy will continue into the next research cycle."
"9323613","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) is the most common acquired chronic autoimmune neuropathy and is characterized by demyelination and immune cell infiltration of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). CIDP is associated with progressive Weaknesses, paresthesias, and sensory dysfunction and is the chronic counterpart of Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Current treatments for CIDP have non-specific mechanisms of action and are ineffective in one-third of patients. Understanding the immune tolerance defects that result in PNS autoimmunity is critical for developing more effective, mechanism-based therapies. CIDP has recently been reported in rare patients with mutations in the Autoimmune Regulator (AIRE) gene. In parallel, we reported that mice with a dominant Aire G228W patient mutation on the autoimmune-prone NOD background (NOD.AireGW/+ mice) spontaneously develop autoimmune peripheral neuropathy that shares multiple features with sporadic CIDP. Together, these findings suggest that Aire plays an important role in preventing PNS autoimmunity in both mice and humans. Aire is a putative thymic transcription factor which promotes immune tolerance by upregulating thymic self-antigen expression and negative selection of self- reactive T cells, enhancing regulatory T cell development, and preventing B cell activation and autoantibody production. We hypothesize that these immunoregulatory mechanisms affected by Aire are also those important in maintaining immune tolerance towards the PNS. The NOD.AireGW/+ mouse therefore represents a valuable model for determining the immune tolerance defects underlying PNS autoimmunity. To this end, we propose to utilize our Aire-deficient model to: 1) identify the primary inciting PNS autoantigen(s) expressed in the thymus, 2) determine how Aire-deficiency alters the development of regulatory T cells important in suppressing PNS autoimmunity, and 3) determine the role of autoantibodies in Aire-mediated PNS autoimmunity. Because Aire affects tolerance mechanisms that are also disrupted in common autoimmune diseases, findings from this study will be applicable not only to the minority of patients with Aire mutations and CIDP, but also to sporadic CIDP patients who do not have Aire mutations. Additionally, findings from these studies will contribute to a broader understanding of how Aire functions to prevent autoimmunity."
"9288177","The binding of a fully flexible peptide, loop, or terminus of a protein to a relatively structured site on the surface of its molecular partner is a prevalent type of a transient macromolecular interaction that mediates the majority of recognition and signaling cascades. While spanning a wide range of affinities, such interactions uniformly involve a structured and an unstructured partner that may exist as independent entities in the absence of one another and only associate for a limited period of time resulting in conformational changes, recruitment or dissociation of other proteins to/from the complex, and activation or inhibition of the downstream pathways. Synthetic peptide modulators of protein-peptide interactions are frequently promising therapeutic candidates in cancer, inflammation and endocrine disorders. Despite the critical importance of transient protein-peptide interactions for biomedical research and therapeutic discovery, only a small fraction of these complexes are amenable to experimental structure determination. Therefore, only accurate peptide docking may lead to a breakthrough in structural understanding of protein-peptide interactions. Yet for peptides longer than 6-8 amino acids, the overwhelming size and complexity of the conformational search space, the inevitable inaccuracies in the binding site representation due to induced fit, inefficient or insufficiently thorough sampling, and accumulation of scoring function errors prohibit the accurate determination of peptide binding poses and interactions by computational methods. The present proposal intends to dramatically expand the range of peptide and protein sizes for which accurate complex geometry prediction can be achieved by global conformational optimization. This advance will be made by pursuing two Specific Aims: (Aim 1) Development and optimization of a reliable peptide cross-docking procedure using chemical field-enhanced binding site representations and improved entropy calculations in the stochastic global conformational search in internal coordinates; and (Aim 2) Extension of the developed protocol to specific biological projects with experimental validation of the predicted geometries and peptide variants. The innovative strategies proposed in Aim 1 include using a new force field, the enrichment of binding site representations with chemical fields, and the optimal conformational expansion of the pocket for induced fit. The targets of Aim 2 include complexes of Class A and B GPCRs with their protein and peptide modulators and G-protein ?i interactions with GEF peptides. The attainment of the aims of this proposal will lead to breakthrough advances in flexible macromolecular docking. It will result in valuable software tools, protocols and shared resources for the biological community. It will also lead to discovery of new peptide modulators of important therapeutic, immune, and diagnostic targets."
"9272738","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Marital disruption disproportionately affects low-income black couples. To understand the unique experiences of black families, ethnographic research suggests that the lives of black couples are affected not only by structural elements of their environments, but by the social networks within which couples are embedded. Yet to date there has been no research directly examining the social networks of low-income couples, despite repeated suggestions that these networks should play an especially important role in the lives of black families in low-income communities.  The overarching goal of the proposed research is to address this oversight through a four- wave longitudinal study of 150 black and 150 white low-income newlywed couples across the first three years of their marriage. A social network interview, administered at each assessment, will be combined with self-reports of personal history, marital quality, and experiences of stress and discrimination, and census data on neighborhood characteristics, videotaped observations of marital interactions, and interviewer ratings of the home environment.  These data will be used to: 1) Describe and compare the social networks of low-income white and black newlywed couples; 2) Describe change in the social networks of black and white newlyweds over the first years of marriage; 3) Evaluate the associations between social network characteristics and marital outcomes.  In particular, the proposed research will evaluate the support for three distinct models of how social networks may affect the development of marriages. The Support Model emphasizes how the composition and structure of a couple's social network shapes the transfer of social support between network members and the couple. The Constraint Model suggests that the structure of spouses' shared networks can operate as a constraint on leaving the relationship, and can reduce each partner's exposure to potential alternative relationships. The Social Norms Model addresses ways that the presence of married couples in a couple's network conveys expectations for marriage.  The proposed research would be the first to evaluate and compare the support for each of these models, the first to describe the composition and structure of social networks in this population, the first to directly compare the networks of black and white couples of comparable income, and the first to link social network characteristics to observational data on marital interactions and longitudinal data on marital outcomes. Together, the results of the proposed research will inform future directions for programs and policies aimed at improving the lives of low-income couples and reducing racial disparities in marital outcomes within low- income communities."

The Node 1) designs and implements clinical trials of evidence-based treatments of addiction through rapid recruitment of diverse study participants in partnership with NIDA and the CTN, 2) generates peer-reviewed publications in collaboration with treatment providers and other nodes, and 3) uses the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Regional Research and Training Center includes talented faculty and staff from Oregon Health & Science Center and University of California, San Francisco as well as leaders of affiliated healthcare partners providing integrated primary care and substance use disorder treatment. The Node was created in 2010 as an amalgam of two CTN Nodes--California-Arizona and Oregon/Hawaii (a charter member of the CTN). The Node was highly successful, during the current award, participating in 10 CTN trials, co-leading two of these and leading one; reporting results of CTN main studies, ancillary, and research using the CTN platform in 100+ publications, and actively disseminating evidence- based practices in 200 presentations. Node investigators also sought and received awards for 10 studies that used the CTN as a platform for research. Eight WS Node healthcare programs recruited over 1,300 participants into CTN studies. In the coming grant period the Node expands to include three national and regional primary care and HIV primary care research networks: OCHIN, the HIV Research Network, and the Oregon Rural Practice-Based Research Network (ORPRN). The Node retains core addiction treatment centers experienced in CTN protocols and exploits their links with primary care: Adapt (Roseburg, OR), CODA (Portland, OR) HealthRIGHT 360 (San Francisco, CA), La Frontera (Tucson, AZ), NARA (Portland, OR), and Signal Behavioral Health Network (Denver, CO). The Node's research agenda proposes study concepts that evaluate three strategies to integrate and enhance addiction treatment within healthcare settings. Study 1 builds a patient registry for HCV infection and tests a multi-contact brief intervention for alcohol use. Study 2 extends the registry testing a candidate therapeutic HIV vaccine. Study 3, a test of reverse integration (primary care clinicians in addiction treatment settings), assesses naloxone distribution and education to reduce fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses and measures impact on return to use. Finally the WS Node continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. The Node has the potential to accelerate the advancement of integrated primary care and addiction in the coming years."
"9218617","ABSTRACT At any one time, tens of thousands of children are living with serious illness and they and their families endure a high degree of suffering. While national recommendations call for early palliative care (PC) integration for seriously ill children to ease suffering, very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated whether PC improves child and family outcomes. In prior work, the investigators developed the Pediatric Quality of Life and Evaluation of Symptoms Technology (PediQUEST/PQ), a software that collects electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (e-PROMS) and generates feedback reports. The effect of using PQ to provide feedback on child's symptoms and health related quality of life (HRQoL) to families and providers was tested in a three-site RCT, within the well established Pediatric PC Research Network, among 104 children ?2 years old with advanced cancer. The study demonstrated the feasibility of conducting a multisite RCT in this patient population, and an ability to obtain child self-report. Findings also included (a) high levels of child symptom distress, (b) association between higher symptom distress and worse HRQoL, (c) high parental psychological distress linked to child suffering, and (d) trends towards better HRQoL in the intervention arm. Subsequent formative research led to identification of barriers to improving symptom management including families and providers ?normalizing distress?, limited use of non-pharmacological treatment strategies, and limited early involvement of PC. Based on Wilson-Cleary's HRQoL model, and informed by these results, the PI and research team developed PQ Response (Response to Pediatric Oncology Symptom Experience). The intervention includes an enhanced PQ system (web-based), coupled with early integration of a PC consulting team (Response team). This dual strategy seeks to standardize the report of symptom distress using PQ feedback, and the providers' response to such distress, trained to include a series of steps in their assessment and interaction with the family including treatment and preventive strategies and family activation regarding symptom control. Pilot work for PQ Response found it feasible, well received by families and oncologists, and potentially effective. Thus, the over-riding aim of this study is to conduct a RCT of PQ Response versus usual care at four large pediatric oncology centers among children ?2 years old with advanced cancer (n=136). Hypotheses include a) children receiving the intervention will have better (higher) HRQoL scores b) parents of children in the intervention group will report better state-anxiety, depression and HRQoL and c) intervention group families will demonstrate higher levels of activation. Parents and children (if ?5 years old) in both arms will answer weekly PQ- Surveys for 16 weeks; parent anxiety, depression, and HRQoL will be assessed every 4-weeks; and parent activation every 8 weeks. Hypotheses will be tested using mixed effects models. The study will provide data on outcomes of early PC integration, use of e-PROMS and parent activation strategies in pediatrics, which are important knowledge gaps in palliative care research, and is well aligned with three key themes defined in NINR's strategic plan: science of symptoms, increased self-management, and palliative care."
"9276972","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a Maximizing Investigator's Research Award (MIRA) submitted by Professor Mary (Molly) Carnes at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Dr. Carnes' research program focuses on diversifying the scientific workforce. She has consistently taken a systems approach, conducting action research with multi-tiered interventions at the individual and institutional level. With funding from NIGMS since 2009, her research has focused on the myriad ways cultural stereotypes impede the entry, persistence, and advancement of all women and underrepresented racial/ethnic minority men and women in academic medicine, science, and engineering. Often outside of conscious awareness, stereotypes can shape the decisions of those in the scientific workforce who determine who to fund, mentor, admit or hire and also influence potential scientists-to-be, who need to determine whether a career in science is right for them and whether they ?fit? in the scientific workforce. Hallmarks of Dr. Carnes' research have been deploying methods appropriate to the research question (experimental, quasi-experimental, and qualitative), engaging researchers from multiple other disciplines (e.g., sociology, psychology, education, systems engineering, linguistics, public health, computer science), developing and testing theoretically-informed interventions, translating evidence-based strategies into practice, and studying the impact of implementation. Approaching unconscious (?implicit?) stereotype-based bias as a habit, Dr. Carnes' team developed and experimentally verified the first effective intervention to help faculty break the gender bias habit (with subsequent improvement in department climate and greater diversity in hiring), created an interactive video game that addresses implicit race bias in graduate school, performed the first text analysis of R01 critiques and found paradoxically worse scores with greater verbal acclamation for women's vs. men's R01 renewals, and constructed and videorecorded authentic NIH study sections to analyze verbal and non-verbal discourse among reviewers to identify patterns that may be consequential to the outcome of an R01 peer review. MIRA would continue the momentum of Dr. Carnes' research program by providing the opportunity to broaden the habit-breaking workshop intervention to include race and other group bias and test its effectiveness beyond a single site, and continue to use text mining to probe for implicit gender and race bias in gatekeeping evaluations (e.g, reviews of manuscripts and K awards). MIRA would also capitalize on the datasets compiled through Dr. Carnes' research program which include 5 waves of the Study of Faculty Worklife at UW-Madison with retained identifiers, >5,000 R01 Summary Statements from investigators' awarded in 2010-2014, 15 hours of videorecording of expert scientists discussing R01 proposals in simulated study sections, and transcribed interviews with >40 experienced NIH reviewers."
"9405717","Abstract Innate immune response is the first line of defense against invading pathogens. The cytosolic RIG-I receptor is defined as a pattern recognition receptor for viral RNA. Upon binding to RNA, RIG-I dimerizes with its downstream mitochondrion antiviral signaling (MAVS) adaptor protein to initiate innate immune signaling that culminates in antiviral cytokine production, thus establishing an antiviral state. Human herpesviruses are one of the most ubiquitous pathogens that cause pronounced diseases in immunocompromised individuals. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the leading causative agent in morbidity and mortality in AIDS patients. Recently, we have found that KSHV infection also activates the RIG-I- and MAVS-dependent innate immune pathway. However, KSHV hijacks these signaling cascades to promote viral infection. This exploratory project aims to address the molecule mechanism by which KSHV manipulates the MAVS adaptor molecule to prevent antiviral interferon production. Our work will define an intricate immune evasion strategy deployed by a stealthy lymphotropic virus and reveal key viral and host factors that may be targeted for antiviral therapy."
"9330873","PROJECT SUMMARY To engage in productive social interactions, an animal must modulate its behavior based on the current situa- tion. Neural and genetic factors regulating homeostatic behaviors (e.g., feeding and sleeping) have been well studied, but the genetic mechanisms by which social behaviors are adjusted remain largely unexplored. Social behaviors are intrinsically more complex than homeostatic behaviors, because in a social context an animal must take into account its own internal state (e.g., hunger, arousal), as well as the reactions and perceived in- tentions of the other individual. Understanding how behavior-related neural circuits are modulated in these con- texts may shed light on human neural disorders that compromise patients' ability to interact with others (e.g., schizophrenia and autism). To identify genetic elements that correlate with behavioral phenotypes, genome- wide association studies have been performed involving patients with psychiatric disorders or animal models. Results from these approaches have been difficult to interpret, however, because: (1) most identified mutations had a small effect, 2) causality between mutation and behavioral phenotype often could not be established, and 3) mutations generally did not involve neuromodulators and neurohormonal systems known to control these processes. To develop more direct approaches for tackling this problem, researchers have turned to Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibits a rich repertoire of stereotypical social behaviors. The Drosophila sys- tem allows for precise genetic alterations, and the labeling and functional manipulation of specific cell types, making it an attractive model for studying how genes control behavioral choice by affecting specific neuronal populations. Research into fly agonistic behavior has been particularly informative, as specific neurons ex- pressing the neuropeptide tachykinin, which functions as a neuromodulator, have been shown to promote ag- gression. However, elements that dampen aggression levels have not been found. Using an RNAi screening approach, five genes that negatively regulate aggression were identified. Proposed research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which these genes control the intensity of agonistic interactions. These genes encode: (1) the neuropeptide FMRFamide, which may function as a neuromodulator to suppress agonistic be- havior, (2 and 3) PKA-R2 and nervy, which act downstream of G-protein coupled receptors and therefore may regulate signaling of aggression-promoting neuromodulators such as tachykinin, (4) TBPH, a transcriptional repressor implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, and (5) Gr21a, a CO2 co-receptor. Finally, interplay be- tween these negative regulators of aggression and known aggression promoters will be studied. As previous work on the genetics of Drosophila aggression has consistently identified genes that regulate mammalian ag- gression, the proposed project promises to illuminate genetic and neuronal networks that dynamically regulate agonistic interaction across animal phyla. Such knowledge will fill critical gap in our understanding about how genes influence social behaviors through specific neurons and circuits."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks are uniquely positioned for genomic discovery and for implementing genomic medicine to improve patient care. In eMERGE I, we leveraged an EHR-linked biobank, high-density genotyping data, and electronic phenotyping algorithms to discover 29 genetic loci associated with cardiovascular traits. In eMERGE II we began implementing genomic medicine by conducting an EHR-based randomized clinical trial of disclosing genomic risk of coronary heart disease and incorporating pharmacogenomic information in the EHR with linkage to clinical decision support. In eMERGE III; we propose to build on our prior work to conduct a genomic medicine implementation project to establish mechanisms for return of actionable findings from targeted sequencing of 100 disease-relevant genes. Focusing on two common genetic disorders-familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and familial colorectal cancer (CRC)-we will begin to translate genomic discovery and implementation efforts in eMERGE to impact public health. We will obtain informed consent from 3000 participants of Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester MN and Phoenix AZ who have moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps. DNA will be sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 100 disease genes. We will use state-of-the-art methods to classify variant pathogenicity, finalize actionable variants for return, examine near-term outcomes, economic implications and behavioral and psychosocial consequences of such return. We will also conduct genomic discovery leveraging a network-wide data set of ~25,000 individuals with sequence data and an existing network-wide data set of ~50,000 individuals with high-density genotype data linked to the EHR. We will exploit the unique potential of the EHR to assess pleiotropy using novel approaches. In partnership with Mountain Park Health Center, a primary care practice that serves a minority population of Mexican Americans in Phoenix AZ, we will contribute high-density genotyping and phenotype data on 1000 Hispanics for genomic discovery and pilot mechanisms for implementing genomic medicine at this site."
"9322825","Project Summary More than 1.5 million infants each year are born with in utero exposure to HIV infection. While prevention of mother to child transmission successfully prevents congenital infection, HIV exposed but uninfected infants (HEU) are more susceptible to common enteric and respiratory infections than their unexposed counterparts, and have higher mortality rate. The precise immunologic alterations that are responsible for this phenomenon among HEU infants have never been clearly characterized. Studies conducted after widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have shown less pronounced differences in morbidity and mortality between HIV exposed and unexposed infants. We believe that the immune perturbations associated with in utero HIV exposure are mitigated by effective ART and the longer the control of the HIV infection is during gestation, the less immune alterations and clinical risk of disease the infant will experience. In this study, we will test the hypothesis that infants born to mothers with suppressed HIV infection since conception will have adaptive immune responses similar to HIV-unexposed infants while infants exposed to high level of HIV infection through most of pregnancy will have a dysregulated adaptive immune response. We propose a longitudinal analysis of adaptive immune subsets in HEU infants, comparing three well-characterized mother-infant cohorts from a single health center in Malawi, where, as in much of sub-Saharan Africa, women often receive their first HIV diagnosis when they present for antenatal care late in pregnancy. In this setting, we will enroll (1) infants born to women diagnosed with HIV infection at the first antenatal visit after 26 weeks gestation, thus exposed to uncontrolled viremia for over half of the pregnancy, (2) infants born to women on ART with undetectable viral loads before conception, and (3) HIV unexposed infants born to HIV uninfected mothers. All HIV-infected women will receive the same ART regimen and will breastfeed their infants during the 9-month follow up period. We will assess the adaptive immune response by probing the immune system at birth, 4 and 9 months of age with both polyclonal stimuli and routine immunization antigens, to which all infants will be exposed in the first three months of life. We will compare differentiation, activation levels and antigen specific T and B cell responses for the three groups of infants, applying state-of-the-art technology for detailed and comprehensive analyses. This will be the most comprehensive longitudinal assessment of the impact of HIV exposure on the development of the adaptive immune responses in infants. The results will provide important evidence for public health policy in helping to determine the optimal timing of ART treatment to maximize infant health and survival."
"9346083","Summary Statement: Administrative Core The primary objective of MPC?s Administrative Core is to maximize the productivity of MPC researchers by reducing administrative burdens. The MPC Administrative Core aims to provide effective leadership for the Center by coordinating activities across cores and planning for the continued progress of the Center; to increase productivity of all MPC employees and members by maintaining excellent facilities and offering cost-effective services; and to assist MPC principal investigators by reducing administrative burdens of research, particularly those related to grants, fiscal management, and human resources. The administrative staff is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Center and for planning for the continued development of MPC. Services fall into the following categories: communications and coordination, policy and planning, operations management, human resources administration, and fiscal and grants management. The Administrative Core director is MPC Director Steven Ruggles. Communications and coordination: The Administrative Core keeps members and staff up to date on policies and procedures, informs them of new initiatives, and responds to member requests for services. Policy and planning: The Advisory Board and Director take a lead role in policy development for the Center as well as in long-range and strategic planning. The Administrative Core arranges monthly meetings of the Advisory Board and semi- annual membership meetings to coordinate these activities, as well as managing communication with the Board and membership regarding policy and planning. Operations management: The Administrative Core ensures that all research projects have outstanding facilities in which to work. Human resources administration: In addition to efficiently handling routine HR tasks for MPC?s 185 staff members, Admin Core staff exert considerable effort on recruitment and retention of a world class staff. Grants and fiscal management: The most critical function of the Administrative Core is management of our grant portfolio. The Core is responsible for coordinating and monitoring all aspects of MPC finances, including the Center?s large and complex grants portfolio. All MPC members are eligible to use MPC administrative services. Without the Administrative Core, the most productive MPC researchers would be forced to devote a large percentage of their time to tasks such as human resources and grant administration. This would be an inefficient investment of resources, from both a scientific and an economic perspective."
"9281851","ABSTRACT Project 3 A largely unresolved problem of in vivo gene therapy with adeno-associated viruses (AAV) is re-administration of vector, which is often diminished by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to the AAV capsid that are generated as a result of the first vector administration. The impact of NAbs on vector delivery is greatest when the vector is infused into the circulation, which is the route of administration being used for liver delivery in the treatment of metabolic diseases that are the subject of this P01. Furthermore, approximately 20% of human populations have NAbs against AAV8 due to natural infections which could interfere with the initial treatment. We propose complementary and potentially synergistic approaches for circumventing the inhibitory effects of NAbs. First, we will create a capsid that is capable of high level transduction of human liver but is serologically distinct from the first generation vector based on AAV8; recent data from the Wilson Lab suggests that this can be accomplished with engineered versions of the previously isolated capsid AAV3B. Populations of AAV3B capsid mutagenized in hypervariable regions will be selected in a mouse which harbors a human liver xenograft and has been passively transferred with human AAV NAbs. Candidate capsids that emerge from these selections will be further characterized in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to identify a second generation vector called AAV3Be which will be evaluated for efficacy in a mouse with a liver xenograft derived from human hoFH hepatocytes. We will also study in NHPs the potential of a short course of immune modulation at the time of AAV8 vector delivery to block the formation of NAbs and to enable re-adminstration with an AAV8 or AAV3Be vector."
"9263699","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Sentence comprehension deficits are ubiquitous in persons with aphasia although they can be mild or severe and variable over short or long periods of time. It is difficult to explain the variability and differences in severity within the construct of impaired linguistic-specific representations, rules or algorithms. Among other cognitive mechanisms, short-term memory (STM) and conflict resolution (CR) are prominent among those proposed to account for these difficulties. STM is defined as the process underlying the maintenance of activated linguistic information over a short period or delay. CR is defined as an executive attention process underlying the inhibition of prepotent or interfering stimuli or response selections. It is well established that persons with aphasia exhibit deficits in STM and demonstrate impairments of executive attention functions, most prominently, CR. However, research in aphasia has produced conflicting results as to whether these cognitive functions cause, contribute to, co-occur or are unrelated to sentence-level language comprehension processing in healthy persons or to their deficits in persons with aphasia (PWA). Most studies have relied on small subject samples and relatively simple correlational analyses to support or refute the relationships among the cognitive and linguistic abilities in and impairments in PWA. In order to understand the mechanisms underlying sentence-level listening and reading comprehension and determine whether relationships among these cognitive and linguistic exist, it is essential to study large participant samples that support the use of more sophisticated statistical procedures. This study will investigate the relationships among the two well- defined cognitive constructs of STM and CR, and the three linguistic domains of phonology, semantics and syntax that are involved in sentence comprehension. It will address a fundamental question relating to the cause of language disorders in aphasia (are these disorders caused by deficits in linguistic-specific processes, by other cognitive functions such as STM and CR or are they simply coexisting disorders?). This study will test the extent to which STM and CR contribute, beyond basic language processes (LP), to online and off-line measures of sentence processing of structures that are assumed to engage these cognitive functions.  One hundred and twenty PWA who meet the strict criteria for enrollment will participate in this multi-site study. Each participant will complete a battery of two to three tasks for each language domain, designed to engage primarily phonological, semantic, or syntactic LP. Participants will also receive two to three independent measures of STM in each of these domains, and three measures designed to engage CR. One of the key challenges to disentangling the unique and shared contributions of LP, STM and CR is that any task intended to measure a specific process, be it a language process or a memory or executive process, draws to some extend on the other domains through stimulus material and task demands - the task impurity problem in cognitive science. Because these functions are not directly observable and are latent variables, the study will use a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to the analysis. SEM is used to make explicit and test hypotheses about inter-relationships between latent variables as well as their relationships to the observed measures used to assess them. Outcome measures reflect accuracy and reading times at critical regions in sentences hypothesized to draw on STM and CR, at the final word of the sentence (wrap-up), and during response planning and execution. The latent variables will be used to estimate the relationship among their underlying constructs and the outcome measures. Specific latent variable models are designed for individual research questions."
"9335397","ABSTRACT We seek to assess the clinical determinants and molecular/genetic mechanisms underlying known individual differences in BP response to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This will result in a more personalized approach to BP management of OSA patients. Hypertension is a common consequence of OSA. Animal studies with cyclical intermittent hypoxia indicate that oxidative stress is likely the major mechanism, but cardiovascular response to arousals may also play a role. However, not all individuals with OSA have hypertension. Moreover, recent meta-analyses of treatment trials of OSA show major individual differences in BP response. The largest drop in BP with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy for OSA is in patients with resistant hypertension taking three or more BP medications. This project is focused on determining the basis of these individual differences in BP response to OSA and PAP treatment. For Aim 1, we will assemble four groups of OSA subjects with: 1) no hypertension; 2) controlled hypertension on medications and/or lifestyle modifications; 3) uncontrolled hyper-tension despite one or two anti-hypertensive medications; and 4) resistant hypertension. We will assess reductions in BP with PAP therapy with mean nocturnal (sleep) arterial BP being the primary end-point. The prediction is that group 4 will show the largest fall in BP, even after controlling for relevant covariates, group 3 the next biggest fall, while groups 1 and 2 will show minimal BP changes. Both intent to treat and per protocol analyses, i.e., analyzing only those subjects who had PAP adherence of ? 4 hours/day and are adherent to medication, will be conducted. All subjects will have the following measured before and after 3 months of therapy: oxidative stress, as assessed by urinary isoprostanes, urinary norepinephrine, renin activity, levels of aldosterone and endothelin-1, endothelial function, and inflammatory biomarkers. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that those individuals with higher BP at baseline and the greatest BP response to PAP therapy will have higher levels of urinary isoprostanes and norepinephrine at baseline and greater falls with therapy. Animal studies show that the key enzyme mediating oxidative stress in OSA is NADPH oxidase, in particular NOX2. Thus, NADPH oxidase activity will also be assessed. Individuals with the largest falls in BP on PAP therapy are hypothesized to have the highest activity of this enzyme at baseline. There are known genetic variants of this enzyme that affect its structure/activity. Thus, individual differences could be the result of genetic variants. To address this, we will employ in-depth sequencing and evaluate variants in 7 key genes regulating NOX2 structure/activity. Gene variants identified will be related to BP responses and to NADPH oxidase activity. In Aim 3, the role of arousals in the BP response to OSA will be assessed using a novel measurement of heart rate response to arousal. We hypothesize that the heart rate response to arousal will be related to the BP and molecular outcomes of Aims 1 and 2. Finally, given the complex relationship between OSA and BP, Aim 4 will utilize structural equation modeling to assess the relative impact of the various biological pathways."
"9276096","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by progressive loss of lung function with subsequent increasing breathlessness and worsening quality of life. The condition is due to an admixture of emphysema and airways remodeling. This unpredictable mixture of tissue pathology is indiscernible with conventional spirometric measures of lung function. Computed tomography (CT) is increasingly being used to characterize emphysema and airway disease in COPD. However, classic CT measures of the airways are limited for assessing airway remodeling. The applicant has developed novel CT metrics of airways that provide insight into both the mechanical properties of airways and their disappearance in advanced emphysema. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that CT airway characteristics can independently predict clinical manifestations and disease progression in COPD. Aim 1 of this application involves the histologic validation of two novel CT metrics of airways. The goal of Aim 2 is to analyze chest CT scans from the COP Gene Study and correlate airway distensibility (a measure of the change in airway inner diameter from end tidal breathing to full inspiration) and total airway count (a measure of proximal airway drop out) with spirometric parameters, clinical manifestations of disease, and exercise capacity. In Aim 3, the applicant will measure total airway count on CT scans from the ECLIPSE Study and then determine the ability of total airway count to predict decline in lung function, COPD exacerbations, and mortality. These CT-based airway metrics have the potential to be used as non-invasive biomarkers for clinical investigation in COPD. The aims of this research proposal are possible through the active collaboration of Dr. Bartolome Celli, M.D., an internationally renowned clinical investigator in COPD and Dr. George Washko M.D., M.M.Sc., a prominent physician investigator in quantitative CT imaging.

"9333647","Abstract Chemotherapy is the major treatment option for cancer patients. However, systemic toxicity from these drugs can significantly impact patient's quality of life and overall survival. Prevention and effective management of side effects of chemotherapy drugs represents a significant bottleneck in oncology today. Many drugs in Phase I trials have been abandoned and many patients have been denied hope from promising treatment regimens because of the associated adverse systemic side effects (4). Furthermore, toxicity from FDA-approved drugs, like interleukin-2, have prevented their use despite having efficacy. To address these limitations of chemotherapy, we propose a transformative technology where the chemotherapy drug is intra-arterially infused from a drug- eluting stent (DES) and captured along the venous outflow of the tumor using an intravascular drug-capturing device (DCD). We believe that by using the DES/DCD pair system, the tumor site will receive highly localized chemotherapy while systemic presence of the excessive drug molecules will be minimized or eliminated (Fig. 1). This strategy can be applied to many cancers, i.e., internal iliac vein/artery for pelvic tumors, bronchial artery/pulmonary vein for lung cancers, internal mammary vein/artery for breast cancer. In this proposal, we will focus on liver cancer because of our liver angiography experience, the liver has a dual blood supply, liver vasculature is large enough to accommodate stent placements and lower cost of imaging, experimentation and maintaining rabbits. As proof of principle, we will use liver cancer as a model to demonstrate the efficacy of this novel strategy, by delivering DNA-targeting anti-cancer drug doxorubicin, which naturally fluoresces at 480 nm allowing easy detection and quantification. Our preliminary data demonstrates exciting results showing our capability in fabrication of anti-thrombotic biomaterials that can selectively release and capture drug molecules. In addition, we have rich experience in catheter-based delivery of biomaterials for a number of in vivo applications, which will ensure successful completion of the proposed project. First we will develop the DES (Aim 1), then develop the DCD (Aim 2) and finally test the drug release and capture concept in rat and rabbit animal models (Aim 3). Successful development of such a system will represent a paradigm shift in the oncology community by improving patient's quality of life, potentially prolonging survival, resurrecting failed Phase I trials from drug toxicity, increasing the use of FDA-approved previously toxic drugs, and opening up new clinical trials to test much higher doses. The proposed idea of drug release and capture represents a platform technology and may have unparalleled impact in other diseases. For example, the system can be designed to isolate exposure to thrombolytic therapy or immunosuppressants."
"9502066","Project Summary  It is now possible to readily identify sequence variants that have been subject to natural selection in human populations. Adaptive variants have been shown to underlie diversity in both disease risk and morphology across human populations, suggesting that the lens of evolution remains a powerful tool for understanding human biology, yet one that is currently underutilized. One challenge to realizing this potential is that over 99% of human genetic variation is non-coding, as are most signals of selection and variants associated with human phenotypic traits. Mutations modifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites in non- coding, cis-regulatory regions are hypothesized to be more amenable to driving phenotypic evolution than coding changes. These cis-regulatory regions are major determinants of tissue-specific gene expression and variation within enhancers has been indicated to play role in selection and disease. However, enhancer `regulatory grammar' ? the complex pattern of sequences that interact with TFs to control gene expression, is poorly understood. The challenge of linking a regulatory variant under selection to an adaptive phenotype is similar to that facing disease association studies: the targeted gene, cell type, and biological process are often unknown, hindering further investigation.  Machine learning algorithms automate the discovery of patterns, making them well-suited to uncover sequence constraints and the combinatorial TF binding patterns of enhancers without relying on limited motif databases. I will optimize support vector machine classifiers to elucidate regulatory grammar from over 100 cell types and tissues. These models will be used to predict the impact of sequence variants on cis-regulatory sites, expanding the utility of the NHGRI's ENCODE and Roadmap projects. I will then apply these tissue- specific predictions to signals of selection and/or disease from the NHGRI's 1000 Genomes Project and its genome-wide association studies catalog. By describing the regulatory impact of signals of selection, I will globally describe patterns of functional adaptation across populations, identifying genes, and gene networks targeted by selection and/or disease. I will functionally characterize variants using massively parallel reporter assays and genome editing to give deeper insight into specific cases of evolution relevant for human health.   This project seeks to develop tools and resources to describe the structure and function of sequence variation in the human genome. This proposal seeks to vastly increase the number of elucidated cases of human evolution, and specifically characterize those adaptive variants associated with disease. We will share the functional regulatory predictions for the use in interpreting a broad range of genomic datasets. This work has broad implications, from interpreting genetic variants in populations and understanding functional targets of evolution, to prioritizing non-coding mutations for precision genomic medicine and beyond."
"9325034","Heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and congenital heart disease can compromise the capacity of the cardiovascular system to deliver sufficient oxygen (O2) to meet the varying metabolic demands of the organ systems. Mixed venous oxygen saturation measured in the main pulmonary artery is an accurate marker of the systemic delivery of blood and oxygen that provides key diagnostic and prognostic value. However, a true mixed venous saturation requires catheter access to the main pulmonary artery and may be underutilized as a diagnostic measure due to the associated level of invasiveness and risk. A non-invasive means to quickly and accurately measure O2 saturation (O2sat) in the main pulmonary artery, the cardiac chambers, and ideally anywhere in the body, would not only reduce the need for invasive catheterization procedures, but would also provide important physiological information that may be otherwise unavailable or unobtainable. In the blood, the magnetic resonance transverse relaxation time (T2) is related to the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, and MR relaxometry has been previously proposed for in vivo estimation of blood O2 saturation; however, these estimates have relied on an impractical in vitro calibration on each patient, and results have been corrupted by flow-induced artifacts. A technique previously developed in our lab for rapid, single-shot T2 mapping has been modified to reduce flow artifacts and improve the accuracy of T2 measured in flowing blood. Together with this modified pulse sequence, we propose an entirely new approach to solving the Luz-Meiboom (L-M) equation that describes the relationship between T2 and O2sat in blood. We hypothesize that the use of varied preparation pulse timing along with direct measurement of easily accessible patient specific parameters will support the application of non-linear parameter estimation techniques to provide an accurate quantitative assessment of blood O2sat in the heart and deep vessels, even in locations having limited accessibility with other diagnostic techniques. We propose to optimize and validate this approach to non-invasive blood oximetry by meeting the following specific aims. Aim 1: We will define appropriate limits for acquisition parameters TE and 180 in a flow phantom and optimize acquisition parameters using statistical sensitivity analysis. Aim 2: We will empirically validate O2sat derived from T2 in a porcine model of graded hypoxemia that enables simultaneous acquisition of T2 and invasive O2sat measurement over a broad range of values. Aim 3: We will evaluate feasibility in a small cohort of heart failure patients undergoing clinically indicated pulmonary artery catheterization for mixed venous O2sat measurement. By addressing the flow sensitivity of the T2 preparation pulse and the inaccuracies introduced by oversimplification of the model relating T2 to O2sat, we anticipate that the level of accuracy and reproducibility for this technique will be raised to that required for clinical application in patients with cardiovascular disease. ?"
"9266831","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transcription is an essential process for life that constitutes the first step of gene expression in the cell and a crucial checkpoint for the control f critical biological events, including cell growth, differentiation, and oncogenesis. In eukaryotes, this highly regulated process is carried out by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). To transcribe the DNA, this enzyme must overcome the physical barriers imposed by the nucleosomal organization of the genetic material. Moreover, Pol II must transcribe torsionally constrained DNA segments that require the enzyme to translocate against increasing torques. Various mechanisms participate in the control and regulation of transcription, including structural changes of chromatin, various transcription factors, the polymerase ability to generate torque, and the activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler complexes. In this application we propose to characterize these mechanisms of transcription control using a combination of single molecule manipulation and visualization approaches. Specifically, we propose: 1) Investigate the dynamics of transcription through nucleosomal arrays to elucidate the contribution of internucleosomal elements to the barrier. 2) Determine the mechanisms by which transcription factors IIS (TFIIS) and IIF (TFIIF) enhance nucleosomal transcription. 3) Characterize the relationship between the torsional strain in DNA and the ability of Pol II to transcribe through a nucleosome. 4) Characterize the nucleosome-remodeling mechanism, mechanochemical properties, and torque generation of the SWI/SNF complex."
"9376212","Novel model for studying PDAC using normal human pancreatic tissue  For the past twenty years, the survival rate for many cancers has improved, but survival for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not, due to lack of both early detection methods and effective treatments. Human PADC cancer cell lines have been widely used. However, such cell lines are far from original organ tissue, and their highly unstable genome complicates interpretation. On the other hand, while animal models overcome many of the limitations of cell lines, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) may overlook some profound differences between human and mouse cells. Indeed, nearly 90% of drugs with proven efficacy in animal models are ineffective in clinical trials. In our previous studies, we have successfully induced ADM in primary human normal acinar cells and found distinct features of human cells. We further engineered these acinar-derived ductal like (AD) cells to PDAC cells by specifically introducing the landscape mutation combination (KRAS/P16/TP53/SMAD4, KPTS) of human PDAC. Importantly, when transplanted into mice, these genetically engineered cells gave rise to invasive desmoplastic tumors, recapitulating the clinical features of PDAC in human patients, highlighting the power of this novel system to modeling human PDAC development. Given the fact that PDAC gains mutations during progression, we propose to use our novel system to generate engineered cells carrying fewer mutations, which may give rise to non-invasive neoplasia when orthotropically transplanted into NOD-SCID mice. This model will not only help us to understand the mechanisms of human PDAC development, it may also be a valuable platform to identify biomarkers for early diagnosis. Since our engineered AD cells give rise to tumors recapitulating clinical features of human PDAC, they are a good model to identify key targets to stop the growth of fully established tumors in vivo. To test this concept, we will utilize an inducible gRNA expressing vector to specifically knockout oncogenic KRAS in vivo to induce tumor size reduction. Success with this method would provide a powerful model to identify other essential genes supporting human PDAC progression and to reveal possible pathways for human PDAC relapse after KRAS knockout. The proposed novel models have great clinical potential on precision medicine, identification of early diagnosis methods, and development of new treatment strategies for human PDAC."
"9281843","?DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):     This renewal of the P01 is a logical extension of progress made during the current cycle and leverages the substantial contributions in this field made by the PIs. During this cycle, we identified an AAV capsid clinical candidate - AAV8 - to use for liver applications. This was evaluated in mouse models of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hoFH) and was shown to be highly effective and safe. We accelerated our clinical development plan of an AAV-LDLR product and reached out to the Food and Drug Administration and met with the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, both of whom were supportive of moving forward with a Phase 1 trial. In preparation for this, we completed IND-enabling studies and are ready to file an IND. The centerpiece of the competing renewal is Project 1 that contains a phase 1 clinical trial of AAV8-LDLR in subjects with hoFH. Projects 2 and 3 build on our pre-clinical experiences with AAV8 in animal models of hoFH in several ways. We plan to conduct proof-of-concept studies in mouse models to develop AAV8 gene therapy for lecithin- cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency which is an inherited dyslipidemia associated with low HDL and renal disease. This will be followed by IND-enabling studies with AAV8-LCAT with the goal of having an approved IND for LCAT deficiency by the completion of the competing renewal. Gene therapy for hoFH and LCAT deficiency has some important similarities that will greatly facilitate the translation of LCAT gene therapy in the clinic although there are differences that provide scientific rationale for pursuing both. The target organ pathology  differs  in  that  hoFH  causes atherosclerosis  while  LCAT  deficiency  leads  to  renal  disease. Furthermore, LDLR confers a cell autonomous function in which the percent hepatocyte transduction is more important than the overall level of LDLR expression. This contrasts with LCAT which is a secreted protein with effects beyond the cells that are transduced; efficacy is more related to overall expression of the enzyme rather than the number of transduced cells. We also will conduct studies to improve gene therapy for hoFH in ways that are specific to this disease - introducing gain-of-function mutations into LDLR to increase vector potency - and using approaches that will be of potential value for all applications of liver directed gene therapy - creating variants of AAV3B that escape antibody neutralization and allow for efficient in vivo gene transfer in the presence of AAV8 neutralizing antibodies present from natural infections or from an earlier treatment with an AAV8 vector. Two of the three projects in the current grant will be retained (PIs: Dan Rader and James Wilson) as will the three scientific cores (Vector, Animal Models and Cell Morphology). The project currently directed by Guangping Gao (UMass) on genotoxicity of AAV genomes will be replaced by a project directed by Marina Cuchel (Penn) to conduct the hoFH clinical trial and LCAT IND-enabling studies."
"9269209","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is for the Nova Southeastern University to serve as a clinical center for the Convergence  Insufficiency Treatment Trial - Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART), a multicenter randomized, placebo  controlled, clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic convergence  insufficiency (Cl) on measures of reading performance and attention in children. In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic Cl will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III]) reading comprehension subtest score and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the Cl Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of Cl (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence at near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1-year post treatment. This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and to retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the CITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DCC] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DCC at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center. Symptomatic Cl is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g. loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of Cl treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems.

Conditions  of hypoxia are associated with robust increases in extracellular adenosine. Here, we build on the hypothesis  that particularly the AD0RA2B adenosine receptor plays a central role in modulating cellular responses  during conditions of hypoxia. During conditions of inflammation, hypoxia, or ischemia, the hypoxia-elicited  rise in extracellular adenosine is sufficient to activate the AD0RA2B. This is due to the fact that hypoxia  coordinates the transcriptional induction of the AD0RA2B through the activity of hypoxia-inducible factor  HIF. Moreover, recent studies have revealed an additional mechanism to enhance AD0RA2B signaling  during hypoxia. This involves hypoxia-dependent attenuation of the termination of extracellular adenosine  signaling via decreased uptake of extracellular adenosine into the intracellular compartment. This molecular  pathway is governed by HIF-dependent repression of adenosine transporters, particularly ENTI and ENT2.  All three projects of this PPG focus on hypoxia-elicited increases of extracellular adenosine signaling,  including the effects of HIF on AD0RA2B signaling and on ENTs. Therefore, it will be central to the success  of the PPG to have state of the art mouse models available to test hypotheses in each individual project.  This Transgenic Mouse Breeding Core will provide state of the art mouse models with cell-specific deletions  of key genes of the hypoxic adenosine response so that the individual projects can address their  hypotheses. The Transgenic Mouse Breeding Core will provide the following services: 1. Generation and  initial characterization of transgenic mouse lines with cell-specific deletions of key elements within the  hypoxic adenosine response, and 2. Delivery of large breeding stocks of specific mouse lines to the  appropriate Project Leaders. Together, these efforts will enhance our knowledge of adenosine and the  regulation of disease and move us towards the development of novel therapies to treat various diseases of  the lungs and the kidneys.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This Core will provide mice to individual Projects to gain insight into the role of the signaling molecule  adenosine in the regulation of deadly lung, kidney and sickle cell disease. This information will benefit the  development of novel therapies for these diseases, which are prevalent and deadly."
"9276692","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Membrane protein function is regulated by changes in the host membrane's lipid composition. This regulation occurs through mechanisms ranging from specific (chemical) interactions between proteins and individual lipid molecules, to non-specific (physical) interactions between proteins and the bilayer behaving as a structure with collective physical properties (e.g., thickness, intrinsic monolayer curvature and elastic moduli). The proposed studies focus on the physical regulation of membrane protein function with special emphasis on how drugs, drug candidates and other molecules that are used to manipulate cell function, alter lipid bilayer properties, as sensed by a bilayer-spanning channel. Such physical regulation of function occurs because hydrophobic interactions between a membrane protein and its host bilayer, couples the protein conformational preference to the bilayer physical properties. This coupling occurs because bilayer-spanning proteins perturb their surrounding bilayer, which incurs an energetic cost, the bilayer deformation energy (?Gdef), where ?Gdef varies with changes in the host lipid bilayer physical properties. Conformational changes that involve the protein/bilayer interface will alter the packing and dynamics of the adjacent lipids, such that the difference in bilayer deformation energy between two protein conformations (I and II) becomes the bilayer contribution  (?GbilayerI->II = ?GdefII - ?GdefI) to th free energy difference (?GtotalI-II) for the conformational transition. Membrane protein function varies with changes in lipid bilayer properties that alter ?GbilayerI-II. The experiments will combine fluorescence quench single-channel electrophysiology measurements to explore how changes in lipid bilayer properties alter the energetics and kinetics of gramicidin (gA) channel formation, where the gA channels are probes for changes in membrane properties. The focus will be how libraries of drugs, drug candidates, and other biologically active molecules alter lipid bilayer properties, have membrane effects, as sensed by bilayer-spanning channels. This is important because many biologically active molecules are amphiphiles, meaning that they will alter lipid bilayer properties at some concentration and thus become promiscuous modifiers of membrane protein function. The screen for bilayer modifying potency will be done using fluorescence quench measurements to determine how different molecules alter the gA monomer dimer equilibrium, which allows for quantification of the compound-induced change in  ?GbilayerM->D, the bilayer contribution to the free energy of dimerization. This provides for quantitative information about the bilayer-modifying potency of diverse molecules and the concentration range where a compound is safe, where it has little membrane effect. Selected molecules will be studied using single channel methods, to determine which bilayer properties that have been altered. These experiments provide a foundation for the development of novel screens of drug candidates, as well as systematic approaches to understand, and eventually avoid (or exploit), the membrane effects caused by biologically active molecules."

"9353227","Effects of Childhood Health on Schooling, Work, and the Transition into Adulthood  This project will address an important unresolved question that is central to understanding the emergence of health and socioeconomic disparities early in the life course: to what extent does poor health in childhood and adolescence impede a successful transition to adulthood? To date, there is a well-developed body of liter- ature which shows that children in poor health perform less well in school in terms of grades and on standard- ized tests. Despite these clear associations, firmly establishing the causal effects of health on education has been elusive due to unobserved factors that shape both health and education, and because the relationship is potentially recursive and bi-directional. Consequently, it is unclear whether health conditions exert a causal longer-term effect on socioeconomic transitions in young adulthood that shape ultimate socioeconomic attain- ment later in the adult lifecourse. Moreover, most studies use either a global measure of health or focus on a single health condition (often measured only at one time point), and so our understanding of the dimensions of health that are most consequential for human capital development is limited. This study will build on the nas- cent literature and improve upon existing research by investigating more thoroughly and conclusively how childhood health trajectories, from birth through childhood and adolescence, shape the contours of the con- temporary transition to adulthood. The study will develop and use new data from the Transition into Adulthood Supplement (TAS) to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). TAS follows children from PSID families into young adulthood. Most of these children participated in the PSID Child Development Supplement (CDS) and many participated in previous waves of the TAS that were fielded between 2005 and 2015. In this Program Project, we will be selecting an expanded sample comprised of all young adults in PSID families and substan- tially revising the TAS questionnaire and fielding two rounds of the TAS in 2017 and 2019. As part of this Re- search Project, we will design a new retrospective childhood health module that will ascertain health conditions across childhood and adolescence; this module will complement, and be used in conjunction with, existing pro- spective measures of childhood health from CDS. In addition, we will collaborate with Research Project 1 to collect vital statistics birth records on sample members that will allow us and other researchers to construct measures of pre-natal health. We will employ innovative new statistical methods that will position us to make the most convincing estimates of causal relationships that are possible with observational data. With unparal- leled longitudinal data on health across the early life course, our project will examine how childhood health is linked with educational attainment, gainful employment, residential/financial independence from parents, mar- riage, and parenthood in young adulthood (the last two topics in conjunction with Research Project 2)."
"9280943","SUMMARY- Research Project 1- Metals and metal mixtures in DNA damage and repair  The Native Environmental Health Equity Center seeks to address environmental health disparities and health  concerns of three Native American communities (Navajo Nation, Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and Crow  Reservation) arising from exposure to mine waste metal mixtures. The communities are exposed to distinct  metal mixtures with overlap in certain metals of primary concern: uranium (U), arsenic (As), manganese (Mn)  and mercury (Hg). The proposed research is grounded in 1) documented community exposures, 2) evidence  for increased body burden of metals of concern within the communities, and 3) evidence that exposure is  linked to adverse effects. Each of the four metals identified by the tribal community partners share likely  mechanisms of action such as generation of oxidative stress and disruption of zinc finger protein function.  These shared mechanisms are predicted to amplify the toxicity of combined exposures compared to single  metal exposure. This project will investigate each metal of concern and community-relevant metal mixtures in  samples derived from the affected populations (Aim 1) and conduct mechanistic experimental studies (Aim 2).  Both aims are designed to test the hypothesis that As, U, Mn and Hg (individually or in combination) will inhibit  the function of a prototypic zinc finger DNA repair protein (PARP-1) and impair DNA repair processes leading  to increased retention of DNA damage, and that metals in combination will exacerbate adverse response  compared to single metal exposure. We have published and preliminary findings indicating interactions  between As and U, disruption of zinc finger protein function by these metals, and evidence that supplemental  zinc is protective against A or U interaction with zinc fingers. The experimental observations are confirmed in a  preliminary analysis of an exposed human population from the Navajo Nation. The proposed studies enhance  understanding of the impact of metals and metal mixtures in the Native communities, and the controlled in vitro  and cell based assays will provide mechanistic insights on the actions of metals and metal mixtures at  concentrations relevant to the communities, and additionally determine whether zinc is protective against the  effects of metals individually or in combination. The research is relevant to the goals of the Native  Environmental Health Equity Center and significant by providing important information to improve  understanding of environmentally driven health disparities due to toxic metals exposures while being  responsive to the concerns of the affected communities. Furthermore, our studies to investigate whether zinc  can mitigate the effects of metals and metal combinations will serve as critical mechanistic foundations for  potential future population and intervention studies in vulnerable communities. Overall, the proposed project  represents transdisciplinary and translational research to advance understanding, mitigation and prevention of  environmentally driven health disparities which is a stated goal within the program."
"9278172","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic arsenic exposure is known to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality from both cancerous and non-cancerous effects. The metabolism of inorganic arsenic to more toxic, trivalent methylated species, in particular monomethylarsonous acid (MMAsIII), is believed to play a key role in arsenic toxicity and carcinogenesis in humans. MMAsIII is capable of inducing malignant transformation in human cells, and population-based studies have shown that an increase in the percentage of urinary and blood arsenic present as MMAsIII, is linked to increased susceptibility to skin lesions and several types of cancer. The mechanism through which MMAsIII induces cell transformation and carcinogenicity has not yet been elucidated but studies suggest the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. Arsenic exposure results in changes in histone acetylation, a key feature of gene regulation, in humans and in cultured human cells. We recently demonstrated a global and lysine specific decrease in histone acetylation upon acute MMAIII exposure in human urothelial cells (UROtsa cells), the target for arsenic-induced carcinogenesis. Further studies showed that chronic low level of MMAIII exposure in UROtsa cells upregulates the expression and activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs), and leads to a cross-board decrease in histone acetylation levels both globally and lysine residues specifically, whereas pan-HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), reverses these effects caused by MMAIII and blocks MMAIII-induced cell malignant transformation. Based on these preliminary observations, we hypothesize that prolonged exposure to an environmentally relevant level of MMAIII affects the activity and expression of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and HDACs, resulting in a reduced histone acetylation and subsequent changes in the gene regulatory regions of genomic DNA and leading to aberrant expression of key growth controlling genes and a neoplastic transformation. The long-term goals of our research are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of arsenic carcinogenesis and facilitate the development of novel strategies to prevent, diagnose, or treat for the arsenic associated diseases including cancer. To this end, we will utilize a MMAIII-induced UROtsa cell malignant transformation model to comprehensively investigate the mechanisms and tumorigenic outcomes of histone acetylation changes upon MMAIII exposure and/or pan-HDACs and HDAC selective inhibitors treatment, and to identify aberrant gene expression and the genomic regulatory regions that are inappropriately targeted by the altered histone acetylation (Aim 1 & 2). We will then verify if the histone acetylation signature and the resultant aberrant expression of key genes identified in malignantly transformed UROtsa cells are manifested in specimens from humans exposed to arsenic (Aim 3). The experiments proposed are envisioned to elucidate the mechanism(s) and outcomes of MMAIII-induced acetylation changes in specific lysine residues in histone. The findings will provide insights into potential biomarkers of arsenic carcinogenicity and future diagnosis of disease risk from other exposures."
"9268695","Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by widespread  inflammation and development of autoantibodies against nucleic acids (NAs). SLE pathogenesis is not fully  understood but genomic studies support an interplay between innate and adaptive immunity. Pathogenic  loops involving immune complex(IC)-containing NAs that activate innate immune cells such as dendritic  cells (DCs), platelets and neutrophils through the endosomal TLR pathway result in plasmacytoid DC (pDC)  activation and release of type I IFN. Excessive production and/or sensing of NAs is emerging as a  fundamental and upstream event in SLE, and over-expression of IFN-inducible transcriptional signatures is  a universal finding, especially in early onset SLE. We and others recently reported that neutrophils release  DNA-protein complexes that activate pDCs, thus acting as Danger-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs).  DAMPS are extruded upon neutrophil activation with SLE immune complexes (ICs) and directly activate  pDCs in an FcR-independent and TLR9-dependent manner. Our preliminary data now show that these  DAMPs are composed of damaged (oxidized) mitochondrial DNA-protein complexes (mtDAMPs) released  upon type I IFN and anti-Sm/RNP mediated endosomal TLR7 activation of neutrophils. This combination of  stimuli impairs the detoxification of oxidized mtDNA through lysosomal degradation, which is a fundamental  step leading to the extrusion of interferogenic mtDAMPs. Here, we propose 1) to characterize the basic  mechanisms that lead to neutrophil mitochondrial damage and release of mtDAMPs in SLE, 2) to identify  the interferogenic components of mtDAMPs and the mechanisms responsible for their internalization in  pDCs, and 3) to characterize the effects of SLE mtDAMPs on non-hemopoietic cells that become the target  of inflammation in SLE, especially endothelial cells. Overall, these studies will provide a better  understanding of how breakdown of tolerance to NAs and dysregulation of the IFN pathway are  interconnected and amplify each other. These studies will bring novel insight into SLE autoantibody  pathogenic roles and perpetuation of IFN-amplification loops"
"9273917","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Child maltreatment is destructive to the psychological and biological development of children, significantly increasing their risk for mental health disorders throughout the lifespan. Thus, translational research which uses our knowledge of risk and protective factors, at multiple levels of analysis, to inform and evaluate evidence-based interventions for young maltreated children is sorely needed (Cicchetti & Valentino, 2006). Because child maltreatment is a pathogenic relational experience, often beginning during early childhood and in the context of the parent-child relationship, dyadic interventions that address the developmental needs of preschool-aged maltreated children and their parents are necessary. There is a significant gap, however, regarding the establishment of empirically supported treatments targeted toward both maltreated preschool- aged children and their parents, including the identification of the mechanisms underlying beneficial outcomes. Accordingly, the aims of this project are to evaluate (1) the efficacy of Reminiscing and Emotion Training (RET), a brief, dyadic intervention for maltreated preschool-aged children and their mothers, in fostering maltreated children's development in cognitive, emotional, and physiological domains and in improving their mothers' parenting; and (2) the specific mechanisms underlying intervention effects, including the role of child and maternal diurnal cortisol regulation. To accomplish these aims, the project will enroll 240 preschool-aged children and their mothers into a randomized clinical trial. Maltreating families will be randomized into one of two conditions: the RET condition, or a Community Standard condition (CS), which serves as an active control. Additionally a demographically matched group of nonmaltreating families will be included to determine the extent to which families in the RET group approximate functioning of nonmaltreated families over time. Key components of the RET include training mothers to (a) ask open-ended questions, (b) use detailed descriptions and build on children's responses, (c) make causal connections between children's experiences and emotions, and (d) talk about emotion resolutions. Families will participate in baseline, 8 week post, 6 month and 1 year follow-up assessments with a repeated measures battery of interviews, observations, and assessments of maternal and child behavioral and biological functioning. The RET intervention and physiological assessment procedures are based on extensive new pilot research. This multi-level, multi-measure approach will enable researchers to fully evaluate the efficacy of the RET intervention, and the mechanisms underlying intervention effects. Consequently, this project addresses significant societal concerns relevant to the psychological and biological health of maltreated children through the evaluation of an innovative brief intervention. As such, the study has potential to significantly advance scientific knowledge and to inform more effective clinical and policy efforts designed to improve the welfare of maltreated children and families, including programs that may be readily disseminated to communities nationally."
"9273584","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed study is to engage American Indian communities in the design and implementation of an intervention to reduce the risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and other related infant deaths due to unsafe sleep environments. American Indian/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) carry a disproportionate burden of infant mortality. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), AI/AN have 1.6 times the infant mortality rate as non-Hispanic whites and are 1.7 times as likely as non-Hispanic white babies to die from SIDS. While there have been decreases in infant mortality rates, the Northern Plains American Indian SIDS rate is 3.46 per 1000 live births compared to the overall US SIDS rate of 0.54 per 1000 live births. The disparity between infant mortality rates by race is largely driven by post-neonatal mortality.  Post-neonatal deaths occur after 28 days post-delivery and are primarily related to SIDS and infant care practices including, sleep environment related factors that are largely considered preventable. Compelling evidence from research in other racial populations suggests that family and cultural norms, attitudes and personal beliefs about infant sleep, safety and comfort are strongly associated with the choice of infant sleep environment. It may be possible that the current safe sleep messages are in conflict with inherent cultural beliefs within American Indian communities. This conflict with the scientifi recommendations regarding safe sleep may influence behavior, even in the presence of adequate knowledge about safe sleep practices.  This proposal provides an unprecedented opportunity to expand our current work in infant mortality established, in part, through the Prenatal Alcohol in SIDS and Stillbirth (PASS) Network (NICHD 2U01- HD045935). During this time, we have successfully engaged communities at the highest risk of infant mortality and established long-term relationships through dialogue and trust, to develop mutually agreeable research protocols and procedures. In partnership with local clinics, hospitals and community service agencies, we have developed a clinical site infrastructure designed to recruit and follow women for research purposes through multiple health-care environments and physical locations to allow for optimal retention and outcome ascertainment.  Using a Community Based Participatory Research model, we will investigate the influence of parental knowledge, cultural beliefs and access to resources on decision making regarding infant sleep environment. Community input and feedback will be utilized in development of a culturally embedded group intervention program, buoyed by the American Academy Pediatrics safe sleep recommendations for infants. The intervention will be tested using a randomized, open trial of a 150 pregnant American Indian women, comparing standard safe sleep education format to a culturally appropriate group education format."

"9384232","Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American men. The objective of this project is to develop a novel therapeutic approach to treat prostate cancer by overcoming the mechanisms of resistance. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling drives prostate cancer development and progression, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care for locally advanced and metastatic hormone nave prostate cancer (HNPC). Unfortunately, most patients develop castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within 2-3 years via AR reactivation (e.g., AR overexpression, AR mutations, AR splice variants), which is also the mechanism of resistance to the two next generation anti-AR signaling inhibitors (ASI) abiraterone and enzalutamide. Further, all of these agents induce the development of AR negative neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), which constitutes approximately 25% of CRPC cases, a lethal and late stage of prostate cancer without any treatment option. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel targeting approaches for prostate cancer treatment. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is an emerging oncogene that often epigenetically represses transcription of target genes such as tumor suppressors and cell cycle inhibitors in cancer cells. Preliminary findings show that PRMT5 promotes prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo via epigenetic activation of AR transcription in both HNPC and CRPC cells. Unlike ADT and ASI, PRMT5 inhibition by our novel inhibitor does not induce NEPC development in prostate cancer cells using our in vitro model system. Given that AR transcription precedes AR splicing and the translation of wild-type and mutant AR proteins, we hypothesize that targeting PRMT5 will offer an effective and unique treatment approach for prostate cancer by overcoming the mechanisms of AR reactivation without inducing NEPC development. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following aims. Aim 1 will determine the role of PRMT5 in regulating AR expression and cell growth in CRPC cell lines. Aim 2 will elucidate the epigenetic mechanism by which PRMT5 regulates AR transcription and cell growth as well neuroendocrine differentiation. Aim 3 will evaluate whether PRMT5 targeting demonstrates a better treatment effect for both HNPC and CRPC in animal models. Aim 4 will improve the potency and pharmacokinetic properties of PRMT5 inhibitors while preserving its specificity for prostate cancer preclinical studies.  Impact: Successful completion of proposed research will gain mechanistic insight into how PRMT5 epigenetically regulates AR transcription in prostate cancer cells and will provide preclinical evidence that targeting PRMT5 is an effective approach for treatment of both HNPC and CRPC without inducing NEPC development. Further improvement and identification of potent and specific PRMT5 inhibitors will likely lead to the development of PRMT5 inhibitors for future clinical trials."

"9285819","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intracellular Ca2+ signals govern numerous physiological phenomena. Often these signals are generated by opening of ryanodine receptor (RyR) or inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ release channels on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. In tissues where one of these channels dominates, functional cross talk with the other is often present. Such cross talk between Ca2+ release channels has been documented in smooth, cardiac and recently skeletal muscle. In other words, function of each has ramifications on both. Here, our focus is the local Ca2+ control of the type-1 IP3R.  IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release is controlled by the concerted actions of local IP3 and Ca2+. The IP3-control signal (source, size, kinetics) is fairly well defined. In contrast, the Ca2+-control signa is poorly understood because of its multi-modal nature. The Ca2+ control signal modes include cytosolic Ca2+ activation, cytosolic Ca2+ inactivation, intra-ER Ca2+ regulation (luminal regulation), auto-FT (Feed Through) and inter-FT Ca2+ regulation. Each has been explored separately but never have all been defined as a whole.  The ill-defined local multi-modal Ca2+ control of the IP3R is a significant obstacle that has limited our understanding of both IP3R hierarchical Ca2+ signaling (channel to puff to wave) and quantal Ca2+ release. The least understood Ca2+ control modes are auto-FT, inter-FT and intra-ER Ca2+ regulation. Often, their existence (let alone significance) has been questioned due to the lack of definitive information (as the overlapping signals and feedback-loops have precluded separate testing of variables). This obstacle is overcome here and multi- modal IP3R local Ca2+ control defined as a whole for the first time. This is significant because IP3R governs Ca2+ signaling in nearly all cells and its abnormal function can have lethal ramifications. This means IP3R local control mechanisms are both potential points of pathological failure and logical targets for therapeutic intervention, making knowledge of their molecular basis highly significant to human health.  Here, 3 laboratories with unique complementary resources and expertise combine to address the hypothesis: Multi-modal IP3R local Ca2+ control (activation, inactivation & feed through) includes a luminal intra-pore Ca2+-Mg2+ sensing site that governs the channel's IP3 sensitivity, the latter newly discovered mechanism explains IP3R-mediated quantal Ca2+ release in cells. This proposal applies a multidisciplinary (molecular to cellular) carefully crafted approach to tes this hypothesis. The specific aims are to 1) define multi-modal local Ca2+ control of type-1 IP3R function and 2) identify the molecular basis of quantal type-1 IP3R Ca2+ release.  This work will establish the biophysical basis of multi-modal local Ca2+ control of single IP3R1 function and likely will identify a novel (and long sought) single IP3R molecular mechanism that explains quantal release. This will represent a significant advancement in our understanding of IP3R1 local control."
"9278323","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia occurs in almost all newborns, and may be benign if its progression to extreme hyperbilirubinemia is recognized, monitored, and prevented or managed in a timely manner. Neonatal jaundice carries the risk of neurotoxicity, due to the deposition of bilirubin in the central nervous system. Most of the bilirubin in plasma is bound to plasma proteins (mainly serum albumin). Bilirubin binding capacity (BBC) defines the dynamic relationship between an infant's level of unbound or free bilirubin and his/her ability to tolerate increasing bilirubin loads. BBC is not synonymous with albumin (Alb) levels because Alb binding of bilirubin is confounded by a variety of molecular, biologic, and metabolic factors. While various methods exist to measure BBC, none have been successfully commercialized. Of these, hematofluorometry holds the greatest promise of a device that can be used at the point of care, and give rapid and accurate BBC measurements. A SBIR Phase I grant demonstrated that such a device is possible. A Phase II grant delivered improved devices to neonatal hospitals. Published clinical studies with these devices not only collaborated prior knowledge, but suggested ways in which BBC measurements may improve existing neonatal care. The aims of this project are to transform the modernized hematofluorometers developed in Phases I and II into a final product suitable for operation in a point-of-care environment in the newborn nursery, NICU, and neonatal outpatient clinic. In year one, Aviv's goals are to develop and evaluate a single position hematofluorometer in terms of increased accuracy over prior designs; develop and evaluate kit designs that increase the ease of use; improve the use of the internal reference; develop primary standards for calibration; develop validation checks. Beginning in year 1 and continuing into year 2, Aviv will: perform shelf-life tests; determine environmental limits of operation; integrate a bar code reader and laboratory information management software support; internal quality checks into the device and software; investigate potential interferences to measurements; and incorporate guidance for use into documentation and software. During year 2 Aviv will: have a commercializable embodiment; develop methods and documentation; identify partners for manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution. Concurrent with these activities, Stanford University's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital will conduct clinical studies to evaluate the usefulness of BBC measurements in a clinical setting. Experienced consultants in the fields of neonatal care management, clinical lab directors, and those with hands-on experience neonatal intensive care units and clinical labs will be consulted on the suitability of the device and reagent kit. The goal is to obtain expert recommendations for the use of the BBC assay to inform additional clinically useful modifications of the hematofluorometer system."
"9270564","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surprisingly little is known about how cytokinesis works in an intact epithelial environment where the dividing cell is connected to its neighboring cells via cell-cell junctions. Notably, failed cytokinesis can promote tumor formation; over 85% of cancers arise from epithelial tissues, and cell-cell junction defects can contribute to cancer metastasis. Therefore, the objective of the proposed research is to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which epithelial cells maintain and remodel their cell-cell junctions during cell division. Our central hypothesis is that the scaffolding protein Anillin regulates proper spatiotemporal patterning of active RhoA (RhoA-GTP) and is essential for regulating junction structure, remodeling, and tension in dividing and non-dividing epithelial cells. Our focus on RhoA, a small GTPase that promotes actomyosin contractility, stems from evidence that precisely localized zones of active RhoA are required both for cytokinesis and for formation and maintenance of cell-cell junctions. Our group is uniquely positioned to tackle the stated objective because we use high-resolution live imaging of active RhoA dynamics in the intact vertebrate epithelium of the Xenopus laevis embryo. We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine Anillin's function in maintaining cell-cell junctions. Or exciting preliminary data indicate that the scaffolding protein Anillin, which is known to play an important role in regulating cytokinesis, also plays a novel role in regulating cell-cell junction integrity. We will test the hypothesis that Anillin regulates cell-cell junctions by controlling th distribution of junctional RhoA-GTP and stabilizing the apical actomyosin belt. In Aim 2, we will characterize how dynamic cell-cell junction remodeling is regulated in dividing cells. We will test the hypothesis that junction protein dynamics are altered in dividing cells due to changes in tension, and proper regulation of localized RhoA-GTP by Anillin is required for junction remodeling. In Aim 3, we will identify mechanisms by which dividing cells regulate and respond to tension changes. Here, we will test the hypothesis that RhoA is activated in response to mechanical force, and Anillin stabilizes RhoA-GTP and promotes increased junctional tension. Using innovative approaches that include live imaging with a fluorescent probe that specifically highlights active RhoA in the cell, characterizing for the first time how cell-cell junction protei dynamics are regulated during vertebrate cell division, and examining RhoA-mediated cellular mechanics - all in intact vertebrate epithelial tissue - will allow us to gain new insights about hw cell division works in epithelial cells. Completion of the proposed research is expected to identif novel mechanisms that regulate localized RhoA activity and the actomyosin-mediated tension required for cell-cell junction maintenance and remodeling during cytokinesis in the intact vertebrate epithelium."
"9260040","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With our ethnically diverse longitudinal twin study, we aim to understand the genetic and environmental mechanisms by which the infant, toddler and childhood family sociocultural environments impact day-to-day associations between quality of sleep and health-related behaviors. Also, we elucidate mechanisms accounting for the longitudinal association between dynamic sleep processes and physical health and academic functioning in middle childhood. Without the use of a genetically-informed design, environmental causation cannot be inferred because quality of sleep is heritable, components of the family environment are also heritable through gene-environment correlation, and thus their covariation may be genetically or environmentally mediated. Salient aspects of the environment include a) family values and stressors (including culture-specific stressors), b) home stability and chaos and c) responsive and negative parenting. Specifically, under Aim 1 we model within person dynamic sleep and health behavioral processes in middle childhood, and the role of the sociocultural environment in moderating these processes. Under Aim 2, we predict physical health and academic functioning from children's average and dynamic sleep and health behavioral processes two years earlier. We also examine the extent to which these dynamic processes mediate the associations between the sociocultural environment and later physical health and academic functioning. With Aim 3, we use the twin method to document genetic and environmental contributions to multiple components of children's sleep, health and academic outcomes. Under Aim 4, we use the twin method to determine the extent to which the measured sociocultural environment moderates the heritability of sleep and health behaviors. This study would be the first to use a genetically-informative dynamic daily approach to understand sociocultural environment-sleep relations. The proposed study forms a new collaboration of a young team of investigators with complementary expertise. The project is notable for its developmental cultural and genetic approach that uncovers gene-environment interplay, extensive assessment of the sociocultural environment during a sensitive period for brain development, establishment of a circadian rhythm, and formation of bedtime routines and habits. Under a resilience framework, we study protective as well as risk processes, as protective environments such as sensitive parenting and bedtime routines likely offset genetic or environmental risk for sleep problems. Combining these design features exponentially increases the scientific contribution by elucidating processes that support preventive intervention efforts."
"9273617","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):: Diabetics are at increased risk of heart disease from several factors including geometric and functional changes that occur independently of other risk factor; this is termed 'diabetic cardiomyopathy'. Mechanisms of this disease are not completely understood, but data increasingly support the notion that aberrant lipid metabolism contributes to this disease process. Among these metabolic changes are perturbations in sphingolipid synthesis; others and we have shown that blocking sphingolipid synthesis ameliorates many facets of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Sphingolipid metabolism comprises numerous enzymes, pathways, and products; teasing apart specific sphingolipids that mediate a specific process has proven challenging. Moreover, mechanisms by which these processes occur have been difficult to determine. We recently published that a specific enzyme of sphingolipid synthesis, Ceramide Synthase 5 (CerS5), mediated lipid- induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and autophagy. In a high saturated-fat feeding model in mice, which caused insulin resistance and obesity, sphingolipid biosynthesis was perturbed in heart. We observed sphingolipid-dependent cell hypertrophy, autophagy, and most importantly, cardiac dysfunction. New preliminary data implicate sphingolipids in mitochondrial damage and mitophagy, and also shed light on molecular mechanisms by which CerS5 causes autophagy. We have observed 1-nuclear accumulation of CerS5 and its product C14-ceramide, 2-CerS5-dependent accumulation of p53 in the nucleus, and 3- sphingolipid-dependent loss of mitochondrial reserve, and increase in mitophagy. Here we propose to dissect mechanisms for DbCM based on these initial findings, and using a combination of strategies including in vivo determinations o diastolic dysfunction in mice lacking CerS5, components of the mitophagy pathway, components of the macroautophagy pathway. As evidenced by our recent publications (Russo et al. 2012, J. Clin. Invest.; Russo et al 2013, J. Biol. Chem.), we are highly suited to address these questions that lie at the interface of sphingolipid biochemistry and cardiology. To facilitat this highly translational work we have enlisted cardiology and metabolism experts to complement our expertise in sphingolipid biochemistry, signaling, and analysis. These studies will reveal roles of these cell processes in diabetic cardiomyopathy, address the controversy surrounding the nature of autophagy in cardiac injury, specifically whether it is adaptive or deleterious, provide insights into sphingolipid-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction, which is especially important in the diabetic context, and finally reveal cell, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of sphingolipid-dependent lipotoxicity in the heart."
"9262150","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite remarkable advances in HIV medication effectiveness, adherence to treatment recommendations among HIV-infected youth is alarmingly poor, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Most current HIV treatment adherence interventions are designed to change thoughts and behaviors, but have limited effect on improving HIV medication adherence. Successful medication adherence relies on individuals' on-going self-regulation, an intertwined process involving coping, psychological function, and cognitive function. In this application, we propose to study the ability of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to improve HIV-infected youth's HIV medication adherence and self-regulation. MBSR is a program of meditation techniques to enhance participants' mindfulness, or present-focused, non-judgmental awareness. Our previous research in urban youth shows that MBSR improves health-related behaviors and self-regulation. Further, preliminary data from our R21 on MBSR for stress-reduction in HIV-infected youth suggest an association between mindfulness and improved medication adherence, as well as enhanced self-regulatory processes (coping, psychological function, and cognitive function). This intervention is innovative and significant because it focuses on self-regulatory processes, and it may be used alone or as a complement to current interventions addressing specific behaviors.  Building on the promising, but preliminary, findings of our R21 pilot study, this RCT will determine the effect of MBSR on HIV medication adherence (Aim 1) and self-regulation (Aim 2) among HIV-infected youth.  To achieve these aims, our experienced, collaborative team will conduct a full-scale, two-site RCT with 162 HIV-infected youth 13-24 years old, comparing 1) MBSR, 2) an active control (health education program), and 3) usual care. We will determine whether group assignment predicts outcomes of interest. We will also explore: 1) associations (and potential mediation) among mindfulness, self-regulation, and medication adherence and 2) using qualitative methods, reasons for non/low-participation to inform future implementation planning. While medication adherence is our primary adherence outcome, we will also look at other HIV treatment behaviors of appointment-keeping and sex behavior. Additionally, we will employ an innovative approach to use 2 potentially-complementary methods of medication adherence data collection."
"9278215","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to recognize social and moral norms, and use them to guide behavior, is fundamental to social cohesion and harmony. One prominent norm that guides adults' and children's actions and evaluations of events is the norm of a fair distribution of goods based on the principle of equality: that, all other things considered, good should be divided equally to recipients. The goal of the proposed experiments is to test a new developmental model regarding the development of fairness sensitivity within infancy, that stresses infants' interactions with caregivers in the context of sharing games as the source of age-related changes and individual differences in infants' acquisition of equality norms. The proposed research has 3 specific aims, 1) to characterize the development origins and trajectory of infants' burgeoning acquisition of equality norms, 2) to investigate the causal role f sharing experience infants' responses to inequality, 3) to investigate the nature of infants' responses to inequality, and, more specifically, whether and when such responses become moral intuitions. We test 3 central hypotheses regarding infants' developing sensitivity to fairness in the context of resource distribution tasks. The first hypothesis is that developmental changes occur between 6 and 9 months of age in infants' ability to detect inequality, coincident with the onset of sharing experience. The second hypothesis is that individual differences in infants' inequality responses arise from individual differences in parental dispositional empathy that influence the ways in which parents emphasize principles of equality and reciprocity in infant-caregiver interactions. The third hypothesis is that infants' inequality responses incrementally, and over time, begin to encompass various affective and cognitive components of more mature moral judgments. Across 10 experiments 6 to 24-month-old infants take part in both implicit tasks (based on looking times and pupil dilation) and explicit tasks (based on infants' overt social behavior) to investigate developmental changes and individual differences in responses to inequality. The proposed experiments are conceptually innovative because they 1) test a novel theoretical model with respect to infants' burgeoning fairness concerns that stresses the role of both parental attitudes and everyday experience in early social cognition, 2) seek to establish criteria for investigating the origins of moral judgment in infancy, and 3) investigate the origins of individual differences in early social cognition. The proposed work is also methodologically innovative as it introduces 3 novel experimental tasks and a novel dependent measure (pupil dilation) to study infants' acquisition of socio-moral norms; the introduction of these methods will have broad- ranging effects on the field or early perceptual and cognitive development by increasing the armory of tools and techniques available to developmental scientists. Finally, the proposed work may have import in the diagnosis and remediation of developmental disorders, such as autism, that are characterized by social deficits, including a recognition and understanding of social norms."
"9272692","Gene expression-based approaches to breast cancer are largely for prognostication, not prediction of individual drug responses. Furthermore, there are still no clinically validated somatic mutation-based approaches in breast cancer management based on next generation DNA sequencing (NGS). A major obstacle to progress in NGS-based diagnostics is a fundamental one: we poorly understand how complex cancer somatic genomes drive clinical phenotypes and drug vulnerabilities. Key issues such as therapeutic resistance, the contribution of the tumor microenvironment and the metastatic process belie single gene/mutation explanations. The new field of proteogenomics provides an opportunity to generate new insights by melding the complexity of cancer genomics with cancer proteomics to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant signal transduction events that drive cancer pathogenesis. To this end, we have formed a multi-institutional, multi-omics center to engage in collaborative studies under the aegis of the NCI-CPTAC PTRC initiative. Our core builds upon ongoing collaborations between the highly experienced and innovative teams at Baylor College of Medicine and the Broad Institute with complementary strengths in cancer genomics, precision diagnostics, proteogenomic technologies and decades of experience in breast cancer research. Our proposal leverages state-of-the-art quantitative discovery proteomics and phosphoproteomics as well as targeted assays to measure the kinome and chromatin modifications. These sensitive and reproducible pipelines will be used to analyze preclinical models, well-annotated cohorts and clinical trial samples in an iterative design. A robust proteogenomics pipeline developed by our group will be used to analyze and visualize the data. These analyses, together with the primary data generated by this multidisciplinary proposal will be made rapidly available to the scientific community. While the FOA envisioned that only targeted approaches could be applicable in the Clinical Research Arm, it did not anticipate the major advances already well underway in discovery proteomics. We show that the global, discovery-based proteome and phosphoproteome pipeline we have developed is already applicable to biopsy-scale tumor samples, providing deep and broad quantitative coverage of the proteome and phosphoproteome with excellent reproducibility and robustness. This key conceptual and practical advance enables us to employ discovery and targeted approaches in both Preclinical and Clinical arms thereby greatly increasing the power of our proposed studies to generate impactful insight into the causes of breast cancer mortality. We postulate that this integrated approach will provide new understanding of the biology of response and resistance to chemotherapeutics, sounder therapeutic hypotheses and identify more accurate predictive biomarkers for drug resistance and treatment selection that could be developed and deployed as clinical tests."
"9293910","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though our knowledge about autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has grown considerably over the last two decades, we know little about the clinical phenotype in adulthood. Recent studies suggest that anywhere from 10-20% of those diagnosed with ASD obtain favorable outcomes in young adulthood. At the same time, a growing body of literature suggests that for many, outcomes worsen during the transition from school-based services to adulthood. The primary aim of this project is to accurately describe ASD in adulthood as well as the transition to adulthood and to identify mechanisms that contribute to positive and negative outcomes in individuals with ASD and their families. The transition to adulthood will be examined in a well-described longitudinal sample of children referred for possible ASD at age two, and a group of non-spectrum developmentally delayed controls most of whom have been followed for two decades. The current study will follow the probands as they transition to adulthood; families will receive annual assessment packets over the next 5 years and receive two face-to-face assessments 3 years apart. The longevity of this study and the families' continued participation will aid our recruitment efforts and should allow us to set up a framework for collection of biological samples from this extraordinary group of families which would then be made available to interested scientists. Findings will inform best practices for the care and support of adults with ASD and ultimately lead to improvements in the quality of life for individuals affected by ASD and their families."
"9282809","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term career objective is to become an independently funded, accomplished physician-scientist with clinical and research expertise in the prevention of pyelonephritis and its sequelae in children. As a pediatric nephrologist, I aim t leverage clinical and scientific training to prevent deterioration of kidney function in these patients. To accomplish these objectives, this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award proposal outlines a plan to facilitate the acquisition of key research and career advancement skills under the mentorship of Dr. Kirk McHugh. Additional expertise will be provided by Drs. David Hains and Sheryl Justice, two investigators with whom I already have an established record of scientific collaboration and productivity. Together, this Research Advisory Committee will provide guidance to successfully transition from a junior investigator to an independently funded physician-scientist. I will benefit further from state-of-the-art facilities ad core services located at Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University. During my training, I will acquire new experimental and analytical skills in the laboratory as well as through classroom- based education at The Ohio State University. I will develop skills in oral and written presentation of research, scientific collaboration, leadership of a research team, and grantsmanship. The long-term research objectives of this work are to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of pyelonephritis and its sequelae in children, and to devise improved diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches to their care. My short-term career goal is to define the pathogenesis of pyelonephritis in children with congenital obstructive nephropathy (CON). Children with CON are especially vulnerable to pyelonephritis, which is an independent risk factor for prolonged hospitalization and progression to end-stage renal disease in this patient population.[1-3] I have identified significant changes in gene expression, morphology, and composition of renal urothelium in a murine model of CON.[4] I hypothesize that CON perturbs structural and functional properties of renal urothelium, placing patients at risk for pyelonephrits and renal scarring. In Specific Aim 1, I will define the relationship between hydronephrosis and structural integrity of renal urothelium. In Specific Aim 2, I will investigate the consequences of CON on bacterial binding and the expression of infection susceptibility genes by renal urothelium. In Specific Aim 3, I will determine if CON increases host susceptibility to experimental pyelonephritis and renal scarring. Completion of these research aims and the training proposed in my educational plan will allow me to develop the foundation to successfully compete for independent R01 funding in the future."
"9293907","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our final goal is to mechanistically characterize the essential role of the serotonin 5-HT2A (5HT2A) receptor and the metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptor as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heteromeric complex in regulating receptor trafficking, signaling, and antipsychotic-like behavior. The neurotransmitters serotonin and glutamate both have been the target of considerable attention regarding psychosis and antipsychotic drug development. Family A 5HT2A and family C mGlu2 are GPCRs that have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone, all have in common a high affinity for the 5HT2A receptor. Recent preclinical assays in rodents suggest that drugs that activate the mGlu2 receptor represent potential new antipsychotic medications. Our previous findings demonstrate that 5HT2A and mGlu2 maintain close molecular proximity in heterologous systems and in mouse frontal cortex. Using the combination of interdisciplinary approaches in vitro, in animal models and in postmortem human brain of schizophrenic subjects, we provide evidence that the 5HT2A-mGlu2 heteromeric receptor complex is necessary for the therapeutic responses induced by atypical and glutamate antipsychotic drugs, and is potentially involved in the altered cortical processes of schizophrenia. In order to provide a better understanding of the 5HT2A-mGlu2 complex in brain function, and the foundation for the development of more effective antipsychotic drugs, we propose to characterize the basic molecular mechanisms involved in its intracellular trafficking and signaling, as well as to investigate the antipsychotic-like behavioral responses that require expression of 5HT2A and mGlu2 as a GPCR heteromer in mouse. Our results are expected to extend our understanding of the molecular basis of psychosis, and may provide a route to the identification of new and more effective drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders."
"9269468","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal complaint among persons with disabilities and the general population, and can substantially impact their ability to perform functional activities. The majority of patients with shoulder pain have evidence of degenerative rotator cuff disease, yet simply identifying the rotator cuff as the source of pain proves insufficient to direct medical and rehabilitation strategies resulting in diminished treatment efficacy. Rehabilitation strategies typically focus on addressing abnormal shoulder motion believed to underlie the pain. However, the specific impact of abnormal scapular motion on the pathogenesis of rotator cuff disease is only theorized, thereby making it difficult for clinicians to target the most effective intervention strategies. The long-term objectves of my research are to identify movement-based mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of shoulder pain, and to develop and test the effectiveness of targeted rehabilitation interventions.  will first assess the impact of decreased scapular upward rotation because it is a common clinically-observed movement dysfunction and is believed to cause rotator cuff compression, which can lead to rotator cuff disease. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Determine the impact of decreased scapular upward rotation on rotator cuff compression in persons with shoulder pain; and 2) Identify the mechanisms by which sternoclavicular and acromioclavicular joint motion contribute to scapular upward rotation. My central hypothesis is that compared to asymptomatic controls, symptomatic individuals with decreased scapular upward rotation will have increased rotator cuff compression and will produce scapular upward rotation through different mechanisms. The proposed project will use advanced technologies and approaches for quantifying human motion and analyzing complex, multi-dimensional datasets. The research training plan has been developed specifically to accelerate the achievement of my long-term career objectives by strengthening scientific and professional skills, fostering networking and collaboration, and providing numerous opportunities to produce and disseminate research. The mentors for this proposal, Drs. Ludewig and Keefe, are well-suited to provide scientific and professional guidance as both are established researchers in the fields of biomechanics and multivariate data visualization and analysis, respectively. Both have a strong history of successful mentorship, publication, federal funding, and interdisciplinary collaborations. An advisory committee consisting of researchers and clinicians will provide content expertise in orthopaedic shoulder surgery, biomechanics, and statistics to help optimize the scope and impact of the proposed research. Receiving a Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA Fellowship will enhance the synergy between my mentors, advisory committee, and the rich research environment at the University of Minnesota ensuring my future success as an independent and impactful researcher."
"9250183","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Among the most ubiquitous scaffolds in medicinal chemistry, biological chemistry, and glycobiology are ?-substituted amines and ethers. The goal of the proposed research program is to define a general and modular catalytic strategy that enables the enantioselective synthesis of these structural motifs, including those imbedded within heterocyclic frameworks, in much the same way that cross coupling serves as an all-purpose and powerful protocol for the assembly of Csp2-Csp2 bonds. To achieve this goal, we will exploit the ability of low-valent transition metal catalysts to undergo oxidative addition to iminium and oxocarbenium ions and show that this underutilized activation mode offers a versatile entry to alkyl cross-coupling reactions. In this contribution, we will pursue catalyst design and development for enantioselective arylation, heteroarylation, and alkylation of readily available and stable N,O-acetals and acetals using organoboronate and organozinc reagents (Specific Aim 1). The substituted dihydroquinolines, piperidines, chromenes, and pyrans that we will obtain from these studies constitute the core structural elements of small molecules that exhibit an array of pharmacological activities. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop a new class of stable Ni precatalyst that is easily activated to Ni(0) and enables more efficient and convenient Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Reaction development will also demonstrate that the iminium/oxocarbenium ion activation mode facilitates unprecedented bond constructions with simple feedstock chemicals such as electron-deficient olefins and carbon dioxide for the synthesis of allylic ethers, allylic amines, and ?-amino acids (Specific Aim 3)."
"9298332","Recent technological advances have accelerated the development of biomedical research, promising high im- pact findings in both basic research and applied or clinical settings. Exploitation of the measurement data col- lected by the ever more prevalent high throughput assays, in turn, is dependent upon innovation in computa- tional biology and bioinformatics. Crucially, we will require further methodological advances for the detection and identification of novel patterns in the data that are of biomedical relevance. Such algorithmic advances can be hard to evaluate considering a lack of ground truth for truly novel discoveries. Systematic progress, howev- er, relies on regular performance evaluations. To address this open need of the research community, we are running a series of conferences on Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) that are orga- nized as part of the annual ISMB meetings of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB), the leading professional organization in the field. CAMDA has become a renowned conference, specializing in ex- amining and driving the cutting edge of complex data analyses in the life sciences. It was originally founded in 2000 (Nature 411, 885. Nature 424, 610) to provide a forum for the critical assessment of different techniques used in large-scale data analysis including, but not limited to high-dimensional gene expression profiling, other -omics, and clinical data (see www.camda.info for general background). It aims to establish the state-of-the-art in analysis methods, identifying progress as well as remaining issues, in order to highlight promising directions for future efforts. Addressing key challenges in the field, CAMDA was one of the first conferences to adopt and optimize the approach of a community-wide contest, with competing experts of the scientific community ana- lysing the same data sets. CAMDA contests focus on technically correct measurements and signal processing on one hand, and the most demanding open ended questions of biomedical inference on the other hand. CAMDA also collaborates with high-profile groups on defining effective contests, challenging the community to deeper analyses of the latest state-of-the-art benchmarks. For instance, several benchmarks generated by the MAQC/SEQC consortia were featured prominently. These consortia were coordinated by the FDA?s NCTR. In fact, CAMDA competitions have included contest data compiled together with the FDA?s NCTR from the very beginning, and regularly since 2012. Researchers worldwide are invited to take the CAMDA challenge, which has already become a prominent fixture (cf. Nature Methods 5, 569), regularly drawing 60?100 specialists from academia and industry. The results and methods of the different contributed analyses are discussed and com- pared at the conference. Selected presentations are published in a special Open Access proceedings issue in collaboration with leading modern publishers, such as F1000 Research, offering fast-track public dissemination and Open Peer Review. Delegates jointly select a winning team and runner-ups. Strikingly, the most impres- sive approaches often come from young scientists in early stages of their careers."
"9351582","Project Summary Our understanding of human disease mechanisms and therapies is crucially illuminated by information discovered in model systems. Although numerous resources exist that collect information about model organisms, their very multiplicity makes it difficult for researchers and clinicians to effectively utilize such resources, since each one focuses on a different species, disease, or data type. Furthermore, models do not faithfully recapitulate all aspects of disease pathology, and we need better methods for identifying and designing disease models that focus on elucidating aspects of phenotype and pathophysiology that are most relevant to human disease. The goal of the proposed work is to facilitate disease research by integrating a large diversity of disconnected resources so that we can make better use of existing model organisms and in vitro models. The Monarch Initiative is a global, translational consortium that provides sophisticated algorithms for phenotype comparison within and across species that leverage a large corpus of deeply integrated human and model data. For instance, our Exomiser tool supports the clinical community by prioritizing exomic variants according to variant pathogenicity and phenotypic relevance to support disease-gene discovery. Here we propose to extend the range and precision of Monarch disease modeling by including a greater diversity of species and sources that focus on a broader range of diseases, as well as new categories of clinical data such as disease progression and quantitative measurements. We will utilize these data in our enhanced algorithms that will include temporal ordering of phenotypes, absence of phenotypes, and more model organisms, to provide greater specificity of model-disease matching. Finally, we will make this large, semantically integrated landscape of human and model data navigable by end-users within our website and by community distribution of visualization tools. One example is PhenoGrid, which reveals phenotypic commonalities shared across model, disease, or patients against all other models and diseases in a succinct visual matrix. Finally, we will further assist external resources by prospectively assisting others to provide data compliant to Global Alliance for Genomics and Health and organism identification community standards."
"9294161","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early stage clinical trials of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) region has demonstrated real potential to improve the lives of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the neurophysiological basis for TRD symptoms remains unknown and definition of electrophysiological biomarkers that could someday be useful in closed-loop DBS control systems remain to be defined. The goal of this project is to identify the key electrophysiological features of chronically recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in the SCC. We propose that recent advances in patient-specific modeling, coupled with novel clinical DBS devices that enable ongoing LFP recording, represent a unique opportunity to augment our understanding of SCC electrophysiology and TRD. Therefore, we will develop detailed computer models that simulate the SCC LFP and use them to help interpret the clinical longterm recordings acquired from TRD patients. We hypothesize that modulation of theta-band activity in SCC can be correlated with TRD symptom relief from DBS, and these LFP signals arise from the interaction of inhibitory and excitatory inputs on SCC pyramidal neurons. We will use patient-specific models of SCC LFPs to evaluate our hypotheses. The LFP models for this project will consist of volume conductor models of the DBS electrodes implanted in each patient's brain, coupled to biophysical models SCC pyramidal neurons generating the sources and sinks responsible for the experimentally recorded signals. We will analyze 10 patients enrolled in an investigator initiated clinical trial of SCC DBS for TRD  (FDA IDE G130107). That trial will use the new Medtronic Activa PC+S experimental DBS system, which enables recording and telemetry of LFP signals from the implanted device. LFP measures of SCC oscillatory activity will also be accompanied by simultaneous acquisition of mood and clinical depression outcome measures. This unique collaborative research opportunity will integrate two DBS world experts, uniquely blending their specific skills and strengths, and apply cutting edge modeling methods to address real life clinical questions. The results of the project will expand our basic understanding of LFP signals in the human brain, and facilitate the evolution of closed-loop DBS technology for the treatment of depression.  BROADER IMPACTS: This proposal takes advantage of an evolving paradigm shift in how depression is defined and treated. The concept that depression is a neurological disorder with a quantifiable neurophysiological signature (even though we do not yet know the exact details), may be accepted by learned scholars. However, the world at large is still lacking in basic education and elucidation on one of the most common afflictions in society. Specifically the work proposed in this project has great potential to provide a cellular-level understanding of mood regulatory circuits in human patients. This has important translational implications for future quantitative classification of mood disorders and brain-based criteria for recovery. Such paradigm shifts in the clinical documentation and classification of depression could represent a springboard for public education and enlightenment on depression, driven by scientific discovery. Dr. Mayberg is especially well positioned to facilitate this broader impact goal; however, the scientific data must be assembled. This 2-center collaboration will facilitate that process and provide a unique training opportunity for both graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in both computational neuroscience and systems neuroscience. This project will further provide important infrastructure for training the next generation of interdisciplinary team scientists that will be necessary to address the complex neuro-engineering demands of the burgeoning field of clinical neuromodulation."
"9278063","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks continuation, from years 30 to 35, of a long-standing training program centered on the biology of aging. Entitled Career Training in the Biology of Aging, the objectives of our training program are to provide graduate students and post-doctoral fellows with a comprehensive, in-depth research training in aging biology, which emphasizes logical and conceptual thinking, together with career-oriented mentoring designed to promote success in a diverse professional landscape. We are requesting 6 pre-doctoral and 3 post-doctoral training positions. Aging biology has a long and proud history at the University of Michigan (UM), which is consistently ranked as one of the top Universities in the world with institutional support for aging research that is at an elite level. The Geriatrics Center in particular, which is recognized internationally for clinical, educational, and research programs, provides an outstanding setting for our Training Program. The program benefits from a Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Biology of Aging, a Claude Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, the Ann Arbor VA GRECC (Geriatrics Research, Education, and Clinical Center), and the soon to be funded Glenn Center Laboratories for the Biology of Aging. Our 20 preceptors represent a diverse, highly-interactive, well-funded, and creative group that spans 17 different department and four schools at UM. The popularity and success of our program is growing, as evidenced by (i) the spread of aging tracks and subject matter into cognate graduate programs, (ii) the ability of us to (every year) appoint highly-qualified trainees to each of our slots, (iii) our ability to attract young, promising faculty members to our program and aging research in general, and (iv) an increasing national recognition through individual faculty awards (e.g., Ellison Medical Foundation Junior and Senior scholars) and institutional support (e.g., the Glenn Laboratories designation).

These programmatic additions complement new efforts in mentorship including Certificate Programs that provide enhanced training in areas such as teaching, public policy, and translational education; integrated Individual Development Plans; mentorship committees for our post-doctoral trainees and junior faculty; extensive initial and refresher training in the responsible conduct of research; and focused efforts to recruit and retain a diverse trainee population."
"9303394","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this NIH Phase IIB Competing Renewal SBIR project, Actuated Medical, Inc. will finalize and clinically test the Low Insertion Force Epidural (LIFE), Actuated Needle Insertion System for Enhanced Control and Tactile Feel. LIFE uses closed-loop control of a vibrating needle to provide the clinician a more controlled entry through tough muscle and tissue, while improving tactile feel. Epidural anesthesia is a form of regional anesthesia involving injection of drugs directly into the epidural space just outside the spinal cord. Epidural anesthesia is used in 2.49M births every year in the U.S. Single shot epidurals, routinely given for pain management in the lower back and legs, account for another ~5.2M epidural procedures in the Medicare population alone. Epidural procedures require significant clinician expertise for accurate and safe medication delivery, due in part to the complexity of anatomy and variety of tissue planes the needle must traverse before reaching the dura. The major complication from epidural anesthesia is overshooting the epidural space and puncturing the dural sheath. Since epidural procedures are `by feel' and human anatomies vary, it is difficult for the clinician to anticipate the exact plane in which the tissue resistance will chang. The overshoot can occur when the force applied to the needle while traversing from hard tissue density (high resistance - e.g., ligamentum flavum) into the soft tissue density (low resistance - e.g., dura sheath) leads to needle acceleration. This needle acceleration causes accidental dural punctures in ~6% of epidural needle insertions. Approximately 86% of dural punctures result in a Post Dural Puncture Headaches (PDPH), leading to an average increase of 17 hours in the hospital - and in 72% of cases, an epidural blood patch is given. Longer-term complications include temporary or permanent cranial nerve injuries, subdural hematoma, infection, inability to perform activities of daily living and missed work. PDPH is also the third highest reason for litigation in anesthesiology with an estimated $130M in settlements annually in obstetrics alone. The controlled insertion force and velocity through tissue provided by LIFE allows an increased ability to focus on tactile feel, resulting in smooth tissue transitions - minimizing the complications of PDPH and associated cost in epidural anesthesia. Phase IIB Hypothesis: LIFE improves procedural safety and effectiveness. LIFE procedures result in a clinically significant reduction in complication rate and a clinically significant reduction in onst time of sensory anesthesia. Hypotheses to be tested with a=0.05, =0.20. Specific Aims: Aim 1 Electronic Shut-off Development Validated with Safety and Clinical Bench Testing, Early Feasibility Clinical Study.

"9276516","?    DESCRIPTION:   Vascularization is important for the treatment of various ischemic diseases and the survival of tissue-engineered constructs. Thus, the development of angiogenesis strategies has continuously attracted great attention in various fields. However, the realization o successful angiogenesis is challenging, because vascular formation and maturation involve multiple growth factors at different stages. Moreover, while insufficient angiogenic factors do not induce effective angiogenesis, excess angiogenic factors can lead to the formation of defective and leaky blood vessels. Thus, therapeutic angiogenesis requires not only multiple growth factors, but also mechanisms for modulating the time, dosage, and sequential order of growth factor delivery. While bolus injections are the simplest way to control the time, dosage, and sequential order of growth factor delivery, this mode of delivery requires very high levels of growth factors. It can lead to severe systemic toxicity. By contrast, polymeric delivery systems hold great promise for localized delivery of growth factors with reduced systemic toxicity. However, it is challenging to develop a polymeric system to control the release time, dosage and sequential order of multiple growth factors. The objective of this application is to develop a novel molecularly controlled release mechanism and a hydrogel-based polymeric system that can release multiple angiogenic factors with differential and independent timing and dose control, hence regulating angiogenesis in a dynamic manner. The central hypothesis is that multiple growth factors would be sequestered within the same hydrogel by specific binding to hydrogel-linked nucleic acid aptamers, and released specifically by competitive binding of complementary sequence (CS) triggers. To test this hypothesis, we will work on three specific aims: 1) to synthesize aptamer-functionalized superporous hydrogels (AS-gels) for high-capacity sequestration and retention of multiple growth factors; 2) to design and optimize aptamer and CS sequences and to determine molecularly regulated growth factor release from AS-gels in vitro; and 3) to investigate molecularly regulated growth factor release from AS-gels and angiogenesis in mice. We have performed preliminary studies and acquired compelling data showing that AS-gels can sequester growth factors and release them in the presence of CS triggers. More importantly, AS-gels can be triggered to release growth factors to stimulate angiogenesis in vivo. Therefore, the accomplishment of this project will lead to a novel strategy for on-demand delivery of multiple growth factors. It will benefit the treatment of various ischemic diseases such as repair of internal organs where it is too harmful or impossible to repeatedly inject growth factors directly into the tissue."
"9371148","Nuclear egress of herpesviruses is an essential and conserved process in virus replication, making it an attractive target for therapeutic interventions to target the broad array of human and animal herpesviruses. The egress process is carried out by a nuclear egress complex (NEC), the core of which is composed of two conserved virus proteins called, in HSV, pUL31 and pUL34. These two proteins may recruit various other virus and host cell proteins to the NEC, the identity and function of those other proteins depending upon the species of herpesvirus. Nuclear egress requires DNA containing capsids to bud into the inner nuclear membrane, and this budding is driven by multimerization of the pUL31/pUL34 heterodimer. Several independent lines of evidence show that the pUL31/pUL34 complex is sufficient to drive this budding. Nevertheless, formation of buds without capsids is not commonly observed in TEM analysis of infected cells, suggesting that capsids must somehow trigger budding, and that capsid-less budding is inhibited in the infected cell. The mechanism of this negative regulation is not understood, and a similar knowledge gap exists for many matrix-driven virus budding processes. Herpesvirus nuclear egress can therefore provide an attractive model for understanding general principles of regulation of viral envelopment. We have previously characterized a pUL34 mutant that is deficient in nuclear egress and shows extensive formation of empty vesicles that bud into the inner nuclear membrane. This adds further evidence that the budding function of the NEC is subject to negative regulation and that this regulation can be disrupted by specific mutations in the NEC proteins. We have selected for extragenic suppressor mutants that suppress the replication defect. Interestingly, we have found two types. In one type, we see one of several mutations in the other known component of the NEC, pUL31. In the other, there are no mutations in the UL31 gene. The existence of this second class of mutants strongly suggests the participation of a third, unidentified viral gene product that is a negative regulator of budding (NRB), and provides an avenue for identification of that gene product. We will identify and characterize the function of the NRB and its interaction with the pUL31/pUL34 heterodimer by pursuing two aims: (i) Our promiscuous budding mutant contains two discrete point mutations in pUL34, and we will determine which of these is responsible for its growth and promiscuous budding phenotypes. (ii) By isolating several non-UL31 suppressors and use of whole-genome sequencing, we will identify the NRB locus. We will confirm its function using recombinant mutant viruses that carry mutant UL34 and the putative NRB suppressor mutant. We will confirm the presence of the NRB in the NEC, and then confirm that it acts as a negative regulator of budding by co-expression with pUL31 and pUL34 in the absence of other viral proteins."
"9298711","The cerebral cortex is the substrate of human mental prowess. It is believed that its increase in size, with gyrification and expansion of upper layer neurons, mediates the growth of intellectual capacity during mammalian evolution. Species-specific cortical cytoarchitecture is largely determined during embryogenesis, integrating both cell autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. We are just beginning to understand the mechanisms regulating cortical size and gyrification, with contribution of specific secreted molecules into development of these cortical characteristics being particularly understudied. During development, the cerebral cortex arises in the telencephalon, lateral to the telencephalic dorsal midline. Several signaling centers have been described in the developing telencephalon, including a mesenchymal derivative meninges and the telencephalic dorsal midline, subdivided into the choroid plexus (ChP) and cortical hem (CH). In addition to secreting signaling molecules, the ChP also produces cerebrospinal fluid that nourishes and protects the brain, while the CH is a major germinal zone in dorsal brain. While analyzing the role of the transcription factors Lmx1a and Lmx1b, we found that Lmx1a/b double, but not single, mutants have an extraordinary phenotype of a compromised telencephalic dorsal midline, and expanded, yet layered neocortex with local overgrowths resembling gyri and an increased number of upper layer neurons. In addition, in Lmx1a/b double mutants, the segregation of the dorsal midline lineage from more lateral neuroepithelium was severely compromised, with dorsal midline progenitors aberrantly dispersing into more lateral neuroepithelium, including the neocortex. To our surprise, we found that Lmx1a and 1b are never expressed in the neocortex nor coexpressed in the telencephalon. Instead, during development, Lmx1a expression is limited to the ChP and CH while Lmx1b is expressed in the adjacent head mesenchyme, suggesting that previously unrecognized mesenchymal-dorsal midline interactions regulate key aspects of the telencephalic development. The goal of this proposal is to define Lmx1a/b - dependent mesenchymal / neuroepithelial pathways regulating development of the telencephalic dorsal midline and neocortex. In Aim 1 we will define how Lmx1a and 1b regulate the telencephalic dorsal midline patterning and CH growth, two poorly understood processes, which are critical for proper formation of the ChP and CH. In Aim 2 we will identify a new role of dorsal midline signaling in neocortical gyrification and expansion of upper layer neurons, and define dorsal midline secreted molecules mediating these processes. In Aim 3 we will define an Lmx1a/b-dependent molecular pathway regulating the segregation of the dorsal midline lineage from more lateral neuroepithelium and show that this process is critical to achieve proper cortical size in mice. Our studies will identify novel fundamental mechanisms regulating telencephalic development and are likely to provide new insights into cortical evolution and human developmental brain disorders."
"9311720","Project Title MicroRNA Shuttling during Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Project Summary This application addresses the following NHLBI Topic of Special Interest (TOSI): HL-142 - Exosomes as Paracrine Signal Mediators in Cardiovascular, Lung, and Blood Disease (R01).The main goal of this proposal is to target microRNA shuttling to prevent or treat perioperative acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a life threatening disease that represents a frequent postoperative complication, occurring in over 7% of surgical patients at risk. It is characterized by acute respiratory failure in the setting of non- cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality of surgical patients. Characteristic features of ARDS include accumulation of inflammatory cells ? particularly neutrophils (PMN), in conjunction with epithelial injury and uncontrolled lung inflammation. PMNs are among the first immune cells that traffic into the injured lungs and come into close spatial contact specifically with alveolar epithelia. Here, we considered the possibility that genetic information in the form of microRNAs (miRNAs) could be transferred from PMNs to alveolar epithelia. MiRNAs are small RNAs that inhibit the expression of mRNA targets. Studies have shown functions of miRNAs in regulating inflammatory outcomes in surgical and critical care patients, and implicate micro-vesicle contained miRNAs in intercellular crosstalk.  To examine miRNA shuttling from PMN into alveolar-epithelia, we initially used an in vitro approach where activated human PMN were co-incubated with primary human alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) for 6h, separated by a permeable membrane. A targeted miRNA array focusing on PMN-dependent miRNAs revealed a selective increase of miR-223 (over 100-fold) following co-culture. Similarly, we observed robust increases in alveolar-epithelial miR223 levels in a co-culture system utilizing murine PMN and murine alveolar epithelia. However, alveolar epithelial increases of miR-223 were completely abolished when PMN from miR-223 deficient mice were used. Subsequent studies of human PMN showed activation-dependent release of miR- 223 into their supernatant, and implicate extracellular vesicles in the transfer of PMN-derived miR-223 into alveolar epithelia. To address the functional role of miR-223-dependent miRNA-shuttling during ARDS, we exposed mice to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Indeed, we observed increased miR-223 levels in isolated alveolar epithelial cells of mice exposed to VILI. In contrast, this response was completely abolished following Ly6G antibody depletion of PMN, indicating that miR-223 is shuttled from PMN towards alveolar epithelia during ARDS in vivo. Functional studies revealed that gene-targeted mice for miR-223 experienced a more severe phenotype during VILI, suggesting a protective role of miR-223-dependent miRNA shuttling during ARDS. Thus, we hypothesize that miR-223-dependent miRNA shuttling represents an anti-inflammatory pathway that can be targeted for ARDS prevention or treatment. We propose 3 Aims to address our hypothesis. In the first aim, we will study PMN-dependent miR-223 transfer into alveolar epithelial cells during ARDS. In the second aim, we will identify the functional role of miR-223 in attenuating pulmonary epithelial inflammation by studying the putative miR-223 target gene poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). In Aim 3, we will target miR-223 for the treatment of ARDS. These studies are designed to identify novel treatment approaches for patients suffering from ARDS. Particularly in the elective perioperative setting, targeting miR223 represents a potential prophylactic treatment to prevent postoperative ARDS in patients at ARDS risk, or in patients undergoing ?high risk? surgery."
"9279230","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lymphatic vessels can transport fluid either by pressure-driven flow or by active pumping, even against gravity when necessary. In normal physiology, the lymphatic system is able to use these mechanisms to effectively and dynamically maintain tissue fluid homeostasis. In some diseases, however, lymphatic function is inefficient, resulting in tissue edema and weakened immune response. Because the mechanisms that control lymphatic function are not well-understood, we currently have no effective therapies that can restore lymphatic function in these patients. We propose that transport of lymph is controlled by complementary mechanobiological mechanisms involving Ca2+ fluxes and nitric oxide. We will test this hypothesis by developing a computational model of lymphatic transport and tissue fluid dynamics. We will then validate the simulations in a mouse model of lymphatic function and use it to identify and test novel treatments for edema and impaired lymph flow."

Microtubules are assembled from multiple ?- and -tubulin isotypes which are encoded by separate, evolutionarily conserved genes. Recently, mutations in the Tubulin 4a (Tubb4a) have been associated with a spectrum of neurological disorders in patients by sequencing studies. How mutations in the Tubb4a gene cause these disorders is not understood. We have generated a mouse model for Tubb4a-related developmental disorders from a forward genetic screen. Our studies will lead to insights into the mechanisms of the human disease spectrum, as well as to fundamental information on the role of microtubules in mammalian neural development and function."
"9211435","MISSISSIPPI CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN PERINATAL RESEARCH ADMINISTRATIVE, MENTORING AND EDUCATION CORE A SUMMARY  The major goal of the Mississippi Center of Excellence in Perinatal Research (CEPR) is to develop an innovative, independent and sustainable center of excellence in perinatal research and treatment spanning the spectrum from adverse pregnancy to subsequent outcomes in offspring. More specifically, perinatal research encompasses the study of disease states that may occur during gestation and early post-natal development that result in long term consequences in the mother and offspring across their lifespan. Studies will focus on the integrative relationships and health disparities in adverse pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and developmental programming of cardiovascular, renal, metabolic and behavioral diseases. This is an important area for research especially in light of the increasing evidence of long term health consequences brought about by adverse fetal environment and subsequent low birth weight during pregnancy both for the mother and offspring. An adverse perinatal environment is thought to account at least in part for the development of obesity, cardiovascular, renal, and behavioral diseases later in life for the offspring, and predispose the mothers for increased risk of these diseases with aging. Mississippi has one of the highest rates of preeclampsia, obesity, cardiovascular, renal and metabolic diseases and hypertension in the United States, leading to disproportionate levels of morbidity and mortality in our population. The incidence of preeclampsia is 10% in Mississippi, compared to 5% in the US. The prevalence of children with low birth weight in Mississippi is 12% in Caucasian children and 18% in African American children, compared to 5-8% in the other states. Studies that will provide novel insight into mechanisms responsible for the high rates of these diseases in Mississippi will require a paradigm shift in research that incorporates multidisciplinary integrated approaches, combining the efforts of basic, clinical and population scientists. A major goal of this proposal is to develop a research Center that will provide infrastructure and capacity for a multidisciplinary, diverse group of basic, clinical and population scientists working on the common synergistic theme of perinatal diseases and health disparities and to facilitate their collaborations. The specific aims of the Administrative, Mentoring and Education Core A include the following: 1. To provide overall leadership for development of infrastructure, mentoring programs and research core facilities that foster excellence in perinatal research spanning the spectrum from adverse pregnancy to subsequent outcomes in offspring and will lead to development of an innovative, internationally recognized Center of Excellence. 2. To develop, implement and monitor a Mentoring and Education Program that facilitates development of junior faculty investigators into independent, extramurally (NIH) funded researchers. 3. To develop and implement a Pipeline Grants Program for promising new investigators, with emphasis on recruiting and mentoring under-represented minority investigators. 4. To develop and implement educational programs that will facilitate collaborations and interactions among investigators from multiple disciplines in perinatal research at UMMC. 5. To develop and implement programs for recruiting, training, and mentoring a diverse group of undergraduate students and postdoctoral trainees to provide experience in mentoring for the junior investigators and so that the trainees become the next generation of perinatal researchers. 6. To implement formative and summative evaluation strategies for overall progress and effectiveness of the CEPR junior investigators, programs, and cores. 7. To provide high-level program administrative support and fiscal oversight of all research projects and cores. 8. To organize networking meetings and seminars related to the Center as well as meetings of the Executive Committee, Internal and External Advisory Committees. 9.To ensure that all Center programs, initiatives, policies and reporting mechanisms to UMMC and NIGMS are optimally developed, implemented, and administered within federal granting agency policies and deadlines."
"9282810","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate for this K23 Patient Oriented Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in pediatric nephrolithiasis research, with particular expertise in using innovative interventions to increase treatment adherence and decrease kidney stone recurrence among adolescents. The proposed mentored research and career development plan facilitates this career goal by identifying and mitigating risk factors for dehydration-mediated nephrolithiasis in adolescents. High and low ambient temperatures lead to dehydration and increase nephrolithiasis risk among adults, but the effect of temperature on stone risk in adolescents, who are particularly susceptible to temperature extremes, is unknown. Water is a cost-effective way to decrease kidney stone occurrence; however, despite dehydration being common among adolescents with stones, no studies have identified barriers to water intake or developed interventions to increase water intake in this population. Aim 1 will determine differences in the temperature thresholds associated with kidney stone presentation among adolescents and adults. Aim 2 will identify barriers to water intake among adolescents with kidney stones using real-time data gathered through mobile devices. Aim 3 will measure the immediate and sustained effect of mobile device hydration reminders on urine calcium oxalate supersaturation and urine volume in adolescents with calcium oxalate kidney stones. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large urban children's hospital and training in clinical epidemiology. An integral part of his career development will be continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team. The candidate's primary mentor is Susan Furth MD, PhD.

Ron Keren MD, MPH, Douglas Wiebe PhD, and Janet Audrain-McGovern PhD, will serve as co-mentors in the areas of clinical trials, ecological momentary assessment of adolescent health, and biobehavioral determinants of adolescent health, respectively. An advisory panel will help guide the candidate's career development and will provide expertise in metabolic kidney stone disease, water access among adolescents, biostatistics, and using mobile games to improve health. The proposed research and training plan will expand the candidate's expertise in advanced statistical analysis, clinical trials, and applying technology to improve health, and will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on investigating novel interventions to improve treatment adherence and decrease kidney stone recurrence among adolescents."
"9270642","The Ohio State University created the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) to catalyze research teams and facilitate innovation through creation of an environment that fosters translation of knowledge to improve human health. The Center will accomplish four specific aims: 1) Build on the unique and diverse strengths of our institution to create an integrated academic home for innovative, team-oriented clinical and translational science; 2) Enhance and nurture the career development of highly trained investigators, with an emphasis on innovation and transdisciplinary science; 3) Integrate and enhance an administrative infrastructure to optimize the efficient conduct of the highest quality, generalizable clinical and translational science that is relevant to the community setting; 4) Develop, enhance and integrate a portfolio of outstanding shared resources in support of transformative clinical and translational research. The CCTS will continue to focus on integrating the traditional biomedical research process (basic scientific discovery with translation to the bedside to dissemination into the community for improved patient outcomes) with a public health model (surveillance to prevention to response). By incorporating this bi-directional model in the creation of a robust translational science infrastructure, the OSU CCTS will foster both the traditional discovery to best practice paradigm as well as taking advantage of the insight garnered from our foundation of excellence in clinical care to stimulate basic discovery and clinical research inquiry. The vision and specific aims will be achieved through an integrated model of governance and partnership, home, and leadership for clinical and translational research spanning NCH and OSU; focused pilot funding initiatives for new team development within an innovation ecosystem; unique educational and training architecture which integrates acquisition of core competencies in research methodology, interpretation of results, implementation of findings, design thinking, team leadership skills and business acumen with rigorous discipline-specific laboratory (bench, clinical or community) training; and a clinical and translational science infrastructure that is cohesive, innovative and adaptable and more effective than the services that currently exist in order to ensure provision of the full range of disease-agnostic scientific resources needed to traverse the continuum of research from T1-4.

"9322860","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glioblastoma is a devastating primary brain tumor, which is characterized by rapid growth and resistance to conventional therapies. The disease is rare with an estimated prevalence of less than 25,000 cases in the United States. The overall median survival is approximately 15 months after treatment with standard therapies, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Cancer recurrence following initial therapy is common and especially devastating, as treatment options are limited and mostly ineffective for prolonging survival. The median survival time for patients with recurrent glioblastoma is 3 to 7 months. Thus, new treatment approaches are critically needed for patients in this setting. Oncolytic virotherapy represents an attractive novel therapeutic approach for recurrent glioblastoma. In this application, a potent oncolytic virus, DNX-2401, will be delivered to human brain tumors and evaluated in a human Phase II clinical study to assess clinical efficacy. DNX-2401 is a conditionally replicative oncolytic virus that functions by replicating in, and killing cells lacking growth control caused by any defect in the retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway, which is defective in 90% of glioblastomas. DNX-2401 also appears to trigger an antitumor immune response that can lead to tumor killing and increased survival in some patients. Results from Phase I clinical studies indicate that DNX-2401 can: (1) replicate in human glioblastoma tumors for a period of weeks to months, (2) elicit tumor necrosis within weeks of injection, (3) trigger intratumoral immune cell infiltration, and (4) lead to long term tumor destruction detectable by MRI scans. In 2014, DNX-2401 was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of glioma in the US and EU and Fast Track Status for recurrent glioblastoma in the US. This open-label, multicenter, Phase II clinical study will determine the efficacy of DNX-2401 when administered as a monotherapy to patients with recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma. Up to 112 patients will be enrolled and receive a single DNX-2401 dose of 3 X 1010 viral particles injected directly into the tumor at the time of a tumor biopsy procedure. Enrolled patients will then be followed for 18 months to assess efficacy and safety, and every 4 months thereafter for survival. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) prospectively determine the objective response rate (ORR) in recurrent glioblastoma, 2) to determine the rate of 12 month overall survival, the clinical benefit rate, and changes in quality of life, and 3) to evaluate the rate and severity of adverse events after treatment with DNX-2401."
"9351559","Sutovsky, Peter - PD SUMMARY The present project is directly relevant to the goals of RFA PAR-13-204, Dual Purpose with Dual Benefit: Research in Biomedicine and Agriculture Using Agriculturally Important Domestic Species. It will be the first project to systematically link the genetic traits affecting male fertility to sperm phenotypes easily measurable in a human/animal semen sample. Whole genome sequencing has identified a large number of gene polymorphisms with the potential to affect male fertility in humans and livestock. However, there is very little understanding of how these polymorphisms may affect the phenotypes of spermatozoa, their fertilizing ability and their influence on pre-embryo development and early embryo loss. We hypothesize that unique mutations/polymorphisms in genes expressed during spermatogenesis and pre- embryo development (further ?fertility associated genes?) are responsible for male subfertility and for early embryo loss during pregnancy. Our goal is to link these genetic traits to sperm phenotypes measurable in a semen sample and reflected by the males? fertility in vivo and in vitro. We chose artificial insemination (AI) bulls as model system because their genotypes are publically accessible, they have extensive fertility records from AI services, and their fertility in vivo correlates with their in vitro fertility. We have identified 3,601 candidate fertility-related genes with loss-of-function LOF) polymorphisms in the whole genome sequences of 219 bulls representing 18 breeds and performed phenotype analysis on several candidate gene products that revealed significant differences between fertile but under-performing bulls with less than satisfactory AI fertility and top bulls with highest AI fertility. Both genes also show non-synonymous polymorphisms in humans. AIM 1 of this project will employ genotyping and in silico search to identify genetic differences between fertile and subfertile bulls, including polymorphisms associated with high/low conception rates in AI, as well as those prevalent in yearling bulls that failed Breeding Soundness Evaluation (BSE). We hypothesize that fertile bulls fall on the opposite ends of fertility range due to identifiable polymorphisms in relatively few genes controlling spermatogenesis, sperm phenotype and sperm function. AIM 2 will use a combination of proteomic and cell biological approaches, including but not limited to innovative image based flow cytometry (IBFC), to link genetic fertility traits to the sperm phenotypes easily measurable in a semen sample. Based on the identification of sperm antigens expressed only or predominantly by carriers of the fertility-affecting mutations, we will develop multiplex, flow cytometry-based high throughput semen quality assays for routine use in field AI. We hypothesize that a non-synonymous change in a gene controlling spermatogenesis or sperm function will alter the sperm phenotype via change in the quantity, localization and/or function of a sperm or embryo protein encoded by this gene, thus influencing fertility of the carrier male. Altogether, we expect to identify and validate sperm phenotype biomarkers encoded by fertility associated polymorphic genes, and to improve sire management by genetic selection and objective, automated semen evaluation. This project will also yield new methods and potentially new treatments for human male and idiopathic infertility. The field of reproductive biology will be advanced through better understanding of the link between male genotype and sperm phenotype."
"9306164","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromosomes is being increasingly appreciated as a critical determinant of gene regulation and genome stability, and dysregulation of chromosome organization is a hallmark of many diseases, most prominently of cancer. Spatial genome architecture in healthy cells and its changes through the cell cycle, development and differentiation remain enigmatic. Recent progress if genomic technologies, particularly development of the Chromosome Conformation Capture methods such as 5C and Hi-C, allowed probing the spatial organization of chromosomes by comprehensive mapping of long-range chromatin interactions. Further progress, however, remains slow in part due to a gap between Hi-C data and 3D models of chromosome organization that can reveal principles of genome folding. Bridging between Hi-C data and polymer models of chromosomes is a major challenge and an objective of our research program. Recently we have developed methods for analysis of Hi-C data, and have successfully developed dynamic polymer models of human mitotic chromosomes and bacterial interphase chromosome, which revealed multiple levels of organization and structural elements not directly visible in the data. Here we propose to make natural next steps by developing multi-scale models of human interphase chromosome in different cell types, and mechanistic models of mitotic condensation that are based on available and emerging genome-wide interaction Hi-C maps. Combined this work has the potential to greatly deepen our understanding of 3D genome organization and reorganization in different cell types and during cell cycle."
"9275488","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) regulate cell growth, differentiation, and motility. Aberrant RTK signaling can lead to disease, and RTK-specific therapies are being sought. Yet, there is no consensus model of RTK signal transduction across the plasma membrane, and the lack of basic knowledge is a bottleneck in further development and improvement of RTK-specific therapies. Two models are most often discussed in the literature, the diffusion-based or canonical model, or the pre-formed dimer model, which differ in the absence and presence of unliganded dimers. Here we explore the novel concept that most RTKs follow a universal activation mechanism, with the difference rooted in the exact value of the unliganded dimerization constant, rather than the fundamental receptor behavior. To test this concept, here we will establish a methodology that, for the first time, allows quantitative RTK dimerization measurements for physiological expression levels. We will characterize the stability of several RTK unliganded dimers in native plasma membranes, and we will assess whether their behavior is described by the law of mass action. We will assess the ability of ligands to induce structural changes in the RTK dimers, independent of the exact values of the unliganded dimer stabilities, in accord with the idea of a universal model of RTK activation. A universal model will provide a unified framework for understanding the similarities and differences in RTK activity. It will help us transition from qualitative to quantitative understanding of RTK signal transduction with predictive power. In the long run, this basic knowledge will help the scientific community in the search for novel RTK-inhibitors that can be used to combats human cancers and growth disorders."
"9276720","Intracellular Ca signals reach their greatest intensity and highest frequencies in striated muscle. Sustaining them is calsequestrin, Casq, notable for its high Ca-binding capacity, convenient affinity and for two unique properties demonstrated in vitro: a marked dependence of its ability to bind Ca on how much free Ca is present and a Ca-driven tendency to polymerize. In addition to these Ca storing properties, there are evidences for a ?gating? function, whereby Casq senses the surrounding Ca concentration and accordingly induces the Ca release channel, RyR, to open or close, through a mechanical link presumably provided by triadin, Tr. The relevance of these functions becomes obvious in view of multiple mutations in Casq that are linked to grave diseases. Our goal is to define the operation in vivo of these unique properties demonstrated in vitro. To this end we joined a lab that has driven the study of Casq's physical chemistry and one that pioneered the quantification of Casq's functions in adult muscle. The plan includes the testing, in vitro and in vivo, of three hypotheses: (1) the extent and type of polymerization of Casq in cells changes as [Ca] depletes inside the cellular store (SR). (2) Changes in [Ca2+]SR are translated, via Casq and Tr, to gating changes in the RyR. (3) Mutations in Casq2 linked to the disease CPVT (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia), as well as M87T, a variant in Casq1 present in a sizable percentage of patients tested for the disease MH (malignant hyperthermia), cause the disease phenotype through mechanisms (1) and (2). To test (1) we will examine the EM structure of Casq1 in Ca-depleted cells, test the ability of a non-polymerizing mutated Casq1 to restore function in Casq-null cells, and carry out in vitro measurements of isotopic Ca diffusion, probing whether the presence of Casq alters Ca diffusion, and how the effects depends on Casq polymerization. For (2) we will explore the effects on Ca signaling of eliminating the putative link provided by Tr in (a) Tr-null mice and (b) cells acutely deprived of the link by expression of ?decoys?, the oligopeptides that bind Casq in the Tr sequence. For (3) we will characterize the Ca-dependent physical chemistry of 11 known mutants of Casq2, the homologous mutants of Casq1 and its M87T variant. We will then test the ability of these mutants to restore function in Casq-null mouse fibers. While understanding how this iconic biobuffer works will be a main reward, the long-term goal is to build a basic science foundation translatable to rational strategies that address human diseases, namely: find the causative mutation?generate the protein?characterize its function in vitro ? then in vivo specify the pathogenic functional gain or loss. Successful completion of these stages will allow us in future iterations of the project to ?design possible rescue strategies?test their efficacy."
"9268798","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 1994, the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) established the Summer Program in Quantitative Sciences for minority and underrepresented undergraduates, with the goal of encouraging the future participation of these students in graduate programs in Public Health, Biomedicine, and Biostatistics. This first-in-kind program served as a model for similar programs throughout the country, which have continued and strengthened this very important mission of increasing the diversity in Public Health and Biostatistics. In 2010, the American Mathematical Society recognized Harvard's program with its Mathematics Programs that Make a Difference Award, its annual award for programs that do an outstanding job of bringing more individuals from underrepresented minority groups into the mathematical sciences ... through replicable methods. The citation for the award states: The program has made a remarkable contribution to the national effort to produce more minority students pursuing careers in biostatistics and public health. Now, in 2011, we are embarking on the second stage of our pipeline development. We have recognized through our experience that while a single, short term summer program experience can be enormously successful at establishing the first segment in the pipeline, it is not sufficient to increase the minority presence that we need among graduate students, fellows and faculty in Biostatistics. Thus, we propose to reinforce and extend the pipeline that we have initiated with the summer program with the following completely new components to our program: 1. An annual symposium that will be attended by current and past program participants, faculty, fellows, graduate students, and the external advisory committee, and will feature oral presentations and posters by participants at all levels. The symposium will have dual academic and mentoring objectives. 2. Post-Baccalaureate Biostatistics Interns will reside at Harvard for three months each summer. These interns will participate in collaborative research projects and participate in three one-month rotations at academic and clinical centers at Harvard, and they will receive directed mentoring and support for graduate school applications and selection.

"9275485","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell migration is regulated by signals from cell-cell interactions, cell-matrix interactions and chemo-attractants and -repellants. Such signals are transduced and coordinated by cascades of post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions. Specifically, Src family tyrosine kinases are activated by mitogens and adhesion receptors and phosphorylate proteins that organize the leading edge and focal adhesions in migrating cells. The Cullin 5 RING (CRL5) E3 ubiquitin ligase and SOCS proteins (phosphotyrosine-dependent substrate adaptors for CRL5) have been implicated as potential tumor suppressors. We have found that SOCS-CRL5 complexes regulate Src activity, cell migration, proliferation and/or transformation in several cell types. Inhibiting the expression of SOCS proteins or Cul5 in epithelial cells stimulates migration, proliferation, and Src kinase activity. Increased Src is necessary but not sufficient for the increased migration and proliferation of CRL5-deficient cells, suggesting that SOCS-CRL5 complexes have additional substrates. We propose three broad aims to understand in depth how CRL5 regulates Src and cell migration. First, we will determine how CRL5 regulates Src activity. Second, we will identify CRL5 substrates, focusing on those that contain phosphotyrosine, and test which substrates regulate cell migration and proliferation. Third, we will dissect the mechanisms by which SOCS proteins and substrates coordinate focal adhesion and leading edge dynamics during cell migration. Collectively, our research will show how protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitylation cooperate to regulate cell biology."
"9398512","Project Summary By controlling the activity of cortex, the basal ganglia is critical to the organization of motor commands. However, how information about the context in which a movement is executed is communicated to the basal ganglia is poorly understood. In particular, connections between stress activated nuclei in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) that respond to threats in the environment, and the basal ganglia are poorly characterized. This proposal uses the expression and localization of the stress neuropeptide, Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF), and its primary receptor, CRFR1 to uncover how stress signals reach the basal ganglia. Within the basal ganglia, CRFR1 is highly expressed by a subset of neurons in the external Globus Pallidus (GPe). In preliminary experiments, we traced the inputs to CRFR1 neurons in the GPe and found novel connections from CRF neurons in stress responsive nuclei. We hypothesize that previously unmapped circuits from these nuclei coordinate stress-induced movement via the GPe. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis using three parallel strategies. First, we aim to map the connectivity of CRF-rich, stress responsive nuclei with the GPe using monosynaptic rabies viral tracing, direct immuno?uorescence, and optogenetics assisted circuit mapping. Then, we will test the functional impact of CRF on the properties of synaptic connections between these nuclei. Finally, we will activate or inhibit particular pathways and assay resulting anxiety-related behavior to determine how the GPe acts to bias movement in stress-relevant contexts. The experiments proposed will probe the anatomy, physiology, and function of the robust, but poorly described connection between limbic circuits that respond to stress and basal ganglia circuits that pattern movement."
"9271995","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Kara Hughan, a Pediatric Endocrinologist and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, is establishing herself as an academic leader in translational research to understand the mechanisms and establish preventions of cardiovascular disease associated with metabolic syndrome and mitochondrial dysfunction. Her proposal focuses on nitric oxide (NO) and mitochondrial biology in hypertension and metabolic syndrome and integrates state-of-the-art translational tools to test her hypotheses. Her multidisciplinary mentoring team will be critical to obtain the mechanistic data to lay the foundation for a pediatri RO1 grant, to guide her career towards independence, and to achieve her career objectives: (1) to advance her understanding and experience in the design, conduct and analysis of bench-to-bedside mechanistic phase I-II clinical trials; (2) to develop a translational toolbox encompassing multiple disciplines to apply to new avenues of cardiometabolic investigations in her future; (3) to apply the information and skill sets obtained from her K12 and K23 bench-to-bedside mechanistic phase I-II trials to pediatric trials in cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, and to develop an integrative pediatric cardiometabolic and mitochondrial center. She will complement her research with courses in bench research fundamentals, advanced statistics and clinical trial design, grant writing and responsible conduct of research training, ad participation in educational activities and scientific meetings in her areas of interest.  While nitrate and nitrite were traditionally considered to be inert and potentially toxic metabolites of O oxidation, it is now appreciated that both can be recycled to bioactive NO. Redox reactions of nitrite can also react with unsaturated fatty acids, such as conjugated linoleic acid, to yield nito-fatty acids (NO2-FA). Studies have shown that mitochondria reduce nitrite to NO which partially inhibits mitochondrial respiration and attenuates mitochondrial ROS generation, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS formation play an important role in hypertension and metabolic syndrome pathogenesis. Studies have suggested that the human nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway mediates signaling through NO and NO2-FA to reduce blood pressure, inhibit platelet activation and improve insulin sensitivity, endothelial and mitochondrial function. However, it remains unclear which products of nitrite metabolism, NO or NO2-FAs, modulate these physiological functions, and what common mechanism could account for their putative therapeutic benefits. Thus, further characterization of this important pathway provides a strong rationale to use oral nitrite to treat a targeted obese hypertensive population and assess the therapeutic effects. These findings form the proposal's overarching hypothesis that dietary supplementation with nitrite generates NO and NO2-FA to reduce blood pressure, inhibit platelet activation, and improve insulin sensitivity, endothelial and mitochondrial function in obese humans and represent a potential conceptual advance for the nitrate-nitrite-NO and cardiometabolic fields."
"9386854","ABSTRACT  Exposure to irritant crystals such as crystalline silica (CS) induces inflammation of lungs leading to chronic, irreversible disease-silicosis. Silicosis is incurable due to impaired particle clearance resulting in chronic lung inflammation and may eventually lead to many inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and lung cancer. CS exposure leads to recruitment of inflammatory cells to lungs, of which neutrophils are key mediators of the pathophysiology of silicosis. Our results in mouse models showed that CS-induced pulmonary inflammation is attenuated in leukotriene B4 receptor1 (BLT1-/-) deficient. Extensive in vivo studies in CS exposed mice and ex vivo studies in isolated bone marrow derived mast cells and macrophages suggested an intricate interplay of mediators such as LTB4, IL-1? and neutrophil active chemokines regulate silicosis. Moreover, our results suggest that CS-induced LTB4 production by mast cells sets the pace of sterile neutrophilic inflammation in the lung. Such inflammation is further perpetuated by IL-1? and CXC and CC neutrophil chemokines. The hypothesis of this proposal is that ?CS-induced lipidosome and inflammasome pathways function in consort with chemokines to coordinate sustained chronic sterile inflammation in silicosis?. In the proposed research plan in two specific aims we will perform studies to 1) delineate the molecular links between phagosome, lipidosome and inflammasome pathways in regulating the CS-induced production of neutrophil chemoattractants (LTB4, IL-1? and CXCL1). Signaling intermediates unique to each of these pathways will be identified as they can serve as potential drug targets to block neutrophil recruitment into silicotic lungs. In aim2 we will identify the cellular mechanisms that integrate the lipid/cytokine/chemokine (LTB4, IL-1? and CXCL1) responses into chronic inflammation in vivo. Select inhibitors of the leukotriene pathway will be tested for their efficacy in controlling CS-induced neutrophilic inflammation in preclinical mouse models. This knowledge will facilitate development of immunotherapeutic strategies to fight silicosis."
"9250806","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Family-based treatment (FBT) is a behavioral weight control intervention that targets children who are overweight/obese and their parents, and has the capacity to improve the weight status of non-targeted family members such as siblings. FBT has significant positive effects on body weight in children for up to 10-years of follow-up, and a robust relationship is observed between child and parent outcomes. FBT's concurrent care of two generations of obesity in the family is more efficacious and cost-effective than if family members are treated by their separate health care providers. Despite its recognized efficacy, FBT is mainly available in specialty clinics and many children fail to receive this guideline-based level of treatment, as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Primary care offers an optimal setting for delivery of FBT by capitalizing on the established relationship between primary care providers and families. Using interventionists co-located within the primary care setting overcomes barriers posed by fragmentation of care, and lack of provider time and training. One of the challenges to integrating childhood obesity treatment into primary care is optimizing limited health care resources. In behavioral weight loss programs, some individuals learn diet, physical activity, and behavior change information quickly, while others learn more slowly. Individuals also differ in their ability to implement treatment recommendations due to individual differences, such as problems with delaying gratification. FBT accommodates these individual differences by using a personalized system of instruction, or a mastery model, in which the content and dose of treatment is calibrated to the needs of the family, ensuring that treatment effort is consistent with need. This multi-site, clinical trial aims to evaluate over a to year period the effectiveness of FBT delivered by a trained interventionist co-located within primary care plus enhanced usual care delivered by the primary care provider (FBT+EUC) compared to enhanced usual care alone (EUC). Participants will be a representative sample of 528 families with a 6-12 year-old child and a parent who are both overweight/obese. Weight changes in approximately 228 siblings who are overweight/obese and between 2-18 years of age will also be studied. This study will test between group differences in child (Primary Specific Aim 1A) and parent (Primary Specific Aim 1B) weight change, as well as weight change in siblings who are overweight/obese (Secondary Aim 1), changes in parent and child delay of gratification, and how changes in delay of gratification are related to parent and child weight changes (Secondary Aim 2), participant level predictors of treatment success (Secondary Aim 3), and how provider attitudes toward evidence-based treatment and perceptions of FBT may relate to their intention to use co- located FBT in their practices in the future (Exploratory Aim 1). Establishing that FBT can be effectively implemented within real world settings is crucial to creating a system by which children and their families who suffer from obesity can be treated in a centralized primary care setting."
"9236987","There are ~ 2.5 million cirrhotics in United States with over 27,000 deaths annually. Despite liver transplantation, loss in muscle mass or sarcopenia is the most frequent complication that contributes to adverse clinical outcomes in cirrhosis. However, there are no established therapies as the underlying mechanisms of sarcopenia in cirrhosis are not well understood and therefore the proposed studies are of high clinical significance. In the previous funding cycle, we showed that hyperammonemia (a consistent abnormality in cirrhosis) results in activation p65NFkB mediated increased expression of myostatin that inhibits muscle protein synthesis. Since the NFkB-myostatin pathway is activated in response to ammonia, the key question in the renewal is to address the molecular mechanisms of how ammonia mediates muscle loss. Based on exciting preliminary data generated by studies in human cirrhotics, rodent models of hyperammonemia, cell culture studies in myotubes, we hypothesize that hyperammonemia inhibits skeletal muscle protein synthesis through non-canonical molecular signaling via MyD88 and metabolic stabilization of HIF1?. We plan to address this hypothesis through following aims: First we will identify the mechanism by which hyperammonemia activates NFkB. Our preliminary data shows that in response to hyperammonemia, RhBG, an ammonia transporter interacts with MyD88 (an adaptor protein for toll like receptor pathway). This non-conical interaction of MyD88 with RhBG activates the downstream signaling response as MyD88 silencing resulted in loss of NFkB activation despite hyperammonemia. Using muscle-specific conditional knockout mice along with cellular studies, we will identify the mechanism by which ammonia promotes RhBG-MyD88 interaction leading to signaling responses that activate NFkB. Second, we will determine how hyperammonemia induced myostatin inhibits the critical protein synthesis regulatory molecule, mTORC1 via the myostatin receptor complex (ALK5-ActIIBr). Our preliminary evidence shows that in hyperammonemia, classical AMPK kinases are not activated and that ALK5 functions as a novel AMPK kinase as depletion of ALK5 by knock down results in loss of AMPK activation. Studies using conditional muscle specific AMPK knockout mice will be complemented with cellular studies in myotubes to determine that ActIIBr-ALK5 is a novel AMPK kinase during hyperammonemia and is responsible for inhibiting protein synthesis. Third, we will dissect how metabolic disposal of ammonia in the muscle via mitochondrial metabolite, ? ketoglutarate (?KG) impairs mTORC1 and hinders protein synthesis by stabilizing HIF1?. We will use mice with muscle specific HIF1? deletion and ?KG precursors in our hyperammonemic cell culture model for these studies. Studies in this aim are critical to the idea that the skeletal muscle plays a key role in ammonia detoxification and that metabolic perturbations result in deleterious effects of hyperammonemia. Our novel, integrated metabolic-molecular studies on how ammonia causes muscle loss can be rapidly translated into targeted therapies to reverse sarcopenia in cirrhosis."
"9385575","Abstract Radiation-induced vascular injury (RIVI) is a critical component of the multi-organ failure (MOF) seen in acute radiation syndrome (ARS), following exposure to whole or partial body irradiation. The pathophysiology of ARS results from a combination of direct cytocidal effects of irradiation (IR) on tissue stem and progenitor cells (TSPC) and niche cells with varying radiosensitivity. While several growth and differentiation agents targeting TSPCs are being actively pursued as therapeutics to treat ARS, it is evident that rapid restoration of the sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) in the stem cell niche cells is critical for improving survival in ARS and in ameliorating the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE). SECs provide a conduit for nutrition and secrete angiocrine growth factors that support the proliferation of perivascular niche cells, such as, mesenchymal cells and TSPCs. Studies have implicated the essential role of the vascular component in acute radiation injuries of the bone marrow (BM) and intestine, as well as, in late effects in lung, liver and kidneys. In the bone marrow, the peri-arteriolar NG2+Nestinbright pericytes support hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence, while the peri-sinusoidal LepR+Nestindim mesenchymal cells promote HSC proliferation. Following exposure to IR, there is regression of BM-SEC with destruction of peri-sinusoidal niche cells and HSCs. VEGFR2-mediated regeneration of the marrow SECs is necessary for BM regeneration in ARS. We are collaborating with Janssen Pharmaceuticals on the development of a novel radiation countermeasure, thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetic (TPOm, aka JNJ-26366821), which is a Phase II ready, fully synthetic, PEGylated TPO receptor, c-MPL agonist peptide that reduces mortality and morbidity associated with BM-ARS. TPOm is unique amongst radiomitigators because of two distinct pharmacodynamic effects: (1) Mitigation of radiation-induced thrombocytopenia, anemia, and leukopenia upon binding and activation of the c-Mpl receptor on megakaryocytes and HSC, and (2) protection and regeneration of vascular endothelium, particularly SEC. A single dose of TPOm, administered 24 h post-whole body irradiation (WBI) improved survival significantly in multiple animal models of ARS, including mouse, rat, dog and non-human primates (NHP). TPO has also been shown to promote mobilization of vascular endothelial progenitor cells to sites of vascular injury. We, therefore, hypothesize that in addition to treating radiation-induced thrombocytopenia, TPOm would promote regeneration of SEC in multiple tissue stem cell niches, including bone marrow and intestine, thereby, accelerating tissue regeneration after radiation exposure. The proposal entails a step-wise plan to determine the radiomitigating efficacy of TPOm in vascular injuries at peripheral and tissue level under specific aim 1 using acute radiation injury model. These studies will focus on peripheral vascular damage, endothelial injury of the hematopoietic and perivascular niche (H-ARS model), and vascular endothelial injury in the crypt and villi (GI-ARS model). We will also validate the efficacy of TPOm in mice, determine its dose modification factor and its effect of inflammatory cytokine profiles under specific aim 2. Finally, we will determine its effects against DEARE of the lungs and kidney, identify early biomarkers of endothelial injury at systemic and tissue level and develop imaging techniques to assess the injury using high contrast micro-CT scanner."

"9273923","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Everyday social activities such as toy play with parents are the context for learning as it unfolds in real time. A well coordinated child-caregiver interaction seems likely to lead to better learning while a decoupled or non-coordinated interaction may disrupt learning and development. Both parent and child play an active role in early communication and word learning as children signals their choices of communication and also determine what environmental information is most relevant to their own developmental needs, and as parents react to those signals in a sensitive manner and provide relevant information to ease the challenge of children's matching linguistic symbols to their referents. The goal of the proposed research is to achieve a deeper understanding of the sensorimotor basis of early social coordination and its potentially critical roles in later language learning an other development milestones. Toward this goal, the proposed research has three key components: 1) a set of longitudinal and cross-sectional experiments will collect multiple streams of sensorimotor data from child-parent toy play to discover fine-grained patterns characteristic of early developmental changes in child-parent social interactions which will provide new evidence on the developmental origins of these skills; 2) we will link sensorimotor dynamics in child-parent interaction with standardized, highly reliable behavioral measures that have been widely used, with the goal to understand how children's moment-to-moment social interactions with social partners may build generalizable word learning skills; 3) we will link social coordination in toy play with parental responsiveness and individual differences in development milestones, which will provide deeper insights into the consequential and longer-term role of early parent-child interactions in developmental process."
"9274841","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autophagy represents a complex pathway of cellular homeostasis that functions in cytoprotection, but if dysregulated can cause cell death; a complete knowledge of regulation is critical for the potential modulation of this process for therapeutic purposes, and to increase our basic understanding of membrane dynamics and organelle biogenesis. Autophagy occurs in all eukaryotes and the protein components of the autophagic machinery are conserved from yeast to mammals. The hallmark of this process is the formation of double- membrane cytosolic vesicles, autophagosomes that sequester cytoplasmic components. After completion, the autophagosomes fuse with the lysosome/vacuole to release the inner vesicle that is broken down, allowing access to the cargo. Autophagy plays a role in various developmental processes and is associated with a range of pathophysiological conditions. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanism and regulation of autophagy and how this translates into autophagosome formation.  The molecular field of autophagy is slightly over fifteen years old, which is startling for a pathway with connections to such a wide range of physiological processes. In a practical sense, this also means there are many questions remaining to be answered. For example, we want to (1) determine how environmental signals are transduced into an autophagic response, defining the kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors that control autophagy; (2) identify the origin of the sequestering compartment and determine how membrane from a variety of organelles can be commandeered to provide the material needed for autophagosome formation; and (3) understand what regulatory controls determine the switch between specific and non-specific types of autophagy, and the method of achieving cargo specificity. We are using yeast to investigate the molecular mechanism of autophagy; this is the best system for a molecular genetics and biochemical analysis of this complex process. Because of the high degree of conservation, however, the information we learn from yeast will be applicable to higher eukaryotes.  At present, almost forty autophagy-related (Atg) proteins have been identified, but their functions and the regulatory processes that control them are largely undefined. The experiments described in this proposal are significant because they will elucidate important links between upstream regulatory components and the machinery that carries out autophagy, providing the next step in a comprehensive analysis that links the signal transduction elements to the functional apparatus, advancing our knowledge of basic cell biology, and identifying targets for ultimate therapeutic intervention. The proposed research is innovative, because it is providing new, and in some cases paradigm-shifting, information about the regulatory and functional components of autophagy."
"9211439","PROJECT III: ROLE OF 17?-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE IN THE HYPERTENSION OF PCOS. SUMMARY Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by increases in plasma androgens and/or hirsutism, irregular menstrual periods, ovarian cystic morphology and infertility. Although the etiology of PCOS is unknown, one theory is that PCOS may be developmentally programmed due to exposure to prenatal androgens. PCOS is one of the most common female endocrine disorders, affecting 5 to 26% of women of reproductive age depending on ethnicity and lifestyle. Recent attention in women with PCOS in the US has focused on several metabolic derangements such as obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension. In the US the prevalence of obesity in PCOS women is up to 80%. Obesity plays a major role in the clinical manifestations of the syndrome, since weight loss is associated with improved fertility and reductions in metabolic derangements in PCOS patients. Several lines of evidence indicate that there is a positive relationship between circulating levels of androgens, obesity, insulin resistance and blood pressure (BP) in women with PCOS. Whether and how increases in circulating androgens cause obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension in PCOS women remains poorly understood and is the main focus of this proposal.  We have established an animal model of PCOS in female rats that mimics many of the metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities of women with PCOS. Implantation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) pellets in female rats causes an increase in food intake, subcutaneous adipose tissue, insulin resistance, obesity, and elevated BP, as observed in PCOS women.  In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that in PCOS, increased plasma androgens via the androgen receptor cause an increase in food intake leading to obesity that includes an increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue, and insulin resistance. The combination of increased circulating androgens, obesity and insulin resistance activate adipose 17?-HSD, resulting in increased adipose androgen synthesis that further increases circulating androgen levels setting up a vicious cycle. Increased circulating androgens lead to subsequent activation of the intrarenal renin angiotensin system and elevated blood pressure. This hypothesis will be tested using an integrative physiological approach using whole animal, cellular, molecular and imaging methods in the following specific aims: 1) to test the hypothesis that increased circulating androgens via activation of the androgen receptor promotes obesity with an increase in subcutaneous adipose tissue and insulin resistance in PCOS; 2) to test the hypothesis that increases in subcutaneous adipose tissue and insulin resistance lead to activation of 17?-HSD in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, thus further increasing circulating levels of androgens in PCOS; 3) to test the hypothesis that increased circulating androgens activate the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system (RAS), shifting the pressure-natriuresis curve to the right, leading to increases in blood pressure in PCOS; 4) to test the hypothesis that either elevated circulating androgens or activation of the RAS by androgens leads to insulin resistance in PCOS independently of obesity. This novel and clinically relevant proposal will elucidate potential mechanisms by which androgens regulate blood pressure, promote obesity and insulin resistance in women with PCOS, determine the pathophysiological interactions between these cardiovascular risk factors and will pave the way to identify novel and improved therapeutic tools to treat the clinical manifestations associated with hyperandrogenism in PCOS women.

"9335396","ABSTRACT  There are known anatomic and physiologic risk factors for sleep apnea (OSA). One strategy to discover how these factors together contribute to OSA risk is to examine patients with clinically defined extreme phenotypes, i.e., patients whose disease status is not explained by primary clinical risk factors. As obesity is the primary risk factor for OSA, two such phenotypes are OSA patients with BMI?25 kg/m2 and non-apneic controls with BMI?35 kg/m2. Apneics with BMI?25 have OSA despite not having the obesity risk factor. Non- apneic controls with BMI?35 are protected from OSA despite high obesity levels; the mechanisms protecting these individuals are unknown. Thus, the overall objectives of this proposal are directed towards understanding the anatomical and physiological factors determining these two extreme OSA phenotypes.  Most individuals with a BMI?35 have OSA and most individuals with a BMI?25 do not. The primary question is, ?What protects individuals with a BMI?35 from OSA and why do some individuals with a BMI?25 have OSA?? Based on our preliminary data, the global hypotheses motivating this study are that: 1) in obese controls (BMI?35) tongue fat and parapharyngeal fat pad volumes will be reduced, pharyngeal muscle responsiveness will be enhanced and airway collapsibility will be less compromised compared to obese apneics, protecting these obese subjects from OSA (Aim 1); 2) in thin apneics (BMI?25) mandibular depth (a measure of retrognathia) will be smaller, UA total soft tissue volume will be larger, loop gain will be higher, and airway collapsibility will be more compromised compared to non-apneics, causing OSA in these thin subjects (Aim 2); and 3) using machine learning techniques, we will assess complex interactions between all anatomic and physiologic traits that predict OSA status in each extreme phenotype (Aim 3). We have the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To quantitatively assess upper airway anatomic phenotypes with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and physiologic phenotypes in gender, age, BMI and race matched apneics and non- apneic controls with a BMI ? 35 kg/m2. Specific Aim 2: To quantitatively assess UA anatomic phenotypes with MRI and physiologic phenotypes in gender, age, BMI and race matched apneics and controls with a BMI ? 25 kg/m2. Specific Aim 3: Utilize machine learning techniques (CART and Random Forest) to explore pathways to OSA using the anatomic and physiologic domains and their interactions, in both extreme phenotypes. This analysis will identify the most important combinations of anatomic and physiologic risk/protective factors for OSA, serving to both validate the hypotheses in Aims 1-2 and identify novel disease pathways. This proposal has multiple innovative features, but the unique innovation is the examination of two extreme OSA phenotypes. The project will lead to better understanding of the relative contribution of each anatomic/physiologic trait to the development of OSA within a given individual, which may allow targeting appropriate trait(s) with specific and novel treatments. This is a primary goal of P4 medicine, an overarching theme to the overall Program Project."

Community Engagement Core To address long-standing tribal concerns about environmental health disparities associated with chronic exposures to metals and other contaminants in water, air, land and food, the Community Engagement Core (CEC) of the UNM Center for Native American Environmental Health Equity Research (CNAEHER) will focus engagement efforts on (i) building sustainable and culturally appropriate environmental health (EH) capacity in the partner tribal communities, (ii) increasing community participation in EH research approaches, particularly multiple pathway exposure assessment, and (iii) implementing multidirectional translational strategies that not only effectively communicate the research results to the communities but also ensure that community knowledge and Native perspectives on health inform the science and tribal and federal decision-making. The CEC will build on established relationships of the UNM Community Environmental Health Program with the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, Crow Tribe in Montana, and the Navajo Nation in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, and will expand in later years of the Center to build new relationships with Pacific Northwest tribes in Washington. CEC will use electronic means to coordinate activities of a team of tribal researchers, specialists at nonprofit and Indian-owned organizations, and university-based scientists to have regular communication and collaboration across the wide expanses of the Western U.S. that separate these communities. The team will address commonly shared tribal concerns about heavy metal contamination of water, air, lands and traditional foods through community-based environmental monitoring, university-based research into the biological mechanisms of toxicity of chronic exposures, and webinars and workshops designed to ensure that indigenous perspectives inform actions to improve environmental health literacy and capacity to reduce health risks in Native communities. The Center?s community engagement and research provide an opportunity to evaluate generalizability of engagement methods and environmental and biomedical research to other Native American communities facing similar EH disparities. By expanding into the Pacific Northwest during the initial five-year project, the Center will develop the capacity and know-how to become the environmental health disparities center for all of Native America."
"9278190","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ca2+ release via IP3R channels is the most ubiquitous and versatile cellular signaling mechanism that plays a key role in the regulation of diverse physiological functions, including fertilization, hormone secretion, gene transcription, metabolic regulation, immune responses, apoptosis, learning and memory. Despite established significance of IP3Rs in physiology and pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying function of these channels, both in native and disease states, remain poorly understood, mainly because of the lack of high- resolution structural details about the 3D architecture of IP3Rs. Such structures have proven exceptionally difficult to obtain given the large size of IP3Rs (~1.3 MDa), their location in the membrane environment, and their dynamic nature. The focus of this proposal is type 1 IP3R (IP3R1), the predominant type of IP3-gated Ca2+ release channel in cerebellar Purkinje cells. To date, the best structure of the entire IP3R1 is resolved by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) at intermediate resolution (10-15 ?), and the crystal structures are limited to a soluble portion of the cytoplasmic region representing only ~15% of the overall structure. Therefore, most critical issues surrounding gating of IP3R channels are stil ambiguous. In this application, we seek to answer the fundamental  questions on IP3R1 gating: what are the structural determinants  of Ca2+  permeation  through  IP3R1,  how  ligands  control  the gating  process  and  what conformational changes underlie pore opening in IP3R channels. To address these questions, we will extend structure determination of the entire IP3R1 to sub-nanometer resolution and will determine its structure in a near-native lipid environment. We will combine structural methodologies from cryo-EM, computational tools and bioinformatics with biochemical and biophysical techniques including radioligand binding, fluorescence- based Ca2+ flux assays and lipid bilayer channel recordings. This multidisciplinary approach will allow correlating structural analysis with channel function. Proposed structural studies will exploit single-particle cryo- EM methodology. Thus, the IP3R1 protein complex will be purified from detergent solubilized microsomal membranes and visualized in the form of individual particles embedded in vitreous ice. The IP3R1 structure will be analyzed in Apo- (aim 1) and ligand-bound states (aim 2) by reproducing the functionally relevant conditions in vitro and freeze-trapping the reaction on the EM grid. We then propose to reconstitute IP3R1 channel into small unilamellar lipid vesicles and to use a variant of single-particle reconstruction to solve the channel structure in the lipid membrane (aim 3). With these studies accomplished, we anticipate to establish the structural and mechanistic basis for IP3R1 function and to elucidate how defects in molecular mechanisms regulating the channel's gating can lead to abnormal cell Ca2+ levels underlying numerous diseases."
"9276795","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A pressing need exists for clinically applicable systems for ex vivo platelet production. Multiple technological advances have set the stage to attain this goal. Inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from donor somatic cells can now be manipulated to yield customized, expandable megakaryocyte (Mk) progenitors. Perfusion bioreactors that replicate the bone marrow environment have enhanced the efficiency of functional platelet release and collection. The biggest roadblock in clinical translation consiss of the problem of scalability. In particular, highly proliferative Mk progenitors yield poor platelt numbers, and Mk with high platelet yields come from progenitors with very limited prolferative capacity. An ability to circumvent these limitations by combining progenitor expandability with efficient platelet production will be critical for cost- effective scale-up. The efficiency of platlet production depends on a program of Mk morphogenesis involving massive cellular enlargement and polyploidization. The relative balance of morphogenetic versus proliferative potential depends on ontogenic developmental stage. Thus, fetal and neonatal Mk progenitors show extensive self-renewal but limited morphogenesis. Progenitors derived from human ESC and iPSC recapitulate the features of early fetal megakaryopoiesis: high proliferation with minimal morphogenesis. The influence of ontogenic stage affects not only platelet numbers but also extends to platelet function. Specifically, Mk from earlier in ontogeny yield platelets with proportionally diminished aggregation capacity.  Our lab identified a signaling pathway critical in Mk morphogenesis (Elagib et al. Dev. Cell, 2013). In this pathway, high-amplitude activation of the transcriptional kinase P-TEFb occurs due to downregulation of the noncoding RNA 7SK. In new unpublished data, we find that defects in this Mk morphogenesis pathway underlie the phenotypic differences between neonatal and adult Mk. Specifically, neonatal Mk fail to downregulate 7SK and fail to trigger high-amplitude activation of P-TEFb. We have identified a 7SK binding factor, IGF2BP3, that is present only in neonatal Mk and functions as an ontogenic masterswitch in Mk morphogenesis. Antagonism of IGF2BP3 by either shRNA knockdown or a novel inhibitory compound significantly augments morphogenesis in neonatal Mk. Conversely, ectopic IGF2BP3 converts adult MK into a fetal phenotype, and a putative agonist compound augments fetal-like features in neonatal Mk. IGF2BP3 thus represents a highly attractive target for engineering scalable megakaryopoiesis. In human neonatal Mk, it appears to be the key determinant of Mk ontogenic phenotype. From a therapeutic perspective, it is a druggable target, with the capability of both negative and positive modulation. Aim 1 will examine the morphogenesis signaling pathway in iPSC Mk, the contributions of IGF2BP factors, and optimal approaches to enhance thrombopoiesis. Aim 2 will take a complementary approach and determine circuits necessary for fetal reprogramming of adult Mk progenitors, thereby allowing for their large-scale, reversible expansion."
"9373065","Project summary: Host-microbial interactions are a critical determinant of health. The intestinal mucosa provides serval distinct overlapping mechanisms that function together in concert to reduce the ability of pathogens to gain access to the body. These protective mechanisms are largely provided by specialized intestinal epithelial cells that can produce mucous and bactericidal antimicrobial peptides. While it has long been known that neurotransmitters control this process, it had been assumed that these originated from neurons. Recently we have identified a unique subset of B- and T-cells that produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and that are specifically recruited during enteric bacterial infection. The overall goals of this project are to determine the role of these unique B- and T-cells and elucidate the mechanisms of protection that are elicited. This will be achieved by using neutralizing antibodies and conditional knockout mice to decipher the role of these cells during infection (SA1). Determining if these B- and T-cells are protective to the host by increasing mucous production and release will be assessed in SA2. The ability of these cells to induce expression of antimicrobial peptides will also be assessed in SA2. Together, these proposed studies will decipher the contribution of a unique immune cell population to mucosal host defense."
"9282757","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal disorders characterized by dysplastic hematopoietic cells, ineffective hematopoiesis, and a variable risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with few curative therapeutic options. Recent studies have established that genes encoding spliceosomal proteins are the most common mutational targets in MDS, with ~60% of MDS patients harboring a spliceosomal gene mutation. These spliceosomal mutations occur exclusively in a heterozygous context, are mutually exclusive with one another, and frequently co-occur with mutations affecting specific epigenetic regulators. However, the molecular and biological reasons for this distinctive mutational pattern are not known, nor is it understood how spliceosomal mutations contribute to dysplastic hematopoiesis. Here, we propose to determine the genetic basis as well as mechanistic and phenotypic consequences of mutations affecting the spliceosomal gene SRSF2. Our team consists of a physician-scientist with experience in MDS biology and patient care (Abdel-Wahab) and a basic scientist with expertise in RNA splicing and genomics (Bradley). In preliminary studies, we found that SRSF2 mutations result in impaired hematopoiesis and altered exon recognition, and we generated extensive novel reagents to explore the functional importance of SRSF2 mutations. We propose to build on these preliminary studies as follows: Aim 1, Determine how SRSF2 mutations alter SFSF2's normal role in pre-mRNA splicing to promote myelodysplasia; Aim 2, determine the biological and molecular basis for the association between SRSF2 mutations and additional genetic alterations; Aim 3, Identify and test therapeutic strategies for targeting malignant cells with SRSF2 mutations. The significance of these studies is that they will definitively connect SRSF2 mutations to altered RNA splicing mechanisms and dysplastic hematopoiesis. The health relatedness is that our studies may identify new therapeutic opportunities for MDS by selectively targeting cells carrying SRSF2 mutations."
"9280170","Rapid advances in genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing are transforming our understandings of both human health and human history. These technologies also promise unprecedented power to intervene on the bodies of individuals with or at risk of disease, and even to alter the identities or futures of individuals not yet born. Such knowledge and power imply immense responsibility to use them in ways that promote core ethical values, including individual and collective welfare, social justice, protection of the vulnerable, and respect for both the autonomy of persons and the interests of communities. Fulfilling these responsibilities requires a cadre of diverse, highly trained, interdisciplinary scholars prepared to engage critically and respectfully with the profound ethical, legal and social challenges raised by genetic and genomic technologies. Responding to this need, the fundamental goal of the Penn Postdoctoral Training Program in the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications (ELSI) of Genetics and Genomics is to prepare trainees for success as creative, independent investigators in the field of ELSI research. The program, housed within the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the Perelman School of Medicine, will achieve this goal through two core components: 1) completion of a Master of Science in Medical Ethics (MSME) degree that blends training in conceptual bioethics, empirical methods and genetic science, and 2) mentored original research leading to high-impact empirical and conceptual scholarly publications. An outstanding program faculty, consisting of 12 experienced ELSI scholars and mentors from departments at the Perelman School of Medicine, the School of Arts and Sciences and the Penn Law School, will serve as preceptors to program trainees. Trainees will present at and participate in the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy's monthly works-in-progress and seminar series, attend a wide range of seminars and conferences across the University focused on genetic medicine and science as well as on ethics, law, economics and health policy, and present at national meetings. Trainees will also gain exposure to genetic medicine through shadowing expert geneticists and counselors drawn from the full spectrum of adult, pediatric and reproductive genetics practice. Finally, trainees will serve as members of one of the UPenn institutional review boards (IRBs) that review ELSI-related research. The program will train seven postdoctoral scholars, each of whom will participate for three years, and will ensure diversity of discipline and background among enrolled trainees by extensive targeted outreach to diverse academic communities."
"9276732","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Agents that can deliver cell-impermeable biologics inside live cells have the potential to greatly improve the treatment of human diseases and benefit medical research in general. The delivery of peptides, proteins, or siRNAs into cells can for instance be used to reintroduce tumor-suppressors into cancer cells or to knock down disease-causing genes by RNA interference. Yet, methodologies that deliver macromolecules into cells are inefficient and this bottleneck has greatly limited the development of protein or RNA-based therapies. Over the past decade, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have generated a lot of enthusiasm because of their ability to carry macromolecular cargos into cells. A major obstacle to the use of CPPs is that, while they are able to enter cells by endocytosis, CPPs and cargo are retained in endosomes, greatly limiting their usefulness. We have recently uncovered the ability of a specific CPP derivative, a disulfide-bonded dimer of fluorescently labeled TAT (dfTAT), to escape endosomes with astonishingly high efficiency. Consequently, we have further established that dfTAT can deliver proteins into live cells with great ease. Remarkably, the endosomal escape mediated by this agent is not cytotoxic. dfTAT is therefore an extremely promising delivery agents that holds the secret to effective and safe cellular penetration. The objectives of this proposal are to establish the mechanisms of dfTAT-mediated endosomal escape and to identify molecular and cellular features required for this activity. We will identify the structural and molecular determinants of dfTAT endosomal escape by establishing critically needed structure- activity relationships. In addition, we will identify the triggers of endosomal leakage and establish the cellular factors that contribute to this process. The rationale for the proposed research is that the mechanistic knowledge gained will permit the design of improved endosomolytic reagents that can be optimally incorporated into therapeutically relevant drug delivery systems. This should in turn greatly facilitate the development of protein and RNA-based therapeutics and benefit researchers as well as patients."
"9388440","Project Summary/Abstract It has known that bladder cancer (BCa) mortality is higher in African American patients. Disparity exists between African-American (AA) and European-American (EA), in the clinical outcome of BCa. The long-term objective of our research plan is to reduce the disproportionate effects of bladder cancer (BCa) on African American. A guiding principle of our methodology is that alterations in mitochondrial metabolites exist between African American and European American BCa and that these differences can explain, in part, BCa health disparity. In this application, we propose to use the technique of metabolomic profiling to uncover these underlying differences. To date, a metabolomic analyses aimed at understanding of bladder cancer health disparity has not been reported. We have recently published the first study describing metabolic alterations associated with bladder cancer. In preliminary studies, we have profiled the metabolome of BCa from AA and EA patients and identified a distinct AA race-specific expression pattern in mitochondrial metabolites and lipids. In this proposal, we will i) characterize the mitochondrial associated metabolites in AA and EA BCa, ii) verify the D-2HG and associated enzymes (GLS, ADHFE1, and IDH1/2) in BCa patients and establish a therapeutically targeted deregulation pathway for glutamine metabolism in AA BCa iii) assess the levels of lyso PC and PC and the function of their metabolizing enzymes PLA1A and LRAT in AA BCa. The successful completion of the proposed studies will have a significant impact in the field of Bladder cancer health disparity and metabolism. Importantly, findings from our study have the potential to reveal racially exclusive metabolic markers and therapeutic targets for BCa. Taken together, the information gleaned from this proposal could rapidly revolutionize current diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches by revealing the biological underpinnings of bladder cancer health disparity."

"9301674","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and ataxia strip away the ability to act on our environment. Each disease causes unwanted movements, makes desired movements more difficult to perform, and also affects how we think and process our emotions. To be effective, research into movement disorders must cross disciplines, and enhance the translation of basic science discoveries to help humans move more effectively. This Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration Training (MDNR) program confronts this problem head on by bringing together an outstanding group of mentors with a rich infrastructure and resources to train predoctoral Trainees focused on movement disorders. This program combines a critical mass of well-trained scientists prepared to conduct research focused on the ABC'S of translational research: an etiology, biomarkers/end phenotypes, and causative and symptom based therapies. To do so, the program will encompass three areas with a central theme of movement disorders: a) molecular biology and animal models; b) translational neuroscience and physiology, and c) human motor and cognitive neuroscience. Specific approaches within these themes can range from genetics to molecular to neuroimaging to neurorestoration to behavioral, but the central focus is movement disorders. Trainees are selected from a pool of outstanding students with diverse backgrounds and are admitted by one of five graduate programs. A key feature is that Trainees experience laboratories that cross areas, and dissertation committee members must come from each of the three scientific areas. The MDNR program capitalizes on existing strengths and strategic investments at the University of Florida (UF) including well-established investigators in ataxia, Parkinson's disease, atypical parkinsonism, and dystonia, outstanding animal research facilities for basic science, world class animal and human imaging facilities, three privately endowed and foundation supported Centers of Excellence for Parkinson's disease, dystonia, and ataxia, and the UF Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration. This patient-centered clinical research facility maintains the largest, comprehensive clinical research database in the world. Upon entering the program, each trainee prepares an individualized career development plan that consists of a structured didactic program, specialized courses, seminars, and laboratory research. The mentor to mentor interaction that crosses levels of analysis sets up a unique learning environment that will prepare Trainees for a strong future as biomedical scientists that can make a difference in movement disorders. This training program in Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration provides an interdisciplinary training environment that is fundamental to the advancement of research in the etiology and treatment of movement disorders."
"9279192","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The spliceosome is a dynamic macromolecular machine that catalyzes the excision of non-coding introns from pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNA) to form mature messages (mRNA), a process called pre- mRNA splicing. The ~3 MDa complex, composed of RNAs and proteins, assembles in a series of regulated steps from four small nuclear ribonucleoprotein subunits (snRNPs; U1, U2, U5, U4/U6) and numerous non- snRNP splicing factors. While the spliceosome is a fundamental cellular machine, its complex and dynamic nature has made obtaining structural information challenging. There are no structures of multi-snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleic particle) complexes at resolutions better than 30. The molecular organization of RNA and proteins within the spliceosome at any stage of the splicing reaction is not known and the global conformational changes that occur during the transitions from a pre- to post-splicing complex have not been characterized. The goal of this proposal is to define the conformational changes required for the transition from a pre- to post- activated spliceosome. In Aim 1 we will compare the structures of pre-activated, activated, and post-activated spliceosomes to map the global conformational changes required for pre-mRNA splicing. In Aim 2 we will define the molecular organization and map proximal protein-protein interaction networks of pre-activated, activated, and post-activated spliceosomes. In Aim 3 we will use structure/function studies to determine the role of the SF3 complex during catalytic activation and how this function is altered in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients that have mutations in this sub-complex. This work will provide direct insight into the conformational changes required for activation and define spliceosome organization during the transitions from a pre- to post-activated complex. Completion of these aims will significantly advance our understanding of the structure and organization of the spliceosome under conditions of both health and disease."
"9278232","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adherens junctions are specialized sites of strong cell-cell adhesion built around cadherin adhesion molecules that organize an actin cytoskeleton to mechanically couple adjacent cells. Adherens junctions can therefore harness actomyosin generated forces and integrate them across entire sheets of interconnected cells to drive the morphogenetic movements that fashion tissues, organs, and entire early embryos. Despite its importance, little is known as to how actin is assembled at adherens junctions. A previous model proposed a linkage between cadherins and actin via the catenins, which would have provided a simple mechanism for recruiting actin to adherens junctions. This model was seriously challenged however when it was demonstrated that ?-catenin couldn't bind simultaneously to both ?-catenin and F-actin. Therefore, additional factors peripheral to the core cadherin-catenin complex are necessary to organize the actin cytoskeleton at adherens junctions. We developed an in vitro system to reconstitute actin assembly at adherens junctions to identify such factors and have already used this system to identify ?-actinin as an essential factor necessary for arp2/3 mediated junctional actin assembly. ?-Actinin and arp2/3 alone however cannot account for actin organization at adherens junctions. We reasoned that junctional proteins in close proximity to ?-actinin would also be involved in junctional actin assembly and used photoactivatable crosslinking to identify six factors in close proximity to ?-actinin in cadherin enriched plasma membrane sheets. We have confirmed that all six of these proteins localize to adherens junctions, all of them are thought to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, and mutations in two of them result in the same inherited kidney disease as mutant forms of ?-actinin known as FSGS suggesting a common cell biological function. We therefore hypothesize that these new factors are important for organizing actin at adherens junctions. In the first aim we determine which of ?-actinin's neighbors at the junction are necessary for recruiting it to adherens junctions and use biochemical methods to identify direct binding interactions between these factors and ?-actinin. In the second aim, we determine the roles of these newly identified factors in organizing actin at adherens junctions in cells and use biochemical methods to determine the effects of these factors on actin assembly in vitro. In the third aim we determine the role of ?-actinin and its junctional neighbors in cadherin mediated cell adhesion and adherens junction assembly and maturation. RELEVANCE TO HUMAN HEALTH: Cadherins and adherens junctions are implicated in numerous developmental defects and diseases, and a number of the factors that we have identified in our biochemical reconstitution are implicated in the inherited kidney disease, Focal Segmental Glomerulosclereosis. Defining the molecular mechanisms underlying actin assembly at adherens junctions will not only reveal core mechanisms necessary for human development but might also shed light on the pathology of certain diseases in adults."
"9303381","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a 5 year training program with the long-term goal of the candidate developing into an independent academic investigator with a research focus in hypertension in patients with chronic and end-stage kidney disease. The candidate will build on a background in clinical research developed during a comprehensive research fellowship spent studying ambulatory blood pressure and endothelial cell dysfunction in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The career development objectives are to obtain skills in designing and conducting prospective clinical research studies, learn statistical models to analyze ambulatory blood pressure in hemodialysis patients, gain experience in measuring and interpreting cardiovascular physiologic parameters including extracellular water and vascular resistance utilizing bioimpedance analysis, and participate in scholarly activities to facilitate te transition into an independent investigator. These will be applied immediately to investigating how extracellular volume and mediators of vascular resistance affect ambulatory blood pressure in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 1 will use a case control design to compare differences in extracellular water in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 2 will determine how extracellular volume, vasoconstrictor mediators of vascular resistance, and vascular resistance itself modify ambulatory blood pressure and the ambulatory blood pressure slope in these two groups. In aim 3, the candidate will gain experience in designing and conducting a randomized trial by comparing the effects of carvedilol vs. prazosin on ambulatory blood pressure, vascular resistance, and mediators of vascular resistance in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The candidate will develop these skills with the support a primary mentor, 3 co-mentors (including one translational research cardiologist and one biostatistician), and a research advisory committee with extensive experience in multiple research disciplines. The candidate and his advisors are located at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, a leading academic medical center with substantial physical and intellectual resources necessary for the career development of young investigators and the performance of cutting-edge research. The candidate will take advantage of numerous courses and research activities as a Clinical Research Scholar in the Department of Clinical Sciences that will promote the overall development of his career. Consistent with the candidate's long term career goals, the findings from this study can be broadened to studying hypertension in hemodialysis patients in general. Understanding the relationship between extracellular volume, vascular resistance, and ambulatory blood pressure will provide the opportunity to investigate how pharmacologic therapies affect each component and how this can improve cardiovascular outcomes in hemodialysis patients."
"9275510","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metal ions in biology allow for an expanded chemical repertoire with the local protein environment and metal coordination sphere acting synergistically imparting unusual capabilities. It is therefore not surprising that the reactions catalyzed by metalloenzymes are chemically challenging and essential for life. This proposal focuses on the complex metalloenzymes involved in anaerobic CO2 fixation. With greenhouse gases and climate change receiving renewed attention due to Super Storm Sandy and the recent droughts in the Midwest, we seek to understand the chemistry by which microbes convert the greenhouse gas CO2 into a metabolic carbon source. Our approach involves a variety of biophysical methods, which will allow us to visualize the hand-off of one-carbon units between enzymes in this pathway, as well as to probe the structural basis for enzymatic generation of low-potential electrons, which drive the chemistry of the pathway. By combining X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, isothermal titration calorimetry, and electron microscopy, we will explore the mechanism of action of the complex metalloenzymes in anaerobic CO2 fixation."

"9245923","Summary Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by aggressive growth, genomic heterogeneity, and rapid development of resistance to chemotherapy. SCLC patients frequently demonstrate initial clinical response to chemotherapy, including the clinical standard of care cisplatin-etoposide regimen, but eventually succumb to chemo-refractory disease. Recent sequencing studies have demonstrated that SCLC is one of the most highly mutated cancers, but these efforts have yet to identify targetable `driver' mutations in both chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory disease. Using an unbiased, high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library, we have identified that SCLC chemo-sensitive and chemo-refractory tumor cells are highly sensitive to inhibitors of the general transcription apparatus. In particular, we observed that SCLC tumor cells were highly sensitive to THZ1, a newly identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) that functions as a co-factor for RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We found that this transcriptional vulnerability is conferred, in part, by the exquisite sensitivity of key super-enhancer (SE) -driven SCLC oncogenes to transcriptional inhibition. We therefore hypothesize that the inhibition of other transcriptional CDKs found at SEs and their associated genes could provide additional therapeutic avenues. For this purpose we have developed structure-inspired approaches for the design of covalent inhibitors targeting various transcriptional CDKs. We further hypothesize that comparative analysis of enhancer landscapes and gene expression profiles from chemo-nave and chemo- refractory primary tumors will 1) identify transcriptional and epigenetic features specific to chemo-refractory disease, 2) enable grouping into clinically relevant subtypes, and 3) identify transcriptional and epigenetic dependencies specific to chemo-refractory disease that can be `drugged' using transcriptional CDK inhibitors. As changes to tumor oncogene expression and chemo-resistance have been shown to impact the immune compartment, we anticipate that chemo-refractory tumors will also exhibit changes in immune cell activation and infiltration. By extending our classification of clinical subtypes to the tumor microenvironment, we hope to find both tumor and immune cell gene expression programs that amenable to small molecule targeting with the goal of enhancing tumor immune surveillance capabilities. Lastly, as many transcription CDKs are known to transcriptionally regulate key pathways that modulate the response to DNA-damaging agents and immunotherapies we will investigate whether transcriptional CDK inhibitors may also be combined with other investigational SCLC therapies."
"9387986","PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer cells have been shown to be sensitive to apoptotic stimulus of tumor necrosis factor ?-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), whereas normal cells showed very little response. TRAIL was shown to be active as a single agent and exhibited synergistic activity with certain chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy, causing marked regression or complete remission of tumors. There is increasing evidence that membrane-bound TRAIL expressed on the surface of activated T-lymphocytes can enhance T-cell effector function and augment T-cell tumoricidal activity. The ability to genetically engineer primary T-cells creates new and highly promising prospects for tumor immunity and cancer treatment. The transduction of T-cells with genes encoding chimeric antigen receptors enables T-cell recognition of antigens that are either poorly immunogenic or ignored by the immune system. In addition, the ectopic expression of therapeutic ligands (e.g. TRAIL) can potently increase their tumoricidal activity. New strategies for tumor sensitization to TRAIL-based immunotherapies and modulation of TRAIL resistance are being developed and some can be translated to the clinic. Our central theme and hypothesis is that TRAIL overexpression by T-cells results in augmented apoptosis in tumor cells and that radiation and/or chemotherapy positively affect TRAIL-mediated tumor apoptosis during T-cell adoptive immunotherapy and can be used as a synergistic approach to enhance T-cell tumor targeting and effector function."
"9269241","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The allocation of cells into the three early embryonic germ layers, in vivo, follows a specific patio-temporal sequence. In response to growth factors, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can generate the three germ layers in culture, but differentiation is random and spatially disordered. We have demonstrated that when hESCs are grown on micro-patterned surfaces in colonies of defined size and shape, they differentiate with quantitatively reproducible spatial patterns of gene expression suggestive of those in mammalian embryos. This is the first demonstration of ordered germ layer patterning in vitro and opens the door to investigations of early development currently impossible to perform in intact mammalian embryos, particularly human embryos. Since the spatial pattern develops spontaneously in a well-mixed medium, this system affords a quantitative phenotype with which to analyze cell-cell signaling. The goal of this grant is to establish micro patterned cell cultureas a system for studying signaling dynamics and spatial patterning in hESCs. We propose to further validate our assay by differentiating mouse epiblast stem cells (the closest analogue to hESC) on our substrates and comparing with mouse embryos purchased from commercial sources. We will stimulate the TGF-, BMP, and Wnt pathways that pattern the early mammalian embryo and follow the transcriptional effectors for these pathways as well as the resulting pattern of germ layer markers in time. We will engineer cell lines with combinations of fluorescent reporters for signaling and fate and use these for time-lapse imaging. The results will be fit to a phenotypic computational model that will permit us to rationally design combinations of ligands with defined doses and timings that produce a defined outcome.    We will also manipulate the levels of secreted ligands (both activators and inhibitors) that are responsible for paracrine signaling in the embryo on our micro patterned colonies and further quantify cell-cell interactions. Physical assays for secreted ligands using microfluidics will be employed to quantify mechanisms of ligand transport."
"9275484","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and many other important pathogens. LPS, also referred to as endotoxin, is essential for survival in this large class of bacteria and serves as a first line of defense against hostile environments encountered during host infection. Given the essential role of LPS in the survival of Gram-negative bacteria - i.e., the bacterial cells die if any step o LPS transport does not occur - and the unique cell surface it creates, a detailed understanding of the proteins and mechanisms involved in LPS synthesis and transport will be the foundation on which to develop novel antibiotics against these promising new drug targets.  Many of the proteins involved in LPS transport have been identified through recent genetics studies, suggesting that a set of seven inner membrane (IM), periplasmic, and OM proteins (named LptA, LptB, LptC, LptD, LptE, LptF, and LptG) are directly involved in moving LPS from the IM to the OM. However, the mechanism of how this group of proteins transports LPS to the OM is yet unknown. One of the most striking questions about this process is how the hydrophobic domain of LPS crosses the periplasm. Therefore, the proposed studies will focus on how the periplasmic protein LptA receives LPS from the IM-associated protein LptC, how LptA protects the hydrophobic acyl chains of LPS as it crosses the periplasm, and how LptA delivers LPS to LptDE at the OM. The successful completion of the proposed studies will include the development of a novel functional assessment tool for LptA, the creation of a comprehensive library of in vivo growth assay results to identify LptA amino acids critical for its structure or function, the identification of the specific LptA sites and conformational changes involved in LPS binding, and the characterization of the interactions between LptA and its binding partners LptC, LptDE, and LPS. The results of the novel genetic screenings, the laser light scattering analyses, the innovative electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy studies, and the isothermal titration calorimetry measurements will provide detailed insights into the mechanism of LPS transport across the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. This unique knowledge will greatly enhance our growing understanding of LPS transport in bacteria and set the stage for future studies on the other Lpt proteins of unknown structure and function."

"9301598","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The detection of RNA provides for rapid identification of microorganisms, gene regulation analysis, molecular diagnostics, and detection of viral persistency. However, there is still a need for RNA detection methods that are rapid, quantitative, sensitive, and amenable for direct monitoring in a variety of matrices. The work presented within describes a method that fulfills these characteristics, and will be ideal for the detection of viral persistency, a scenario in which viruses hide within a specific cell type while remaining few in number.  Stem-loop probes (SLPs) are a class of nucleic acid biosensors that are single-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing a loop region (about 15-30 nt) complementary to a target sequence. This loop region is flanked by two short self-complementary regions (about 5-7 nt) known as the stem, which are typically conjugated to a fluorophore and a quencher. The SLP switches from closed to open conformations upon hybridization of a complementary target to the loop region. In the closed conformation, fluorescence is quenched by an energy transfer mechanism, whereas in the open conformation this quenching effect is removed, and fluorescence can be measured. The inherent signal transduction mechanism of these probes yields superior specificity and the ability to perform detection in real time without separation of unhybridized probes. However, currently available SLPs have limited sensitivity. Addressing these problems present in current SLPs and generating effective solutions will allow SLPs to serve as a platform of low-level RNA detection, as is necessary in the case of viral persistency. Toward that end, we hypothesize that the development of a bioluminescent SLP (BSLP) would enhance sensitivity of current SLP-based detection systems by retaining the rugged versatility and broad applicability of its fluorescent counterparts while exhibiting low background and high detection sensitivity.  Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, 1) Enhance analytical performance of BSLPs and develop facile BSLP synthesis methods, 2) Incorporate bioluminescent enzymes possessing high substrate turnover as well as thermostable, long-lived, highly active photo proteins into BSLP design, 3) Design, develop and optimize BSLPs for the detection of viral persistency using HIV persistency as a model system in cell and blood samples. The proposed work is innovative because it introduces a novel, new sensing strategy that seamlessly combines the high sensitivity of bioluminescent proteins and the specificity of SLPs. This provides a means for the rapid detection of low levels of viral RNA in any sample matrix such as would exist in the case of viral persistency, solving a problem current technologies aren't capable of addressing. This research is significant because it is expected to provide a highly sensitive tool for the detection of nucleic acids that will allow for the detection of viral persistency. This, in turn, wll have a significant impact on infectious disease diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring."
"9271204","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Today the majority of pregnant women in the United States are either overweight or obese at conception with their offspring having greater adiposity at birth, a 2-fold greater risk of later obesity, and neonatal insulin resistance. Breastfeeding ha many clear benefits that may include protection against obesity and its sequelae, and exclusive breast milk feeding is recommended as the ideal infant feeding strategy for the first six months. It was long thought that breast milk composition was fairly uniform among women, having been optimized through evolutionary time to provide adequate sole nutrition for the growing infant regardless of the environmental circumstances. However, recent evidence shows that breast milk is a highly complex fluid with significant inter-individual variation in hormonal and cytokine concentrations. Pervasive maternal obesity is an evolutionarily novel condition for the human species but little effort has yet been made to systematically examine how this novel condition is associated with breast milk adipose-tissue derived hormone and cytokine (adipocytokine) variation, or whether that variation relates to infant metabolic status. Our objective is to comprehensively assess the lactational programming hypothesis, that is, whether or not recently documented variation in breast-milk composition is related to both maternal adiposity and to infant metabolic status. The central hypothesis is that a graded, dose-response relationship between maternal adiposity and adipocytokine concentrations in breast milk exists and that milk adipocytokine concentrations are associated with altered body composition in their exclusively breast-fed offspring. Guided by compelling preliminary data, and with consideration of potential confounders, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) Identify windows of exposure during the perinatal period (pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, post-partum) when elevated maternal weight and weight gain are associated with milk adipocytokine concentrations; 2) Test novel relationships between breast-milk adipocytokine concentrations and infant body composition and insulin secretion; and 3) Further characterize the relationship of maternal adiposity to milk variation and infant outcomes, to augment Aims 1 and 2 using state-of-the-science maternal and infant body composition methods, comprehensive breast-milk sampling techniques, and metabolomic analysis. The proposed research is significant because it tackles an understudied, but potentially important pathway explaining the vicious cycle of maternal-child obesity transmission prevalent today. The results of the study will be used to design interventions to reduce maternal weight during pregnancy and lactation and to augment lactation education materials to focus on the needs of obese breast-feeding women. The ultimate goal is to support women and infants during this crucial period of developmental plasticity, for the prevention of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease."
"9271814","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diarrheal illness creates a large and persistent disease burden among children in low-income countries; mortality estimates attribute 10% of global deaths among children < 5 to diarrhea. Fecal-oral pathogens (believed to be the most important causes of diarrhea) are transmitted from feces to new hosts through a variety of complex, environmentally mediated pathways that interact with each other and are also influenced by human behavior. Sanitation interventions that prevent the spread of pathogens from feces into the environment (e.g. provision of latrines) could block these transmission pathways and reduce the burden of diarrheal disease. Despite the potential importance of sanitation in reducing diarrhea, all studies to date of sanitation interventions on child gastrointestinal infections in rural settings have used non-randomized designs. Additionally, few studies have included detailed monitoring of sanitation-related behaviors and microbiological assessment of the complex pathogen transmission pathways that lead from feces to child illness. Aims: The principal aims of this study are to assess the impact of improvements in sanitation infrastructure and household sanitation practices on fecal contamination along pathogen transmission pathways in rural Bangladesh, and to assess how these pathways mediate the impact of sanitation improvements on diarrhea and parasitic infections in children < 24 months old. We hypothesize that improved sanitation will reduce contamination of drinking water, household soil, and children's hands; we also posit that these pathways will mediate any reductions in diarrhea prevalence and parasitic infections caused by the intervention. Methods: We will test our hypotheses by nesting microbiological and behavioral measurements within WASH Benefits, a randomized controlled trial currently underway in rural Bangladesh funded by the Gates Foundation and led by our team. We will visit a total of 720 households from the trial's sanitation and control arms quarterly for 2 years, starting 12 months after intervention. At each visit, we will collect samples from tubewells, ponds, stored water, soil from the child play area, soil near tubewells and from children's hands for analysis of fecal indicator bacteria. During the last two sampling rounds, we will analyze samples for prominent fecal pathogens and perform source tracking to distinguish fecal contamination from humans versus animals. We will monitor sanitation practices through spot checks and passive infrared sensor measurements. These data will leverage the health outcomes measured in the existing trial protocol (diarrhea and helminth and protozoan infections in stool). We will compare fecal contamination between the study arms using intention to treat and complier average causal effect estimators. We will estimate the contribution of contamination to health outcomes through individual pathways by analysis of direct and indirect effects. Our team (UC Berkeley, Stanford, ICDDR,B) has extensive experience collaborating on studies of water, sanitation and hygiene in Bangladesh and other low-income countries on projects funded by the NIH, CDC, DFID, USEPA and the Gates Foundation."
"9304780","Project Summary  Great strides have been made in controlling pain during surgery, however postoperative pain remains poorly controlled and undermanaged, with upwards of 50% of patients reporting significant persistent postoperative pain. Although the mechanisms of postoperative pain are still incompletely understood, research has shed light on one potentially important immune cell. Mast cells play a crucial role in the body's innate immune response to pathogens and are capable of acting locally at the site of injury. These bone marrow derived immune cells can be found in close proximity to peripheral nerve endings where upon activation they can release a broad range of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators.  The role of mast cells in mediating postoperative pain is incompletely understood, although studies using the mast cell stabilizer cromoglycate demonstrate that this immune cell is pivotally involved in contributing to nociception in animal models of postoperative pain. Thus, there is a compelling need for fundamental research aimed at understanding the mechanisms of postoperative pain and in identifying potentially novel therapeutic approaches for treating it, as typically used analgesics offer patients either incomplete efficacy or are limited by substantial adverse effects.  Towards this objective, our lab has previously published data identifying a novel mast cell specific receptor, Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor B2 (MRGB2) and its human orthologue, MRGX2, in non-allergenic activation of mast cells. Our recent preliminary data have identified MRGB2 in mediating thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity post inflammation. Therefore, we propose to test the central hypothesis that postoperative tissue injury leads to activation of mast cells via MRGB2 and contributes to the development of mechanical and thermal allodynia. The following specific aims will test this innovative hypothesis: Specific Aim 1 Characterize the contribution of mast cells and their receptor MRGB2 to incision induced allodynia in a mouse model of postoperative pain Specific Aim 2 Identify the mechanisms by which mast cell receptor MRGB2 contributes to postoperative pain Specific Aim 3 Examine the interaction between mast cells and peripheral sensory neurons in a mouse model of postoperative pain using in vivo live imaging"
"8982247","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical care of heart failure (HF) has been stagnant for the past 20 years; innovative therapy is urgently needed. A novel therapeutic target, mitochondrial dysfunction, has been implicated in multiple diseases, including heart failure. However, there currently is no specific treatment for mitochondrial dysfunction in human heart failure or any other disease. Mitochondria-based therapy development has been hampered both by limited understanding of how mitochondrial impairment causes cardiac dysfunction, and by a lack of interventions shown to improve mitochondrial function. Recently, we demonstrated in a murine model, that impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation led to an increased myocardial NADH/NAD+ ratio and increased mitochondrial protein acetylation, without affecting mitochondrial ROS production or ATP synthesis. These changes rendered the heart susceptible to chronic stresses, which accelerated the development of heart failure. We observed a similar increase of NADH/NAD+ ratio and increase in protein acetylation in animal models of heart failure due to chronic pressure overload with no prior mitochondrial dysfunction. Supplying the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), to these mice normalized the NADH/NAD+ ratio, prevented increased mitochondrial protein acetylation and improved cardiac function. Though NMN is not orally bioavailable, we and others have shown that oral supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR), the precursor from which NMN is produced, also decreases (normalizes) tissue NADH/NAD+ ratio and improves mitochondrial function in mouse models. These animal model results suggest a conceptually innovative mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction to the development and progression of heart failure that is distinct from the existing hypotheses of oxidative stress and energy starvation. Thus, we hypothesize that oral supplementation with NR will improve the NADH/NAD+ ratio caused by mitochondrial dysfunction during chronic stresses, and improve functional capacity and ventricular function in systolic heart failure. We therefore propose a first-in-human, safety and tolerability trial of the nutritional supplement, nicotinamide riboside (NR) in 30 participants wit clinically-stable, systolic heart failure. NR is a relative of niacin, but a closer relative of nicotinamide which, unlike niacin, does not induce flushing or pruritis and has no effect on lipid levels. NR does not induce insulin resistance or dysglycemia in mouse models. Thus, NR would potentially be cheap, safe, well-tolerated and readily available. The application is in response to the program announcement of Nutrition and Diet in the Causation, Prevention, and Management of Heart Failure as NR has recently been approved for human use as a health supplement. As NR has not been used therapeutically in heart failure patients, we will utilize the R21 mechanism to support a pilot study with the following aims: 1) to determine the safety and tolerability of NR in patients with clinically-stable, systolic heart failure (LVEF <40%); 2) to determine whether, at the doses employed, NR has measureable effects on leukocyte NAD+ level and NADH/NAD+ ratio; and 3) to explore the potential range of effects of NR supplementation on heart failure surrogate endpoints."
"9292330","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal is for the Akron Children's Hospital to serve as a clinical center for the Convergence  Insufficiency Treatment Trial - Attention and Reading Trial (CITT-ART), a multicenter randomized, placebo  controlled, clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of treatment for symptomatic convergence  insufficiency (Cl) on measures of reading performance and attention in children.  In this trial, 324 children aged 9 to <14 years with symptomatic Cl will be randomly assigned to 16 weeks of: 1) office-based vergence/ accommodative therapy with home-reinforcement or 2) office-based placebo therapy. After 16 weeks of treatment, the primary outcome measures of reading comprehension (Wechsler Individual Achievement test [WIAT-III] reading comprehension subtest score) and attention (Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms & Normal Behavior Scale [SWAN]) will be assessed by examiners masked to treatment group. The Gates MacGinitie-4 test, which uses a format similar to curriculum-based evaluation done in classrooms, will provide a secondary measure of reading comprehension. Reading fluency, another test of attention, the 01 Symptom Survey, and clinical measures of 01 (i.e., the near point of convergence, and positive fusional vergence at near) are other secondary outcome measures; also included are assessments of key reading and cognitive components that impact reading comprehension including pseudo word decoding, word reading, and listening comprehension. Long-term effects on reading achievement and attention are assessed 1-year post treatment.  This application documents our site's ability to recruit at least 36 subjects and to retain them for 1 year after completion of treatment. Documentation is provided that our site has the appropriate personnel, equipment, and facilities to conduct the study in accordance with the OITT-ART Manual of Procedures (MOP). Complete details of the study rationale, design, and methods are contained in the Manual of Procedures (submitted with the Study Chair and Data Coordinating Center [DOO] applications). In addition to our center, there are 8 other optometric or ophthalmologic centers, the Study Chair at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry at Salus University, and the DOO at The Ohio State University Optometry Coordinating Center.  Symptomatic Cl is a common vision disorder in children that is commonly associated with symptoms while reading (e.g.; loss of place, loss of concentration, frequent re-reading, reading slowly, and trouble remembering what was read). However, the effect of Cl treatment on reading and attention is unknown. The results of the proposed study will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and-have important implications for educators, psychologists, and physicians who care for children with reading and attention problems. The findings will guide hypothesis development for future scientific investigations in children with vision disorders."
"9383935","Mitochondria are central to the physiology of all eukaryotic cells. The immense diversity of mitochondria and their functions among the various branches of eukaryotic organisms is likely to have evolved in response to the diverse environmental niches of these organisms, which dictate the physiological demands placed on their mitochondria. The mitochondrion of malaria parasites has characteristics that are highly divergent from their hosts'. In the 1980s, our laboratory discovered the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of malaria parasites. With its highly diminished gene content and organization, this genome presented the specter of divergent mitochondrial functions in Apicomplexan parasites that could be targets for novel antimalarial drugs. Previous studies from our laboratory have validated the parasite mitochondrion as a target for antimalarial drugs. The availability of genomic sequences and advances in gene transfer technology for malaria parasites has permitted us to explore various nuclearly encoded mitochondrial functions to assess their role in parasite physiology. Findings from this project have successfully addressed questions of long standing regarding the roles of major mitochondrial metabolic functions in P. falciparum: mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and heme biosynthesis. For the next funding period of this project, we wish to explore additional metabolic features of the parasite mitochondria that are essential for parasite survival and might be divergent from those in their mammalian counterparts. We have initiated experiments to derive a proteomic landscape of the parasite mitochondrion at different lifecycle stages through the use of a modified proximity biotinylation and allied approaches. In collaboration with the Sanger Institute we are identifying mitochondrially-targeted proteins, knockdown of which impacts blood stage growth of P. berghei. Genetic investigations combined with phenotypic studies involving these proteins will be carried out in P. falciparum. Several advances for genetic manipulation of P. falciparum, such as CRISPR-Cas9 editing and conditional knockdown of gene expression, have recently become available (and are currently used successfully in our laboratory), permitting relatively rapid gene knock-in/knockout as well as conditional knockdown mutant generation involving critical metabolic pathways. Genome scale disruption studies in P. beghei have also identified essential conserved un-annotated mitochondrially targeted proteins, functions of which will be investigated by conditional knockdown and phenotypic characterizations. Additional proteins to be investigated would be mitochondrial transport molecules, the mtETC components and the ATP synthase complex. Phenotypic characterization of these mutant parasites using various methods including metabolomics would bring our understanding of the unusual mitochondrial physiology of malaria parasite to an unprecedented level, which could inform future discoveries to control malaria.

"9451487","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several lines of evidence link the endogenous neuromodulator kynurenic acid (KYNA), a major metabolite of the essential amino acid tryptophan and antagonist of both a7 nicotinic and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, causally to the cognitive deficits seen in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ): 1) brain and cerebrospinal fluid KYNA levels are increased in SZ; 2) a7 nicotinic and NMDA receptors play critical roles in both neurodevelopment and cognition; 3) in animals, perinatal increases in brain KYNA cause an array of SZ-like abnormalities and vulnerabilities in adulthood; 4) experimental KYNA elevations cause cognitive dysfunctions reminiscent of SZ; 5) brain KYNA metabolism is stimulated by stress and immune stimulation during early development; and 6) first results indicate that inhibitors of KYNA biosynthesis (KAT II inhibitors) show efficacy in animal preparations that are believed to be informative for SZ pathophysiology. The proposed Center is based on three premises: 1) SZ is a complex psychiatric illness in which stress/immune challenges during pregnancy set the stage for the emergence of the disease in vulnerable offspring; 2) Stressful events during development precipitate the early presentation of cognitive impairments in susceptible individuals by disproportionally elevating brain KYNA levels; and 3) Pharmacological reduction of brain KYNA synthesis offers a promising new therapeutic target in SZ, especially for pro-cognitive interventions. Hypotheses derived from these insights and from supportive preliminary results in animals and humans will be tested in two pre-clinical and two clinical projects. All studies will be led by established and highly interactive laboratory-based and clinical faculty, and the host institution has the appropriate infrastructure to embark on this  overarching and highly synergistic translational project. Notably, the planned research strategy fits the Strategic Plan of the NIMH, which calls for a) discoveries of the causes of mental disorders, b) charting of disease trajectories to optimize treatment, and c) the development of new and better therapeutic interventions. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Deficits in cognitive functions are a core symptom of pathology in schizophrenia, a debilitating disorder affecting ~ 1 % of the world population. The proposed Center, organized in four highly complementary and synergistic projects in animals and humans, is designed to provide new insights into the role of the tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) in cognition, and to examine inhibition of KYNA formation as a novel strategy to overcome cognitive impairments."

The highly successful Bridges to the Baccalaureate Program between these two institutions will continue aiding to increase the diversity in these scientific fields and positively influencing the social mobility of the Hispanic community. The specific aims of this proposal are the following: SPECIFIC AIM #1: To increase interest among minority students (primarily Mexican-Americans) in biomedical/behavioral sciences as a career. During the recruitment period several strategies will be employed to inform and attract students, such as the use of a variety of educational tools and social media like Facebook (e.g., flyers, classroom visits and seminars at EPCC by UTEP mentors, Bridges Program website, etc.). Also, the student tutors and a symposium at EPCC will play important roles in the process. SPECIFIC AIM #2: To maintain a transfer rate of about 90% of Bridges participants to baccalaureate degree programs in the biomedical/behavioral sciences, while making the experience more efficient. Except for the 2013 cohort of Bridges summer research experience participants, we have maintained a transfer rate of from 92 to 100% over the past four years (those students in the 2013 cohort who did not transfer immediately after the summer experience plan to do so either this coming spring or next fall). We will continue to offer weekly colloquia, seminars, and workshops to develop participants' professional skills and understanding of career options in the biomedical/behavioral sciences as well as other strategies that have proven to be very effective in our program. SPECIFIC AIM #3: To significantly increase the percentage of transferred participants who complete a baccalaureate degree in biomedical/behavioral sciences. We propose to increase the percentage of Bridges participants who attain the baccalaureate degree in biomedical/behavioral sciences from our historical (20 year) average of 68.6 % to an average of 80% over the proposed grant period (5 years). The ultimate goal of our proposal is to increase the influx of underrepresented students (mainly Hispanics) into biomedical/behavioral science careers and encourage them toward a graduate (Ph.D.) research program."
"9410690","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Survival rates for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain low, despite the fact that knowledge of the molecular events that cause AML has evolved rapidly in the last decade. This is in part due to a distinct lack of understanding of the response to chemotherapy at the cellular and molecular levels. Previous work has been directed toward the long term goal of developing novel, rational combination-therapies to improve the outcomes of patients with AML. The objective of this specific project is to provide pre-clinical validation of one such therapeutic strategy, combining antimetabolite chemotherapeutics with inhibition of Wee1, a cell cycle checkpoint protein. The central hypothesis of this project is that Wee1 is a critical mediator of leukemia cell survival, acting inS phase to ensure accurate DNA replication, and that combining inhibition of Wee1 with antimetabolites will be more effective in eliminating leukemia cells than antimetabolites alone. This hypothesis emanates from our preliminary data from a genome-wide shRNA screen, in which we identified Wee1 as a critical mediator of AML cell death after cytarabine treatment. We have validated these findings in a broad panel of AML cell lines and found that the effect of inhibiting Wee1 in combination with cytarabine involves abrogation of the S phase checkpoint induced by cytarabine. Notably, preliminary data show that cells with Class I leukemogenic mutations are quite sensitive to Wee1 inhibition alone and suggest that Wee1 may contribute to leukemogenesis. The hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Determine whether Wee1 contributes to leukemogenesis, 2) Confirm the efficacy and tolerability of cytarabine and Wee1 inhibition in vivo and 3) Identify the mechanism of enhanced AML cell killing with cytarabine and Wee1 inhibition. To achieve Aim 1, we will examine the consequences of Class I and II mutation expression and Wee1 inhibition as they relate to oncogenic stresses in myeloid progenitor cells and perform immunohistochemistry for Wee1 expression in AML bone marrow biopsy specimens. To achieve Aim 2, mouse models of AML, including direct patient xenografts will be used to test the pharmacodynamics, tolerability and efficacy of combining cytarabine with Wee1 inhibition. To achieve Aim 3, pharmacologic and genetic inhibition will be used to test the functional significance of proteins upstream, downstream and in parallel with Wee1 in cell cycle checkpoint cascades to identify the key molecules involved; complementary cellular and molecular assays will be used to further define the mechanism of combinatorial cell killing. The project is innovative in 1) the study of Wee1 contributing to leukemogenesis, 2) the study of non-oncogene vulnerabilities of FLT3-ITD+ cells, 3) the development of a novel therapeutic target in AML, 4) translational modeling of leukemia with direct patient xenografts, and 5) high-throughput methodology to survey the role of DNA damage repair proteins in specific contexts. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance the understanding of a novel therapeutic target in AML that can be rapidly translated into clinical trials combining standard and targeted therapy."
"9344748","ABSTRACT Uganda has the fifth highest HIV burden globally and one of the highest fertility rates in Africa. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission Option B+ (PMTCT B+) is national policy in Uganda. To maximize the prevention and clinical benefits of PMTCT B+, the challenges of low HIV testing by male partners and high rates of post- partum discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), insufficient ART adherence, and incomplete viral suppression need to be addressed. Women may be more likely to continue ART long-term and have higher adherence post-partum if their partners are tested, there is mutual disclosure of HIV status, and their partner takes ART or PrEP, depending on the partner?s status. Innovative approaches are needed to allow men to test in alternative settings to busy antenatal clinics, preferably privately where they are comfortable and do not miss work. We will use innovative technologies ? HIV self-testing (HIVST) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) ? to increase male partners? engagement in HIV testing, prevention, and care services. We will train pregnant women in the use and interpretation of HIVST, provide them with two oral fluid-based HIVST kits to use with or give to their partners. We will offer men confirmatory testing, counseling, and if negative, PrEP and if positive, ART. We will provide counseling to minimize social harms of HIV self-testing. PrEP for HIV-negative male partners of HIV- positive pregnant women provides an effective intervention during an important ?season of risk? when they may have additional risk through other partners or when their partner may be viremic (during the first few months after ART initiation, post-partum ART discontinuation or due to viral resistance).. Integrated PrEP and ART delivery among East African HIV serodiscordant couples showed that PrEP as a ?bridge? until the HIV-positive partner was on ART for six months was very acceptable, achieved very high uptake and adherence to ART and PrEP, and nearly eliminated HIV transmission. We will use HIVST to identify HIV serodiscordant couples, and adapt the PrEP bridging strategy to Ugandan PMTCT B+ programs to increase ART continuation post-partum for clinical and prevention benefits. Aim 1: Determine whether an enhanced PMTCT program in Uganda that provides HIV self-testing for male partners and PrEP for HIV-negative men increases the proportion of men who test for HIV and initiate PrEP. Aim 2: Evaluate whether HIV testing and PrEP and ART use among male partners increases effective post-partum ART use among HIV-infected Ugandan women in PMTCT B+. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability of HIV self-testing and PrEP to pregnant women in PMTCT B+ and to their male partners, using qualitative and quantitative methods. In summary, this project will address key challenges in PMTCT B+ programs, by evaluating innovative strategies to increase male partner involvement in PMTCT B ? HIVST to overcome men?s reluctance to test and their tendency to test ?by proxy,? coupled with offering PrEP to HIV-negative men, ART to HIV-positive men, and encouraging post-partum ART continuation and adherence among HIV-positive women."

"9362662","SUMMARY: The majority of HNSCC patients die from local recurrences and/or metastasis that can occur early, or many years after primary tumor removal. This can be due to disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) remaining dormant in patients. DTCs can be detected in the bone marrow (BM), but rarely give rise to metastasis, suggesting a dormant state in this site. We discovered that dormancy of HNSCC DTCs precedes metastasis and that dormant DTCs are governed by unique chromatin states and microenvironmental cues that can be derived from the vascular niche. Through loss-of-function screens, we also identified chromatin remodelers that enforce tumor cell dormancy. Further, using information we derived from senescence models, we determined that dormant DTCs express chromatin regulators and secreted factors found in senescent cells. We hypothesize that specific microenvironmental cues and epigenetic regulators induce and maintain a strong, yet reversible, growth arrest program during the dormant state of DTCs. We found that the quiescence and differentiation signals, retinoic acid (atRA), TGF?2 and BMP7 can induce dormancy and metastasis suppression. Dormant cancer cells also display a global repressive chromatin state and upregulation of specific transcription factors (NR2F1) and histone variants (macroH2A, clipped H3.3), found upregulated during differentiation, senescence and metastasis suppression. In addition, CRISPR-Cas9 screens identified the chromatin remodeler ARID1A as an enforcer of dormancy. We propose that microenvironmental and epigenetic regulators converge to induce and maintain dormancy. We will test this hypothesis by A) investigating the role of histone variant macroH2A associated with quiescence and senescence programs in DTC dormancy induction, B) deciphering how ARID1A enforces dormancy and C) by identifying chromatin permissive states for dormancy induction by microenviromental signals. MPI SYNERGY: The Aguirre-Ghiso and Bernstein labs along with our collaborators have a productive history of publications and active collaborations. This team possesses specialized expertise in dormancy, metastasis, and chromatin biology that has delivered breakthroughs in the cancer dormancy and metastasis fields. The Condeelis team will provide the most advanced intravital imaging to dissect the epigenetic and microenvironmental regulation of DTC dormancy onset and survival at single cell resolution. Importantly, the Klein and Stoecklein labs will allow validation of our findings in human DTC samples. This provides an unsurpassed opportunity to dissect the microenvironmental and epigenetic regulation of single DTC dormancy."
"9293401","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Damage to the myelin sheath (demyelination) in multiple sclerosis (MS) retards the propagation of nerve impulses, with devastating neurological consequences. Remyelination restores myelin through the proliferation, migration and maturation of oligodendrocyte (OL) progenitor cells (OPCs). The failure of remyelination by OPCs in MS lesions is not understood, and the identification of inhibitory factors in lesions is critical to improve repair. Demyelination results in reactive gliosis, an astrocytic response that impedes OL development and regeneration. Strategies that target inhibitory factors of reactive gliosis could improve remyelination by OPCs. We have shown that: i) Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is expressed at high levels by reactive astrocytes in MS lesions; ii) in an animal model of demyelination, astrocyte-derived ET-1 delays OPC differentiation and remyelination, and iii) inhibition of ET-1 signaling accelerates myelin repair. ETA- and ETB-receptors (ET-Rs) are expressed by astrocytes and OPCs, but the specific contribution of each receptor and each cell type to the remyelination phenotype is unknown. Our preliminary data show that pharmacological inhibition of ETB-Rs or selective ETB-R deletion in astrocytes accelerates remyelination, suggesting a major functional role for this ET-R subtype. We will use two novel conditional knock-out mouse strains, hGFAP-Cre ;ETBflox/flox and PDGF a- R ERT2 Cre ;ETBflox/flox, in which the ETB-R is inducibly ablated in astrocytes or OPCs. We will test the ERT2 hypothesis that ET-1 acts predominantly through the ETB-R on astrocytes to inhibit remyelination. We will determine: i) the functional role of ET-Rs in remyelination and determine whether the ETB-R is the predominant functional receptor involved in this process; ii) the specific role of ETB-R signaling on astrocytes during remyelination; iii) the specific role of ETB-R signaling on OPCs during remyelination, and iv) whether the inhibitory effects of ET-1 on OPCs and remyelination are direct or mediated by astrocytes. Our studies will provide crucial insight into the mechanisms by which ET-1 limits remyelination, and will identify new potential therapeutic targets to promote OL regeneration and myelin repair in demyelinating diseases."
"9464119","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in the understanding of alterations in brain and behavior in adult affective psychopathology, and the more recent conceptualization of these illnesses as neurodevelopmental in origin, there is a dearth of early developmental data to inform this trajectory. The current proposal aims to fill this gap using data from a unique 13 year prospective longitudinal study, which started in the preschool period and contains three waves of functional and structural scan data: the Preschool Depression Study [PDS]. The proposed extension of this PDS study will focus on three constructs/RDoC domains encompassing specific aspects of emotion reactivity and regulation thought to be central to the development of affective psychopathology: 1) Negative Emotion Reactivity (NER), 2) Reward Reactivity (RR), and 3) Cognitive Emotion Re-appraisal (CER). Data from this sample has already shown that children who were depressed as preschoolers show similar alterations in brain structure and function relevant to the three constructs of interest as established in depressed adults. Brain markers of later recurrence, over and above behavioral symptoms have also been identified. Importantly, both hormonal and psychosocial factors influenced behavior and brain structure/function in the data to date. Follow-up of this unique sample with two additional waves of imaging and comprehensive assessment of these constructs, including measures of hormones, as they pass through adolescence represents an unprecedented, but time limited, opportunity to investigate early developmental antecedents and predictors of adolescent affective psychopathology. The proposed study will directly target the constructs of interest using parent and child report, direct behavioral assessments, and reward and emotion reappraisal tasks during fMRI scanning, as well as structural imaging and resting state functional connectivity, using tools developed in the Human Connectome Project. Using latent growth curve modeling approaches, we will test the hypotheses that specific patterns of individual differences in trajectories of the neural circuitry supporting NER (e.g., insula, hippocampus, amygdala), CER (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate and RR (e.g., striatum, insula) measured during preschool, school age and/or early adolescence predict: (1a) measures of the same constructs in mid to late adolescence; and (1b) risk for reoccurrence or new onset of affective psychopathology in adolescence, over key phenomenological and psychosocial variables assessed from preschool to school age. We will also test the hypothesis that pubertal timing and hormonal factors interact with both adaptive and impaired forms of NER, RR and CER to contribute to the emergence of sex differences in affective psychopathology during the high-risk phase of adolescence. This work will allow an investigation of the role of early childhood emotion and brain function in the course and trajectory of adolescent affective psychopathology, identification of potential markers of risk and pathways for early intervention, as well as potential mechanisms driving sex differences that emerge at this period."
"9350740","Core 1 ? Project Summary The overarching goal of Core 1 is to provide the infrastructure and professional expertise needed to bank primary leukemia, colon, and pancreatic cancer specimens, establish patient-derived xenograft (PDX), organoid, and cell models, and make these patient-derived resources available to all Program investigators, thereby facilitating the translational and laboratory-based research performed by CSBC investigators in Projects 1 and 2. Both projects will require access to patient samples and cells derived from PDX and organoid models. The core supports 3 functions: (1) cryopreservation and distribution of primary cells from patients with leukemia, colon, and pancreatic cancer, (2) establishment, characterization, and distribution of xenograft, organoid, and cell culture models of these diseases, and (3) isolation of cell populations from primary tumor samples and tissue models for single cell analysis. The functions of the core include documentation and tracking of informed consent, isolation and cryopreservation of viable tissue, plasma or serum, and genomic DNA from patient samples and distribution of samples to CSBC investigators. A large number of primary leukemia, colon and pancreatic tumor samples are currently available in our existing repositories for use by Project Investigators. Additional samples will be acquired from patients routinely evaluated in our gastrointestinal oncologic and hematologic malignancies clinics. In addition to distributing primary cells to program investigators, Core 1 will also maintain and distribute a bank of well characterized PDXs selected for passage in immunocompromised mice. Methods for engrafting leukemia cells and primary epithelial tumor tissues in immunodeficient mice are now well established, and we and others have successfully used PDX models for drug testing. Organoid culture approaches will be used to complement the PDX effort, and will provide an additional way of propagating and segregating patient-derived epithelial tumor cells and stromal cells. Core 1 will maintain a bank of PDX models and organoids and distribute to program investigators as needed. Core 1 will be jointly directed by Drs. William Hahn and Dr. David Weinstock. Dr. Hahn is a medical oncologist who directs the DFCI Center for Cancer Genome Discovery (CCGD). He also works closely with the Division of Gastrointestinal Oncology at DFCI and has helped establish an organoid and PDX repository derived from primary and metastatic pancreatic and colon cancer samples. Working with the CCGD, Dr. Hahn's laboratory has created a pipeline for the genomic characterization of consented patient derived samples. Dr. Weinstock is a medical oncologist and directs the DFCI Hematologic Malignancy PDX repository, which already contains >200 transplantable leukemia PDX models that have been cryopreserved and undergone genome-wide transcriptome analysis, targeted DNA sequencing, immunophenotyping, and additional molecular characterization. Thus, Core 1 has extensive experience in the processing, cryopreservation, flow cytometric analysis, purification, propagation, banking, and genomic characterization of primary specimens and tumor models, as well as their use in preclinical drug evaluation."
"9310927","ROMK (Kir 1.1, product of the KCNJ1 gene) channels in the kidney are exquisitely regulated to adjust renal potassium excretion and maintain potassium balance. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis plays a critical role, limiting urinary potassium loss in potassium deficiency. In renal disease, aberrant ROMK endocytosis may contribute to potassium retention and life-threatening hyperkalemia. Available evidence indicates ROMK endocytosis is stimulated by WNKs, kinases that are mutated in Familial Hyperkalemic and Hypertension (FHHt). This application builds on our recent discoveries that: 1) Low potassium directly stimulates ROMK endocytosis in the distal nephron, 2) WNK stimulates ROMK endocytosis by phosphorylating the clathrin-adaptor, ARH, 3) NEDD4 Family of Interacting Proteins, NDFIP1 and 2, interact with ROMK to control post-endocytic processing of the channel. To carry these breakthrough observations toward a completely new understanding of how potassium balance is achieved, we outline plans to: 1) Define the mechanism by which potassium directly regulates ROMK endocytosis; 2) Explore the involvement of this pathway in a mouse model of FHHt, 3) Elucidate the molecular mechanism by which NDFIP1 and NDFIP2 control post-endocytic routing of ROMK to the lysosome. The studies should provide novel insights into the molecular basis of renal K handling and K homeostasis in health and disease while illuminating fundamental mechanisms of membrane protein targeting in the kidney."
"9272003","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is among the leading cause of morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients, and  novel treatment options are urgently needed. The main goal of this proposal is to identify the functional  contributions of adenosine transporters to renal protection from AKI. Moreover, we will utilize our findings in  AKI to better understand the hypoxic adenosine response in acute or chronic states of lung injury and sickle  cell disease (SCD). As such, our findings will address functional differences of extracellular adenosine during  disease progression from acute injury into chronic disease states. Adenosine signaling plays an important  role in tissue adaptation during hypoxia. Adenosine's effects are terminated via uptake from the extracellular  towards the intracellular compartment through equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs). Studies from our  laboratory show that inhibition of ENTs enhances adenosine signaling during hypoxia and promotes  protection from AKI. Studies in mice with genetic deletion of Enti or Ent2 identified a selective phenotype in  Entl'^' mice, including higher adenosine levels, preserved kidney function, and attenuated inflammation.  Subsequent studies of ENT inhibitor treatment in mice with deletion of individual adenosine receptors  suggested the AD0RA2B adenosine receptor mediates kidney protection from AKI. Therefore, we  hypothesize that inhibition or deletion of ENTI promotes kidney protection from ischemia by increasing  extracellular adenosine and signaling events through the AD0RA2B. Four specific aims are proposed: Aim  1: Define the cell-specific contributions of ENTs during AKI, Aim 2: Study the transcriptional control of ENTs  during ischemic AKI, Aim 3: Study the cell-specific functions of adenosine receptors in ENT-dependent  kidney protection during ischemic AKI, and Aim 4: Study the role of the hypoxic adenosine response in AKI-  driven lung injury. Together, these studies will provide novel insight into how the hypoxic adenosine  response varies among different organ systems, which will help guide the use of adenosine-based  therapeutics for kidney, lung and SCD associated disorders."
"9260027","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposal is to identify the asthma gene that is responsible for the genetic associations on chromosome 17q12 with asthma. A common haplotype on chromosome 17q12 is the strongest, most consistently reproducible asthma-susceptibility locus to emerge from genome-wide association studies. The 17q12 asthma-risk haplotype confers regional chromatin remodeling of three neighboring genes: ORMDL3, GSDMB, and ZPBP2. However, from the available genetic data alone, it is impossible to conclude with any certainty which of these three is responsible for the genetic association. From our preliminary data, we observe that both ORDML3 and GSDMB are constitutively expressed in bronchial epithelium, and that their overexpression results in discrete molecular and cellular consequences of importance in asthma. In contrast, we find that ZPBP2 is not expressed in either bronchial epithelium or other asthma-relevant cell types. We thus hypothesize that ORMDL3 or GSDMB, but not ZPBP2, confers asthma risk. To test this hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will study inducible transgenic mice generated in our lab that conditionally over express ORMDL3 or GSDMB in bronchial epithelium. We will assess the effects of each gene's over expression in an established murine model of allergic asthma, examining the physiological, histological, and metabolic consequences. In Specific Aim 2, we will experimentally assess (via in vitro knockdown and over expression studies) the independent cellular consequences of ORMDL3 and GSDMB expression in human bronchial epithelial cells derived from individuals homozygous for the risk and protective 17q12 haplotypes. In Specific Aim 3, we will study the relationship of 17q12 haplotype with sphingolipid metabolism in several ways (i) we will measure sphingolipid levels in the airways & lung homogenates from our murine studies in Aim 1 to determine the in vivo effects of ORMDL3 expression; (ii) we will examine by genetic association whether the functional 17q12 regulatory variant contributes to variations in plasma sphingolipid levels in 200 asthmatics; and (iii) we will correlate these plasma sphingolipid levels with bronchodilator response to albuterol and airways hyperreactivity to methacholine. The knowledge gained through these proposed efforts will advance our understanding of this most important asthma-susceptibility locus, and will provide the requisite foundations for the development of novel asthma therapies."
"9281731","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Collaborative Design in the Clinical Domain Program is designed to provide senior biomedical engineering students with experience in a necessary, but often forgotten, dimension of biomedical engineering design - determining whether or not the device or system they are designing will really be used in the clinical setting and whether it will truly improve patient care. Building from the first five semesters of an integrated design program, this program comprises the final three semesters and one summer of the students' curriculum. All students in the undergraduate BME program will participate, with a maximum cohort size of 40. During the winter semester of the junior year, students will review the design processes and tools that they have previously been introduced to. In addition, they will be educated in techniques to support observational exercises in clinical settings and facilitating discussions with clinical practitioners. During the summer between the junior and senior year, students will participate in a summer-long externship program in which they will spend 4 hours per week working with medical and health care mentors. This may include doctors, nurses, physical or occupational therapists, and others. The externships will be selected based on areas of health care that are most directly applicable to the student's assigned capstone project for their senior year. Externs will be expected to observe their mentors in the clinical environment and assess how biomedical engineering may be able to support or improve patient care. The students will also lead discussions to help the clinicians identify what areas may be supported by the design of biomedical engineering devices or systems. Finally, students will return to campus to participate in a 2-semester capstone design project in which they will design, prototype, and test a device or system to address a problem presented to them by a client. During the capstone experience, students will refer to their new understanding of the clinical environment and will also interact with new clinicians or users of medical devices to insure that their design most appropriately addresses the identified needs. The outcome of this program will be biomedical engineers who have both an understanding of how things actually happen in the clinical environment and a comfort with interacting with health care providers in that setting. Such engineers will be much better prepared to work in the multidisciplinary teams that are needed to develop systems and devices that will improve patient care and reduce societal costs."
"9273687","Summary Developing fundamental tools and insight into biomaterial designs for predictive functional outcomes remains critical for the field. In our current U01 grant we have made significant progress in many areas related to this need, starting from the overarching goal of integrating experimental-modeling-processing approaches into a synergistic approach for protein biomaterial design, as viewed from a hierarchical perspective and with a focus on mechanical outcomes. This approach has resulted in specific insights into the role of molecular weight, domain sizes and distributions, hydrophobic/hydrophilic partitioning and charged termini, on protein polymer assembly and the resulting properties, all informed via this integrated modeling-experimental feedback loop. These insights provide the foundation upon which we plan to build in this renewal application. The key features of our proposed approach remain to integrate modeling and experimentation at multiple scales to reach enhanced, predictive material functions out of simple protein building blocks though the exploitation of the accessibility and control afforded by genetically-encoded protein polymer designs. Our hypothesis in this renewal proposal is that predictions of biomaterial performance can be attained by the combined use of suitable experimental models to cover polymer features (chemistry, molecular weight, sequence control), processing (to modulate hierarchical structures) and modeling at different length scales of materials structural hierarchy (from nano- to macroscopic scales). Our goal is to further develop predictive assessments of biomaterials to save time, animals and costs, while accelerating translation of such biomaterials for repair and regenerative systems. In the renewal we will specifically focus on the use of modeling tools to further design and optimize protein-based materials to achieve specific functional outcomes (Aim 1), develop dynamic, shape-changing, protein materials (Aim 2), and address biomaterial interfaces with respect to mineralization of protein biomaterials (Aim 3). In total, these three aims build off of our progress in the current grant, but move the tools, experimental approaches and predictive capabilities to a new set of biomaterial challenges. Importantly, we also have established a strong, interdisciplinary team under the current grant to continue to foster this planned new insight, outcomes and contributions to the broader needs in the field of biomaterials.

"9355216","Childhood maltreatment is a major public health problem that is linked to high rates of mood and anxiety disorders, and a growing literature documents risk for conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and diabetes. These conditions are often chronic and severe, and they exact tremendous costs in terms of suffering, disability, treatment, and loss of productivity. Existing social services programs for maltreated children suffer from a lack of available data regarding which children are at risk for which psychiatric outcomes and from a lack of focus on risk for other adverse health conditions. In order to develop more targeted and specific interventions and treatments, we need to better understand the trajectory and mechanisms of risk and protective factors. There is evidence that the pathophysiological effects of adversity begin early in life, and that clinical or sub-clinical effects of major adversity can be seen in childhood. Maltreated children, particularly those living in poverty, are at especially high risk for early-onset disorders, but childhood maltreatment is usually clandestine and therefore very difficult to study. This study involves a 5-year follow up assessment of a sample of impoverished maltreated preschool-aged children and demographically matched non-maltreated children. Existing data include details of maltreatment experiences, socioeconomic factors and neighborhood characteristics, and additional adversities such as parental loss, homelessness, and traumas. Data on protective factors include home and neighborhood resources, parenting, and social services. In our initial work, adverse experiences were linked to depressive symptoms and blunted cortisol levels, and epigenetic changes to glucocorticoid signaling genes were significant mediators of these relationships. We also found that levels of salivary inflammatory cytokine IL-1? increased as a function of stress exposure. In our work with healthy un-medicated adults, we have shown that attenuated plasma cortisol concentrations are linked to several indices of the metabolic syndrome, and that childhood stress and psychiatric conditions are associated with telomere shortening and a measure of mitochondrial DNA proliferation, indicators of cellular stress and aging. In the proposed 5-year follow-up, we will test a model of risk and resilience for medical and psychiatric outcomes obtained from medical records, from interviews and questionnaires completed by children and caregivers, and tests of cognitive/affective, metabolic, endovascular, and pulmonary function. Behavioral, social, and biological mechanisms of risk and resilience will be examined. Statistical models will be aimed at identifying profiles of risk and protective factors and biological mechanisms that are most likely to be useful targets for intervention."
"9332469","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is one of the most devastating diseases known to humankind and is one of the top 10 causes globally of profound functional disability. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia account for much of the poor functional outcome in schizophrenia and are an unmet treatment need in a large proportion of patients. We propose to use an experimental therapeutics approach to test a novel psychosocial intervention that combines in-person and smartphone-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for experiential negative symptoms in schizophrenia called, Mobile-assisted CBT for Negative symptoms (mCBTn). mCBTn is a novel extraction and integration of the CBT components that target defeatist attitudes from our cognitive behavioral social skills training (CBSST) group therapy and mobile smartphone interventions from our prior clinical trials research. The primary aim of the project is to test whether mCBTn can reduce severity of a novel treatment target: defeatist performance attitudes. In a promising new model, Beck and colleagues proposed that defeatist attitudes (e.g., Why bother, I always fail, It's not worth the effort) contribute to experientil negative symptoms like amotivation and asociality, and ultimately poor functioning in schizophrenia, because defeatist attitudes lead to avoidance of effortful goal-directed activities. Our approach centers on the hypothesis that defeatist attitudes contribute to experiential negative symptoms, including diminished motivation and effort, which ultimately leads to poor functioning in schizophrenia. In addition, the field currently relies on symptom rating scales and subjective patient reports to measure motivation and effort; more objective measures are needed. The proposed project will determine whether pupillary responses can provide an objective psychophysiological biomarker of effort that is sensitive to change in a clinical trial fr negative symptoms. Greater pupil dilation indicates greater task effort allocation. We propose two sequential clinical trials of mCBTn in consumers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders with persistent moderate-to-severe experiential negative symptoms. In the R61 phase, we propose an open trial to determine whether mCBTn changes the defeatist attitude target and will identify the optimal dose to engage the target. In the R33 phase, we propose an RCT comparing mCBTn with a supportive contact control and will determine whether mCBTn produces greater reduction in defeatist attitudes that mediates improvement in experiential negative symptoms. Pupillary responses will be recorded as a secondary outcome in both trials to determine its potential as an end point in clinical trials of motivation and effort."
"9279140","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project continues our long term goal of investigating the molecular mechanisms of membrane-acting antibiotics and understanding how they work in bacteria. These antibiotics utilize mechanisms different from conventional antibiotics and have already contributed to the campaign against the growing public health problem of antibiotic-resistant infections. Our specific aim 1 is to study the molecular mechanism of daptomycin.  Daptomycin is the first FDA approved member of a new structural class of antibiotics that target the cytoplasmic membranes of Gram-positive pathogens. Unlike the host-defense antimicrobial peptides, daptomycin does not form transmembrane pores. Thus, despite its clinical use, the mechanism of daptomycin is still unknown. Using a method of aspirating membrane vesicles, we found daptomycin capable of extracting lipid molecules from membranes. We hypothesize that this is a so-far unrecognized bactericidal mechanism. We propose to investigate the lipid extracting effect of daptomycin by further developing the membrane aspirating methods. We will also use X-ray methods made available by new synchrotron radiation facilities to investigate the structures of daptomycin bound to a membrane. Our specific aim 2 proposes to close the gap between two different methods of studying membrane-acting antibiotics, i.e., the biophysical methods that use lipid bilayers in place of cell membranes and the direct studies with bacteria. Direct studies with bacteria are complicated by the outer cell wall and the periplasmic peptidoglycan. Our proposed method is to use bacterial spheroplasts that have been stripped off the cell wall and peptidoglycan. We will apply physical methods to the cytoplasmic membranes of spheroplasts to measure the elastic properties of bacterial membranes for the first time. We will study the direct interactions of membrane-acting antibiotics on spheroplast membranes and compare with the results on lipid bilayers. These results will connect the molecular mechanisms deduced from the lipid-bilayer studies to the actions on bacterial membranes. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 06/09) Page Continuation Format Page"
"9276813","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Human erythrocytes (commonly called red blood cells or RBCs) are generated from transiently proliferating erythroblasts in marrow of mammalian adults. The inability to vastly expand erythroblasts or their precursors hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) isolated from human adult peripheral blood (PB) or cord blood (CB) hinders our ability to generate ex vivo trillions of RBCs necessary for transfusion and other cell therapeutic applications. Recently, human erythroblasts and other somatic cell types were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that have unlimited expansion and differentiation potential. We recently developed a facile method to generate high-quality human iPS cell lines from CB or adult PB mononuclear cells (MNCs). We have used this method to generate human iPS cells from >200 adult healthy donors and patients including those with sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, PNH and severe aplastic anemia who need frequent and chronic blood transfusion. Moreover, we developed a feeder-free and xeno-free system to differentiate human iPS cells into definitive HSPCs and then into erythroblasts. Upon induction of terminal differentiation, these erythroblasts proliferate additional 3-4 cell divisions and form reticulocytes that express the HBB protein and exclude nuclei. Therefore, trillions of erythrocytes can be generated from a single iPS cell line that itself is expandable by cell culture For example, autologous erythrocytes could be generated from an iPS cell line derived from an alloimmunized, transfusion-dependent patient, or from donors with favorable or rare blood group antigen types. In addition, iPS cells can be genetically modified by precise genome editing technology in contrast to human HSPCs or erythroblasts that are unable to expand extensively. In this project, we aim to produce physiologic numbers of human erythrocytes ex vivo with enhanced functionality. Specifically, we propose to use selected human iPS cell lines including those with precise genetic modification for efficient and economical production of erythrocytes derived ex vivo from expandable human stem cells. The scalable ex vivo production of human erythrocytes that live longer and possess enhanced properties will provide unprecedented opportunities for transfusion medicine and other forms of cell therapies."
"9069968","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The traditional view that the adult heart has no capacity for regeneration or cardiomyogenesis has been called into question, and multiple lines of evidence now support some albeit limited potential for cardiac regeneration. However, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the physiological processes and pathways that regulate this regenerative capacity. This gap represents an important problem because it limits our ability to exploit the heart's regenerative capacity to restore cardiac function in disease. Th long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms regulating cardiac regeneration and to learn how to control it. The objective of the current application is to understand the mechanisms and contribution of exercise-induced cardiomyogenesis. Preliminary data produced in the applicants' laboratories suggest that exercise induces a potentially regenerative response in the heart. These studies also identify a new transcriptional pathway, including the co-activator, CITED4, as a key mediator of the cardiac exercise response. This proposal is based on three central hypotheses: 1) that exercise enhances the endogenous regenerative capacity of the heart; 2) that CITED4 is necessary for exercise-induced cardiomyogenesis; and 3) that CITED4-dependent cardiomyogenesis contributes to the benefits of exercise at baseline and in disease. The rationale for the proposal is that understanding the physiological mechanisms regulating the heart's endogenous regenerative capacity will advance efforts to therapeutically harness this capacity for clinically important conditions associated with loss of cardiomyocytes. The central hypotheses will be tested in three integrated Specific Aims. In Aim 1, a recently developed technology that combines genetic fate mapping with mass spectrometry-based imaging (Multi-isotope Imaging Mass Spectrometry or MIMS) will be used to unambiguously identify the number, source, and fate of new cardiomyocytes formed in two models of exercise. In Aim 2, the consequences of lineage-specific CITED4 inactivation in cardiomyocytes and c-kit-expressing cardiac progenitor cells will be determined at baseline and in exercise. In Aim 3, the ability of exercise-induced cardiomyogenesis to mitigate remodeling after myocardial infarction and whether CITED4 is required will be examined. In vivo studies will be supported by in vitro investigation of isolated cell populations including adult cardiomyocytes and c-kit-expressing cardiac progenitor cells to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The approach combines innovative hypotheses, technologies, and unique animal models with the complementary expertise of an outstanding team of collaborating investigators. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance our understanding of cardiac regeneration and the benefits of exercise as well as their potential to mitigate disease. These studies will provide new insights into the physiological mechanisms controlling cardiac growth and regeneration as well as informing therapeutic approaches to diseases associated with cardiomyocyte loss such as heart failure and ischemic heart disease."
"9270628","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial meningitis continues to be an important cause of mortality and morbidity, such as developmental delay, hearing loss and cognitive impairment. The Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program identified bacterial meningitis as the leading postnatal cause of developmental disabilities. A major contributing factor to such mortality and morbidity is our incomplete knowledge on the pathogenesis of this disease. E. coli is the most common Gram-negative bacillary organism causing meningitis. Several lines of evidence from human cases and experimental animal models of E. coli meningitis indicate that E. coli penetration into the brain follows a high level f bacteremia and cerebral capillaries are the portal of E. coli entry into the brain. Since E. coli entry into the brain occurred in the cerebral microvessels, we developed the blood-brain barrier model with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) to study E. coli penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Our HBMEC monolayer, upon cultivation on collagen-coated Transwells, exhibits spatial organization of tight and adherens junction proteins as well as a polarized monolayer, a unique property of the blood-brain barrier endothelial cells. We have shown for the first time that meningitis-causing E. coli strains exhibit the ability to invade the HBMEC monolayer and that the ability of HBMEC invasion is correlated with E. coli penetration into the brain in vivo. The underlying mechanisms involved in E. coli penetration of the blood-brain barrier, however, remain incompletely understood. These findings indicate that new approaches are needed to investigate E. coli penetration of the blood-brain barrier. We have used E. coli invasion of HBMEC monolayer as a biologically relevant new approach for discovery of targets affecting E. coli penetration of the blood-brain barrier. This application is to take advantage of the new targets identified from our chemical screen for investigating how they contribute to E. coli penetration of the blood-brain barrier in vitro and in vivo. Characterization of such targets will demonstrate a novel strategy exploited by meningitis-causing E. coli strains for penetration of the blood-brain barrier, the essential step in the development of E. coli meningitis."
"9293399","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In multiple sclerosis (MS), demyelination of axons produces conduction block and symptoms including paralysis and blindness, while myelin repair (remyelination) brings functional recovery. A key goal in MS research is to enhance remyelination, which occurs spontaneously but is inefficient, especially in the later stages of the disease. Oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLP) are the major reservoir of remyelinating cells. Their differentiation occurs via an intrinsic transcriptional program, which is promoted by extrinsic pathways, including Stat3, Smad3, Akt-PI3kinase, Erk1/2 and Tralpha1/RXR signaling. Elucidating how these pathways promote differentiation may identify new strategies to enhance remyelination.  Recently, we identified the Kr?ppel-like transcriptional activator Klf6 as an essential coordinator of CNS myelination. Importantly, our data also indicate that Klf6 signaling links extrinsic pathways to the intrinsic differentiation program. Notably, key extrinsic pro-myelinating pathways (Stat3 and Smad3 signaling) strongly induce Klf6 in differentiating cells, and Klf6 over-expression accelerates differentiation. Conversely, Klf6 deletion in vitro or in vivo blocks vital steps in differentiation, and leads to complete failure of myelination. This pathology partly mimics deficits resulting from Stat3 or Smad3 inactivation. The effects of Klf6 are restricted to the differentiation program - inactivation in proliferating or mature cells produces o pathology. Our data further suggest important roles in adults, in normal myelin turnover and, critically, in remyelination. Klf6 is strongly induced in remyelinating lesions, paralleling activaion of extrinsic pro-myelinating pathways.  To understand Klf6 mechanism of action, we have now used genome-wide analysis of chromatin occupancy, and transcriptional profiling. This work has identified a program of both novel and anticipated Klf6- regulated genes. Importantly, their roles propose Klf6 contributions to sequential steps in differentiation. Moreover, our data further indicate that Klf6 binding also recruits epigenetic coactivators to target loci, and that these enhance transactivation of its transcriptional targets. Together, our findings suggest that Klf6 may form complexes with transcriptional and epigenetic coactivators, to promote differentiation and myelin formation.  In this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that Klf6 linkage of extrinsic regulators with the intrinsic differentiation program is essential for CNS remyelination. We propose three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the extent to which extrinsic pro-myelinating factors promote differentiation via Klf6 signaling. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanism of action by which Klf6 controls differentiation. In Aim 3, we will then test the role of Klf6 signaling in adult white matter, in normal myelin turnover and, critically, in remyelination.  This work will define a new mechanism required for myelin formation, and which may be vital for repair. Elucidating how extrinsic pathways promote maturation may identify new strategies to enhance remyelination."
