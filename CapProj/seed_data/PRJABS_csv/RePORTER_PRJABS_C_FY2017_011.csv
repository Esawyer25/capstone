"9185327","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally, with over three million affected individuals in this country and seventy millio worldwide. This eye disease is widely recognized as a major health and socio-economic burden as an estimated 45% of patients progress to demonstrable loss of vision and approximately 15% eventually lose sight in one eye. As a blinding illness that generates more than seven million physician visits per year in this country, an improved paradigm for disease management is urgently needed. The singular unmet need for improved clinical management of glaucoma patients is accurate and detailed information on the daily intraocular pressure fluctuations and trends for each affected individual. Such comprehensive, long-term IOP data is currently not available as IOP measurements are typically only obtained from each patient 2-3 times a year during clinic visits. There is significant interest in high quality, personalized IOP data sets andit is widely believed that such comprehensive data will help improve clinical decision-making and the optimization of medical and surgical management for glaucoma. In this application, we test the hypothesis that convenient, on-demand IOP measurements can be achieved simply using light as a sensing medium in combination with a nanophotonics sensor micro-implant. The detection principle is based on changes in the optical resonance signature of the 600 µm implant device containing a Fabry-Perot microcavity, whose signal-to-noise ratio performance is enhanced by engineered nanodot patterns embedded on a deformable membrane. The near-infrared resonance signature of the sensor shifts predictably in response to changes in the ambient pressure or IOP. The research teams from Caltech and UCSF have worked closely together for the past three years and have obtained proof of concept for the fundamental sensing principle and IOP sensing using light in rabbits in vivo. By leveraging expertise in nanophotonics from Caltech and ophthalmic device development from UCSF, the research team proposes in the present application to further develop and refine the IOP sensor to meet key performance required of a clinically useful device. The successful implementation of this light-based IOP sensing technology will significantly enhance both the patient's access to convenient, on demand self-monitoring and the physician's ability to fully utilize personalized IOP profiles to more effectively tailor treatment for individuals afflicted with this debilitating ye disease."
"9186470","The development of alcohol addiction is characterized by repeated binge/  intoxication episodes. Prominent theories of addiction suggest that drugs gain control over the individual, in  part, by usurping glutamate-linked mechanisms of neuroplasticity within brain reward circuits. The preclinical  studies in this application are focused on identifying alcohol-induced pathologies in brain reward circuits that  underlie addiction. Preliminary results show that binge-like alcohol self-administration activates primary  glutamatergic mechanisms of neuroplasticity (i.e., AMPA GluRI; CaMKIIa) in amygdala and accumbens  nuclei that, in turn, are required for alcohol reinforcement. These novel findings suggest the main hypothesis  of this application that the binge/intoxication stage of alcohol addiction is associated with adaptations in  glutamatergic cell signaling in amygdala-accumbens circuits that regulate alcohol reinforcement. Aim 1 will  investigate the effects of binge-like alcohol self-administration on adaptive changes in AMPA GluRI and  CaMKIIa protein expression in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens and will evaluate functional effects of  alcohol self-administration on CaMKIIo-positive glutamatergic projections that are intrinsic (BLA to CeA) and  extrinsic (BLA to AcbSh) to the amygdala using optogenetic and electrophysiological strategies. Aim 2 will  determine the functional role of AMPAR/CaMKII in the CeA and AcbSh, using pharmacological techniques  and identify the functional involvement of CaMKIla-positive glutamatergic projections that are  intrinsic/extrinsic to the amygdala in relation to binge-like alcohol self-administration, using optogenetic  techniques. These studies will identify novel plasticity-linked molecular mechanisms and functional neural  circuits that regulate binge-like alcohol self-administration. Finally, Aim 3 will characterize the role of AMPAR  positive modulation in the CeA and AcbSh on escalated alcohol self-administration using pharmacological  and optogenetic techniques. These studies will identify specific nuclei and circuits in which increased  glutamate signaling contributes to escalated binge drinking. This Component will identify and validate novel  mechanisms of a critical behavioral pathology that pervades the development and progression of alcohol addiction."
"9187018","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human sensory systems cannot simultaneously parse and reconstruct all available inputs into meaningful perceptual representations. Classic accounts address this processing limit by invoking a selection mechanism that preferentially encodes only the most salient and behaviorally relevant stimuli in the environment. This mechanism is typically referred to as selective attention, and empirical work has traditionally focused on understanding why and how relevant stimuli dominate perceptual awareness. However, other extra-retinal factors can also impact the efficiency of information processing, such as estimates of the prior probability of a particular stimulus (or configuration of stimuli) based on past experience in a particular context (i.e. expectation). Despite many demonstrations that expectation can profoundly influence a variety of perceptual phenomena ranging from low-level grouping to high-level object recognition, empirical and theoretical studies almost always conflate expectation and selective attention. This confusion persists even though these factors are logically dissociable: the probability that a stimulus will appear in a given context may have little or nothing to do with behavioral relevance. The conflation of these extra-retinal factors may seem inconsequential, as both might naively be expected to influence neural activity and behavior in a similar way. However, recent theories of cortical information processing - such as predictive coding - hold that stable perceptual representations emerge from the dynamic interplay between internal probability estimates about the state of the world (i.e. expectations) and the content and quality of incoming sensory information (which is shaped by task-relevance, or attention). Here, we adopt a Bayesian framework that casts perceptual inference as the product of prior beliefs and likelihoods (i.e. sensory evidence). We will use this framework to formulate and test the hypothesis that expectation operates on priors to modulate pre-stimulus responses in visual cortex and to bias the `read-out' of neural codes during decision-making, whereas attention directly impacts likelihood functions by shaping stimulus-evoked neural responses on the basis of task relevance. Our approach will combine psychophysics, quantitative models of perceptual and cognitive processes, and novel EEG and fMRI analysis methods that can determine how priors and likelihoods combine to shape the quality of feature-selective perceptual representations. Collectively, this work will provide key insights into how different extra-retinal biasing factors interact to shape perception, and will more broadly test generative models of cortical information processing that characterize perception as a problem of optimal statistical inference. In turn, this knowledge should improve our ability to isolate specific aspects of selective information processing that can sometimes go awry, thereby enabling more targeted diagnoses and interventions in clinical settings."
"9187812","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad objective of this project is to elucidate how lens fiber cells, their membranes, cytoskeleton and interlocking junctions all interact with each other to maintain the transparency of the organ. Lens fibers possess an elaborate interlocking system and adherens junctions (AJs) for maintaining their structural stability, especially during the deformation that accompanies visual accommodation. Gap junctions are needed for the exchange of ions and small metabolites between avascular lens cells. Also, aquaporin-0 constitutes 50% of total integral fiber-cell membrane proteins, and as an adhesion molecule, helps maintain the narrowed extracellular space between fiber cells to minimize light scattering. A number of mutations of AQP0 are directly associated with various forms of cataracts in humans and animals. For the first time, our recent data have shown that AQP0, highly enriched in protrusions, plays an unconventional role in maintaining the normal structure of these domains. With loss of AQP0, protrusions specifically undergo uncontrolled elongation and breakdown, leading to fiber-cell separation and cataract. By using wild-type, AQP0-/- and AQP0+/- mice, Aim 1 will demonstrate a novel cooperative role played by N-cadherin-based AJs in regulating AQP0-rich protrusions for maintaining the stability of protrusions. We will analyze cell-cell adhesion formations of AQP0 and cadherin proteins expressed in adhesion-deficient mouse fibroblast L-cells. We rationalize that AQPO-based protrusions maintain an overall stability of fiber cells at the gross level, while N-cadherin-based AJs support localized adhesions in protrusions and between fiber cells at the microscopic level. Ball-and-sockets (B&S) and protrusions are two distinct interlocking domains in lens fibers. The goal of Aim 2 is to demonstrate that AQP0 plays a role in regulating gap junction-rich B&S domains during fiber cell differentiation. We will also test the mechanistic role of AQP0 in regulating Cx50 and Cx46 in B&S domains in Cx50-KO, Cx46-KO and double KO lenses. Aim 3 will identify the functional role of an actin-based cytoskeletal organization in maintaining a normal structure of protrusions. We will identify the actin-based structural organization and its associated proteins, and determine the biochemical associations that exist between actin, cytoskeletal proteins, and AQP0-binding proteins with membranes of the mouse lenses. The proposed work will employ state-of-the-art techniques such as our improved whole-mount preparations, 3-D ultrastructural visualization, high-resolution freeze-fracture immunogold labeling, TEM, SEM, and biochemical analysis. Impact: Successful completion of the three aims will provide for the first time a novel mechanistic view of: (1)  a cooperative adhesion role played by both AQP0-based protrusions and N-cadherin-based AJs in maintaining the stability and transparency of the lens, (2) the crucial role played by AQP0 via maintaining a normal structure of gap junction-rich B&S domains in facilitating cell-to-cell communications in metabolically active fiber cells, and (3) ho AQP0 interacts with underlying actin-based cytoskeleton complexes to control the shape and function of interlocking domains."
"9187848","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NICHD Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN, UG1) was established in 2004 to address the following: (1) increased utilization of costly and complex pediatric critical care services and (2) lack of prospective clinical trials in pediatric critical care compared with adult and neonatal populations The primary Aim of this application is to join the CPCCRN as a clinical site, in order to expand our single center prospective observational cohort of pediatric patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) through enrollment at multiple CPCCRN Sites. ARDS is a common cause of pediatric critical illness (30% of PICU mortalities). We propose to enroll 800 pediatric patients with ARDS and collect clinical data with plasma and genetic biomarkers of coagulation and inflammation. The data obtained will be essential for stratifying prospective clinical research trials and will provide insight into basic molecular and cellular disease mechanisms necessary for designing new treatments. UCSF Medical Center and Benioff Children's Hospital, the Department of Pediatrics and Division of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine have a long history of participation in ground breaking multicenter clinical research, as well as cutting edge individual investigator driven basic, translational and clinical research. This tradition, coupled with deep institutional resources for biomedical research, makes our center ideally positioned to contribute novel proposals to the consortium and participate fully in network-sponsored studies"
"9195086","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: Mer belongs to the TAM subfamily (Tyro-3, Axl, Mer) of receptor tyrosine kinases. Receptors of this family play an important role in apoptotic cell clearance and immune tolerance while performing homeostatic phagocytosis.  Nephrotoxic serum (NTS)-induced  experimental nephritis has been a useful model that produces pathological changes similar to those seen in immune-mediated glomerulonephritis.  Using this model, we found an important protective role for Mer. We showed that Mer-KO mice developed severe early stage renal damage, which led to lower survival. In seeming contrast to these results, Axl was reported to promote mesangial cell proliferation in a similar model, and might hence worsen the disease. In this proposal, we will explore more deeply the physiological functions of both Mer and Axl in the development of experimental nephritis and spontaneous lupus nephritis.  Using mice lacking Axl, Mer, or both receptors, we will follow disease  development by enumerating apoptotic cells, and by quantitating cytokine/chemokine secretion and leukocyte infiltration and activation.  The expression pattern of Mer will be further studied along with Axl in renal cells by FACS and immunofluorescence while following disease progress in those animal models. We will test our hypothesis that the absence of Mer and Axl leads to impaired apoptotic cell clearance and skewed pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine secretion and enhanced monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the kidney.  Monocytes/macrophages and glomerular cells lacking TAM (Mer-KO, Axl- KO, or Mer/Axl-dKO) receptors are aberrantly activated and severe nephritis occurs. We will construct chimeric mice to ask if the renal damage is caused by resident renal cells or by migrated Mer/Axl- bearing cells. We will further investigate the role of TAM receptors on disease progress in lupus- prone B6/sle123 mice. Results from this study will extend our understanding of the mechanisms in which Mer and Axl regulate chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.  Data may reveal  potential  therapeutic targets for lupus nephritis."
"9188476","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section African American (AA) men are at a greater risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer (PrCa) than are Caucasian men. Therefore, identifying biomarkers involved in aggressive PrCa that can be used to identify AA men for specific and/or novel therapies would provide a major advance in public health. Consequently, there is intense effort to identify potential biomarkers that could independently predict poor clinical outcome and identify novel therapies for men with aggressive PrCa. Notably, heat shock proteins, PrCa Antigen 3, and Serine Protease Inhibitor Kazal-type 1, are all overexpressed in men with PrCa, where as Annexin II is suppressed. Despite the biological importance of these biomarkers, no studies have yet evaluated the significance of these biomarkers in AA men with aggressive PrCa. We believe that Howard's University Hospital urologic clinic which evaluates approximately 200 PrCa patients per year, is an ideal source for studying the importance of biomarkers as predictors of aggressive PrCa in AA men. We propose to evaluate the bi-directional expression of protein and gene signature pairs different in archival tissue samples from AA men who had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of PrCa at the Washington VA Medical Center and Howard and Johns Hopkins University Cancer Centers. The main hypothesis is that the bi-directional expression of genes and proteins is predictive of aggressive, lethal PrCa risk. To test this hypothesis we propose two aims. The first aim will test the hypothesis that microarray gene expression profiling produces bi-directional biomarker signature pairs that can be used to build a risk prediction model for PrCa. The second aim will test the hypothesis that the risk prediction of poor clinical outcome with bi-directional gene and protein expression pairs is superior to the use of a single gene or protein. Candidate pairs include those discovered in Aim 1. We anticipate that these studies may provide insight into selected genes and proteins as reliable predictive biomarkers for identifying aggressive PrCa in AA men, and could inform future human clinical applications for treatment of aggressive PrCa."
"9188570","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinal bipolar cells provide the major conduit for the transmission of visual information from photoreceptors to the output neurons of the retina. They can release a brief burst of neurotransmitter to signal a change in contrast, and they release neurotransmitter continuously to provide an analog read-out of luminance. To perform these functions, they must maintain a stockpile of fusion-competent or primed synaptic vesicles. In the extreme case that this stockpile is depleted, vision would cease, while modest decrements would alter the encoding of visual information. These sequelae are offset by the Ca2+-accelerated recruitment of vesicles to the primed state. However, the mechanism(s) by which Ca2+ facilitates recruitment to the primed state at bipolar cell ribbon-style synapses is poorly-understood, and the unusual molecular composition of ribbon-style synapses prevents the simple extrapolation of information gleaned from other systems. At the same time, this unusual molecular composition presents the opportunity to identify novel mechanisms that can be exploited for therapeutic gain. In this research program, we consider the unique properties of two unusual proteins proposed to regulate bipolar cell neurotransmitter release, syntaxin3B and CaBP5, and use these as a guide to uncover novel Ca2+-dependent mechanisms that regulate vesicle priming and enable bipolar cells to maintain their critical signaling abilities. In additio, we will determine whether the newly identified pathways comprise the mysterious, alternate priming pathway of retinal ribbon-style synapses. To provide this information, we use a three-pronged approach. Experiments using state-of-the-art biophysical approaches in reduced preparations will allow us to perform in-depth, mechanistic studies. Experiments performed at the tissue level will allow us to study the regulation of a biochemical correlate of priming by these pathways in response to physiological stimuli. Studies performed at the circuit level will allow us to define the consequences of these pathways on synaptic transmission from bipolar cells to postsynaptic neurons. These approaches will be supported by the use of genetically-modified animals, designer peptides, phospho-specific antibodies and pharmacological manipulations. Results will yield new information about the Ca2+-dependent pathways in bipolar cells that regulate the transfer of visual information across the vertebrate retina and open the door to the selective modulation of the visual pathway."
"9190511","Chromosomes are organized in a complex manner within the nucleus. For example, individual genomic loci take on distinct conformations via looping, pairing, and subnuclear targeting. Insulators and polycomb response elements (PREs), DNA elements bound by insulator proteins and the Polycomb Group complex, mediate these interactions. Improper organization of the nucleus has been linked to disorders including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and limb malformations, but it is unclear how nuclear targeting and long-distance interactions between specific genomic loci work to maintain proper gene expression.  Nuclear organization plays an essential role in stochastic gene expression, which is used during development to diversify cell fates. Disruptions in stochastic gene expression can lead to autism, visual and olfactory disorders, lymphoma, and immunodeficiencies, but little is known about the mechanisms that control the random on/off expression of genes. The goal of this project is to determine how subnuclear compartmentalization and long-distance gene interactions control stochastic expression decisions.  An excellent model for studying stochastic gene regulation is the fruit fly retina, where the gene spineless (ss) is expressed in a random on/off manner in a subset of photoreceptor cells. Two mechanisms control stochastic ss expression: 1) the ?expression decision,? in which each copy of ss within a nucleus makes an independent decision to be either on or off, and 2) ?Interchromosomal Communication (InterCom),? in which crosstalk between individual ss copies coordinates ss expression frequency. ss nuclear localization changes between Ss-on and Ss-off cell types, suggesting that ss subnuclear position is critical for the expression decision. Additionally, copies of ss pair within the nucleus independent of their location in the genome, suggesting that InterCom requires copies of ss to be in close physical proximity. Furthermore, specific insulators and PREs within ss appear to mediate expression decisions, pairing, and InterCom. We hypothesize that cis-regulatory elements direct ss subnuclear targeting to control the ss expression decision (Aim 1) and mediate ss pairing to control InterCom (Aim 2). We will further investigate the mechanisms controlling the ss expression decision by using the DNA Oligopaints FISH technique to track the localization of wild-type ss and CRISPR-generated insulator- and PRE-mutant ss alleles relative to activating and repressing nuclear bodies (Aim 1). We will further investigate the mechanisms of InterCom by testing the pairing of InterCom-competent ss transgenes and mutant alleles using DNA Oligopaints. We will then determine which DNA elements are required for pairing and InterCom by examining CRISPR and BAC transgene deletions of individual ss insulators and PREs (Aim 2). The results of this project will elucidate how interactions between DNA elements across long nuclear distances facilitate proper gene regulation during development and prevent disease states."
"9214477","Problem: Influenza infection results in an estimated 31 million outpatient visits, 55,000 to 974,200 hospitalizations, and 3,000 to 49,000 deaths. Membership in household in which someone else has influenza is the major risk factor for contracting influenza. The household secondary attack rate (SAR) is as high as 19% based on laboratory-confirmed influenza and 30% based on symptoms. Non-pharmaceutical preventive measures, including education, may play a role in decreasing transmission, but are only effective if started within 36 hours of symptom onset in index cases. Yet, most interventions are delayed because they are not initiated until care is sought. We have demonstrated in one primarily Latino, urban community sample, that text messaging can be used to rapidly identify community members with influenza-like illness (ILI) early in an illness. This early identification would enable implementation of an educational intervention in the optimal timeframe to reduce influenza transmission. Providing education within a text message is a proven successful strategy to influence behavior. Text messaging itself is scalable, low-cost, and can be used in low literacy populations. However, using text-message based surveillance to trigger a real-time text-message behavioral educational intervention to decrease household influenza transmission has not been assessed. Aim: To assess the impact of an educational intervention delivered by text messaging on transmission of influenza within households Exploratory Aim: To compare the yield of text message ILI/ARI surveillance among subgroups in a diverse, community sample  Methods: We will enroll 400 households (n=~1500 individuals) with ?1 child recruited from four contiguous communities in New York City. We will randomize households stratified by community 1:1 to receive surveillance-only (no text message education) vs. surveillance plus text message educational intervention. For symptom surveillance, households in both arms will receive text messages 3x/week during each influenza season (November-March) and report if someone in the household has ILI symptoms. For those in the educational intervention arm, when an ILI/ARI is reported, a series of educational text messages will be sent with information to decrease household transmission. Both arms will obtain one self-swab of the index case, and self-swabs of all other household members on days 3 and 5 from index onset. To identify respiratory tract pathogens, swabs will be analyzed using RT-PCR.  Outcomes: The primary outcome will be SAR of laboratory-confirmed influenza. Secondarily, we will assess SAR based on ILI/ARI symptoms, and of non-influenza viruses. Response rates will be compared between arms and by demographic factors (age, education, race/ethnicity)."

"9214594","PROJECT SUMMARY Genetic mutations cause congenital or progressive inner ear disorders in humans. Despite the recent progress in human genetics for identifying syndromic and nonsyndromic genes, little is known about how mutations in these genes contribute to the clinical features of patients with cochlear and/or vestibular dysfunction. In order to overcome limitations stemming from a paucity of human inner ear tissues available for experimentation, we recently established a method for deriving inner ear sensory epithelia harboring functional sensory hair cells from human pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture. These stem cell-derived tissues, designated as ?human inner ear organoids,? harbor a layer of tightly packed hair cells whose structural, biochemical and functional properties are indistinguishable from native sensory hair cells in the human inner ear. The primary goal of this application is to investigate pathophysiology of two monogenetic inner ear disorders, CHARGE syndrome and DFNA36/DFNB7/11 deafness, with human inner ear organoids as a model system. CHARGE syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by dysmorphic features of inner ear structures and caused primary by de novo mutations in CHD7, a gene encoding an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme. DFNA36 and DFNB7/11 associated maladies are caused by dominant and recessive mutations in TMC1, respectively. Since TMC1 plays a critical role in mechano-electrical transduction of sensory hair cells, hearing loss caused by DFNA36 or DFNB7/11 is believed to originate from defects in sensory transduction. We will generate human embryonic stem cell lines bearing disease-associated mutations using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, and examine when and how phenotypes manifest themselves using a combination of histological, biochemical and electrophysiological assays. Additional experiments are designed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the pathological defects and test if some of the defects can be rescued by forced expression of exogenous genes. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to recapitulate genetic inner ear disorders using a human model system and will provide valuable clinical information on the etiology of these disorders."
"9218590","Clinical and Metabolic Signature of Recovered Myocardium in Human Heart Failure Summary:  Remarkable improvements in myocardial structure and function have been reported in some advanced heart failure (HF) patients undergoing ?mechanical unloading? induced by left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). Unlike other HF therapies, which have also been associated with significant myocardial improvement, this tractable and specific LVAD population provides us access to pre-treatment myocardial tissue from both responders and non- responders which has enabled us to start probing the ?signature? of myocardium that has the potential to improve. Our central hypothesis is that refining this ?signature? will lead to a rational therapeutic approach in severe HF and will reveal broader recovery principles applicable to all stages and severity of HF.  Achieving and defining ?response? in LVAD patients requires a battery of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols and, as shown in the real world of advanced HF multicenter registries, this is challenging. Thus, there is a critical need for a selection process that can reliably predict who will and who will not ?respond? to LVAD therapy. This program will also enable us to develop such a predictive model in addition to our studies of the mechanisms driving myocardial recovery. First we will provide a clinically relevant ?signature? of failing hearts with the potential for recovery. Following a derivation- validation approach we will develop a myocardial recovery score using myocardial structural and/ or functional parameters together with clinical characteristics. This score will create a precise algorithm for selection of patients likely to recover prior to LVAD intervention, enrich the criteria for device explantation and sustained recovery following LVAD intervention and likely increase the real world incidence and sustainability of LVAD enabled recovery. Second, we hypothesized that specific metabolic adaptations drive myocardial recovery. Our preliminary data after examining myocardial tissue from normal donors and LVAD patients suggests a post- LVAD mismatch in glycolytic versus mitochondrial intermediates that might indicate increased flux through the cardioprotective pentose phosphate pathway. We have developed methodology and will employ novel and powerful in vivo metabolic flux studies using stable isotopes, mitochondrial respiratory measurements and additional metabolic assays to test this hypothesis.  This project offers a rare opportunity to closely integrate clinical function, structure and in vivo mechanistic studies in human HF and recovery. The physiological insights derived are providing clinical characteristics and biomarkers that will impact our practice in advanced HF patients. They are also revealing novel biological insights that inform both our clinical and basic science understanding of myocardial recovery applicable to all stages and severity of HF."
"9222307","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the leading causes of liver cancer and liver transplants in the United States. While current treatments show considerable promise, many patients worldwide will not benefit from these treatments due to cost and required long-term administration and monitoring. Furthermore, cured patients are not protected from new HCV infection. A protective vaccine would greatly augment the efforts to reduce the global health impact caused by HCV. An immunocompetent animal model would aid development of an effective HCV vaccine, however this effort is impeded by HCV's strict species-tropism, as efficient HCV infection is restricted to only humans and chimpanzees. The experiments proposed in this application are aimed at studying the basic mechanisms by which HCV tropism is regulated, and are based on our hypothesis that HCV species-specific tropism is influenced, at least in part, by differences in the capacity for HCV to enter host cells and suppress innate immune responses in disparate species. We recently observed that ferrets are able to support HCV infection in vivo, but at much lower levels than observed in humans and chimpanzees. We seek to understand what controls viral tropism of HCV during both entry and post-entry events and will explore species-specific blocks to HCV infection in ferrets. Our preliminary studies identified that the ferret version of the tight junction protein occludin (OCLN) does not function efficiently as an HCV entry factor. To define the cellular determinants of ferret OCLN's activity as an HCV entry factor, we will map critical residues that influence its function as an entry factor during HCV entry. We will also select for mutations in the HCV genome that will allow more efficient use of ferret OCLN to identify viral determinants for this restriction. Furthermore, HCV suppression of the innate immune response is influenced by species-specific factors, as we have found that HCV is unable to cleave ferret MAVS. We propose experiments to examine host and viral determinants that influence HCV cleavage of ferret MAVS and determine how inadequate suppression of the innate immune system in ferrets by HCV influences viral replication. By identifying species-specific entry, replication and innate immunity restrictions to HCV infection across a wide range of species and defining how these blocks contribute to HCV viral tropism, we can devise methods for efficient HCV infection in a range of species as well as provide insight on how host-pathogen interactions impact the life cycles and host susceptibility for a range of other viruses with similar replication and immune evasion mechanisms."
"9219111","Electrical signaling in bacterial biofilms Gürol Süel (P.I.), Lev Tsimring (Co-I.) and Andrew Mugler (Co-I.) Summary Understanding communication among bacteria is a fundamental biological problem with critical implications for public health. Nowhere is this problem perhaps more relevant than in bacterial communities known as biofilms. How individual bacteria communicate within such collectively organized communities to coordinate their behavior is a long-standing question in biology. We recently discovered a new type of bacterial communication mechanism based on ion channel mediated electrical cell-to-cell signaling in Bacillus subtilis biofilms. This discovery made possible by our recent technical innovations, ideally positions us to tackle the fundamental and long-standing question regarding how bacteria coordinate their behavior in biofilms. Necessitated by the multi- scale nature of the problem, the specific aims we propose are designed to bridge across spatial and temporal scales: 1) How does cell density and heterogeneity influence long-range communication within the biofilm? We propose that high cell density and cell-to-cell heterogeneity in electrical activity promotes efficient signal transmission within the biofilm. 2) What governs the composition and dispersion of biofilm communities? We propose that long-range electrical signaling plays a critical role in attracting individual bacteria to, or repelling them from the biofilm. 3) Does a biofilm operate as an independent functional unit in the presence of neighboring biofilms? We propose that multiple neighboring biofilms can become coupled through long-range electrical signaling into a super-cluster that can act as a functional unit. These questions involve phenomena operating over length scales ranging from individual cells to groups of biofilms, and timescales ranging from seconds to hours. Therefore, multi-scale quantitative time-lapse microscopy is the essential tool to address these questions. Importantly, the resulting quantitative spatio-temporal measurements are ideal to inform and constrain problem specific mathematical models and determine the role of electrical signaling in coordinating bacteria in biofilms. The quantitative spatio-temporal measurements to be generated here will thus also serve the broad interests of the computational biology community. !"
"9222103","Project Summary. Infectious diarrhea constitutes a major endemic health threat as an increasingly frequent and deadly source of food- and water-borne illness. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are especially significant bacterial pathogens because their toxins can cause a type of renal failure (hemolytic uremic syndrome) for which therapy is limited. The molecular mechanisms by which EHEC and the closely related enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), as well as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a common cause of human gastroenteritis, inhibit host innate immune responses to promote bacterial colonization are under intense investigation. Understanding these host-pathogen dynamics in molecular detail may enhance the development of pharmacological approaches to prevent and treat infections.  Through studies of the mechanism of the NleB virulence protein expressed by E. coli and by a related pathogen of mice, Citrobacter rodentium, it was determined that NleB functions as a glycosyltransferase enzyme that covalently modifies host proteins with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to subvert their normal functions. NleB disrupts tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) signaling, leading to inhibition of the pro-inflammatory NF-?B pathway. The glycolysis enzyme GAPDH functions as a co- activator of TRAF2 activity. The modification of GAPDH with GlcNAc by NleB prevents GAPDH from binding to and activating TRAF2, leading to a reduced NF-?B response to infection and thus enhanced bacterial survival. It was also discovered that some NleB orthologs modify the arginine residues of host proteins, rather than the expected modification of their serine/threonine residues. S. Typhimurium strains also encode from 1-3 NleB orthologs named SseK/1/2/3, although their enzymatic activities and relative contributions to virulence are less clear.  The proposed project is designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of NleB/SseK glycosyltransferase activities, with the ultimate goal of using these data to inform future strategies to prevent and treat infectious diarrhea. The specific aims are: 1) Elucidate the NleB/SseK GlcNAcylation mechanisms and their targeting of host proteins. 2) Identify GAPDH GlcNAcylation sites and characterize their role in GAPDH activity and NF-?B pathway activation. This multidisciplinary approach provides an opportunity to probe not only the enzymology of these virulence factors, but also to effect the future development of small molecules with anti-virulence properties."
"9232507","Project Summary The principal investigator for this Small Research Grant is a pediatric neurosurgeon with specific interest in improving the neurological and functional outcomes (e.g. quality of life, school performance, activities of daily living) for children who are afflicted with adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP). This neurologically devastating tumor, due to its low mortality rate, forces children and their families to face a lifetime of chronic and profound disability. As a junior investigator, the PI has developed, and leads, North America's only consortium dedicated to the study of pediatric ACP, Advancing Treatment for Pediatric Craniopharyngioma (ATPC). The goal of this award is to determine whether pilot data that Dr. Hankinson derived from ACP specimens merits further investigation with animal models, and potentially human trials. Analysis of cytokine expression from ACP cyst fluid indicated a unique proinflammatory profile, when compared to another cyst- forming pediatric brain tumor, Pilocytic Astrocytoma. This raises the possibility that FDA approved medications that specifically target IL-6/IL-6 receptor, a critical mediator of the proinflammatory pathway, could control ACP cyst growth. This could reveal a novel therapeutic option for children with ACP, either through improved tumor control or by facilitating safer curative surgery. By leveraging the University of Colorado's NIH-supported interdisciplinary research centers, this small project will identify which cellular component of ACP is responsible for the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and, further, if IL-6/IL-6R blockade mitigates this process. Dr. Hankinson works in an environment that is ideal for the completion of this work. He works very closely with Dr. Nicholas Foreman, who is one of the primary mentors on his KL2 career development award. Dr. Foreman is a well-established senior investigator and leader in research regarding the immunobiology of pediatric brain tumors, most notably ependymoma. Dr. Hankinson has also undertaken formal training in bioinformatics during his KL2 award period, which resulted in a strong relationship with Dr. Aik-Choon Tan, Director of the Translational Bioinformatics and Cancer Systems Biology Laboratory at the University of Colorado Cancer Center. As such, the key personnel of this project possess considerable expertise in all the methods required for the successful completion of this award. These include flow cytometry, RNAseq, cell proliferation assays and cytokine microarray analysis. Dr. Hankinson has additionally built collaborative relationships with international leaders in ACP research. Most relevant to this award proposal is that with Dr. Juan Pedro Martinez-Barbera, who has established the only animal models of ACP. If the results of this work are promising, we will proceed to animal studies through collaboration with Dr. Martinez-Barbera. If the results do not indicate the potential for considerable advancement in the therapy for ACP, we will continue to focus our resources on the lines of research that were defined in our recent publication regarding ACP gene expression."
"9232830","Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: ? Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters ? Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype ? Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers ? both positive and negative ? associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss."
"9233613","The early olfactory system, one of the best-characterized sensory systems, is well understood for its connectivity and how it represents odors. However, how odor representation is affected by endogenous neuromodulation remains controversial and elusive. In recent years, neuromodulation in olfactory circuits has garnered great attention in regards to the targets of modulatory cells within these circuits. To date, the manner in which olfactory circuits control the activity of modulatory neurons, and thus modulator release, has been entirely unexplored. Thus, no models presently exist demonstrating the natural pattern of modulator release in olfactory structures, rendering it impossible to study neuromodulation is a natural manner. Furthermore many modulatory neurons, including those involved in olfaction, are also known to possess co- neurotransmitters. The role of such co-transmission remains elusive. This proposal will address these gaps by focusing on the Drosophila antennal lobe, which is analogous to the olfactory bulb, but comprising far fewer neurons than its mammalian counterpart. We will use patch clamp physiology and develop novel approaches to map out the wiring diagram between serotonergic neurons and neurons of the first olfactory relay. Importantly, we will emphasize the feedback connections made from olfactory neurons back onto modulatory cells. Such connections shape activity in modulatory cells and may regulate modulator concentration locally in olfactory circuits. Additionally, we are screening RNAi collections to isolate tools to knock down the expression of individual neurotransmitters in serotonergic neurons that possess multiple transmitters. These RNAi tools will first be combined with optical imaging to determine how each transmitter influences olfactory coding in the antennal lobe. Next, we will use these reagents to alter synaptic function in flies performing an olfactory discrimination task to link sensory coding and perception."
"9234225","ABSTRACT A complete understanding of immune system development and homeostasis would require the mapping of every immune cell's origin and eventual fate. A powerful approach for high-resolution cell fate mapping involves ?DNA barcodes?, i.e. unique short sequences of DNA that are inserted into the genome of cells under study. One drawback of this approach is the necessity of cell isolation and transplantation, which limits it to only a few cell types, destroys the native tissue environment and introduces biases due to transplantation. We propose to develop an approach that introduces DNA barcodes in vivo by genetic manipulation, i.e. without cell isolation or transplantation. Crucially, DNA barcodes would be introduced in a time-controlled and cell type-specific manner, allowing the reconstruction of developmental kinetics and precursor-product relationships in the immune system. In Aim 1, we will validate and optimize the inducible DNA barcoding system. In Aim 2, we will use this system to barcode dendritic cell progenitors and analyze their clonal contribution to mature dendritic cell subsets. These studies would establish a novel experimental system for clonal cell analysis in the immune system, and apply it to the development of a critical immune cell type in unperturbed animals."
"9236396","PROJECT SUMMARY A major mechanism proposed for HDL's beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease risk is its capacity to promote cholesterol excretion through a process called reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Elevated HDL cholesterol levels are generally correlated with reduced disease risk. However, recent trials of HDL-raising drugs failed to observe a clinical benefit. This has led to a revised HDL hypothesis where the functional capacity of HDL to promote peripheral cholesterol efflux and RCT, not HDL concentration, is deemed most important for its protective role. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) facilitates the net movement of cholesteryl ester (CE) between plasma lipoproteins. In humans, following the conversion of tissue-derived cholesterol to CE on HDL, 70% of HDL CE is transferred by CETP to VLDL and LDL prior to being removal by the liver. Thus, CETP is a central player in the HDL-mediated cholesterol excretion pathway. We have shown in vitro that apolipoprotein F (ApoF) modulates CETP activity by inhibiting lipid transfers involving LDL but stimulating lipid transfer between HDL and VLDL. We hypothesize that ApoF operates as a metabolic switch by redirecting HDL-derived CE to VLDL instead of LDL, and that this reduces plasma LDL cholesterol levels and stimulates RCT. Here, we test this hypothesis and investigate mechanisms controlling ApoF activity. Aim 1 ? Determine the role of ApoF in defining the fate of HDL-derived CE ? With an established model of siRNA-mediated ApoF knockdown in hamsters, we will quantify how the loss of this key protein modifies the efflux of HDL CE to LDL and VLDL, measure the hepatic clearance of VLDL and LDL CE, and determine the impact of ApoF on HDL function and RCT in chow-fed and fat-fed animals. Aim 2 ? Define the mechanism that converts ApoF to its active form and quantify the effect of hyperlipidemia on ApoF concentration and its activation status ? Plasma ApoF exists in both active and inactive forms; active ApoF is bound to LDL. Hypercholesterolemic LDL is enriched in ApoF. We hypothesize that the molecular packing of LDL surface lipids controls ApoF binding. We will identify the molecular properties of LDL that correlate with enhanced ApoF binding and rigorously test their role in this process. Total and active ApoF concentrations will be quantified in hyperlipidemic human subjects to determine their possible contribution to aberrant lipoprotein levels. Aim 3 ? Determine the factors that control plasma ApoF levels ? In fat-fed animals, plasma ApoF is increased but hepatic APOF mRNA levels are decreased. To understand these discordant observa- tions, the molecular mechanisms causing this decrease in APOF mRNA will be determined, and the turnover of plasma ApoF in normolipidemic and hypercholesterolemic hamsters will be compared. We anticipate find- ing that greater association of ApoF with LDL lengthens its plasma residence time. Overall, these studies will provide novel insight into how ApoF regulates CETP activity and enhances the functional properties of HDL."
"9237217","The Cancer Molecular Imaging (CMI) Program Area is comprised of 29 members, including two split  members (shared between two program areas), representing two schools and eight departments at UCLA.  The NCI and other peer-reviewed cancer-related support for this Program Area is $5.7M. CMI Program Area  members have produced a total number of 411 publications, of which 27% are intra-programmatic, 4 1% are  inter-programmatic and 44% were in collaboration with investigators at other institutions. The main goals of  the CMI Program Area are to develop new molecular imaging technologies and methodologies to provide  new insights into cancer biology, to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and to translate  molecular imaging approaches to the clinic. Four themes support this goal: 1) Instrumentation and  analytical tools. Next-generation instrumentation provides high-resolution, sensitive and quantitative noninvasive  measurement of molecular biomarkers in vivo at low cost, and facilitates adoption of novel tracers in  preclinical and clinical imaging centers. 2) Novel molecular Imaging approaches. CMI members develop  novel, translatable PET tracers and reporter gene systems. These probes are employed preclinically to study  cancer initiation, progression and metastasis, and to predict and monitor treatment response, laying the  groundwork for ciinicai translation. 3) Imaging immune responses. Immune regulation plays a key role in  the development and control of cancer, as evidenced by new developments in immunotherapeutics. The CMI  Program Area is developing a range of probes for imaging immune responses and monitoring cancer  immunotherapy in preclinical models and patients. 4) Translational molecular imaging. CMI investigators  are advancing clinical molecular imaging of cancer through first-in-human studies of new radiotracers for  deoxycytidine kinase activity (dCK), engineered immunoPET probes for imaging of cell surface markers,  novel reporter systems for human use, and finally, new applications of current clinical molecular tracers and  modalities (e.g., FDG, FLT, as well as MRI/MRSI to investigate metabolism in gliomas and prostate cancer)  to improve patient outcomes."

The CRU was established in 1993 as the first major facility for support of clinical cancer research at UCLA. The establishment of this unit was critical to move the Division of Clinical/Transitional Research of the JCCC and its investigators into a position from which it could play a significant role in investigator-initiated, cooperative group and industry-sponsored clinical research in cancer. Data Safety and Monitoring is also contained in this section of our proposal and is overseen by the JCCC Office of Regulatory Compliance (ORC). The ORC is a separate entity within the JCCC that manages our protocol review and monitoring activities and is responsible for reporting to CTRP and clinicaltrials.gov."

Standing internal advisory committees include the Director's Council, the Basic and Clinical Seed Grant Review Committees, the Director's Administrative Review Committee and a variety of ad hoc groups used to review different aspects of the JCCC.  During the current cycle and in addition to regular EAB Meetings, we have conducted ad hoc reviews of our Office of Regulatory Compliance, Administration, JCCC Shared Resources and have conducted member satisfaction surveys. In addition, we prepared a strategic plan with input from a large number of JCCC members and senior leaders."
"9237232","The Developmental Funds component of the CCSG is a critical resource for the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, as it provides the only continuing source of support from the CCSG to recruit new faculty and provide funding for JCCC members use of the University of California, Davis Mouse Biology Program for transgenic mice. The final authority over distribution of Developmental Funds resides with the Director, in consultation with the Director's Council. The highest priority is assigned to bringing new faculty recruits to UCLA and the JCCC through a search process in which the Cancer Center is a full partner. During the past funding cycle, Developmental Funds were used for recruiting faculty members who are both outstanding and in line with our strategic goals. We plan to continue this focus for Developmental Funds in the future. The budgetary request for Developmental Funds to recruit and retain stellar faculty in this renewal represents no increase over the current level. As discussed in Section 6.1, we have sunset our ES/Transgenic Shared Resource and have developed a strategic relationship with the University of California, Davis Mouse Biology Program. In keeping with the new CCSG guidelines, we are requesting funding to subsidize our members use of the Davis facility. A cooperative agreement between the JCCC and the Mouse Biology Program (MBP) at UC Davis has been established to meet JCCC member needs for genetically engineered mice. This will be particularly advantageous to JCCC members, because it provides them access to technology not available at UCLA."
"9240058","Abstract: Nrf2 Regulation of Ductal Pancreatic Cancer Etiology and Treatment We seek to leverage the unique capability of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells to resist oxidative stress towards the development of effective therapies for this malignancy. Indeed, in addition to the advanced stage of disease that patients typically have at presentation, the lethality of PDA largely reflects the poor response of their tumors to systemic therapeutics. We previously reported that PDA initiation in a mouse model required the Nrf2 transcription factor, in part through the ability of Nrf2 to direct the expression of many genes that collectively reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additional work by others demonstrated that somatic mutations in NRF2 or its binding protein KEAP1 occur commonly in lung and breast cancer, resulting in the activation of the NRF2 pathway and increased drug resistance. To determine how Nrf2 promotes cancer formation and therapeutic resistance in PDA we have generated new conditional models and developed mouse and human pancreatic cancer organoid cultures. The new mouse models and organoids will serve two complementary purposes: to unequivocally determine whether Nrf2 functions solely in a cell intrinsic manner in promoting PDA, and as model systems to discover the Nrf2 effector pathways and explore new therapeutic strategies in vivo and ex vivo (Aim 1). Accordingly, we have found that Nrf2 regulates protein translation through its antioxidant function to promote cell proliferation in PDA organoids, and we will define the biochemical mechanisms involved and determine whether they represent new therapeutic opportunities (Aim 2). Furthermore, we have identified new, non-antioxidant related Nrf2 target genes in PDA organoids, and we will determine their role in PDA pathogenesis (Aim 3). Our project will utilize bespoke model systems and state-of-the-art mass spectrometric, genomic, transcriptomic, and bioinformatics methods in order to identify new mediators of Nrf2 function in PDA. Nrf2 effector pathways and target genes discovered in our work will be assessed for their individual importance in PDA biology and therapeutic resistance, and the most promising candidates will be validated in organoid and mouse models using genetic and pharmacological approaches. We anticipate that our results will explain fundamental aspects of oncogenesis in PDA and will lead to the development of more effective therapies for this deadly malignancy."
"9238889","Lung cancer is a critical health care problem among Veterans, who have a higher incidence and worse outcome. Most individuals with lung cancer die of their disease because of drug resistance, invasion and metastases, features closely linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs). Importantly, this resistant phenotype includes targeted agents (e.g., EGFR inhibitors), conventional chemotherapy, radiation, and escape from immune destruction by upregulation of PD-L1. The identification and therapeutic targeting of molecules contributing to the aggressive and resistant properties of lung cancer cells are key to tumor cell eradication and cure. Recently, we discovered that TGF?-mediated EMT involves upregulation of the cell surface receptor, Neuropilin-2 (NRP2). Importantly, NRP2 knockdown inhibits TGF?- mediated migration, invasion, metastasis and tumorsphere formation, a feature of CSCs. More recently, we discovered that TGF? induces the preferential translation of a previously uninvestigated isoform, NRP2b, which is identical to the prototype NRP2a in its extracellular domain, but diverges substantially before the transmembrane segment to encode a distinct, yet highly evolutionarily conserved, C-terminus. Our studies demonstrate that NRP2a and NRP2b have opposing effects on tumorigenesis, with NRP2b specifically promoting tumorigenesis, as well as signaling from the receptor tyrosine kinase, MET. The isoforms also differ in their binding to the PDZ domain protein, GIPC1, which is specific to NRP2a, and which is also known to function in receptor endocytosis and trafficking. Importantly, mutations that disrupt NRP2a-GIPC1 binding do not result in NRP2b-like activities, whereas C-terminal deletions of NRP2b attenuate its ability to enhance migration. These results suggest that the NRP2b C-terminus is critical to its pro-tumorigenic properties, which may result from differential interactions or trafficking of cell surface receptors, including MET. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of how NRP2b functions has therapeutic implications. This may come from identifying which cooperating receptors are most important, or elucidating the mechanisms by which NRP2b affects receptor trafficking, thus suggesting new therapeutic strategies. Aim 1 will use genetic approaches to further examine the role of MET in NRP2b function and tumorigenesis, as well as determine if NRP2 isoforms differentially interact with MET, or affect its endocytosis, trafficking and recycling. In addition, we will examine patient samples for co-expression of NRP2b along with markers of MET activation and EMT. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the effects of NRP2b on MET can be generalized to other receptors. Their contribution to NRP2b function and tumorigenesis will be examined. In Aim 3, we will use site-specific mutagenesis and domain swaps to identify critical residues in the 93 amino acid NRP2b C-terminus (JM, TM and cytoplasmic segments) responsible for its distinct activity. The JM segment is unique, extracellular and predicted to be antigenic. We will make monoclonal antibodies against this segment and test them for specificity and inhibitory activity. NRP2b represents a highly innovative avenue of research, which can be exploited for therapeutic gain. In addition, EMT plays a major role in inflammation, fibrosis and normal development, where the role of NRP2b is unknown. Thus, our proposed studies should have broad applicability to lung cancer and other human diseases."
"9241177","The differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) in the bone marrow environment is a crucial determinant of bone mass, whole body metabolism, and bone repair. However, the mechanisms that regulate MPC differentiation are poorly understood. This proposal is based on the hypothesis that MPCs serve to sense metabolic stress which then directs their differentiation. In this view, the control of adipogenic vs. osteogenic differentiation of MPCs is a mechanism for balancing structural/biomechanical and metabolic needs. Excessive marrow adipogenesis is associated with bone loss and metabolic adaptation whereas excessive osteoblast differentiation favors acquisition of bone mass possibly at the cost of reduced capacity for metabolic adaptation. Conditions of high metabolic stress, such as diet- induced obesity, drive adipogenic differentiation in preference to osteoblast differentiation. We propose that G protein signaling is a key participant in metabolic sensing in MPCs, with the inhibitory G protein (Gi) signaling pathway promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that drives increased marrow adipogenesis and bone loss. These concepts will be tested in three specifics aims. In specific aims 1 and 2, we will utilize mouse genetic models to effect constitutive Gi signaling (Aim 1) or blockade of Gi signaling (Aim 2) in MPCs. We will investigate the effect of these manipulations on bone marrow adipose tissue, bone mass, fracture repair, and adaption to metabolic stress (high fat diet). In specific aim 3, we will use cellular and molecular approaches to elucidate the mechanisms by which MPC differentiation is regulated by Gi signaling and by metabolic stress. Successful completion of these studies will identify novel mechanisms for the control of skeletal and metabolic homeostasis, will provide new insights into the basis for the well-established relationship between bone mass and bone marrow adipose tissue, and may provide new opportunities for developing therapies aimed at improving bone and metabolic health."
"9243447","Noonan syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by congenital heart disease, dysmorphic facial and chest features, and mental retardation bears an increased risk of progressing to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), a fatal myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), and acute leukemias. This disease affects 1 in 1000 to 2500 children. There is an enormous unmet need for novel therapeutic interventions that specifically target disease-causing molecules for the prevention and treatment of leukemias in Noonan syndrome. Germline heterozygous mutations in the tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 (Shp2), a positive regulator of the Ras signaling pathway, are associated with 50% of individuals with Noonan syndrome. Moreover, somatic heterozygous mutations in Ptpn11 have been found in non-syndromic JMML (35%) and other childhood leukemias. These mutations disrupt the autoinhibitory structure of Shp2, resulting in greatly increased catalytic activity. Recent studies have demonstrated that a single Ptpn11 disease mutation, such as E76K or D61G/Y, is sufficient to drive the development of a Noonan syndrome-like developmental disorder and JMML-like MPN followed by progression to acute leukemias in mice, strongly suggesting a causal role for Ptpn11 activating mutations in these diseases. It is evident that the increased catalytic activity of mutated Shp2 leads to aberrant hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation. Shp2 might thus be an effective target of mechanism-based therapeutic intervention for Ptpn11-associated hematological malignancies. Through structure-based chemical database screening in combination with biochemical/biological experimentation, we have identified several small molecule compounds that selectively inhibit Shp2 (United States Patent 8,673,913 B2). Among these inhibitors is the natural product compound cryptotanshinone, one of the major active ingredients of the traditional medicinal herbal plant Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge. Notably, disease related mutant Shp2 with the open conformation is more sensitive to this inhibitor than wildtype Shp2. More importantly, cryptotanshinone is already in clinical use in Asian countries to treat heart disease and stroke in adult patients (presumably through inhibition of Shp2 function in promoting platelet adhesion/aggregation). Given that this Shp2 inhibitor is a clinically-used drug with low toxicity, we plan to use this drug to determine in animal models whether Shp2 is an effective target of therapeutic intervention for the treatment of Ptpn11-associated non-syndromic leukemias and/or for the prevention of leukemic progression in Ptpn11 mutation positive Noonan syndrome. We will first test the inhibitor?s effects on Ptpn11E76K/+ mouse leukemic cells in vitro. After determining the most effective concentrations from these assays, dose finding experiments, and toxicity tests, we will then test the inhibitor in Ptpn11E76K/+ leukemic mice. Furthermore, we will determine the effectiveness of the inhibitor on Ptpn11 mutation-positive JMML patient cells."
"9245027","Project Summary  Influenza B virus (IBV) causes seasonal epidemics in humans and is responsible for the major influenza disease burden in some years, although it receives less attention as compared with influenza A virus (IAV). Unlike IAVs that infect a wide range of species, IBV infections are almost exclusively restricted to humans, despite sporadic infections reported in seals. It is unclear whether other animal species can support the replication of IBV and serve as a reservoir. Recent studies led by Dr. Ma provide serological and experimental infection evidence that domestic pigs are susceptible to IBV infection. Swine herds previously exposed to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) had a higher prevalence of IBV antibodies; the IBV genome was detected in nasal swabs collected from PRRSV seropositive pigs (Ran et al., JVI, 2015). It has been well documented that PRRSV causes host immunosuppression and its emergence in the latter part of the 1980s has changed the landscape of porcine infectious ecology and affected the overall health status of the global swine population.  To date, little is known about the biology and evolution of IBVs in non-human species. The precise role of PRRSV infection on IBV replication and transmission in pigs is not completely understood. Based on Dr. Ma's published work, it is hypothesized that the introduction of PRRSV into the U.S. swine population has increased the permissiveness of swine to IBVs, thus creating a novel animal reservoir and a zoonotic source, for what has traditionally been considered a uniquely human pathogen. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims in this R21 proposal, one that will determine the impact of PRRSV on susceptibility of swine to human IBVs and one that will determine whether IBV replication in swine leads to genetic and antigenic divergence of swine and human IBVs. In specific aim 1, pig challenge experiments with IBV will be conducted as a function of persistent PRRSV infection. In specific aim 2, IBVs from naturally infected pigs will be isolated and compared with co-circulating seasonal human IBV strains in vitro and in vivo for viral replication and pathogenesis.  The results of this study will provide novel insight into the biology and evolution of IBVs, especially as they relate to co-infection with PRRSV. Studying the differences between human and swine IBV isolates may improve understanding of how IBVs are maintained when they are not circulating in humans. The results of these experiments will likely reveal new information about the molecular mechanisms of IBV replication and evolution in non-human species, which is an important issue in the influenza research community.  "
"9252062","The long-term goal of this project is to improve brain cancer patient care by developing and validating advanced dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) methods for tumor characterization and therapeutic response assessment. Improving the biophysical characterization of brain tumors remains a highly relevant clinical objective. Currently, Contrast-Enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) is the primary means to detect primary and recurrent tumors and assess therapeutic response for essentially all brain tumor patients. Yet despite widespread use, CE-MRI accuracy remains limited, as it is incapable of delineating between tumor types, is confounded by treatment effects and can require months to discern true therapeutic response. We believe that advanced and clinically optimized DSC-MRI techniques can overcome these limitations and could impact radiographic diagnosis, response assessment and image-guided biopsies. During the first period of support of this grant we developed and validated, in pre-clinical animal models, novel DSC- MRI techniques for quantitative and simultaneous imaging of brain tumor hemodynamics, vascular integrity and cytoarchitecture. Given the demonstrated validity of these techniques in pre-clinical studies we now seek to optimize and validate their utility in brain tumor patients. Our first Aim is to develop and optimize a clinically practical, simultaneous spiral-based spin and gradient echo (SAGE) DSC-MRI strategy for mapping total and microvascular hemodynamics, vessel size, vessel architecture, vascular permeability and cytoarchitecture. Such a sequence overcomes many of the obstacles that reduce the quality of current DSC-MRI scans, requires lower doses of Gadolinium based contrast agents, enables more reliable perfusion measures and improves registration accuracy between DSC-MRI data and conventional images used for surgical planning. We next aim to establish threshold values for SAGE based metrics that accurately differentiate high-grade glioma recurrence from post treatment radiation effect and validate by direct correlation to image-guided tissue histopathology. This would enable clinicians to make earlier treatment decisions and initiate second-line therapies sooner. Our final aim is to validate the sensitivity of SAGE-based parameters to histologic tumor content both within enhancing and non-enhancing tissue. We will determine whether SAGE based metrics, individually or combined, enable the identification of tumor rich biopsy sampling sites, thereby providing a validated biomarker-based image guided biopsy approach that could improve histologic and genetic profiling. SAGE-based measures of tumor perfusion, permeability and cellularity would help overcome many of the limitations of CE-MRI as they are more likely to improve tumor characterization, localization and offer early and more specific indicators of treatment response."
"9258221","ABSTRACT Each year 1.5 million people are diagnosed with an incidentally (not screen) detected lung nodule. The diagnosis is important because it may represent an early-stage lung cancer, but 90% of incidentally detected lung nodules are benign. Accordingly, the intensity of a lung nodule evaluation must weigh the benefits of early-detection and treatment (e.g. cure) against the risks of diagnostic tests (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events). Practice guideline recommendations are intended to optimize risks and benefits but adherence rates are only 55%. One reason for this poor adherence is the low level of evidence supporting guidelines leading to legitimate uncertainty about their effectiveness, safety, and impact on health care resources. This uncertainty is significant because it is unclear whether interventions should be developed to increase guideline adherence or if new approaches to varying the intensity of a nodule evaluation are needed. Until recently, an important barrier to generating a higher level of evidence has been an inability to identify and longitudinally follow a cohort of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Investigators from the Cancer Research Network (CRN) have determined that individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule can be efficiently and accurately identified using a combination of administrative data, electronic radiology reports, natural language processing, and some chart abstraction. Additionally, investigators found that providers routinely document lung cancer risk factors (e.g. age and smoking status) that allow for a study of adherence to Fleischner Society guidelines, and this information is readily available in a structured format within the electronic medical record. Furthermore, other CRN investigators have developed methods that allow for estimation of radiation exposure from imaging studies and the costs of care delivery within integrated healthcare systems. This work allows us to propose the first-ever multi-site comparative-effectiveness study of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. The study aims to compare the: 1) effectiveness (e.g. incidence of early-stage lung cancer), 2) potential harms (e.g. radiation exposure, procedure-related adverse events), and 3) two-year total costs of care of varying intensities of lung nodule evaluation (e.g. guideline concordant versus more intense versus less intense evaluations). We hypothesize that less intense nodule evaluations are associated with a lower incidence of early-stage lung cancer compared to guideline concordant care, and more intense nodule evaluations are associated with greater radiation exposure, more procedure-related adverse events, and higher costs. Findings from this study will determine whether limited resources should be invested in developing system-level interventions designed to increase guideline adherence or studying alternative approaches to lung nodule evaluation (e.g. risk- prediction models, biomarkers). This line of investigation is expected to ultimately improve the care and outcomes of individuals with an incidentally detected lung nodule."
"9263660","Approximately one-third of the proteins in the human proteome are intrinsically disordered (IDPs). IDPs play a central role in cellular signaling and regulatory pathways and are directly implicated in numerous devastating diseases such as cancer, leukemia, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. Because of the central role of IDPs in signaling and regulation and the unique features of their complexes with their physiological partners, interactions involving disordered proteins are frequently targeted by viral proteins that mimic cellular IDP motifs. Many regulatory IDPs function through the transient assembly of multi- component signaling complexes, where flexibility and dynamic exchange of binding partners plays a critical role. The dynamic nature of IDPs and their regulatory complexes imposes a major challenge to traditional structural biology techniques. The overarching goal of this project is to characterize the conformational ensemble and interactions of a key intrinsically disordered transcription factor, the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which its activity is down regulated by hyperphosphorylation in response to DNA damage and by binding to an important human T cell leukemia virus oncoprotein that promotes lymphoid cell transformation and progression of leukemia. CREB plays a critical role in regulating normal hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and is implicated in proliferation of myeloid and acute leukemias. Transcription of CREB- responsive genes is regulated by phosphorylation at multiple sites and by interactions with the CBP/p300 and CRTC coactivators. A powerful combination of complementary biophysical tools - NMR, single molecule FRET (smFRET), and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) ? will be used to characterize the conformation of CREB and conformational changes associated with hyperphosphorylation and with binding to DNA, coactivators, and the basic leucine zipper oncoprotein (HBZ) of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1."
"9286549","Spinal cord injury and disorders (SCI/D) are a substantial health concern impacting about 1.2 million Americans, and 45,000 veterans. The total economic burden of SCI/D is estimated at $9 billion/year to $400 billion in lifetime medical and loss-of-productivity costs. The most common clinical presentation is high cervical SCI/D which produces a broad spectrum of issues, including loss of hand function and autonomy, sensory changes, spasticity, pain and autonomic dysfunction, profoundly impacting quality of life. Restoring these broad functions is the goal of regenerative and rehabilitative therapeutic approaches for SCI/D. The VA Gordon Mansfield Spinal Cord Injury Consortium (VA-GMSCIC) is a VA-funded effort to develop late-stage translational therapeutics in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model in preparation for testing emerging therapeutic approaches clinically. Prior and current funding has focused on multifaceted data collection on each subject, with 5 different centers collaboratively collecting data, each within their specific domain of expertise (physiology, behavior, histology, neurorehabilitation, and molecular biology). This is an ideal use of the NHP model, as maximal information is collected on the performance of therapeutic approaches in a small number of NHPs. Yet the data from VA-GMSCIC is high-volume, high-complexity, and high-heterogeneity, providing both a challenge and opportunity for novel discoveries. Application of modern data science tools can help deliver on the promise of translational precision medicine for SCI/D. However, the VA-GMSCIC does not have dedicated funding to support modern big-data infrastructure for data integration, analysis and visualization. The proposed project will address this gap to deliver much-needed data science tools through an NHP Data Commons in collaboration with the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) to create open-source software for the data commons, an NHP ontology built on top of the NIF-Standard Ontology (NIFSTD), and a data analysis and visualization services. NIF is an NIH-Blueprint funded initiative that maintains the largest federated repository of neuroscience data, biomedical resources and neuroscience ontologies on the web. Our data-science team is uniquely-positioned to develop the proposed big-data-to-knowledge pipeline for SCI/D. Over the past 5 years we built the first multicenter, multispecies data repository for SCI/D, known as VISION-SCI (housing data on N>3500 SCI/D animals tracked on >20,000 variables). In the process of building VISION-SCI we developed tools and workflows for large-scale data curation, federated database systems, and cutting edge machine learning analytics for SCI/D discovery in mice, rats, monkeys and de-identified human clinical data. This prior work demonstrates proof-of-concept that a translational SCI/D data commons can deliver new discoveries about the nature of plasticity and recovery, as well as cross-species translation. For the proposed Aims we will apply these lessons to integrate VA-GMSCIC data by: establishing a secure NHP federated data commons (Aim 1), and then populating this data commons with: robotic rehabilitation data (Aim 2), open-field behavioral data (Aim 3), and imaging data including in vivo MRI data and postmortem microscopic studies (Aim 4). All of these data elements are currently collected on each NHP, however the data are stored in fragmented data systems ranging from siloed databases maintained by the individual collaborators to individual flat files and images. We will establish a dedicated data processing pipeline that will integrate these data for rapid decision- support in ongoing therapeutic development trials; novel data-driven-discovery; machine learning-based hypothesis generation; and confirmatory hypothesis testing. The NHP Data Commons will leverage existing data to support the past, present and future VA-GMSCIC rehabilitation and regeneration therapeutic studies and extend them with cutting-edge analytics. This represents a modern big-data approach to translation and will ensure that the existing VA investment in data collection is leveraged to the maximal extent through digital technologies for enduring knowledge-discovery from this valuable NHP model of SCI/D."
"9313143","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Like other areas of the nervous system, the retina is subject to many acquired and inherited neuronal degenerative diseases. Since the retina provides the input for all visual sensory information to the brain, the loss of cells results in viual impairment and potentially complete blindness. Many retinal degenerative diseases affect only a subset of the retinal cells, although, frequently in more advanced disease, loss and reorganization of the entire retina can occur. In mammals, there is very limited regeneration of the degenerated cells; however, in fish, new neurons of all types regenerate from M¿ller glia following retinal damage and they are functionally integrated into the existing circuitry. Nevertheless, M¿ller glia, the cellular source for regeneration, is present in all vertebrate retins. In the proposal we submitted three years ago, we hypothesized that regeneration from mammalian M¿ller glia was limited because they fail to express a key proneural transcription factor, Ascl1, after injury. We proposed to test this hypothesis by virally-mediated expression of Ascl1 in mouse M¿ller glia. In the two years of funding, we have tested the hypothesis, and found that viral expression of Ascl1 is sufficient to activate a neurogenic program in mouse M¿ller glia, both in dissociated cultures and in the intact retina. The reprogrammed M¿ller glia generates cells that resemble neurons in morphology, gene expression and their responses to neurotransmitters. In the next funding period, we propose to further optimize this reprogramming process, using other transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers, and then to test whether Ascl1-reprogrammed Muller glia can provide a source for regeneration in vivo in a newly developed line of transgenic mice."
"9322377","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks renewal of funding to cover travel costs to allow the attendance of from 8-12 trainees and new investigators from the USA at the annual International Federation of Placenta Associations (IFPA) meetings together with funding to support the travel costs of a senior US-based investigator to these meetings where he/she will present an invited plenary lecture and take part in workshop sessions. The many physiologic roles fulfilled by the human placenta in support of fetal growth and development means that placental research is truly multidisciplinary and meetings of the placental research community bring together clinicians and basic scientists of various specializations. Often these are individuals whose primary focus is not the placenta but who recognize that their talents can be brought to bear on investigations in this most multifaceted area. The highly successful annual IFPA meeting has served to bring together clinicians and scientists, established senior and junior beginning investigators from around the world, to report and discuss their findings in an atmosphere conducive to frank yet amicable exchange. Meetings are scheduled in September/October of each year in Paris, France (2014), Brisbane, Australia (2015), San Antonio, USA (2016), Manchester, UK (2017), Japan (2018) and the Americas (2019). The meeting duration is 3 - 3 1/2 days with up to eight plenary sessions addressing specific aspects of placental function. The main speaker in each plenary gives a state of the art presentation and is not necessarily a placental biologist. Plenary sessions are accompanied by a corresponding interactive 2-hour workshop session addressing controversial questions. At least two 3-hour poster discussion sessions are scheduled and posters are displayed for the entire meeting to allow time for in- depth discussion of work particularly of new investigators. Oral sessions for new investigators and trainees are scheduled with the best abstracts selected for these by the program committee. Prizes are awarded for the best oral presentation and best poster presentations by trainees or new investigators. Trainees and new investigators will be selected based on competitive review of submitted first author abstracts for award of travel funds. The US-based senior investigator will be selected by the meeting organizer and PI of this proposal. There is always a high proportion (up to 60%) of women attendees, speakers and session chairs at IFPA meetings ensuring adequate representation. In the previous 9 years this conference grant has supported 74 young investigators of whom 49 were female and 21 minorities. The vast majority are still engaged in the field."
"9381072","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Alice Berger is a postdoctoral research fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Matthew Meyerson at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Broad Institute. Her long-term career goal, in alignment with the mission of the NCI, is to reduce cancer-associated mortality and suffering by determining mechanisms of cancer development and identifying attractive therapeutic targets. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Berger uniquely leverages both genomics and cell biological methods to answer fundamental questions relating to cancer biology. Recently, Dr. Berger identified somatic mutations in the small GTPase gene, RIT1, in lung adenocarcinoma, one of the most prevalent and deadly cancer types in both men and women. The proposed research will test whether RIT1 mutations are required for tumor initiation and/or maintenance and will determine the critical effectors of RIT1 function in lung epithelial cells. The first aim will test the hypothesis that RIT1 is an initiating event in lung adenocarcinoma by generating a lung-specific, inducible mouse model of RIT1 mutation. To determine the mechanism of action of RIT1, the second aim will utilize unbiased quantitative proteomics and expression profiling to identify proteins/genes interacting with or regulated by RIT1 in lung epithelial cells. The third aim will determine genetic dependencies of RIT1-mutant cells using shRNA and CRISPR-mediated loss- of-function genetic experiments in tractable cellular models. Together, these studies will determine if RIT1 itself or any of its downstream effectors represent promising targets for therapeutic development in lung adenocarcinoma. The mentored phase of this award will involve establishment and analysis of in vivo and cellular models while the applicant simultaneously enhances her career development through focused biostatistics and leadership training. During the independent phase, candidate RIT1 effectors will be validated in vitro and in vivo, and the results used to apply for continued independent funding. The outstanding research environment and facilities available to Dr. Berger include laboratory space and full institutional access at both Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Broad Institute. Dr. Berger's research and training will be additionally enhanced by collaborations with established experts in mouse pathology, mouse modeling, and proteomics, as well as by mentoring from an advisory committee of leading cancer biologists including Dr. William Hahn, Dr. Todd Golub, Dr. Peter Hammerman, and Dr. Edward Harlow."
"9385610","Project Summary Sleep disorders affect millions of people and can be co-morbid with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition to the iconic motor impairments of PD, sleep disorders, including excessive sleepiness, plague many individuals with PD and significantly reduce their quality of life. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying excessive sleepiness in PD remain to be elucidated. Although degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) is considered the primary neuropathology of PD responsible for the disease's motor impairments, these neurons do not mediate sleep- wake cycles. An understudied population of DA neurons in the ventral periaqueductal gray (vPAG) promote wakefulness, and although these DA neurons do not degenerate in PD, dysfunction of these neurons may occur in PD due to reduced noradrenergic input. Indeed, catastrophic loss of noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons occurs in PD and actually precedes the death of SN neurons, the LC promotes arousal and its activity tracks with sleep-wake cycles, and the LC projects to the vPAG. Therefore, I hypothesize that dysfunction of an LC-vPAG arousal circuit underlies excessive sleepiness in PD. To test this hypothesis, this project will utilize in vitro electrophysiology, behavioral assays of arousal, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), and site-specific behavioral pharmacology in genetically engineered mice. Aim 1 will determine whether suppression of LC transmission in the vPAG decreases arousal, Aim 2 will test whether direct activation of vPAG DA neurons increases arousal, and Aim 3 will determine the neurophysiology and pharmacology mediating the LC-vPAG arousal circuit. These experiments will investigate the role of this novel LC-vPAG circuit in arousal and how dysfunctions of this circuit may underlie the excessive sleepiness that occurs in PD and other sleep disorders."

"9114896","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Background/rationale: Tremor is the second most common complaint in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) after slowness, as it is bothersome to patients and interferes with many hand functions (e.g. eating, buttoning, zipping, shaving, typing, handling pills, tying shoelace, and brushing teeth). Muscle weakness is also a consequence of slowness and contributes to impaired fine movements and manual dexterity. Patients with pronounced tremor are disabled by the tremor itself and may suffer from social isolation that further decreases quality of life. Postural tremor can limit activities of daily living (ADL). Pronounced tremor can impair fine motor dexterity as well as job performance. In such cases, the tremor results in handicap and disability. Previous evidence demonstrated that resistance training significantly reduced motor unit firing rate variability, reduced upper limb coactivation, improved digit force steadiness, and improved intra- and intermuscular coordination, factors which could improve tremor and movement control in persons with neurological conditions. There has been no study on a rehabilitation intervention for impaired hand dexterity and tremor in PD. Project objectives: In this project, the investigators (Dr. Bryant and her research team) will study the effect of progressive resistance exercise of hand and arm (HREX) on hand dexterity and tremor in patients with PD. The specific purposes of this proposal are to: 1) Estimate the efficacy of HREX to improve hand dexterity, and strength; 2) Estimate the efficacy of HREX in reducing tremor and bradykinesia; and 3) Estimate the efficacy of HREX to reduce motor impairments from PD and ADL. Project methods: This study is a randomized wait-list controlled design using 6 weeks of HREX, as a home-based program. 62 Veterans with a diagnosis of PD will be recruited and randomized into wait-list control (WAIT) and exercise (HREX) groups. Subjects will use a dumbbell, a hand grip, and hand therapy putty to exercise at home. Volume of exercise (sets and repetitions) will be increased to gradually progress the exercises during the 6 weeks. The subjects will be asked to do the exercise 3 times a week on 3 different days, with at least 24- hour intervals between sessions. The WAIT group will start their exercise at the end of a 6- week waiting period. Measures to evaluate the efficacy are tremor amplitude, finger tapping test, Purdue pegboard test, electromyography (EMG), tremor clinical rating score, grip strength, motor and activity of daily living (ADL) scores. Long-term objectives: If efficacy of the resistanc exercise is demonstrated, the team will develop a larger multi-center proposal to implement this intervention in clinical care to benefit Veterans suffering from PD. The home-based, strengthening exercise program can be used as an adjunct to medical treatment in Veterans with PD."
"9137334","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Female sex workers (FSWs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are disproportionately affected by HIV and play a key role in ongoing transmission dynamics in the region. Gender based violence (GBV) may promote in HIV acquisition and transmission among FSWs and their sexual partners. Past studies have established the negative effect of GBV on sexual risk behaviors among FSWs in SSA. Our study addresses the limited knowledge regarding the effect of GBV on utilization of HIV care and treatment services among HIV-infected FSWs, and how social cohesion may influence this relationship. These behaviors are necessary for ensuring the health and wellbeing of the HIV infected individual, and reducing the risk of transmission to an HIV uninfected partner. Through a sample of HIV-infected FSWs from Iringa, Tanzania, the purpose of the proposed research is to investigate the relationship between GBV, social cohesion and engagement in HIV care among this population. Specifically, this study aims to assess the relationship between GBV and engagement in HIV care, and explore how social cohesion may modify this relationship. The proposed research will use quantitative baseline survey data from a parent NIMH/NIAID-sponsored community-based combination prevention study among FSWs. We will also conduct qualitative in-depth interviews to explore the perspectives and experiences of HIV-infected FSWs who have experienced GBV regarding the role social cohesion plays in access and retention in HIV care and treatment. Finally, through a parallel mixed methods design, we will assess how the quantitative and qualitative results converge in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role social cohesion plays in HIV service utilization among HIV-infected FSWs who have experienced GBV. The proposed research offers an opportunity to work with a strong mentorship team, comprised of faculty members who are leaders in their fields, to build skills in advanced data analysis, social theory and mixed methods, while simultaneously addressing NIMH's HIV research priorities and strategic goals. Findings will advance knowledge regarding the role of GBV in engagement in HIV care among FSWs and ultimately inform the development of integrated GBV and HIV treatment interventions among FSWs in SSA and globally."

"9177771","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence in the last decade implicates cerebral microvasculature abnormalities in the genesis of AD neuropathology. Additional literature shows that the EphB4/ephrinB2 system is an important regulator of the development and function of the vascular system. Binding of the extracellular sequence of EphB4 receptor to its transmembrane ligand ephrinB2 protein on the surface of endothelial cells of blood vessels, stimulates angiogenesis and growth of new vessels from existing vasculature. Furthermore, in vitro assays show that treatment of ephrinB2expressing endothelial cells with the extracellular domain of EphB4 stimulates cell sprouting and tube formation, processes considered crucial initial steps in angiogenesis, while transgenic mouse experiments indicate that the intracellular (cytoplasmic) domain of ephrinB2 protein is necessary for ephrinB2-dependent angiogenesis.  We found that EphB4 stimulates the metalloproteinase (MP) and PS/?-secretase processing of ephrinB2 producing cytosolic peptide ephrinB2/CTF2 and that the EphB4-induced sprouting and tube formation of endothelial cells depends on ?-secretase activity. These observations raise the possibility that the endothelial EphB4/ephrinB2 system regulates angiogenesis through PS/?-secretase. In support of this hypothesis, we obtained data that peptide ephrinB2/CTF2 stimulates sprouting of endothelial cells in vitro. Recent literature shows that a crucial step in angiogenic factor-induced angiogenesis is formation of complexes between Raf1/ Rok-? and Vascular Endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and we made the novel observation (preliminary data) that treatment of endothelial cell cultures with EphB4 increases these angiogenic complexes. Together, our observations suggest that PS1/?-secretase may affect angiogenesis by regulating processing of transmembrane protein ephrinB2, a critical step in EphB4-induced angiogenesis. Here we propose to explore the mechanisms via which the EphB4/ephrinB2 and PS1/?-secretase systems interact to promote endothelial cell sprouting and angiogenesis and to examine whether any of these mechanisms are altered in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. Furthermore, we and others reported that PS1 familial AD (FAD) mutations may affect the epsilon (?) cleavage of PS1/?-secretase substrates thus decreasing production of CTF2 peptides including ephrinB2/CTF2 (see Significance). Thus, we will ask whether PS1 FAD mutants alter the EphB4/ephrinB2-dependent angiogenesis."
"9185321","Project Summary We use color to help identify and select objects (e.g., pick the ripest fruit, find our car in a large parking lot). For color to be useful in this way requires that it support selections that correlate well with object-intrinsic surface reflectance. This is not trivial, because the spectrum of the light reflected from an object confounds surface reflectance and illumination. The illumination dependence leads to ambiguity: changes in the spectrum of the reflected light can arise from changes in object reflectance, changes in illumination, or both. Ambiguity of the general sort that underlies object color perception is also characteristic of other aspects of perception, as well as of higher levels of language and cognitive processing. Studying object color provides a model system for making advances that may have applicability beyond the immediate content domain of color. Human color vision is thought to exhibit considerable color constancy. Classically, this is conceived of as the partial stabilization of object color appearance across changes in illumination. In quantitative appearance-based studies of constancy, observers typically adjust the color of one stimulus so that its appearance matches that of another, across a change of illumination. The study of color appearance provides the foundation for the field's current understanding of constancy. Despite the value and intrinsic interest of appearance measurements, however, it is critical to recognize that characterizing the stability of color appearance does not directly tell us how color supports selection: an object could look different across a change in illumination without the difference impairing accurate selection. This would, for example, be the case if a person also perceived the illumination and combined information about the illuminant with object color appearance, perhaps similarly to the way in which we can recognize a bicycle across changes of pose while still apprehending that it looks different in each pose. Understanding constancy requires going beyond appearance and measuring directly how color is used to select objects. The proposed experiments will measure color- based selection across changes of illumination in naturalistic tasks and i) test whether performance is predicted by the visual system's stabilization of color appearance; ii) measure the relative weight placed on color for object selection when other cues are available, and test whether this weight is adjusted dynamically according to the relative quality of the color information; and iii) measure learning in response to feedback provided during color-based selection, and test the generality of this learning."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In May 2005, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) established the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) to support multi-institutional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies in critically ill children, and the network was competitively renewed in 2009. The CPCCRN currently consists of seven core Clinical Centers, and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Since it was established nine years ago, the CPCCRN and its investigators have considered 61 research concepts, created a network registry, implemented 23 studies (including the NHLBI-funded Therapeutic Hypothermia after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest (THAPCA) Trials), published 39 peer-reviewed publications, and produced seven public use datasets that are freely available to enable research by additional investigators. Going forward, in addition to the network registry and the THAPCA Trials, CPCCRN has five on-going studies that are anticipated to continue through at least early 2016. These include observational studies of the complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and hemodynamic analyses of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the intensive care unit, a pharmacometric evaluation of antibiotics during ECMO, and two R01-funded sepsis studies.  The University of Utah has been the DCC since network inception, and proposes to continue in this role during the next five years.

"9188467","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic hemolytic disorder characterized by recurrent vaso-occlusive episodes (VOC) and progressive organ damage. It strikes at a young age, with a clinical course punctuated by painful disabling crises, yet treatment options are few. Once patients develop VOC, intervention is limited to pain alleviation; no therapy is currently available to alter the course of VOC. Therefore, efforts are needed to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions and determine the potential impact. My research efforts have focused on pediatric and adult patients with SCD, with a specific goal of measuring coagulation by innovative technologies and determining potential therapeutic options. I recently completed a small pilot study evaluating prophylactic dose anticoagulation for patients with SCD admitted for VOC. I found a greater absolute decrease in pain scores and shorter time on patient controlled analgesia, both arguing for further investigations. I now have positioned myself to examine the effect of an oral factor Xa inhibitor administered daily to decrease chronic daily pain and hypercoagulability. Outcomes will include daily pain scores, patient reported outcomes and hypercoagulable markers. To provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of pain in patients with SCD, I will use Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), a computerized adaptive questionnaire, to evaluate fatigue, physical function and pain impact. Pain scores will be recorded through the Sickle cell Mobile Application to Record symptoms via Technology (SMART) app. The SMART app was developed by my research group to track symptoms and improve medication adherence. To allow successful completion of the study, I have established solid mentorship with the leaders in coagulation and SCD, in addition to assembling a scientific advisory board to promote further expertise and insight. I will also pursue completion of coursework required to obtain a Masters in Clinical Research, to strengthen my background in clinical research methodology. Support from this award will provide the opportunity for me to gain the necessary experience, didactic training, and mentorship to become a successful and independent researcher in hematology. Importantly, it will also build a framework for my long-term career in academic medicine; performing innovative research evaluating novel therapeutic agents in patients with SCD."
"9188825","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is in response to PAR-13-382, supporting secondary data analyses of existing large genomic datasets for the purpose of identifying gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions. Lung function and its decline in older adulthood is likely the result of genetic and environmental influences. Cigarette smoking is a key environmental context for loss of lung function over time. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 26 genetic loci associated with cross-sectional spirometric measures of lung function. Recent GWAS of the longitudinal change in lung function have identified additional novel loci. To date, there is only one published genome-wide study of GxE interaction on lung function that considers smoking as the environment of interest. This genome-wide GxE study used common variation and cross-sectional information on lung function and smoking to identify three novel loci not previously associated with lung function. In aggregate, these published studies made important contributions to understanding the etiology of lung function, and were facilitated by the organizational structure and support of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the CHARGE Pulmonary Working Group. Additional investigation is warranted to further understand how smoking interacts with genetic factors to influence lung function.  The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the complex interplay of genes and environment underlying lung function using state-of-the-art statistical methods and analysis strategies that leverage available data resources. Ongoing work within the CHARGE Pulmonary Working Group includes analysis of data from the Illumina HumanExome BeadChip (the exome chip) for ~33,800 individuals of European ancestry with spirometric measures of lung function, all of whom also have longitudinal measures of smoking history and lung function. An additional ~6,000 individuals of African ancestry have measures of lung function, smoking history, and exome chip data, and ~3,800 also have longitudinal measures. Spirometric measures include forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and their ratio (FEV1/FVC). These measures of lung function are important clinical tools for diagnosing pulmonary disease, classifying its severity, and evaluating its progression over time.  The large volume of phenotype and exome chip data available within the CHARGE consortium provides a unique, cost-effective opportunity to apply new analytical approaches and methods. This application has two novel aspects: 1) investigation of rare variation and environmental interactions, and 2) investigation of longitudinal measures of environmental factors. The proposed research represents the next step in the efforts to investigate the interplay of genetic variation and environmental factors influencing lung function. Results from this study may disclose novel genetic susceptibilities to smoking exposure or a greater understanding of the role of smoking in the development, progression, and severity of declining lung function."
"9193656","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To avoid post-operative language impairments after surgery for drug-resistant epilepsy, clinicians rely primarily on electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM), but this can trigger afterdischarges, clinical seizures, or cause uncomfortable sensations, all of which can prevent mapping in some areas. Moreover, ESM can be very time- consuming and the resulting impairment is usually all-or-none, complicating its interpretation. These practical limitations have long motivated passive electrocorticography (ECoG) as an alternative, or complementary, functional mapping technique that can map function at all sites simultaneously, resulting in significant time savings without adverse side-effects. Recent technical developments also permit ECoG functional mapping to be performed online during testing, but the correspondence between these results and ESM has not been as good for language mapping as it has been for motor mapping. This may be, in part, because even simple language tasks such as object naming or word reading require the recruitment and interaction of widely distributed and potentially redundant cortical areas responsible for different stages of cognitive processing, and because there is no a priori threshold for a magnitude of activation critically important for task performance.. Our overall hypothesis is that the functional importance of a cortical site depends on its role in task-related network dynamics, i.e. the propagation of activation between distributed cortical regions performing the distinct cognitive operations necessary for successful task performance. In this project we will study the task-related network dynamics of spoken word production in order to improve the accuracy of ECoG language maps and to better understand the relationship between ECoG and ESM language maps. First, we will use ECoG to capture the fine temporal dynamics of network propagation during a series of simple word production tasks. We will decompose these network dynamics into temporally cascaded subnets corresponding to functional-anatomical modules responsible for each task's constitutive cognitive operations. In addition, we will identify high centrality noes that serve as hubs facilitating propagation across subnets. Second, we will test these ECoG models of task-specific network dynamics by temporarily deactivating the hubs of high efficiency pathways linking subnets. We will test the effect of this deactivation on verbal latency and accuracy using much briefer (200- 400 ms) stimulation trains than those used during routine clinical ESM (2-5 seconds). This will also test the feasibility of performing ESM with a lower risk of afterdischarges and seizures, and with greater functional specificity. Third, we will compare both ECoG network mapping and ESM to ground-truth post-operative language outcomes in order to comparatively assess their predictive abilities. Although the immediate goal of these studies is to gain deeper insights into the cortical network dynamics of spoken word production and how they are affected by ESM, these studies will exert their most profound and lasting impact by improving the clinical utility of ECoG for both extraoperative and intraoperative functional mapping prior to respective surgery."
"9212860","ABSTRACT Malaria remains one of the most devastating infectious diseases. It kills over a million people every year while causing immense suffering and economic losses worldwide. Whereas much progress has been made in understanding the life cycle of the parasite in the human host and in the mosquito vector, significant gaps of knowledge remain. Fertilization of malaria parasites is a poorly understood process that takes place in the lumen of the mosquito gut. This process is important because survival in nature is completely dependent on the ability of the parasite to undergo sexual reproduction. The proposed research aims to identify molecular interactions that take place during fertilization of malaria parasites. This project is based on an unorthodox approach (identification of peptides that bind to the gamete surface) made possible by the recent development of an important tool, a transgenic parasite that produces red-fluorescent female gametes and green-fluorescent male gametes. Pure populations of malaria female and male gametes from this transgenic parasite were isolated by cell sorting and then used to screen a phage display library for peptides that recognize molecules on the gamete surfaces. A peptide (FG1) that binds to female gametes and another peptide (MG1) that binds to male gametes were identified. Importantly, when added to a malaria infectious blood meal, each of these peptides blocked parasite fertilization, suggesting that the peptides bound to a receptor and prevented its interaction with a ligand on the gamete of the opposite sex. Our working hypothesis is that the peptide structurally mimics the gamete ligand and that peptide and ligand compete for binding to the corresponding receptor. This proposal lays out a research plan to identify the receptor to which the FG1 and MG1 peptides bind and the ligands on the gametes of the opposite sex that the two peptides structurally mimic. An additional aim is to characterize the proteome on the surface of female gametes before and after fertilization, to gain insights on additional proteins involved in fertilization and possible block to polyspermy. Elucidation of mechanisms of fertilization is important not only for understanding the basic biology of malaria and other parasitic diseases but could also lead to the identification of new targets for blocking transmission and the spread of disease. Moreover, should the mechanisms be conserved, our findings could be extended to the biology of fertilization of higher organisms."
"9216965","Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the ?different from normal? cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication."
"9219126","When two influenza A viruses (IAVs) co-infect the same cell, exchange of gene segments through reassortment gives rise to up to 256 different viral variants. This process has the potential to bring together viral genes that have evolved in distinct host species, which in turn can facilitate zoonotic transfer. In a host infected with a single virus population, reassortment can furthermore couple beneficial mutations or purge deleterious ones, thereby accelerating viral evolution. Using a unique experimental system that allows direct quantification of reassortment, we have shown that this process of genetic exchange is highly efficient in cell culture and in a guinea pig host. Indeed, the prevalence of reassortant viruses shed from co-infected guinea pigs (up to 75%) suggests that reassortment is a routine feature of IAV infections in nature. IAVs circulate in a wide range of avian and mammalian species, however, and it remains unclear whether our findings in guinea pigs would extend to these natural hosts. We therefore propose to evaluate the efficiency of reassortment in pigs, mallards, quail and chickens. Ferrets and guinea pigs will also be included as models of human IAV infection. By comparing results among species we will not only gain important insight into the incidence of reassortment in natural hosts, but also test the hypothesis that the efficiency of reassortment varies among host species. To investigate the mechanisms determining IAV reassortment efficiency in vivo, we will use immunohistochemistry to track the spread of co-infecting viruses over a time course after inoculation. We hypothesize that reassortment is favored by focal spread within target tissues, creating local areas where cells are infected at high multiplicity. Finally, since our work in cell culture has revealed that viral genomes lacking one or more segments markedly enhance the frequency of reassortment, we will test whether the prevalence of incomplete viral genomes varies with host species. Our preliminary data strongly suggest that missing segments are lost, not during virion assembly, but rather after genomes are delivered to a new target cell. The likelihood of segments reaching the site of replication furthermore appears to depend on the species from which the target cell is derived. Thus, we propose that reassortment levels may be host dependent in part due to differing frequencies of incomplete viral genomes and will test this novel concept through experimentation both in cell culture and in animal models. Overall, the research proposed will deepen mechanistic understanding of IAV reassortment, a critical process in the diversification, evolution and emergence of novel influenza A viruses."
"9220166","Project Summary Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy give new hope to patients suffering from drug-resistant infectious organisms such as Aspergillus, Candida, or Mucor. This is the first time that a pattern-recognition receptor (Dectin-1) has been adapted to redirect T-cell specificity to control fungal infection. Dectin-1 CAR (D-CAR) can activate the cytolytic machinery, and likely the perforin/granzyme and granulysin pathway, of genetically modified T-cells. The production of IFN-? from the D-CAR+ T-cells may further augment innate immunity to invasive fungal infections if recombinant IFN-? is administered pharmacologically or derived from CD4+ helper T-cells or natural killer cells. In the R21 phase, 2 major factors that limit immediate clinical applications of CAR T-cell therapy will be addressed: (1) generation of rapidly proliferative ?-glucan-specific D-CAR+ T-cells and (2) long-term in vivo persistence to control invasive fungal infection. Several types of CARs are currently used in clinical trials to control B-cell malignancy. Because it is not yet apparent which CAR design provides fully competent T-cell activation for a given patient, we have developed an approach for screening multiple CAR molecules. Our team has developed the EZ-CAR platform for generating multiple CARs by mixing and matching components derived from known T-cell activating receptors while keeping the targeting domain intact. Using this approach, we will generate about 21 D-CARs with the Dectin-1 fungal targeting domain. Rapid production (within 10 days of PBMC collection from donor) may improve the therapeutic potential of the manufactured T-cells because it avoids the replication-mediated T-cell senescence and terminal differentiation that is associated with loss of in vivo persistence. In the R33 phase, the study will be expanded to target a wide variety of clinically important opportunistic molds (Mucor, Scedosporium) and yeasts (Candida). Drug-resistant isolates identified in MD Anderson clinical laboratories will be used for validating the therapeutic efficacy of the D-CAR+ T cells. In some fungi, such as Rhizopus (Mucorales family), the ?-glucan layer is masked by the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) layer. D-CAR+ T- cell therapy will be used in combination with fungal cell wall biosynthesis inhibitors such as caspofungin to disrupt the glycosaminoglycans layer, which will allow better recognition and activation of the D-CAR+ T-cell therapy. In summary, patients suffering from invasive fungal infections due to primary immunodeficiencies such as genetic mutations and secondary immunodeficiencies such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, cancer, and transplantation are highly likely to benefit from immune adjuvant therapy. Development of single-engineered T- cells that can target various pathogens, such as D-CAR+ T-cells cells, which redirect T-cell specificity to Aspergillus, Candida, and Mucor species, is highly warranted to combat invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients."
"9221932","A compelling need exists to find more efficacious medicines with which to treat Chagas? Disease, especially the chronic stages for which there is no effective treatment. Chagas? Disease is caused by a parasitic trypanosome that afflicts millions in the tropical Americas and more than 300,000 in the US. Moreover, with climate change there are changing patterns of parasitic diseases such as Chagas? Disease, and this is certain to affect an increasing number of American citizens in the future. Our laboratories have discovered an exquisitely potent anti-Chagas agent from a marine cyanobacterium that targets the unique protease of this parasite, namely ?cruzain?. Cruzain represents a chemically and genetically validated target within this parasite. Moreover, this natural product as well as synthetic analogs have the ability to clear myoblast cells of infection with no significant host cell cytotoxicity. In this application we plan to advance this drug class to meet this unmet medical need in eukaryotic parasitic diseases, and this will be accomplished in two phases. Three specific aims in the R21 phase will allow synthesis and re-synthesis of several gallinamide A analogs designed previously from a modeling study, establish critical initial PK parameters and allow proof of concept efficacy testing. We have developed an effective synthetic route for this compound as well as 16 analogs based on extensive optimization of two published synthetic routes, insuring an adequate supply of the compounds. This is a rare starting point for a drug development effort in which a natural product can be sustainably produced and the molecular target in the parasite is known. In the R33 phase, we will further explore a second generation of model-inspired gallinamide A analogs through chemical synthesis, expand our evaluation of their ADME, PK, MTD and efficacy evaluations, and then test our best lead compounds in a chronic curative mouse model. A set of clear metrics have been devised by which to evaluate progress and success in both the R21 and R33 phases of the project. At the conclusion of this project, we anticipate delivery of a late stage preclinical lead for the treatment of Chagas? Disease which will have a robust profile of chemical, biochemical, pharmaceutical and efficacy information."
"9222315","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The development of drugs for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) suffers from a critical gap in the discovery process, wherein drugs screened in vitro rarely progress to the preclinical phase. While academic research laboratories often discover new compounds effective in vitro, development organizations are reluctant to perform the pre-clinical research until lead compounds show proven activity in appropriate animal models.  We propose to fill this gap for three NTDs: cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and Chagas disease by contributing new, high quality chemical matter to the candidate-seeking pipeline. This will be accomplished by producing compounds that are effective in the in vivo models of the diseases and that meet target-product profiles as described by the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi). We have produced hundreds of compounds that have been tested against T. cruzi (n=312) and Leishmania major (n=420), and have identified 83 anti-chagasic compounds (EC50 ? 5 µM), 127 L. major inhibitors (EC50 ? 5 µM), and 53 inhibitors with potent activity against both pathogens. The key limitations of these compounds are in their metabolic and physical properties: limited solubility, high clearance, and high plasma protein binding. We also have in vitro data against only one species of Leishmania (L. major, which causes CL).  To address these limitations we propose in the R21 phase of this project to prioritize the compounds and to identify key weaknesses that can be addressed by systematic medicinal chemistry in the R33 phase. The prioritization will require completion of in vitro L. donovani assays (of relevance to VL), and prioritization of compounds for mouse pharmacokinetic (PK) experiments. Once compounds with acceptable potency and PK properties are identified from the existing set of analogs, prioritized compounds will be advanced to assessment in mouse infection models of all three diseases. Those compounds that show efficacy in animal models of infection will be profiled in toxicity assays (human kinase, GPCR, ion channel activity, genotoxicity), completing a data package that will drive the later medicinal chemistry optimization program.  In order to transition to the R33 phase, we will have minimally identified at least two compounds that meet the defined lead criteria for at least one pathogen assessed, with key issues identified for optimization in the R33 phase of the project. This phase of the project will be focused on lead-to-preclinical candidate medicinal chemistry optimization in order to achieve the targeted properties for further advancement. In order to accomplish these goals, we will employ a unique combination of academic, government, and industry collaborators. By the end of the R33 phase, we will deliver compounds that effect parasitological cure in animal models of Chagas disease, VL, and/or CL using the dosing paradigm and endpoints required by DNDi. With NIAID Therapeutic Development Services, we will round out the necessary data package for a candidate compound and one backup compound in order to either make a go/no-go decision for continued advancement towards clinical trials."
"9224358","PROJECT SUMMARY The Role of the FOXO Pathway in the Control of Transposons in Aging  Understanding aging and the processes that effect lifespan at the molecular level remains an important problem in modern biology and medicine. The Forkhead-box, family O (FOXO) transcription factors have been identified as factors that can extend lifespan and stave off aging in a number of model systems including worms, flies and mice. In general, increasing FOXO activity increases lifespan in these models. FOXO activity can be increased by overexpressing FOXO or by downregulating the insulin signaling pathway, a major negative regulator of FOXO. Complementing the findings in model organisms, SNPs associated with longevity in humans have been identified in the FOXO1, FOXO3 and components of the insulin signaling pathway in multiple cohorts. This strongly suggests that the FOXO pathway influences lifespan in humans as well. Therefore, an important goal is to identify the molecular targets and pathways controlled by FOXO transcription factors to better understand the multiple mechanisms that influence aging. Mammals have four FOXO genes (FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6) with some division of labor between the four factors often complicating interpretation of experiments. Invertebrates each have a single FOXO gene, daf-16 in C. elegans and foxo in Drosophila. Given the conserved role in affecting lifespan, the simple invertebrate system offers a powerful tool to understand the FOXO regulon in molecular detail.  FOXO factors are typically regulated as downstream components of insulin and insulin-like factor signaling. Because of this, much attention has been paid to the role of FOXO on metabolic influences driving aging. However, there are certainly other drivers of aging in addition to the metabolic. One area that is underexplored is FOXO's role in the maintenance of genome integrity as factor increasing longevity.  Genome integrity decreases with age and it has been argued that this may be a driver of ageing phenotypes in somatic cells. While genome integrity is controlled by multiple mechanisms there is a growing appreciation that transposon activation occurs as a function of age and may be a driver of genome integrity loss. This age related transposon activation has been observed in both Drosophila and mammals. In Drosophila transposon mobilization has been shown to lead to neurodegeneration and increase mortality.  We recently identified the small RNA pathways as downstream direct targets of foxo in Drosophila. We also identified a physiological role for this control in viral innate immunity through the siRNA pathway. Increasing foxo activity led to an increase in the efficacy of the RNAi response. This effect both increased post- transcriptional silencing of endogenous loci and led to viral clearance in infected cells. This is the first pathway identified that can modulate RNA interference in somatic cells. Although viral resistance could be one of the ways foxo enhances lifespan this would require an acute encounter with an RNA virus and would not be a generalizable effect. However, the siRNA pathway is also known to control transposons in somatic cells. This role could potentially provide a broader effect on lifespan as transposon mobilization has been identified as increasing with age, and has been shown to be a potential cause of shortened lifespan.  We are seeking to extend these findings in a new direction. We hypothesize that foxo regulates the small RNA pathways and aids in the prevention of transposon mobilization and thus helps to protect genome integrity leading to increased lifespan. In order to begin to test this hypothesis we propose to determine the role of foxo in transposon regulation as a function of age using our Drosophila model."
"9236992","Summary The intestinal mucosa serves as a barrier to infection from pathogens and normal gut flora. This barrier is defended by the mucosal immune system through a variety of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. However, mucosal immune responses must be tightly regulated to maintain tolerance to resident normal flora and food antigens. Because peripheral tolerance cannot be explained completely by immunological ignorance or negative selection in the thymus, various mechanisms have been proposed for how lamina propria macrophages (MPs) and dendritic cells (DCs) capture and present luminal antigen in the steady-state to promote intestinal homeostasis. Recently, we described a novel luminal antigen transport mechanism that we've termed goblet cell associated antigen passages (GAPs). The role of GAPs in peripheral tolerance vs. immunity is relatively unexplored, but GAPs deliver small soluble antigens preferentially to CD103+ DCs, which have tolerogenic potential. A key question is whether pathogen invasion mechanisms have evolved to target steady-state antigen acquisition pathways (e.g., GAPs) as a strategy to evade the acute immune response.  These studies will use a common and often deadly bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), to investigate how initial host-bacterial interactions (minutes to hours) affects mucosal immunity and link invasion pathways to downstream infection outcomes. Our hypothesis is that bacterial invasion via GAPs will lead to inefficient innate and adaptive immune responses and increase bacterial persistence in the host. This hypothesis will be tested in vivo using a murinized Lm strain (Lm InlAMt) mouse that can infect mice orally and complemented by studying Lm InlAWt infection in explanted human intestinal tissues. These studies build on important recent developments including the murinized Lm oral infection model, in vivo two-photon imaging of the intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes, the development of a human explant infection system and state-of- the-art RNA sequencing approaches to characterize epithelial responses. This work is conceptually innovative in that it examines the first few minutes of an infection, which is rarely studied in vivo and impractical to study in human patients, but which may ultimately determine infection outcomes."
"9226369","Abstract /Summary:  Streptococcus pneumoniae, a principal cause of pneumonia and otitis media, escapes from vaccine protection and antibiotic therapy by acquiring new genes through genetic transformation from other strains or species. Genetic transformation in S. pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is regulated by a quorum sensing system that induces the expression of its sole alternative sigma factor and master regulator of competence, SigX, as well as expression of a second regulator of competence, ComW. Together, the two proteins, SigX and ComW, direct transcription of numerous transformation-specific genes. SigX directly binds to core RNA polymerase, resulting in a transient and global shift in gene expression; however we have not yet been able to assign a direct function to ComW. Previous experimental data suggest that ComW may act at the point of sigma factor switching between SigA and SigX at the onset of competence. As the interplay between SigX and ComW represents a potentially unique sigma-factor switching mechanism and is required for genetic transformation, we aim to determine the role of ComW and to dissect the molecular interaction between ComX and ComW. Not only is the biochemical function of ComW currently unknown, but the lack of known homologs suggests a novel fold and mechanism of action. To study this system, we will take a biochemical and biophysical approach to characterize ComW both functionally and structurally, probe its interaction with SigX in vitro, and support our observations in vivo by genetic analysis directly in S. pneumoniae.  Medical Relevance. Most pathogenic streptococci of the mitis and anginosus groups share this mechanism of control of natural genetic transformation. Genetic transformation is an important path for genetic flexibility in pneumococcus, where it is documented as key to vaccine escape and creation and spread of drug-resistance genes. Because Streptococcus pneumoniae is a model organism for the study of DNA uptake, this work on the mechanism that connects quorum sensing to natural competence will have broad impact on understanding and targeting the many similar peptide signaling systems among Gram positive bacteria that are often associated with the ability of these bacteria to cause disease."
"9237079","The liver plays a central role in whole-body lipid metabolism by regulating the uptake, synthesis, oxidation and export of fatty acids (FAs) and lipids. Dysfunction of lipid metabolism in liver underlies the development of obesity, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cardiovascular disease. Although the mechanisms that regulate the hepatic uptake, activation, and metabolism of fatty acids (FAs) are not fully understood, nearly all pathways of FA metabolism require conversion of FAs to acyl-CoAs by acyl-CoA synthetases. Long chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) is a family of five enzymes (ACSL1, 3, 4, 5 and 6) that catalyze the formation of fatty acyl-CoAs from ATP, CoA, and long chain fatty acids. Within ACSL family members, ACSL4 has unique substrate specificity for arachidonic acid (AA) and hepatic ACSL4 has been demonstrated being abnormally expressed in pathological conditions including hepatocarcinoma and NAFLD. However, to date, no literature reports have clearly defined the specific roles played by ACSL4 in liver lipid metabolism under normal and disease state such as the benign form of NAFLD (steatosis) and the nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). During the last funding period, we have obtained two major findings related to the regulation of hepatic ACSL4. First, we demonstrated that expression and activity of hepatic ACSL4 are upregulated by activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?) in vivo and in vitro. Through conducting lipidomic studies we further demonstrated that depletion of ACSL4 in hepatic cells selectively reduced cellular contents of several PC species including PC(18:0/18:1), a critical lipid mediator in PPAR? signaling pathway. Second, we uncovered a novel substrate-induced posttranslational regulatory mechanism by which AA specifically downregulates ACSL4 protein abundance in hepatic cells by promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Since AA-derived eicosanoids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, the AA-induced ACSL4 degradation could be one contributing factor to the progression of hepatic steatosis to NASH with increased hepatic inflammation caused by imbalance between AA-CoA and unesterified AA that leads to increased production of AA-derived eicosanoids. Recently, through proteomic studies, we have identified the intracellular vesicular transport factor p115 as a major ACSL4 interacting protein and demonstrated that p115 interaction with ACSL4 is markedly enhanced by exposure of HepG2 cells to AA but not to other FAs. Since AA specifically induces ACSL4 degradation, our observations suggest that p115 might be a key mediator in the process of ACSL4 degradation through ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (UPP). The overall goals of this revised Merit Review Renewal are to fully characterize two new regulatory mechanisms that uniquely impact the expression and function of ACSL4 in liver tissue to reach a better understanding of its specific roles in hepatic lipid metabolism under healthy and pathophysiological conditions including hyperlipidemia and NAFLD. The specific aims of this Merit Review renewal application are to: 1) comprehensively define the metabolic functions of hepatic ACSL4 and its critical roles in PPAR? regulated lipid metabolism under normal and hyperlipidemic conditions in two complementary animal models with acute deletion and chronic deletion of ACSL4 in liver tissues and 2) utilize various molecular and biochemical approaches to characterize the ubiquitination motifs of ACSL4 protein and to define the functional roles of the newly identified ACSL4-interacting proteins including p115 and other three ACSL4 binding proteins in the degradation process of ACSL4 via UPP in response to treatment with AA in vitro and in vivo. The successful completion of our proposed studies is likely to identify novel targets that can be exploited in the development of new therapies to treat hyperlipidemia and steatosis in metabolic diseases such as obesity, NAFLD and cardiovascular disease."

"9237219","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The original Signal Transduction (ST) Program Area was established in 1997 to bring together researchers Studying a variety of signaling pathways, including pathways initiated by receptors and membrane-mediated events, heterotrimeric G-protein, small G-protein- and protein kinase-mediated intermediate signaling events, and distal transcription factor activation. The ST Program Area sponsored large symposia to promote discussion and to facilitate interaction among ST researchers. Research during this period led to the identification of molecular targets, which then led to the development of signal transduction inhibitors. Because of the translational potential of signal transduction research for cancer therapy, we wanted to create a platform where basic scientists could discuss their studies on signaling pathways with clinicians carrying out clinical trials of signal transduction inhibitors. To create this platform, the ST Program Area was reconfigured in 2007 as the Signal Transduction and Therapeutics (STT) Program Area. The new/revised STT Program Area includes both basic scientists and clinicians. Our aim is to have an easy, transparent transition from basic science to the clinic and from the clinic to basic science. During the current funding period, basic science and clinical activities in the STT Program Area have truly become integrated. Our members share a passion to promote new cancer therapies based on basic signal transduction observations.

"9238095","The central objective of this partnership between Emory and Eigen is to translate our PET/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy technology into a commercially supported platform for improving the detection of prostate cancer. It has been reported that the long-term prostate cancer specific survival of patients initially managed with active surveillance (AS) or watchful waiting for low-risk prostate cancer ranges from 97% to 100%. However, among all men with indolent prostate cancer, the rate of aggressive treatment is as high as 64.3%. The costs for the treatment are $12 billion each year in the USA. One reason for aggressive treatment is due to the fact that the current standard diagnosis with transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy can miss up to 30% of cancers. A major concern for active surveillance is the risk of high-grade cancer that may be missed by the current diagnosis. There are unmet clinical needs to develop innovative imaging technology that can improve the detection rate and distinguish aggressive cancer, which requires treatment, from the non-aggressive disease, which can be well-managed with active surveillance.  PET with new molecular imaging tracers has shown promising results for the detection of prostate cancer. For example, 68Ga-PSMA PET can detect lesions characteristic for prostate cancer at low prostate specific antigen level. In our preliminary study, 18F-FACBC PET showed higher focal uptake in tumor foci than in normal prostate; and the standard uptake value of FACBC significantly correlated with Gleason score. Hence, PET molecular information is useful to identify and target the suspicious high-risk cancer lesions for biopsy. For this purpose, we built a PET/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy system that is able to obtain 3D ultrasound data and fuse them with PET/CT images. As a result, a suspicious PET lesion is superimposed over the ultrasound data; and the fused image is then used to direct biopsy needles to targets. The PET/ultrasound targeted biopsy technology can be used to identify those AS patients who have high-risk cancers but are missed by standard TRUS-guided biopsy. We hypothesize that PET/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy can detect more clinically significant cancers than the standard transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy in AS patients. This partnership will focus on the technology development and translation. Advanced learning-based segmentation and deformable registration methods will be developed and integrated into Eigen's Artemis and ProFuse systems. The PET/ultrasound targeted biopsy system will be tested with two new PET tracers in AS patients. The approach will be applicable to any other PET probe. With this device, histology will be correlated with molecular image characteristics, which may correlate to low vs high risk, at a high degree of certainty. The new PET/ultrasound fusion method can be readily disseminated to our 55 existing sites. The technology will provide clinicians a new imaging tool to select millions of low-risk prostate cancer patients for active surveillance instead of unnecessary treatment, therefore may help save billions of dollars in treatment costs."
"9239732","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) requires comprehensive evaluation of lung lymph nodes, either via complete lymphadenectomy during pulmonary resection or via sampling of lymph nodes using mediastinoscopy (preoperatively or intraoperatively). Prospective randomized controlled trial Z0030, reported in 2011, reported no difference between a complete mediastinal lymph node dissection (MLND) and a more limited mediastinal lymph node sampling (MLNS), provided that a minimum of 18 lymph nodes were found and resected. However, finding even 18 lymph nodes in the mediastinum is a daunting task, especially when the latest ACOSOG recommendations include specific lymph nodes from stations 2R, 4R, 7, 8, 9, and 10R in the right chest and stations 4L, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10L in the left chest. Currently, lymph node sampling of the lung is time-consuming and technically challenging, which in turn increases the risk of complications and missed lymph nodes. The ideal technology for NSCLC staging would provide sensitive and real-time identification of lung lymph nodes via a 5-mm diameter thoracoscope, without the need for ionizing radiation.  Curadel has developed such a technology. The FLARE® (FLuorescence-Assisted Resection and Exploration) imaging platform uses low levels of safe, invisible, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent light to highlight one or more targets during surgery. Our two newest innovations include a minimally-invasive FLARE® system compatible with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and a targeted NIR fluorescent contrast agent (CUR-PS327) that highlights every lymph node in the mediastinum for several hours after a single low-dose intravenous injection. Because NIR light penetrates several millimeters through living tissue and blood, this technology enables MLNS for NSCLC to be performed in real-time and with high sensitivity.  Our long-term goal is to minimize anesthesia time, minimize complication rate, and maximize lymph node sampling for patients with NSCLC. To accomplish this goal, we have assembled an international team of highly experienced investigators from academia (Leiden University Medical Center in The Netherlands; LUMC) and industry (Curadel, LLC). Each institution has proven core competencies and unique infrastructures that will be combined and leveraged to complete the aims of the grant. Specifically, we will optimize a 5-mm diameter thoracoscope capable of simultaneous color video, 700 nm NIR fluorescence, and 800 nm fluorescence, develop cGMP-compliant synthesis and aseptic fill-finish of pan lymph node agent CUR-PS327 (800 nm peak emission), perform Clinical Trial Application (IND equivalent) enabling toxicology, and perform Phase 1A (normal human volunteers) and Phase 1B (NSCLC patients undergoing MLNS) first-in-human clinical trials of the technology at the LUMC Centre for Drug Research.  Completion of the Specific Aims will position this new technology to have a major impact on the care of patients with lung cancer."
"9241048","Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and a significant burden for Veterans and the VHA due to the high frequency of recurrence and progression linked to smoking and exposure to deployment- related carcinogens. Nearly 80% of bladder cancers do not invade the muscle of the bladder wall (called ?non- muscle invasive bladder cancer?, NMIBC) but the most aggressive of these tumors will progress to muscle invasion with lymph node metastasis resulting in death in 30% of patients. The primary cause of death from bladder cancer is resistance to therapy as these invasive carcinomas acquire cellular plasticity and stem cell- like properties. Identification of mechanisms that regulate this change in cellular differentiation This invasive phenotype is a hallmark of cancer and a major shift in differentiation regulated by both genetic mutations and epigenetic cellular reprogramming. The long-term goal of our research is to investigate the molecular and epigenetic pathways driving invasion of bladder cancer. By understanding these mechanisms, we may develop rational and novel therapeutics for patients with bladder cancer. To investigate the epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to invasion and proliferation as a feasible target for bladder cancer, we evaluated the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste-2 (EZH2), as part of the polycomb repressor complex-2 (PRC-2) in bladder cancer. Our preliminary data demonstrate increased expression of EZH2 and its histone target, H3K27me3, in a carcinogen-induced mouse model of bladder cancer. In multiple bladder cancer cell lines, EZH2 expression is increased compared to non-transformed urothelial cells. Destabilization of the PRC-2 complex stops cellular proliferation. Consistent with our findings, bioinformatics analysis of multiple human bladder cancer databases demonstrate that EZH2 is overexpressed in invasive bladder cancers, which we have confirmed in tumor specimens from patients with all stages of bladder cancer. Given this preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that EZH2 drives invasion of bladder cancer by causing global changes in histone methylation that shifts cellular identity to an invasive and stem cell-like phenotype via an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Thus, given our promising preliminary data, we propose to investigate our hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the role of EZH2 in bladder cancer initiation and progression; 2) Investigate aberrant histone methylation of EMT, invasive and stem cell genes by EZH2 in bladder cancer; 3) Evaluate pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 as a treatment for bladder cancer. Currently, we have no personalized genetic or epigenetic targets for bladder cancer and our best therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is > 40 years old. Through multi-disciplinary collaboration we have demonstrated feasibility with our approach. Successful completion of the studies described in this proposal will provide an innovative approach to both investigate the mechanisms involved in the invasion of bladder cancer and utilize a novel therapeutic approach to treat bladder cancer. These EZH2-targeted agents overcome the challenge of cellular resistance and have pre-clinical investigations that will allow access to Veterans with bladder cancer."
"9243585","Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc), is a dimorphic fungal pathogen that undergoes a temperature-induced transition from a mold that grows in the soil, to a parasitic yeast form that establishes infection in the lung and is capable of causing severe systemic disease in mammals. While disease is most severe in the immunocompromised, Hc also causes serious problems in immunocompetent hosts. In mice and humans, the pathology of histoplasmosis demonstrates the pivotal role of macrophages in primary infection of the lungs, systemic dissemination, and resolution of disease. Transition from mold to yeast is the first essential step in the pathogenesis of Hc. Conidia and mycelial fragments are inhaled and germinate to the pathogenic yeast form that is responsible for all subsequent steps and interactions with host cells. Hc is a remarkably well-adapted parasite of macrophages, proliferating intracellularly in a membrane-bound compartment of relatively neutral pH. The ability to modulate and survive within the hostile environment of the macrophage is integral to Hc pathogenesis. To fully understand the course of Hc infection, we must ascertain mechanistic details regarding how Hc establishes a successful infection of macrophages, as little research has focused on identifying adhesive factors required for the initial Hc and macrophage attachment. The central goal of this project is to therefore identify adhesins employed by Hc that are required for initial macrophage attachment and subsequent virulence. Analysis of these adhesins or adhesin-related factors will reveal important insights into the molecular determinants required by intracellular parasites for macrophage entry and therefore intracellular survival. In the first aim, we will generate a library of Hc insertional mutants. Mutants will be screened and enriched to yield several candidates containing mutations in genes required for macrophage attachment. The second aim will identify and characterize the molecular determinants that are critical for adhering to macrophages and for Hc virulence. Our objective is to map the sites of insertion resulting in low-binding yeasts and through targeted gene disruption and complementation verify the requirement of specific genetic elements for virulence in vitro and in vivo. The third aim will assess whether predicted adhesins, cell surface proteins, or secreted factors are required for attachment to macrophage in either the yeast or conidial phases of growth. These candidates were selected based on their identification by an adhesin prediction program and through the analysis of expression data and transcriptomics. This approach will complement our unbiased screening and provide insight into whether gene products required for macrophage attachment by yeast and conidia are similar or different. The completion of this project will identify molecular determinants required for Hc attachment to macrophages and yield a fundamental understanding of the initial interaction required by Hc for the establishment of a successful infection of macrophages."
"9242629","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Host-Microbe Core (HMC) is comprised of two components ? the Gnotobiotic component (GBC) and Enteric Microbiology component (EMC). They synergize in the isolation, cultivation and analysis of microbiota by biochemical and sequencing methods with the concomitant analysis of microbes and their communities in vivo using our state-of-the-art gnotobiotic facility. Recent advances in the analysis of the commensal microbiota and an increasing appreciation for the role of the microbiota in the vital functions of the mammalian host have put the studies of host-microbe interactions at the forefront of many areas of the life sciences. This is especially true for studies of the normal physiology of the gut and pathophysiology of disease states such as IBD, which has been linked to disruptions in the host-commensal mutualism. The ability to analyze the composition and structure of the microbiota, as well as its functional properties and ex vivo culturing conditions, is a base requirement for building a successful research center devoted to studying digestive diseases. Moreover, to be in the vanguard of these increasingly inter-disciplinary research fields, DDRCC scientists need access to a reliable mechanism for testing their ideas in in vivo experiments in animals colonized with defined microbiota ? gnotobiotic mice. They are also in need of germ-free (GF) animals to use as controls for studies of the role of microbes in disease development. As a result, the HMC is committed to: (1) Providing DDRCC researchers with services that reflect their needs, are available on campus, and are competitively priced compared to commercial services; and (2) Further development of the HMC to meet both current and anticipated demands. The HMC not only provides valuable expertise to DDRCC users for experiment planning, troubleshooting and discussion of the results but is also integrated with the other DDRCC cores to augment these capabilities. The HMC together with the Integrated Translational Research (ITR) Core are essential for providing cells, tissues, and patient samples to investigators for establishing experimental models. Likewise, the Enteric Microbiology component of the HMC provides high-quality, customized service for cultivation- dependent and -independent analyses of complex gut microbiomes, and in conjunction with the Computational Analysis and Modeling Resource (CAMR) component of the Administrative Core provides assistance and instruction in the analysis of large datasets. Thus, the HM Core has had tremendous impact in enabling DDRCC members to advance knowledge in the DDRCC's thematic areas that focus on the study of IBD, host- microbe interactions, mucosal immunology and inflammation. Of the 306 DDRCC-acknowledged publications over the past funding cycles, 59 (~20%) cited the HMC as the primary core that they used. Further underscoring the integration of DDRCC Cores, the HMC was also listed as a secondary core for an additional 24 pubs, totaling 83 or 28% of the total publications that helped by the DDRCC over the past funding period."
"9242631","The overall goal of the Administrative Core of the Digestive Diseases Research Core Center (DDRCC) at the University of Chicago is to provide leadership and strategic vision to foster and expand gastrointestinal-related research by its clinical and basic science faculty, particularly in the areas of IBD, and the immunology, inflammation, and microbiology of the GI tract. These themes have defined our GI program ever since Dr. Joseph B Kirsner put forward the hypothesis over 75 years ago that IBD was caused by genetic, immunological, and microbial factors. The goals of the Administrative core are to foster and expand gastrointestinal-related research by its clinical and basic science faculty, particularly in the areas of IBD, and the immunology, inflammation, and microbiology of the GI tract. The core will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the DDRCC, including strategic, scientific, and operational directions to insure effectiveness and impact of the program. It will continue to seek opportunities to foster interaction and collaborations among its members. Researchers in the DDRCC are now routinely confronted with data sets of significant sizes, requiring the use of clusters, clouds or supercomputers. In anticipation of this growing need, the Administrative Core created the Computational Analysis and Modeling Resource (CAMR) component that a ?one stop shopping? resource to help DDRCC investigators in bioinformatics, biostatistics, high-throughput microbial analysis and modeling & simulation. The CAMR will assist them in the design, execution and interpretation of research projects. The proceedings of the monthly Executive Committee meetings are reviewed on an annual basis by the Internal Advisory Board (comprised of selected senior leaders in the Biological Sciences Division) and the Dean of Biological Sciences, Dr. Kenneth Polonsky. As the neutral review and sounding board, the External Advisory Board (EAB) of the DDRCC reviews all requests, reports, and recommendations of the Executive committee. The members of the EAB include 5 internationally renowned investigators who are leaders in the area of digestive diseases, particularly in the focus areas of the DDRCC. In summary, the Administrative core of the DDRCC provides leadership, strategic and programmatic vision, oversight, and management of a highly multidisciplinary program that foster interaction, collaboration, and synergy in studies of inflammatory bowel diseases and other related inflammatory diseases of the bowel."
"9244625","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although B cells are best known for providing humoral immunity through the production of antigen-specific antibodies, accumulating evidence suggests some B cell subsets can function to negatively regulate inflammatory responses by producing the immunosuppressive cytokine IL10. Perhaps the best characterized of these subsets is the B10 B cell, which is distinctive for its CD5+CD1dhiCD19hi phenotype and ability to secrete IL10 in response to mitogenic stimuli. B10 B cells are thought to promote antigen-specific suppression of autoreactive T cells through an IL10 (B cell) ? IL21 (T cell) feedback loop established by cognate B cell-T cell interactions. Interestingly, some CD5+ B cell populations have a propensity to react with membrane- associated self-antigens and may also produce IL10 like B10 B cells. Furthermore, certain diseases associated with expanded CD5+ B cells, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Sjögren?s syndrome, show an increased incidence of autoimmune cytopenias that occur when antibodies attack the host?s own cells. Together, these data raise the possibility that the IL10-dependent feedback mechanism may function in reverse to help constrain B cells reactive to membrane antigens, and that breakdown of this regulatory loop may cause B cell-intrinsic autoimmune manifestations. We previously generated transgenic mice (called dnRAG1 mice) which exhibit a receptor editing defect used to alter B cell receptor specificity away from self- reactivity. These animals show an expanded CD5+ B cell population and impaired antibody production. We have found that dnRAG1 CD5+ B cells share the immunophenotype and IL10-competence of B10 B cells, leading us to hypothesize that a failure to successfully edit B cell receptor specificity against certain self- antigens may cause the B cell to acquire B10-like properties to suppress B cell-intrinsic autoimmunity. Consistent with this hypothesis, we show here that IL10-deficiency in dnRAG1 mice leads to elevated IgM production. This hypothesis will be further tested by analyzing wild-type and dnRAG1 mice on IL10+/+ and IL10-/- backgrounds to compare spontaneous and stimulation-induced antibody levels, autoantigen reactivity profiles, immunoglobulin variable gene usage patterns, and the frequency of IgM antibody-producing cells. We will also determine whether adoptively transferring CD5+ B cells from IL10+/+ dnRAG1 mice into IL10-/- dnRAG1 mice can restore immune suppression in these animals. Furthermore, we will test whether impaired receptor editing in mice expressing a site-directed phosphatidylcholine (PtC)-specific heavy chain transgene enhances CD5+ B cell accumulation and IL10-competence, and suppresses total or PtC-specific IgM production. The results obtained from this study may reveal an important new mechanism for how B cell-intrinsic autoimmunity against certain self-antigens are suppressed, and will identify autoantigens that may be subjected to tolerance induction by receptor editing. This work may also suggest an etiology for certain autoimmune manifestations, like cytopenias, that can arise as a clinical complication in diseases associated with expanded CD5+ B cells."
"9245035","Physical activity (PA) has numerous and profound benefits on health and function, yet there is limited knowledge of the mechanistic signals that underlie these benefits. Such knowledge is critical for optimizing the effective use of PA as a preventive or therapeutic intervention strategy for specific diseases and in specific populations. The overarching goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to address this knowledge gap by characterizing the molecular responses to PA. This will be accomplished through the collection of blood and tissue samples from both humans and animals, which will then be subjected to extensive ?Omics? analyses. By generating a comprehensive map of molecular responses to PA, MoTrPAC will lay the foundation for a new era of biomedical research on Precision Exercise Medicine. The University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU-AMC) is exceptionally well poised to lead a MoTrPAC Adult Clinical Center and to contribute to all Consortium activities. Our investigators and collaborators have extensive experience with complex clinical PA intervention trials, including tissue sampling, in cohorts spanning the entire adult age spectrum. Our expertise extends across multiple physiological systems, diseases, and health conditions, and includes broad proficiency in physiologic, metabolic, and morphometric phenotyping. The facilities at CU-AMC for MoTrPAC activities are outstanding. The proposed MoTrPAC ? Colorado Clinical Center will accomplish the following Specific Aims (SA): SA1: Contribute to, and lead when appropriate, all MoTrPAC Phase 1 planning activities (Year 1) described in RFA-RM-15-015 through participation on the MoTrPAC Steering Committee and Subcomittees. The local goals for Phase 1 will be to accomplish tasks (e.g., obtain regulatory approvals, train staff) that will enable Phase 2 to start at the beginning of Year 2. SA2: Recruit and enroll 450 adults at CU-AMC (or the number determined during Phase 1), conduct the acute PA tests and PA intervention according to protocols established by the Consortium, and carry out all other MoTrPAC Phase 2 activities (Years 2 to 5). Highly accomplished clinical investigators will lead the seven ?teams? that will be responsible for: recruitment, screening, and retention; physiologic, metabolic, and morphometric phenotyping; biospecimen acquisition; biospecimen processing; acute PA tests; chronic PA interventions; and data management and quality assurance. SA3: As animal and human data become available from the Chemical Analysis Sites and Bioinformatics Center, we will participate in all Phase 3 activities, including data analysis, preparation of manuscripts, and dissemination of results. These activities will be guided by the MoTrPAC Steering Committee and Subcommittees. On the local level, we will host an annual 1-day local symposium on PA, Health, and Fitness to catalyze the interest of investigators at CU-AMC and other nearby academic institutions in MoTrPAC."
"9247341","ABSTRACT MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs approximately 21 nucleotides in length that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by inducing mRNA destabilization and translational inhibition of target mRNAs. In humans, more than 2000 miRNAs have been identified and are thought to control a variety of biological processes development and cancer. The goal of this competitive renewal application is to continue our investigation of the biological functions and the oncogenic properties of the polycistronic miR-17~92 miRNA cluster, also known as Oncomir1. The miR- 17~92 cluster contains six miRNAs (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a, and miR-92) that can be grouped, based on sequence similarity, in four distinct subfamilies: miR-17 (includes miR-17 and miR-20a), miR-18, miR-19 (includes miR-19a and miR-19b), and miR-92a. During the past five years, supported by the NIH/NCI grant R01 CA149707, my group has performed a careful, and unprecedented, genetic dissection of this polycistronic cluster by generating an characterizing an allelic series of six genetically engineered mouse strains, each carrying selective targeted deletion of individual components of miR-17~92. This analysis, has lead to several important findings, including the discovery of causal role for miR-17 in skeletogenesis and axial patterning, the identification of germline mutations of miR- 17~92 as the cause of a human developmental syndrome known as Feingold Syndrome, and the discovery that the miR-19 family of miRNAs plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Myc-driven human cancers. These exciting new findings have lead to a series of novel hypotheses that are at the core of this grant renewal application. We propose a series of experiments that can be grouped into the following specific aims. The first aim has the goal of investigating the molecular mechanisms through which miR-19 contributes to Myc- driven tumorigenesis. We will also test the recently proposed hypothesis that miR-92 functionally antagonizes miR-19 by acting as a tumor suppressor. In the second aim, we will test a novel pharmacologic approach to inhibit miR-19 in vivo based on a recently developed technology that allows targeted delivery of miRNA antagonists to the acidic tumor microenvironment. In the third aim, we will develop a novel and more efficient method to experimentally identify miRNA-mRNA interactions directly in vivo. Successful completion of the experiments described in this grant application would greatly advance our understanding of this important miRNA cluster in particular, and of miRNAs in general, and could lead to novel anticancer approaches."
"9258674","Project Summary Bone is a dynamic tissue which requires intricate regulatory processes that must work in synchrony to maintain a healthy skeleton. Alterations in this regulation can lead to bone disease. Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from a lack of insulin or reduced insulin sensitivity and affects over 20 million people in the United States. Individuals with diabetes experience decreased bone quality and an increased susceptibility to fracture, leading to significant disability and morbidity. Diabetic bone disease primarily results from an anabolic defect in which there is deficient osteoblast activity, in contrast to the mainly catabolic dysregulation seen in osteoporosis. Osteoblasts produce fibrillar collagens during bone formation, which require lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzyme-dependent modification of specific lysine residues and subsequent cross-linking in order to form a functional fibrillar network and confer strength to bone. The number of lysyl oxidase-dependent cross-links in collagen is decreased in diabetes, leading to compromised bone microarchitecture. Incretins are gastric hormones released by intestinal K-cells into the circulation which regulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. One of these hormones, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide or GIP is anabolic in bone partially mediated independent of its effects action on the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Deletion of the receptor for this hormone, which is expressed on osteoblasts, results in a reduction in bone strength and material properties in mice similar to the low bone formation osteopenia seen in diabetes. GIP also augments LOX activity in osteoblasts, resulting in an increase in mature, stable collagen cross-links. In diabetes the cellular response to GIP is abnormally low, while serum GIP levels remain the same or elevated. Hypothesis: Diabetes interferes with GIP-stimulated LOX expression in osteoblasts. This is mediated by GIP receptor desensitization and leads to the osteopenic phenotype seen in mouse and human diabetic bone. Aim 1: Evaluate the bone phenotype of diabetic and non-diabetic LOX +/- and wild type bones and establish diminished LOX levels as a critical determinant of bone quality in diabetes Aim 2: Determine the mechanism of GIP up-regulation of LOX under normal conditions in osteoblasts and assess for molecular defects in GIPR signaling under diabetic conditions to develop approaches for treating diabetic osteopenia."
"9261689","Abstract: Intrauterine inflammation (IUI) is a major contributor to preterm labor and fetal inflammation leading to injury responses in fetal organs such as the brain, lung and the GI tract. Although inflammation is known to be the proximate cause of preterm labor and fetal complications in IUI, no anti-inflammatory therapies are currently available, partly because the mechanism/s of inflammation are not well understood. New therapeutic targets are urgently needed to stem the tide and costly sequelae of IUI and preterm labor. We investigated these mechanisms in a preterm gestation Rhesus macaque model of IUI induced by intra-amniotic injection of LPS, and by using tissues from women delivering preterm infants. Our key findings supporting this application are: (i) Neutrophils infiltrating the chorio-decidua during IUI are activated with prolonged survival and a contributor to the inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface; (ii) The anti-apoptosis mediator, Bfl1 (also known as Bcl-2A1 in mice), is up-regulated specifically in the chorio-decidua neutrophils during IUI; (iii) Bfl1 increases survival of activated neutrophils. In this multi-PI application, we will test the hypothesis that Bfl1 promotes neutrophil survival and exacerbates inflammatory responses in the chorio-decidua. Our approach is to develop a high-affinity Bfl1 inhibitor as a potential novel therapy for IUI. A compelling rationale for focusing on Bfl1 is that it's up-regulation is specific to activated hematopoietic cells and these activated cells are uniquely susceptible to Bfl1 inhibition. This property of Bfl1 overcomes a major hurdle in anti-inflammatory therapy of undesired deleterious effects on basal immune function. Our study will build on proof-of-concept pre-clinical studies from other labs demonstrating efficacy of anti-Bfl1 directed therapies targeting activated basophil- mediated anaphylaxis or triggering apoptosis in resistant cancer cells. In Aim 1, we will exploit our expertise in drug-design by using in silico, biochemical, and crystallographic approaches to find compounds with high affinity for Bfl1 but not other Bcl-2 members. After screening primary compounds for efficacy in mouse cells, a key feature in our approach is the use of counter-screening secondary assays. Here, we will screen the lead compounds for lack of biologic effects in mouse cells devoid of Bax/Bak, the downstream executioners of the Bcl-2A1 (Bfl1) regulated apoptotic pathway. This will minimize any pro-apoptotic compounds with off-target effects. In Aim 2, the efficacy of the lead compounds will be tested in activated chorio-decidua cells from women with histologic chorioamnionitis, and the efficacy will be compared against siRNA-mediated blockade. Completion of these studies will provide novel clinical candidate compounds that can be tested in pre-clinical in vivo studies using mouse and non-human primate models that our group already has. A distinctive feature of our application is the collaborative multi-disciplinary team with expertise in clinical-translational perinatal inflammation, Bcl-2 immunology, medicinal chemistry, and rational drug-design. !"
"9309421","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) is a keystone periodontal pathogen. Controlling chronic inflammation elicited by periodontal pathogens is thought central to mitigating soft and hard tissue destruction that characterizes periodontal disease (PD). Clinical treatment of patients with moderate to severe PD typically requires highly invasive approaches. Thus, development of non-invasive measures to therapeutically regulate pathogen-driven inflammation and limit oral bone loss are sought to augment current PD clinical treatment modalities. Recent studies have identified that one group of nuclear hormone receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), as potential molecules of therapeutic value as PPARs have been shown to control expression of genes involved in inflammation. Although some supportive data exists regarding the role played by PPARs in pathogen- induced inflammation, there is a significant gap in our knowledge in the context of PD-associated bacterial infection-elicited inflammation, and oral bone loss. Based on our preliminary data, and the gap in knowledge regarding specific PPAR exploitation as a therapeutic target for controlling Pg infection-elicited inflammation and oral bone loss, we propose that that PPARs control the expression of key inflammatory elements that contribute inflammation and oral bone loss elicited by the defined periodontal pathogen Pg. Our approach, will utilize an in vitro screen employing human tissue resident macrophages and epithelial cells to identify a PPAR agonist or antagonist that most significantly reduces cellular inflammatory response to Pg challenge. This PPAR-targeting molecule will then be tested in an animal model to define its therapeutic value in reducing Pg oral infection- elicited inflammation and oral bone loss."
"9313650","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is disproportionately high among military personnel. Even mild TBI can have persistent adverse neurobiological effects that can continue to evolve long after the initial injury. Seizures, spasticity, cognitive and affective disorders, sleep problems, and endocrine diseases (diabetes) are prevalent, debilitating, and difficult to treat. Effective long-term rehabilitation will require transformative therapeutic approaches that address the brain processes responsible for the emergence of delayed symptoms. The delayed evolution of these problems post-TBI offers opportunities for prevention and improved long-term outcome. A gene delivery technique we developed produces sustained over-expression of the gene for neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) in discrete brain regions. Intracranial gene delivery using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors similar to our SST vector is proving safe and effective in clinical trials for several brain diseases. In the central nervous system SST participates in synaptic inhibition, inflammation, cognition, emotional function, analgesia, and cytoprotection, multiple mechanisms by which it might provide positive benefits against delayed TBI effects. Our SST gene delivery to the hippocampus prevented electrically induced seizures from developing in 70% of rats tested in an established epilepsy model. The next step in translating this approach to clinically useful applications is to test it in more advanced animal models of brain injury. At the same time, determining the safety of this method will be essential for further preclinical development. Efficacy and safety thus comprise 2 specific aims of this Small Project intended to serve as a foundation for translational progress. To test whether efficacy extends to the delayed development of seizures after TBI, we will combine a well-characterized rat model for closed-head TBI with the kindling seizure model in which efficacy was first observed. Anesthetized young adult male rats will be given a controlled brain injury 10 days before receiving intracranial infusion of SST or control gene transfer vectors in hippocampus, and permanently implanted electrodes for electrical stimulation, during a single surgery. A week later a kindling procedure will be initiated composed of timed stimulation twice per day, using intensities sub-threshold for seizure generation. Paired electroencephalograph (EEG) and video recordings obtained during stimulated seizures will be scored blind offline as duplicate measures of severity and duration. Gradually over the following days to weeks mild seizures start and become progressively more severe until reaching a fully kindled state where the stimulation consistently elicits maximally intense seizures in untreated rats. Therapeutic efficacy of hippocampal SST gene delivery will be reflected in reduced seizure severity or duration, delayed progression of seizure severity, or a reduction in the maximal seizure severity that can be consistently evoked. To examine effects of TBI, gene transfer, and kindling on memory performance sensitive to hippocampal injury, a natural tendency of rats to explore alternating arms of a Y-shaped maze on successive trials will be tested repeatedly throughout the study. Cognitive performance will be evaluated on multiple challenge tasks sensitive to learning and memory ability. Natural motor function (activity, rearing, grooming), affective states (anxiety), and circadian physiology (sleep) will be assessed from continuous home cage infrared video. Therapeutic safety will be evaluated from comprehensive behavioral assessments, but also by comprehensive histological analysis of brain pathology as a function of vector treatment. In addition to markers for pathology, we will evaluate the effects of gene transfer in kindled TBI rats on spatial localization patterns of SST receptor proteins. We propose that seizure reduction, and amelioration of progressive cognitive and motor dysfunction post-TBI, will involve multiple efficacy mechanisms that engage several receptor subtypes in specific subregions of the brain. This feasible and innovative Small Project opens new avenues for improving the rehabilitation of Veterans facing decades of debilitating consequences after TBI."
"9341480","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer causes ~160,000 deaths annually in the U.S. and prevention will be crucial to win the war on this deadliest cancer. Since DNA modification by tobacco carcinogens is one major driver for lung cancer initiation, blocking DNA adduct formation (the root cause) is a plausible strategy. This proposal focuses on the preclinical studies of dihydromethysticin (DHM) as a novel and highly efficacious chemopreventive agent that inhibits lung tumor initiation via preventing tobacco carcinogen-induced DNA modification. Preliminary data demonstrate that DHM (given during carcinogen exposure period at a dose of 50 ppm in diet) completely blocked NNK-induced lung tumor formation in A/J mice. A natural analog, dihydrokavain (DHK), was completely inactive even at 500 ppm in diet. Such a sharp in vivo difference suggests a crucial role of methylenedioxy functional group for specific targeting by DHM. DHM selectively reduced NNAL (the active metabolite of NNK)-induced DNA adducts in the lung tissues. DHM also reduced NNK-derived DNA adducts in F344 rats, indicating its cross-species anti-initiation potential. Based on the reported activity of DHM in activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and our own data of DHM in increasing glucuronidated NNAL in mouse urine, we propose that DHM activates detoxification pathways as the primary mechanism of action. With respect to safety, 17-week dietary exposure of DHM to A/J mice caused no adverse effects at 500 ppm, affording a wide safety margin as a lung cancer chemopreventive agent for long-term use. Our central hypothesis is that DHM effectively prevents tobacco carcinogen-induced lung tumorigenesis, at least in major part, by enhancing carcinogen detoxification potentially via activating AHR leading to a reduction in oncogenic DNA adducts in the target lung tissues. This hypothesis will be tested by accomplishing the following aims: Aim 1 To elucidate the structural determinant(s) of DHM (i.e., intact DHM or its metabolite) for its exceptional in vivo inhibitory activities against NNK-induced DNA adduct formation and lung tumor initiation. Data will also inform the in vivo active form of DHM. Aim 2 To investigate enhanced detoxification as a key mechanism of DHM to inhibit NNK-induced DNA adduct  formation and lung tumor initiation. Data will also inform its potential to protect against other tobacco  carcinogens and identify surrogate biomarkers for future translational studies. Aim 3 To evaluate the efficacy of DHM against NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis in F344 rats and BaP-induced  lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice. Data will inform its cross-species applicability and carcinogen specificity. If the results support our hypothesis, DHM will be well positioned for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-based toxicology in higher mammals in preparation for an IND application for human translation studies. The mechanistic knowledge will not only identify surrogate biomarkers critical for translation, but also advance our basic understanding about NNAL metabolism and carcinogenesis."
"9378465","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The title of this project is Treating Collagen-induced Arthritis with Fc? Receptor Activating Nanoparticles. We and others have identified and characterized a population of macrophages with potent immunorergulatory activity. The goal of the present proposal is to induce the production of regulatory macrophages (R-M?) in mice, and determine whether their induction can decrease pathology associated with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). To induce R-M?, mice will be injected with Fc? Receptor Activating Nanoparticle (Fc?RANP). We have established a collaborative arrangement in which LeukoSight will produce and purify proprietary polypeptides that bind to Fc? receptors on macrophages. In collaboration with Dr. Christopher Jewell, at the University of Maryland, these polypeptides will be tethered to nanoparticles and tested for their ability to reprogram macrophages into R-M?. Fc?RANP with the highest reprogramming activity will then be tested in two models of CIA. In the first model, mice will be injected with Type II Collagen in CFA and then administered Fc?RANP prior to the induction of disease. A delay in the onset of disease or a decrease in severity will be measured over the next several weeks (Aim 1). In the second model, clinically apparent CIA will be induced in mice by the injection of C-II in CFA and then after the mice show symptoms of established disease, they will be injected with Fc?RANP. Over the next two weeks the resolution of symptoms and a decrease in pathology will be examined and quantified (Aim 2). The decrease in pathology will be correlated with the appearance of R-M? in the joint synovium. LeukoSight, Inc has invested substantial time and effort into identifying recombinant polypeptides that bind avidly to macrophage Fc?R and they have developed a reliable assay to measure regulatory macrophage reprogramming. The university research laboratories of Drs. Mosser and Jewell have proficiency in a variety of autoimmune disease models, including CIA. The University has provided IACUC approval to perform these studies. The goal of these studies is to demonstrate the feasibility of using nanoparticle-based macrophage reprogramming as a therapeutic strategy to treat autoimmune diseases."
"9378848","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Molecular Genetics Program has been continuously approved through the NCI CCSG since the USC Norris first received NCI designation over 35 years ago. This Program has always been distinguished nationally for its strength in DNA replication and DNA repair, with an emphasis on applying discoveries toward cancer chemotherapy. During the project period, Preet Chaudhary joined Michael Lieber as Co-Leader to add depth in translation and oversee a new theme on the molecular genetics of cancers associated with infection by HHV8, including the development of targeted therapies for the treatment of these cancers. The Program has three integrated aims: 1) DNA replication, cell cycle, and cell proliferation in genetic instability; 2) DNA repair and recombination in genetic instability; and 3) viral oncogenesis with an emphasis on HHV8. Lymphoid malignancies are used as a disease model used by Program members for all three aims. Members continue to be highly interactive within and across themes and across program boundaries. The 39 Program members, who come from three schools and 13 departments, have $11.4M in peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of which 18% is from NCI, 61% from other NIH sources, and 8% from other peer-reviewed funding sources. The Program is highly productive with 439 publications of which 21% are inter-programmatic, 15% intra-programmatic and 25% inter-institutional. Program Leaders organize retreats and mini-symposia several times per year to cross-fertilize research within and across Programs while remaining watchful to ensure a high level of member crosstalk. This has led to high success in securing new P01s that are intra- and inter-programmatic, while also cross-cutting thematically. Examples include renewal of an NCI P01 on understanding human DNA polymerase active sites and development of new chemotherapeutics (Goodman, McKenna, Warshel), and a new NCI P01 on viral oncogenesis by KSHV (HHV8) (Jung, Feng, Gao). Members have been particularly successful in seeking new cancer drug therapies, which has been achieved with the Translational and Clinical Sciences Program."
"9396082","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical shortage of new PhD's in the field of Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSD). This training grant is designed to address this shortage by preparing researcher-scholars in the field of speech- language disorders in children and adults at one of the top-ranked departments in the country. This competing continuation requests support for five predoctoral students and one postdoctoral fellow to participate in an interdisciplinary training program that draws on faculty and resources in the departments of Communication Sciences & Disorders, Psychology, Educational Psychology, and the Waisman Center. The University of Wisconsin-Madison is perhaps unique in the high level of collaboration among faculty and their students in these different programs, interactions that are facilitated by the existence of the Waisman Center, an interdisciplinary center that supports research on human development, developmental disabilities, and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, UW-Madison is ideally suited for training students for careers in speech and language disorders given that research and practice in this field must draw on expertise from a variety of fields. The purpose of the proposed training grant is to prepare students for academic careers in the field of speech and language disorders or related disciplines within an interdisciplinary training program. Predoctoral trainees will take formal coursework across different disciplines and will be required to complete two short lab rotations (1 semester each) or one longer lab rotation in addition to working in the lab of their primary advisor. Trainees will be able to select rotations from a number of research programs, including ones in language development, language disorders, language and bilingualism, memory and cognition, social communication deficits in traumatic brain injury, speech perception and production in children and adults, speech sound disorders in children, and neurogenic speech disorders. Experimental methodologies that are available to trainees include acoustic speech analysis, neuroimaging (e.g., MRI/fMRI, DTI), eye-tracking, computational modeling, as well as many behavioral paradigms. In addition to the lab rotation component, value-added training activities for predoctoral students include more rigorous instruction in quantitative methods (statistics), expanded instruction in responsible conduct of research (RCR), mentoring training, journal club, interdisciplinary proseminars, and an Individual Development Plan (IDP). The postdoctoral trainees will engage in the mentoring training, grant writing instruction, journal club, proseminars, and creation of an IDP. Both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees will take at least one semester-long seminar focusing on the theme of interdisciplinary approaches to science."
"9071356","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Transfers are an essential task performed numerous times a day by wheelchair users with lower limb paralysis or dysfunction. Because transfers are highly physically demanding on the upper limbs they are a major contributor to the development of upper limb pain and injury. In previous work, we developed an instrumented transfer station to evaluate the biomechanics of sitting-pivot wheelchair transfer techniques. We discovered that using certain prescribed trunk and hand positions reduces loading on the upper limb joints. We also developed and established the psychometric properties of the Transfer Assessment Instrument (TAI) which is a quick and easy way that clinicians can determine how well their patients adhere to best transfer practices. We found that subjects who had TAI detectable technique deficits and received individualized training by a therapist to correct these deficits showed an immediate improvement in their movement patterns and forces after the training session. While one-on-one training with a therapist is ideal, the training is labor intensive. Moreover, shorter rehab stays and heavy caseloads prohibit clinicians from spending a lot of time teaching and reinforcing transfer skills.  Once taught, patients are generally responsible for practicing and implementing the techniques on their own. Supplementing the clinician's training with an interactive coaching tool that provides veterans with a way to check and correct their form on their own would likely facilitate the learning and retention of new transfer skills. This pre-development phase of research will determine the types of transfer movement variables that can be reliability detected with the Microsoft KinectTM, a low-cost, markerless motion capture system and the accuracy associated with each movement variable. Aim 1 will be to identify Kinect motions that are reliable and consistent with motions measured by a reference 3D marker based system (e.g. Vicon). Twenty-five wheelchair users who are independent with transfers will transfer to/from two surfaces (e.g. a level bench and commode) while the two systems simultaneously record their movement patterns. We hypothesize that the 3D trunk, shoulder, elbow and wrist angle motions measured with the Kinect will follow a similar trajectory as the Vicon-measured motions and the peak angles will be repeatable and similar between the two systems. Aim 2 will evaluate an additional 25 subjects to explore the relationships between TAI scores and Kinect motions during transfers. We hypothesize that Kinect motions will be significantly correlated with the quality of the transfers. Successful completion of this study will allow for defining the design criteria and features of the transfer coaching system."
"9118005","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Veterans with PTSD have high rates of smoking (34%-86% vs. 18% in the general population) and have substantial difficulties with quitting tobacco. Only 23% of individuals with PTSD quit smoking compared to 50% of the general population. As a result, Veterans with PTSD are at high risk of developing severe health problems and poor physical functioning. Fifty percent of these long-term smokers will die of a smoking-related cause and on average, will lose 25 years of their life compared to non-smokers. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with smoking, no smoking cessation treatments exist that intensively target PTSD symptoms as an obstacle to quit smoking, although this is a significant barrier to quitting for many Veterans. n addition, no smoking cessation treatments have a large emphasis on improving the functioning of Veterans with PTSD and tobacco dependence, although both PTSD and tobacco use negatively affect functioning across physical, mental health, and social domains.  The goal of this SPiRE project is to evaluate Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Veterans with PTSD and Tobacco Use (ACT-PT), which is an acceptance and mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment for Veterans with PTSD and tobacco dependence. ACT-PT specifically targets smoking cravings related to PTSD symptoms and memories of trauma, in addition to difficulties managing PTSD symptoms. negative affect and nicotine withdrawal symptoms during quit attempts. ACT-PT includes structured intervention components that guide Veterans to replace smoking as a coping strategy for PTSD symptoms and memories with alternative coping strategies (e.g., mindfulness, acceptance). And healthy living activities (e.g., engaging in work, expanding social networks, engaging in physical exercise) that are consistent with Veterans' values. This emphasis on substantially improving health-related quality of life and functioning across several areas makes ACT-PT particularly innovative and different from existing treatments. However, research is needed on the relative feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of  ACT-PT compared to standard smoking cessation treatments.  The proposed SPiRE (I21) will involve a randomized clinical trial study of 50 Veteran smokers with PTSD and tobacco dependence randomized to one of two different types of psychosocial treatment 10 individual sessions of ACT-PT (n= 25) versus 10 individual sessions of the American Lung Association's Freedom From Smoking Program [FFS] (n=25) with all participants receiving 12 weeks of the nicotine patch. This study has two primary aims: 1) evaluate the relative feasibility and acceptability of the two interventions (including ease of recruitment, randomization proportion, staff and Veteran acceptance of the treatment, retention rates, treatment adherence, fidelity, ease of the assessment process), and 2) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of ACT-PT vs. FFS with the primary outcomes of tobacco use, PTSD symptoms, health-related quality of life, and functional impairment."

"9138279","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Chronic inflammatory diseases, such as, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are associated with premature development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mortality rates among US Veterans with RA are more than twice that of age-matched men in the general population, a risk that appears to be higher than that observed in other RA cohorts. Despite strong evidence that chronic inflammation accelerates CVD, currently available treatments are not sufficient to prevent the accelerated CVD. Therefore, other approaches that target the vascular effectors of chronic inflammation are needed. The long-term goal of our research program is to understand the mechanisms by which the Nox1 NADPH oxidase contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular disease and identify novel therapeutic targets to reduce CVD. In work that was funded by a VA Merit Award, we have identified mechanisms of cytokine-mediated Nox1 activation. Our findings have also established a link between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation and Nox1 in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) growth and migration. In this renewal application, our objective is to integrate these findings and explore the mechanism by which chronic inflammation increases CVD. We hypothesize that chronic inflammation increases circulating EGF-like ligands, which induces vascular Nox1 expression and primes SMCs to cytokine activation, thereby promoting vascular disease. We will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanism by which EGF-like ligands accelerate vascular injury via Nox1 activation. Proposed studies will be performed in cultured human vascular SMCs and assess (1) the role of Nox1 splice isoforms; (2) ROS-induced ROS mechanisms, and (3) priming effects of EGF-like ligands on SMCs? Aim 2: Determine whether interrupting EGFR-Nox1 activation in SMCs prevents accelerated development of vascular disease in chronic inflammation. Proposed studies will induce neointimal hyperplasia in genetically modified mice subjected to a model of inflammatory arthritis and examine the effects of (1) smooth muscle cell-specific deficiency of EGFR; (2) deficiency of Nox1; and (3) the inhibition of Nox1 phosphorylation, on neointimal formation. Aim 3: Determine if plasma EGF-like ligands identify RA patients at high risk for developing vascular disease. Proposed studies will utilize the Veterans Affairs Rheumatoid Arthritis (VARA) registry consisting of bio-specimens and longitudinal clinical data to investigate  the association of plasma EGF-like ligands in RA patients with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Successful completion of these studies will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which chronic inflammation, such as RA, increases morbidity and mortality of CVD. A positive clinical impact of our proposed studies is that our findings will provide new strategies fr the development of specific targeted therapeutics for the treatment of Veterans with chronic inflammation and vascular disease."
"9188568","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Low vision refers to any chronic, uncorrectable visual impairment that hinders everyday function.  In the United States, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairment in older adults.  More than two million Americans 50 years and older suffer intermediate or advanced AMD.  The condition causes damage in the central region of the retina, leading to scotomas that force the use of remaining eccentric vision for tasks formerly performed by the fovea.  Specific regions of the eccentric retina are recruited as replacement for the original fovea, leading to development of preferred retinal loci (PRLs).  Nevertheless, performing daily visual tasks and maintaining quality of life remain extremely challenging.  Due to the severe impact of central vision loss on daily visual tasks, developing suitable visual rehabilitation based on a comprehensive and accurate assessment of their residual vision is vital for people with central vision loss.  Such assessment is crucial for monitoring the status of vision loss, for developing and providing effective low vision rehabilitation interventions, and for obtaining projections of potential benefits from interventions.  The proposed studies aim to tackle the technological challenges.  We will develop new efficient adaptive procedures to measure a number of visual functions and their maps, and identify the core metrics of functional vision in low vision.  The proposal has three specific aims.  In Aim 1, we will develop and validate new adaptive methods for efficient assessment of metrics of functional vision in normal vision.  This set of measures will serve as candidates for core metrics of functional vision.  In Aim 2, we will refine the new adaptive methods developed in Aim 1 for applications in low vision.  In Aim 3, we will model and evaluate the relationship between the candidate metrics and everyday visual performance, and identify the core metrics of functional vision in low vision.  The proposed research addresses one of the major research needs/gaps identified by the NEI Low Vision and Blindness Rehabilitation Panel.  Our overall objective is to develop time- and cost-efficient clinical outcome measures that provide a thorough and precise assessment of patients' functional vision.  The innovative adaptive methods can also be employed for many medical purposes such as providing prognostic and diagnostic information, monitoring disease progression, and evaluating treatment and rehabilitation outcomes."

"9177699","DESCRIPTION     Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) due to exposure to explosive blasts is a common occurrence in veterans  returning from recent deployments. Although mTBI is not associated with gross brain damage visible on  standard radiological examinations, a subset of individuals report long-term disruptions of cognitive and  emotional functioning, suggesting that more subtle neural damage may exist. Given results from civilian mTBI,  the damage is likely to be spatially variable across individuals and to affect white matter (WM) tracts  connecting distant brain regions. Therefore, measures of brain connectivity may be vital for understanding the  neurological effects of deployment-related mTBI (dTBI). In particular, quantification of changes in brain  connectivity, rather than simply end-state differences, associated with dTBI may be especially informative.   The proposed research plan will investigate deployment-related changes in MRI-based measures of  structural and functional connectivity, as well as clinical and neuropsychological measures, in a population of  military service members being deployed for the first time. The effect of dTBI on these changes will be tested  as well as potential moderating effects of combat stress and other deployment experiences. In addition, the  presence of baseline differences in connectivity measures and the effect of these differences on deployment-  related changes will be investigated. The overall goals of the proposed research plan are to characterize the  neural effects of blast mTBI on brain connectivity and the potential moderating effects of pre-deployment and  in-theater factors by pursuing the following aims:   Aim 1: To investigate the longitudinal effects of dTBI and deployment experiences on brain connectivity  and cognitive performance, as well as the inter-relationships among these changes.   Aim 2: To investigate the effects of factors present prior to deployment (e.g. history of civilian mTBI) on pre-  deployment brain connectivity and longitudinal changes in connectivity and cognition.   The most unique elements of this research plan are the inclusion of neuroimaging data from service  members with no prior deployment, the collection of pre- and post-deployment longitudinal neuroimaging data,  and the explicit examination of relationships among changes in structural connectivity, functional connectivity,  and neuropsychological measures. These elements allow the neural changes associated with deployment in general and bTBI in particular to be characterized in a comprehensive manner.   The candidate seeks to use this Career Development experience to build on his existing expertise using  neuroimaging methods to study clinical conditions, to develop his skills in clinical assessment of TBI and  related conditions, to provide opportunities for VA service, and to establish a rich set of resources for  establishing an independent research career within VA. He will accomplish this by working closely with his  mentors, administering neuropsychological tests in research and clinical settings, and providing educational,  academic, and clinical service to a range of VA centers. The candidate will meet regularly with his mentors  throughout the study period to use their wealth of experience to ensure that the study is designed and  implemented in a manner most likely to accomplish the proposed aims, contribute to veterans' care, and build  a pool of resources that will fuel applications for future funded research. He will engage in a range of training  activities that combine coursework with direct patient contact, as well as service activities that include  education of clinicians and military leadership, participation in administrative committees (e.g. IRB), and  integration of research and clinical aims of the Minneapolis Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center. In addition to  providing necessary training and experience in conditions of high relevance to veteran care, these activities will  help Dr. Davenport integrate himself with the resources available at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System  that will be used to establish an independent VA research career."
"9179635","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our group has determined that PIAS3-dependent SUMOylation plays a central role in regulating both rod and cone photoreceptor differentiation. However, several critical questions about the function of PIAS3 and protein SUMOylation in photoreceptors still remain unresolved. While protein SUMOylation is essential for photoreceptor viability, our previous work did not determine whether PIAS3 is required for the maturation, maintenance or survival of differentiated photoreceptors. To address this question, we will generate and characterize mutant mice that selectively lack PIAS3 expression in photoreceptors. Second, it is not known how PIAS3-dependent SUMOylation induces NR2E3 to act as a transcriptional repressor when bound to the promoters of cone-specific genes, but does not do so when it bound to the promoters of rod-specific genes. We will test whether the TFIIH-associated proteins ERCC2 and CDK7 might mediate this effect by blocking PIAS3-dependent SUMOylation of NR2E3 when it is bound to the promoters of rod-specific genes. Finally, preliminary studies of SUMO ligase specificity obtained using protein microarrays have suggested that PIAS3 and TOPORS, another E3 SUMO ligase critical for photoreceptor function, may regulate the activity of multiple photoreceptor-specific proteins that function outside the nucleus. We have found that BBS4 is SUMOylated by PIAS3, and propose to study how this process regulates BBSome assembly and rhodopsin transport in vivo. We also plan to investigate whether PIAS3 also regulates the function of other ciliary and centrosomal proteins such as CEP290 through site-specific SUMOylation, and will whether the activity of PIAS3 is controlled by TOPORS-dependent SUMOylation, as suggested by our preliminary in vitro analysis."
"9186544","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and in particular neuroactive non-dioxin-like PCBs, remain a significant children's health concern because of their persistence and inadvertent production by various industrial processes that continue to contaminate food and indoor air, especially in schools across the United States. PCBs have been identified as probable environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), which affect 1 in 10 children born in the United States. Most NDD have complex etiologies that likely involve multiple genetic loci interacting with exposures to environmental factors during critical periods of neurodevelopment. While many genes have been associated with increased risk of NDD, there remains a huge gap in understanding how multiple genes interact to modify neurodevelopment and even less clarity as to how genetic susceptibilities interact with environmental factors to amplify NDD risk. We will address these questions by testing the hypothesis that exposure during critical window(s) of neurodevelopment to a mixture of PCBs found in mothers at risk for having a child with NDD will potently disrupt neuronal connectivity via ryanodine receptor (RyR)-dependent mechanisms and the net outcome will be influenced by heritable mutations that alter the fidelity of Ca2+ signals essential for activity-dependent dendriic growth. This hypothesis derives from data generated during the previous funding cycle demonstrating sensitization of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) by PCB 95 activates calcium-dependent signaling pathways that promote dendritic arborization, and increased dendritic arborization is associated with impaired cognitive behavior in weanling mice exposed to PCB 95 in the maternal diet. The studies described in this application will use a PCB mixture that is relevant to human NDD based on data of PCB levels in the plasma of mothers participating in the MARBLES study at UC Davis, a longitudinal study for pregnant women with increased risk for having a child with NDD. This MARBLES mix will be tested for effects on morphometric, biochemical and functional indices of neuronal connectivity in unique mouse models that express an expansion repeat in the FMR1 gene, the single most frequent monogenetic cause of neurodevelopmental impairments, and a human RyR1 gain of function mutation, singly or in combination. These studies will address the critical need to better understand mechanisms by which non-dioxin-like PCBs cause developmental neurotoxicity, and will provide among the first mechanistic data regarding relevant interactions among genes and environment that increase NDD risk. This information will inform rational strategies for minimizing NDD risk by mitigating relevant exposures and will facilitate the development of mechanistically based screening platforms for identifying other gene-environment interactions likely to amplify adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes."
"9186858","ABSTRACT Novel immunotherapies for cancer are having a major clinical impact, in particular anti-PD-1 mAbs. However, the mechanisms that explain why a subset of patients responds to these therapies while other patients do not remain incompletely understood. Our preliminary data suggest that a baseline T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment may be a predictive biomarker for response to multiple immunotherapies. Combination immunotherapies may push clinical efficacy in this subset of patients further. Our over-arching hypothesis is that germline polymorphisms in the host, genomic features of the tumor cells, and the composition of intestinal microbiota profoundly influence the extent of a spontaneous T cell response against a patient's tumor, which in turn will determine the likelihood of response to immunotherapy. Identifying molecular mechanisms for T cell exclusion should point towards new therapeutic interventions that will expand the fraction of patients responding to anti-PD-1- based immunotherapies. While our work to date has focused on melanoma, recent TCGA analysis has indicated that many of the same principles apply to multiple additional cancer types. Thus, a major goal of the proposed funding period will be to broaden our translational research strategy to encompass patients with all cancer types being treated with anti-PD-1- based immunotherapies. The output of this work is therefore anticipated to have profound impact on cancer patient outcomes overall."
"9187904","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Child mortality in the United States is most commonly attributed to trauma and sepsis, the major research focus of our research team at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh Site of the National Institutes of Child Health and Development (NICHD) Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN). This is a renewal application to continue participation in the third cycle of the NICHD-CPCCRN with the goals of collaboratively supporting existing and new studies developed by the Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Branch network and also extending our center's novel work within the CPCCRN in host-pathogen interactions in trauma and sepsis. Over the past 9 years our center has provided 24,000 patients to over 22 CPCCRN studies. Our center's program of research in host-pathogen interactions has led to three CPCCRN approved studies. In the first cycle we showed that trauma patients have a two-fold increased risk of developing nosocomial infection and sepsis compared to non-trauma patients. In the second cycle we commenced the ongoing NIGMS-R01 funded Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Severe Sepsis study (PI: Carcillo) which examines the influence of host inflammation phenotype response on nosocomial infection and sepsis outcomes in trauma and non-trauma patients. In our new concept proposal for this third cycle we respond to the NIH roadmap initiative's call for improved understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease by evaluating microbiome perturbations in critical illness. In our single center pilot study we found that critically ill children suffered `dysbiosis with loss of microbiome diversity and site specificity with a tendency to formation of an abundant microorganism (> 30% of the microbiome) which could be found in the patient's room and in the patient two days before the onset of nosocomial infection. If we demonstrate that these findings are generalizable across the CPCCRN then this will open the possibility of a new era of microbiome based medicine for prevention and treatment of nosocomial infection and sepsis in critically injured children."
"9188827","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lymph transport relies critically on the intrinsic contractions of lymphatic smooth muscle (SM) cells in the walls of collecting lymphatic vessels to propel lymph against a hydrostatic pressure gradient. These contractions must be coordinated within each pumping unit, the lymphangion, to efficiently propel lymph downstream to the next segment. Synchronized contractions depend on tight electrical coupling of lymphatic SMCs through connexins (Cx) - gap junction proteins that link adjacent cells and allow the transfer of electrical current. The significance of understanding how contractions are coordinated is underscored by studies suggesting that impaired or uncoordinated lymphatic vessel contractions contribute to both congenital and acquired forms of lymphedema. Notably, women with Cx47 mutations have a higher incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema of the extremities and patients with Cx47 or Cx43 mutations develop primary lymphedema, reputedly due to a contraction coordination deficit in collecting lymphatic vessels. Little is know about Cx expression and electrical coupling between the cells of the lymphatic wall. A better understanding of how electrical signals are conducted and coordinated within and along the lymphatic wall requires knowledge of the specific Cx isoforms expressed in the SM and endothelial cell (EC) layers as well as direct measures of electrical coupling between the cells. We have recently developed a preparation ideally suited to address these issues: the isolated popliteal lymphatic vessel of the mouse. We can control pressure/flow, measure membrane potential in both SMCs and ECs, and quantitatively assess the degree of cell-cell coupling by passing current between two recording microelectrodes at defined separations. Our preliminary data suggest 1) lymphatic vessels show EC-specific expression of Cx37 and Cx43 but SM-specific expression of Cx45; 2) there is robust EC-EC electrical coupling, good SM-SM coupling, but relatively poor SM-EC coupling. This is in stark contrast to what is found in arterioles. Our central hypothesis is that the lymphatic wall exhibits a high degree of SM-SM electrical coupling between, but not across, valves to allow focal generation, conduction and synchronization of action potentials (APs) within lymphangions; further, we hypothesize that the SM layer is essentially uncoupled electrically from the EC layer, due to poor SM-EC Cx expression, and is optimized to conduct a depolarizing wave rather than a hyperpolarization wave. This hypothesis will be tested by 3 specific aims: 1) Determine the extent of electrical and Cx coupling between SM and EC cells in the lymphatic wall; 2) Determine which cells of the lymphatic wall initiate electrical pacemaking; 3) Determine the factors controlling the direction and conduction of lymphatic pacemaker waves. We will take advantage of GFP reporter mice and global and tissue-specific knock-outs of specific Cx isoforms. Accomplishment of these aims will advance our understanding of how lymphatic contractions are coordinated, enabling potential pharmacological rescue of the dysfunctional lymphatic pump in lymphedema."
"9197608","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Ras pathway is one of the most commonly deregulated pathways in cancer. Mutations in RAS genes, upstream regulators, or downstream effectors occur in the majority of human tumors. One important Ras regulatory gene involved in cancer is the NF1 tumor suppressor, which encodes a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP). NF1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP and normally terminates Ras signaling. Accordingly, loss-of-function mutations in NF1 result in hyperactivated Ras. NF1 mutations underlie a common familial cancer syndrome neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). More recently, NF1 has been shown to play a role in a variety of sporadic tumors including melanoma, glioblastoma, and lung cancer. However, while the gene was cloned in 1990, surprisingly little is known about how the NF1 protein is normally regulated or functions. In addition, there are no effective therapies for NF1-mutant tumors. In this application we aim to tackle both of these important problems. Specifically, we will 1) determine how the NF1 protein is normally regulated and terminates Ras signaling, 2) deconstruct downstream and converging signaling pathways, and 3) identify broad signaling networks that are deregulated in NF1-mutant tumors. Collectively, these studies should not only reveal novel insight into NF1 and Ras signaling, but will identify key regulators and effectors in NF1-mutant tumors that may ultimately serve as therapeutic targets."

The objective of this research program is to understand the basis of these memory impairments, and rodent and nonhuman primate models each can provide unique windows into understanding how age impacts networks critical for cognition, at cellular resolution. The experiments proposed in the present application are guided by two primary aims. Aim 1 is to understand how brain circuits responsible for spatial cognition are altered in the aged rat. While empirical focus on the hippocampus is justified because of this structure's critical role in memory, the extent to which changes in upstream cortico-hippocampal inputs, such as the entorhinal cortex, contribute to these age- related behavioral deficits is unknown. Two approaches are taken in this aim to answer these questions. We have developed a novel spatial task (the Instantaneous Cue Rotation arena, ICR) that enables precise measurement of spatial behavior accuracy and flexibility in the rat. Additionally, the hippocampus and its primary afferent input, the entorhinal cortex, are recorded simultaneously in order to examine age-related changes in bi-directional interactions between these structures. The dual-structure recordings will enable identification of changes within the hippocampus proper that are driven by upstream entorhinal cortical inputs, as well as changes in the entorhinal cortex driven by degraded hippocampal feedback signals. This multi-site recording method also allows examination of neural dynamics thought to be involved in memory consolidation. Aim 2 is to understand how hippocampal representations are altered in aged freely-behaving primates. While other important questions about circuit dysfunction in aging remain to be addressed in rodent models of aging, recent advances in wireless recording technologies enable new experimental designs for primates that have the potential to test directly assumptions that our discoveries in the rat will find an analogue in the aging human brain. Free locomotion is an important missing link between the behavioral conditions employed to study place cells in rodents, and more constrained conditions under which human studies must be conducted. The experiments under this aim will implement the behavior and electrophysiological tools that allow us to determine the neural impact that aging and level of restraint has on the function of hippocampal networks in the nonhuman primate. Our hypotheses are that old monkeys will show faulty retrieval of hippocampal network patterns (similar to map retrieval failures in old rats) and that the global network activity state will be altered in both age groups when the animals are restrained, compared to when completely unrestrained and free to move. Taking advantage of new behavior and recording approaches in rodents and primates, we believe significant advances will be made in our understanding of the aging brain that will contribute substantively to the development of therapeutic or preventative treatments for cognitive decline in the elderly."
"9198810","Abstract This research challenges existing dogma for pre-emptive antibiotic use in preterm infants immediately after birth. Antibiotic use, especially when repeated, induces a perturbation (?dysbiosis?) in gut microbiota that may not recover to the basal state. A majority of preterm very low birthweight (VLBW) infants are exposed to antibiotics which have very poor evidence for such widespread use and are thus subjected to a potentially harmful course of antibiotics that provides no clear benefit. Our hypothesis is that early antibiotic use in preterm neonates has significant consequences on the developing intestinal microbiome, metabolome and host response, predisposing the neonate to various major morbidities. It is possible that the effect of this widespread antibiotic use outweighs the potential benefits. We propose a randomized trial of pre-emptive antibiotics versus no-pre-emptive antibiotics in preterms born at <33 weeks gestation. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the risks and benefits of current practice to determine optimal levels of antibiotic use that protects the babies from infection with minimal effect on the microbiome and subsequent adverse outcomes related to overuse of antibiotics. There are 2 specific aims: Aim 1. In a prospective, randomized pilot study, test the effects of pre-emptive postnatal antibiotics on the microbiome, metabolome and inflammatory responses in the neonate during the NICU course. We hypothesize that antibiotic use results in alterations in the microbial ecology of the intestinal microbiome that lasts well beyond discontinuance of antibiotic use and that this in turn results in altered fecal metabolic and inflammatory profiles that are associated with a higher incidence of adverse outcomes (Aim 2) while these infants are in the neonatal intensive care unit. Aim 2. In this same prospective, randomized pilot study, test the effects of pre-emptive postnatal antibiotics on adverse outcomes in the neonate while in the NICU. We hypothesize that higher antibiotic use will not be associated with decreased early onset sepsis and will be associated with increased adverse outcomes including necrotizing enterocolitis, late onset sepsis and mortality. At the end of this 2 year project, we will have effectively challenged existing dogma that nearly all preterm infants require at least a short course of intravenous antibiotics because of the risk of early onset sepsis. We will have a better understanding of the risks versus benefits of early pre-emptive antibiotic use in preterm infants. We will have a better understanding of the effects of antibiotics routinely given to preterm infants on the developing intestinal microbiome, metabolome and inflammatory status. It is anticipated that correlations to common morbidities such as late onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis will be found. These will provide targets for future mechanistic based studies of causality. A greater justification and guidance for larger randomized trials may also result, which in turn will lead to major improvements in clinical care of preterm infants.  "
"9188830","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional imaging studies in PTSD patients suggest that reduced activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) contributes to the excessive fear response and to the impaired response to treatment seen in these patients. To understand why the mPFC is less activated in PTSD patients, we need to understand the mechanisms by which fear conditioning and extinction alter mPFC activity. Patch-clamp recordings of mPFC neurons, which populate the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices, revealed that fear conditioning and extinction in rats induces intrinsic and synaptic changes in the mPFC. First, IL neurons showed decreased excitability after fear conditioning, and enhanced excitability after extinction. The depressed IL excitability could reduce IL activation and enhance conditioned fear responses, whereas the increased IL excitability could result in the opposite effect. Consistent with this, reducing IL intrinsic excitability enhances conditioned fear responses and increasing IL excitability enhances fear response inhibition. These findings imply that the intrinsic excitabilit state of IL is one determinant of the level of fear expression. Second, neurons from PL showed synaptic changes after fear conditioning and extinction, whereas neurons from IL showed synaptic changes only after extinction. However, the identities of the inputs onto mPFC neurons exhibiting changes in synaptic efficacy after fear conditioning and extinction remain unknown. Taken together, these findings suggest that intrinsic and synaptic changes in the mPFC mediate the formation of fear conditioning and extinction memory. The goal of this proposal is to extend these results by examining the contribution of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) in these fear conditioning- and extinction-induced intrinsic and synaptic changes in the mPFC, since extinction is context-dependent and the vHPC conveys this crucial contextual information to the mPFC via direct connections to IL and PL. In Aim 1, the role of the vHPC in mediating intrinsic excitability changes in IL will be examined. In Aim 2, the role of the vHPC in mediating synaptic plasticity in the mPFC after fear conditioning and extinction will be evaluated. The results of thi study could have important implications for human extinction-based exposure therapy, which is generally done in a context that is different from the context of the traumatic experience."
"9189615","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Zinc has been shown to have multiple important and distinct effects on synaptic transmission and has been implicated as a critical mediator of neuronal injury. We have now discovered a previously unrecognized role for zinc as a major suppressor of axon regeneration and cell survival following axonal injury in the central nervous system (CNS). Under normal conditions, neurons in the adult CNS cannot regenerate damaged axons, placing severe limitations on the amount of recovery that can occur after spinal cord injury, stroke, and other types of neurological damage. The optic nerve is an integral part of the central nervous system (CNS) that has been widely used to investigate CNS regeneration due to its accessibility, anatomical simplicity, and functional importance. Although the projection neurons of the eye, the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), are normally unable to regenerate injured axons, this inability can be partially reversed in mice by treatments that activate RGCs' intrinsic growth state and by counteracting cell-extrinsic inhibitors of axon growth. However, these manipulations result in only limited regeneration, suggesting that our current understanding of the factors that regulate neurons' regenerative potential in the CNS is incomplete. Our preliminary data show that within 6 hours after injuring the optic nerve, there is a dramatic elevation of Zn2+ in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retina, which contains synaptic contacts from amacrine and bipolar cells onto the dendrites of RGCs. This increase represents a very early event following optic nerve damage. Over the next few days, Zn2+ accumulates in RGC somata. Importantly, agents that chelate extracellular Zn2+ provide enduring protection against RGC death and have a dramatic effect on these cells' ability to regenerate injured axons through the optic nerve. We therefore hypothesize that Zn2+ is a major suppressor of the regenerative potential of axons after nerve injury as well as a cause of neuronal death. The specific aims are to: 1) Characterize the timing, localization, and mechanism of Zn2+ accumulation following optic nerve crush; 2) Determine whether Zn2+ regulates axon regeneration via histone deacetylases; and 3) Characterize the pathways by which Zn2+ suppresses, and chelation enhances, RGC survival. These studies will add greatly to our understanding of the role that Zn2+ plays in the normal and injured nervous system, and may lead to treatments to help improve outcome after CNS injury."
"9190244","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to carry out research training to develop new expertise in cognitive modeling that is inspired and constrained by neurophysiology. My previous work in human group decision making, and the sponsors' recent formulation of a novel modeling framework to explore neural ensemble decision making, yields an excellent opportunity for new training and interdisciplinary collaboration. Aim 1 will systematically investigate the relationship between neurons, instantiated as evidence accumulators, and the collective behavior of ensembles of neural accumulators in decision choice tasks; predicted choice behavior and dynamics of ensembles will be compared to observed saccade choice behavior and measured neural dynamics of awake behaving monkeys. Aim 2 will significantly extend this work by exploring alternative computational mechanisms for aggregation across accumulators in an ensemble, with hypotheses for alternative aggregation schemes drawn from other domains of group decision making. Training potential is high because the work will develop new computational models of decisions made by ensembles of neurons, an area of research in which I have no prior experience, but which offers exciting new directions for linking to my prior work on the Wisdom of Crowds. Forging novel connections between my new postdoctoral work and my previous PhD work will form a basis for my future research as an independent investigator. The findings have potential wide interest and applicability, as it may shed insight into how ensembles of neurons collectively make decisions in the brain."
"9191781","Project Summary/Abstract Frail elders living at home are a population at risk for decline and death as they often have multiple chronic conditions and complex social needs that may lead to unnecessary hospitalizations or potentially futile treatment at the end of life thereby driving up individual and public socioeconomic burdens. Advanced care planning, a process in which preferences for care at the end of life are discussed and placed in writing, is one approach to ensure that patient-centered decision making drives end of life care. Yet, only 12.5% of black and 32% of white Americans receiving home healthcare have an ACP. Despite the fact that the majority of older adults state that they would want to have discussions about care preferences, providers often remain reluctant to raise the issue when faced with prognostic uncertainty for patients who lack a clear terminal diagnosis or precipitating event. Data science methods, aimed towards discovering new knowledge in large datasets, shows tremendous potential for improving both individual and population-level quality outcomes. Nurse- scientists have made progress using these methods to improve care, increase satisfaction, and lower healthcare costs. The purpose of this study of community dwelling frail elders is to build a ?rules-based? prognostication model for clinical decision support for routine screening for mortality risk within 12 months to trigger home health nurses to identify those most at risk for dying. This data-science inquiry will use the Home Health Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to describe a variety of home healthcare measures. This study is unique because it develops and tests a novel methodological approach and because it is the only known study that will prognosticate death using a clinical outcomes measurement tool in current widespread use in this setting. The objectives of this study are aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) because it uses data- science methods to develop an evidence-based approach to improve communication, promote a shared understanding of prognosis, and facilitate patient and family-centered preferences for care at the end of life. The applicant will receive mentorship and training in data science methods from leading national and international experts in the field of health informatics, computer science, and mortality risk prognostication. The findings of this study will be foundational for an intervention study in which the predictive model is incorporated into clinical practice in an interoperable format to explore the impact that mortality risk prognostication has on the rates of advance care plans. Moreover, this study will be used to inform future research and to produce recommendations for clinical decision support to enhance bi-directional communication and collaboration between nurses, patients, families, and providers."
"9192951","This proposal requests the next stage in NICHD support for population research at UC Berkeley. The  Berkeley Population Center (BPC) capitalized on R21 developmental infrastructure funding to create an  awareness of the plentiful population research being conducted on campus among faculty, including junior  faculty, who have been historically isolated by academic department. This awareness (and support) led to  research and grant application activity. With a foundation firmly set, BPC now seeks to leverage the core  strengths of the UC Berkeley campus, beginning with the teaching and research in the Demography  Department, as well as population research conducted in the School of Public Health, Graduate School of  Public Policy, Dept. of Economics, and other schools and departments. Synergistic ties with several research  centers on campus further promote population research on campus, notably with the Center of Economics  and Demography of Aging (CEDA), Institute for the Study of Social Issues (ISSI), the Robert Wood Johnson  Scholars Program, and other centers. BPC has attracted and connected with over 60 faculty members and  other researchers on campus, as well as researchers in neighboring institutions such as UCSF, UC Davis  and Stanford University. As a result, the thematic areas in population research emerged from the unique  strengths ofthe UC Berkeley campus: Reproduction and HIV, Mortality, Health Dispahties, Inequalities and  Opportunities, Behavioral Economics, and Formal Demography. BPC research questions and methods  utilized are cross-cutting and innovative. To foster our mission of population research, we propose 3  Research Infrastructure Cores. The Research Support Core consists of two subcores: (1) Administrative  and (2) Data and Computing. Research Development is the third core. Implicit in all cores is public outreach.  These cores will provide support for BPC affiliates by assisting with the identification of relevant grants,  assistance with grant application preparation and administration, providing hardware and software for data  analysis, and awarding pilot grants for projects with solid potential for external funding."
"9195247","Aging and age related co-morbidities are major risk factors for neurological pathologies. As the population ages, this puts a major strain on public health. One population that is particularly at risk in the United States are human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected individuals as more than half of the population is now 50 years of age or older. Infected individuals show signs of premature aging and are prone to neurological dysfunctions collectively known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The persistence of HAND has been troubling since with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the virus is sufficiently suppressed. Possible contributors to HAND therefore include the HAART drugs themselves as well as reservoirs of the gp120 viral envelope protein hidden in the CNS. Since advancing age is critical for HAND, it is likely that there is an interaction between aging and the factors that influence HAND pathology. We propose that an age associated stress response in astrocytes known as cellular senescence in response to HAART drugs and gp120 could be a contributor to HAND. We will examine the senescence-associated DNA damage response, telomere damage and oxidative stress pathways activated in response to these stimuli. Since senescence is accompanied by the secretion of pro-inflammatory proteins known as the senescence- associated secretory phenotype, we will also determine the contribution of senescent astrocytes to inflammation in response to these HIV-associated stimuli. We will also determine which signaling mechanisms contribute to the secretions by using pharmacological inhibitors of major inflammatory centers. Neurons are also sensitive to glial activation and their toxicity in response to activated glia are another possible HAND contributor. We will examine if secretions from HIV-associated senescent astrocyte are able to cause neurotoxicity and whether pharmacological inhibition of inflammation can mitigate this response. Our overall objective is to determine the interaction between aging and HIV-associated factors as a contributor to HAND. Since many age associated pathologies are associated with the accumulation of senescent cells, astrocyte senescence in response to HAART drugs and gp120 could be a major contributor to HAND and Inhibition of this response could be a public health boon as a potential therapy."

"9215316","Tumor-specific metabolic alterations have been increasingly recognized as a driving force of tumor growth. Glutamine (Gln) is the most abundant amino acid in the blood. Glucose and Gln are two major nutrients utilized by cancers to meet the demand for energy production and biosynthesis. Gln is metabolized through the glutaminolysis pathway, which is highly active in many aggressive forms of human cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), pancreatic and lung cancer, lymphoma and glioblastoma. The first and rate-limiting step of glutaminolysis is catalyzed by mitochondrial glutaminase (GLS) that converts glutamine to glutamate. Drugs targeting key steps of glutaminolysis pathway are being developed, and promising inhibitors of GLS have advanced to early phase clinical trials. However, there are no current clinically feasible methods to estimate the level of cancer glutamine metabolism, nor is there a non-invasive marker that can report the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of GLS inhibitors. These unmet needs provide strong motivation to develop imaging-based methods to measure cellular glutaminolysis in order to direct GLS-targeted therapy, the focus of this proposal.  To interrogate in vivo glutamine metabolism in cancer, our Center has designed and developed two positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probes: L-[5-11C]Glutamine ([11C]Gln) and (2S,4R)-4[18F]Glutamine ([18F]Fluoroglutamine or [18F]4F-Gln ). This project aims to develop and validate quantitative analysis tools for [11C]Gln and [18F]4F-Gln PET using human breast cancer xenografts. Based on our preliminary studies, we have designed studies to test the central hypothesis that the distribution volume of [18F]4F-Gln is a marker of tumor glutamine pool that is an indirect measure of glutamine metabolism, while flux through GLS measured by [11C]Gln PET is an authentic marker of tumor GLS activity. The utility of these markers to report the pharmacodynamic effect of novel glutaminase inhibitor will be developed and validated using breast cancer xenograft models based on cell lines of different breast cancer subtype with varied degrees of dependence on glutamine.  The outcome of the proposed project will fulfill the unmet clinical needs for quantitative, non-invasive tools capable of predicting and measuring response to glutamine-targeted therapies. These tools will be ready for clinical trials upon completion of this project to play a critical role in development and deployment of such therapies in patients."
"9198976","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In tropical settings, the diagnosis of infectious etiologies of fever remains challenging, owing to the complex epidemiology of parasitic, viral, fungal, and bacterial causes and the suboptimal performance of current diagnostics. Multiplex molecular pathogen detection systems are now routinely used in the developed world to interrogate respiratory and blood specimens, and there remains an ongoing need for simple, rapid, multiplex, and sensitive platforms for point-of-care diagnostics for tropical pathogens. In this project, a novel nanophotonic, PCR-free, incubation- independent, sequence-based detection platform for bloodborne tropical pathogens that cause fever will be developed and field-tested. Specifically, in the initial R21 phase, a multiplex nanophotonic chip based upon plasmonic `nano-rattles' will be designed and engineered that can detect unamplified nucleic acid targets in two species of malaria parasites, dengue and chikungunya viruses, spotted fever group Rickettsia, and Leptospira interrogans, and its operating characteristics will be quantified by comparison with reference diagnostics using banked field samples from Kenya, Cambodia, and Sri Lanka. Upon achievement of transition milestones based upon these operating characteristics, in the R33 phase, the assay will be further developed by 1) engineering and building an integrated testing unit suitable for field use, and 2) deploying the assay for pathogen detection in prospective cohorts of febrile patients at field sites in western Kenya and western Thailand. The overall goal of this project is to produce a field-ready diagnostic system which sensitively and simultaneously detects 6 major bloodborne tropical pathogens in unprocessed whole blood specimens. To achieve this, this proposal is submitted by co-PIs with expertise in nanoplasmonics, bioassay development, optical sensing, tropical medicine, and epidemiology, and partners with collaborators in molecular diagnostics and tropical clinical research. This interdisciplinary team of investigators is committed to improving molecular diagnostics for tropical pathogens in order to improve the clinical care of patients with fever in the tropics and enhance the ability to track and detect emerging tropical diseases."
"9215155","1 PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT (~30 lines)  2 Bronchiolitis is the #1 cause of hospitalization in US infants, with ~130,000 hospitalizations 3 annually. Small cohort studies (n<210) suggest that 40-50% of infants hospitalized with  4 bronchiolitis will subsequently develop asthma. The greatest challenges for developing primary 5 prevention strategies for this large group of children are the very early identification of  6 modifiable risk factors and the heterogeneity of asthma. The 35th Multicenter Airway Research  7 Collaboration (MARC-35) study (U01AI-87881; Camargo, PI) is a 17-center prospective cohort  8 study that completed enrollment of 921 hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis in 2014. In this  9 diverse cohort (53% African-American or Hispanic), investigators have collected biospecimens, 10 including nasal swabs at the index hospitalization (median age 3 months). Follow-up data 11 include biannual parent interviews and medical records to age 5 years, with >90% follow-up to 12 date. This competitive renewal would extend this largest, most comprehensive severe 13 bronchiolitis cohort in the world by conducting an in-person examination at age 6 years to 14 diagnose and phenotype asthma and by examining nasal airway microRNA and NF?B signaling 15 mediators/outcomes, at both the index hospitalization and at age 6 years. In Aim 1, we will 16 identify nasal airway microRNAs that are prospectively associated with asthma at age 6 years. 17 In Aim 2, we will determine the inter-relations among airway microRNAs and inflammatory 18 response (e.g., NF?B signaling) and their integrated contributions to risk of incident asthma. 19 Pilot data provide compelling support for our hypotheses. Lastly, using a systems biology 20 approach, Aim 3 will define asthma endotypes by integrating clinical phenotype and molecular 21 data (e.g., airway microRNAs and NF?B signaling) at age 6 years. Among these infants with 22 severe bronchiolitis ? a natural experiment ? we will have a unique opportunity to identify airway 23 microRNAs associated with incident asthma during an important period of lung development 24 that would provide a critical window for primary intervention. Furthermore, using innovative 25 approaches, we will not only investigate underlying mechanisms linking bronchiolitis to incident 26 asthma (e.g., enhanced NF?B signaling) but also identify phenotypes/endotypes of asthma that 27 are likely to respond differently to different interventions. The study will provide a strong 28 evidence base for primary prevention through the future development of targeted interventions 29 (e.g., microRNA-targeting therapy). The investigators are NIH-funded researchers with 30 international expertise in the field. The study advances research on the primary prevention of 31 childhood asthma, and matches well with the 2013 NIAID Strategic Plan."
"9216793","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mutations in RAS proteins, in particular K-ras, are common in human cancer, and the signaling pathways emanating from this oncoprotein have been examined in detail. Despite intensive efforts to translate this knowledge into improved cancer care, K-ras mutant tumors remain a formidable scientific and clinical challenge. In this proposal, we focus on individual KRAS mutations that are commonly found in colorectal cancer (CRC), because these mutations are associated with different sensitivities to targeted inhibitors and thus may engage distinct signaling programs and require individualized therapeutic strategies. To access and exploit these distinct programs, we employ an innovative mass spectrometry-based technique that enables the majority of the human kinome to be analyzed simultaneously, providing the means to explore the K-ras induced kinome in an unbiased fashion. Our unique approach combines mass spectrometry and protein kinase-capture beads to monitor activated protein kinases from tumor cells, providing the ?big picture? of tumor kinase activity. Using this technology, in Aim 1 we will measure the basal activity of the kinome in (i) a model isogenic CRC system that represents common CRC associated KRAS mutant alleles and (ii) a panel of well characterized human KRAS mutant CRC cell lines, before and after KRAS knockdown, to identify kinases whose activity is dependent on expression of the various mutant forms of this oncogene. In Aim 2, we will explore the resiliency of the CRC KRAS kinome(s) to MEK inhibition to identify and target compensatory kinases that promote resistance. In Aim 3, we will use this information to carry out a targeted synthetic lethal screen in vivo, testing the effectiveness of inhibiting these activated protein kinases in KRAS dependent CRC xenografts and in CRC knock-in mouse models driven by a common KRAS exon 2 (G12D) or an exon 4 (A146T) mutation. In this way, we hope to identify individualized kinase inhibitor combinations that are effective in treating these common types of K-ras- driven CRC."
"9222517","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Parasitic nematodes are responsible for numerous chronically incapacitating and deforming diseases in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Among these diseases is lymphatic filariasis, which is a mosquito-transmitted disease, endemic to 81 countries. It is estimated that 120 million people are infected with this disease. Enzymes that are essential to the parasitic nematodes but that do not have a human homologue are potential drug targets for therapeutic intervention. The availability of the genome from B. malayi, the representative organism for filarial nematodes, has enabled the ranking of potential drug targets from this parasitic organism. One such enzyme is trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (T6PP), which is required for the biosynthesis of trehalose. The oblation of T6PP activity in the C. elegans model commonly used for parasitic nematodes ultimately leads to organism death, probably due to the accumulation of trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P). In our collaborative research project we have solved the structure of B. malayi T6PP, determined those residues critical to T6P binding, developed substrate analogs, established a high-throughput assay for inhibitor screening and utilized that screen to find two nanomolar-affinity lead inhibitors. One of the lead compounds discovered by screening, Closantel, shows in vivo activity against B. malayi, and notably against adult worms which current treatments fail to achieve. The proposed objective is to develop advanced leads based on the compounds already identified via screening to enhance potency and availability and to determine the mechanism of T6P toxicity. The research plan is focused on four Aims.  Aim 1 (R21) will deliver 1) structure-activity relationship analysis on principle hits Closantel and Cephalosporin C via synthesis and testing in vitro on B. malayi T6PP and in vivo on C. elegans 2) in vitro stability tests in rat plasma and liver S9 fractions 3) X-ray crystal structures of B. malayi T6PP complexed with inhibitors, 4) tests of principle hits and variants in a SAXS-based screen as additional insight into SAR and mechanism of action. Aim 2 (R21) will 1) provide counter-screening against phosphatases from the same and other phosphatase families to ensure selectivity, 2) develop a panel of orthologous T6PP enzymes from other parasitic nematodes for inhibition kinetics (and possibly crystallography) to provide the basis for broad- spectrum anti-helminthics. Aim 3 (R33) will 1) test for inhibitory activity in vivo in B. malayi 2) perform metabolism, preliminary pharmacokinetic and cytotoxicity studies 3) determine the mechanism of the anti- metabolite activity of T6P by quantifying levels of T6P accompanying toxicity and assessing the effect of T6P on primary metabolic enzymes. Aim 4 (R33) will test the advanced leads in a B. malayi gerbil infection model.  The proposed research will deliver advanced leads that show selective killing action for the treatment of disease(s) inflicting the large segment of the world?s population suffering from infection by parasitic nematodes."
"9226933","Immunosuppressants are absolutely essential for successful organ transplantation and are useful in the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Analyzing their mechanism of action can, as in the case of cyclosporine and calcineurin, yield important insights into basic features of T cell biology. We recently embarked upon an ambitious three-step project intended to use chemical biology approaches to identify unknown pathways involved in lymphocyte function. The over-arching rationale underlying the project was that compounds that inhibit T cell activation and work via unknown molecular mechanism (MMOA) could be developed into chemical probes that could be used to identify novel cellular targets, which would reveal currently-unknown aspects of basic T cell biology and might become the basis for new classes of immunosuppressant agents. The first step of the project- screening the NIH's Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository of ~375,000 compounds and identifying compounds with unknown MMOA- succeeded. We monitored lytic granule exocytosis using TALL-104 human cytotoxic T lymphocytes as a model, measuring externalization of LAMP-1/ CD107a using flow cytometry. Among hits with unknown MMOA was 2-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-4-N-[(4- propan-2-ylphenyl)methyl]thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, CID 49792547, which is the subject of this application. This compound inhibits lytic granule exocytosis with potency in the micromolar range, but does not work via any of the mechanisms we tested. It inhibits IL-2 production by Jurkat human leukemic T cells, confirming that has broad immunosuppressive activity. It is a drug-like molecule that is amenable to synthesis and the generation of diverse analogs. The project's intended second step was to generate analogs for structure-activity analysis, then use that information to design chemical probes to use in the third and final step, applying affinity-based and/or photo- crosslinking approaches to identify the unknown target that underlies the compound's activity. However, Chemistry Center support was withdrawn when the NIH MLPCN program ended. This application for an R03 is intended to allow us to continue to pursue the overall goals of the project by creating probes for target identification. We will create analogs of CID 49792547, then test their effects on lytic granule exocytosis, IL-2 secretion and toxicity. This information will allow us to identify the highest possible affinity analogs and will reveal sites that can be used to attach linkers which will allow the compound to be coupled to biotin for creation of an affinity matrix and to bifunctional photo-crosslinking/ click-chemistry groups that can be used to label target proteins. Future efforts will be directed towards target identification using probes developed in this application and in a companion application submitted previously focused on another compound."
"9230098","PROJECT SUMMARY This application is responsive to PA-15-313, Research to Advance Vaccine Safety (R21). Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used as a live vaccine for smallpox, a disease caused by variola virus. VACV has also been successfully used as a live viral vector for the development of effective human and animal vaccines, as well as immunotherapies and oncolytic virotherapies. However, VACV can cause complications in individuals with conditions such as atopic dermatitis, cardiac disease, and immunosuppression. Consequently, individuals with such conditions or with contacts that have these conditions are contraindicated for vaccination with replicating VACV vectors. We recently generated VACV vectors with a built-in safety mechanism that replicate only in the presence of tetracycline (TC) antibiotics (replication-inducible VACVs). In this system, a VACV gene essential for replication (eg, D6R) is inducibly expressed by TCs using elements of the tet operon. When administered as a vaccine (in the absence of antibiotics), the vector does not replicate but retains its immunogenicity, and therefore is safer for human use. Conveniently, the vector can be propagated in cell culture at high titers in the presence of TCs, unlike other replication-defective VACV-based vectors such as MVA. We also developed VACV vectors that replicate normally in the absence of antibiotics, but are replication-defective in the presence of TCs (replication-repressible VACVs). When administered as a vaccine (in the absence of antibiotics), the vector is replication competent like traditional VACV vectors (and therefore highly immunogenic), and treatment of any adverse reactions would be as simple as TC antibiotic therapy. We can further enhance the safety of our vectors by a fail-safe feature that links expression of the essential gene (D6R) with interferon-? (IFN-?), via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). We showed that expression of IFN-? by VACV, either constitutively or inducibly, leads to complete attenuation of VACV in vivo, even when expressed at very low levels. Surprisingly, the virus is still able to grow to wild-type levels in vitro. Thus, both strategies can be combined to develop replication-defective VACVs inducibly or repressibly expressing D6R (under its natural promoter) and IFN-? (under a small murine IRES). The resulting vectors should be able to grow to high titers in vitro (thus allowing propagation) in the presence of TCs (inducible vectors) or absence of TCs (repressible vectors). Since expression of D6R will be linked to IFN-? expression, any potential replication-competent VACV that may originate during in vitro propagation or in vivo administration would be replication-incompetent in vivo due to concomitant expression of IFN-?. In Aim 1 we will determine the safety of replication-inducible and replication-repressible VACV vectors in vivo using immunodeficient SCID mice. In Aim 2, we will develop, characterize, and determine the safety of replication-defective VACV vectors with a fail-safe feature. We plan to use this VACV vaccine platform for rapid development of safe vaccines for infectious diseases such as Zika virus, immunotherapies (eg, personalized cancer vaccines), and oncolytic virotherapies."
"9237220","The Patients and Survivors Program (PS) has 23 core members distributed across two themes. Members have appointments in four schools and eleven departments. During the current funding year, cancer-related funding for this program totaled $12M in total costs. Of this amount, peer-reviewed funding totaled $7.8M in total costs, including $3.5M from the NCI. As with other programs, the JCCC fosters many interactive activities and shared resources that support investigators in PS. During the current grant cycle, funds from the JCCC in the form of CCSG developmental funds, institutional support and philanthropic gifts to PS total $3,475,196. These funds supported seed grants, program leadership support, funding for special workshops and trainees. Sixteen PS members were recipients of JCCC support. PS members published 507 peer reviewed papers during the recent five-year renewal period, with 171 publications (34%) appearing in highimpact journals. The PS is highly interactive with 112 (22%) of its 507publications reflecting intraprogrammatic efforts and 58 (11%) reporting inter-programmatic collaborations. Accruals to therapeutic trials totaled 32, prevention trials 116, supportive care 1,751, epidemiologic/obs/outcome 16,921, ancillary/companion 185, and correlative 1,247 for a total of 20,252 subjects. PS has as its major goal the reduction in avoidable morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer and long-term survivors of cancer. The two main themes of the program are: 1) Quality-of-life/outcomes research, including late medical and psychosocial effects; and 2) Quality of cancer care, its measurement and evaluation. In both of these areas members focus on fundamental, investigator-initiated research, with extensive translational and transdisciplinary components. Program discoveries are being brought to the clinic and the community, as well as to broader testing arenas, such as Phase III clinical trials funded by the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). PS members are national and international leaders in survivorship, cancer outcomes assessment and quality of care research. Future program plans include continued translation and dissemination of research findings through implementation science and health policy engagement, as well as sustained emphasis on investigator-initiated research."

To achieve its goals, the FCSR houses five analytic flow cytometers, three high-speed FACSAria cell sorters, a RoboSep magnetic cell separator and a freestanding analysis station. The FCSR is easily accessible and is responsible for procurement, daily calibration, maintenance and repair of all instrumentation. FCSR personnel have a combined 98 years of experience in flow cytometry; their expertise is available to investigators through one-on-one consultation, frequent classes, a website, poster presentations and scheduled open houses. Schmid and Jamieson (Tl) also work with researchers to adapt or develop assays to enable investigators to pursue research questions in novel ways. FCSR services help researchers with a widely varied range of experience in flow cytometry to perform high quality assays with minimal time expenditure. Workshops, seminars and implementation of new assays ensure that researchers remain on the cutting-edge of flow cytometry without the necessity of investing their own funds or staff time to keep current in the latest advances. Cytometric instrumentation is expensive and beyond the budget of most individual researchers. Therefore, the FCSR provides instrumentation, as well as additional cost savings to researchers, by obtaining grant and institutional support to help offset the cost of purchasing, maintaining and operating those instruments. From 07/01/2011 to 06/30/2012, the FCSR had 170 users, 110 of whom were JCCC members, representing eight Cancer Center Program Areas. Of the 110 member users, 95 had peer-reviewed funding and 15 did not have peer-reviewed funding."
"9233469","Project Summary  Neonatal resuscitation can be challenging for healthcare teams due to its complex nature, requiring a combination of content knowledge, technical skills, behavioral skills, and teamwork. Simulation as a training tool can address this complex skill and also address the infrequent nature of resuscitations in conditions such as very preterm birth or hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. While simulation is common in neonatal resuscitation training, the effectiveness of using simulation on actual clinical outcomes is unknown.  We will test whether using in situ simulation training ? simulation training in the actual setting that healthcare teams practice ? improves team performance and clinical outcomes. This hypothesis will be tested in a stepped wedge trial in a large population-based quality improvement network. A stepped wedge trial allows for all participants to receive the intervention, and therefore increases recruitment ability and gives all participants to benefit from the intervention. In this design, the intervention is rolled out over time with some centers starting earlier than others. Each center is able to then serve as its own control, increasing the power to make comparisons. The setting of this research project will be the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative (CPQCC), a population-based network of neonatal intensive care units. CPQCC includes both academic and community units, which means that results will be generalizable. CPQCC already has an existing data infrastructure that includes maternal and neonatal data, including follow-up data at 2 years of age giving an opportunity to study outcomes that does not exist in similar networks.  In this project, 40 hospitals will engage in a proven quality improvement model for neonatal resuscitation. In a stepwise fashion, each unit will learn and implement in situ simulation. The setting of the CPQCC allows for a unique opportunity to study the impact of training programs on important clinical outcomes for the most common cause of mortality and long-term morbidity in newborns, preterm birth. In Aim 1, we will assess whether in situ simulation improves clinical outcomes for preterm infants. In Aim 2, we will assess whether better team performance in simulation predicts better clinical outcomes. This will help to inform training methodologies and assessment in neonatal resuscitation. In Aim 3, we will examine facilitators and barriers of implementing simulation training across hospitals. This will inform the implementation of training programs across hospitals to improve neonatal resuscitation. In Aim 4, we will evaluate perform an economic evaluation of in situ simulation and implementation.  The results of this research will provide a clearer understanding of how simulation can be used as an assessment tool, and more importantly the impact that it can have on improving clinical outcomes."
"9237790","ABSTRACT Impaired tissue vascularization is a critical feature of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and diabetes and can lead to tissue necrosis and amputation. Several clinical strategies have been designed to increase revascularization in PAD patients beyond the current standard of care (e.g., endovascular procedures and bypass grafting), including delivery of growth factors and cell-based therapies. While variably successful, these therapies have limited efficacy in part because they do not address the underlying chronic inflammation, which is a primary feature of PAD and diabetes. Tissue revascularization is a critical component of normal wound- healing and is regulated in part by macrophages. Resolvins are a new family of lipid mediators biosynthesized during the resolution phase of inflammation by macrophages. Resolvins limit inflammatory signaling and neutrophil chemotaxis, while simultaneously promoting the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages. In this funding period, we found that diabetes impairs resolution and that resolvins restore defective resolution and promote cutaneous wound healing in diabetes. Our recent results indicate that resolvins promote ischemic revascularization, suggesting that they have new roles in activating the wound-healing program. This renewal is designed to test the innovative hypothesis that resolvins generated by macrophages promote revascularization during hind limb ischemia (HLI). This hypothesis postulates that by resolving inflammation, resolvins can also rescue defective revascularization in atherosclerosis and diabetes. Specific aims of this application are: 1. Determine the biosynthesis and endogenous roles of resolvins in revascularization during HLI. We identified resolvin D1 (RvD1) and RvD2 in both skeletal muscle and bone marrow during HLI. Here, we will determine how their production relates to inflammation-resolution and revascularization, determine how resolvin production is affected by adoptive transfer of monocytes, and how genetic deficiency of recently identified RvD1 and RvD2 receptors impacts revascularization; 2. Delineate the mechanisms whereby resolvins enhance ischemic revascularization. We found that resolvins enhance limb perfusion during HLI by promoting arteriogenesis. In this aim, we will determine whether their actions in promoting arteriogenesis are affected by genetic deficiency of resolvin receptors in myeloid cells or endothelial cells and determine how resolvins regulate arteriogenic phenotypes of macrophages and endothelial cells; and 3. Assess whether resolvins promote revascularization in mice with pre-existing atherosclerosis or diabetes. We will determine how these chronic inflammatory diseases impact resolvin biosynthesis and eicosanoid tissue profiles and whether resolvins enhance revascularization while resolving inflammation. Completion of these aims will provide entirely new information about the biological functions of resolvins that could potentially lead to the development of a new class of therapeutics that both resolve inflammation and increase tissue perfusion."
"9237836","ABSTRACT  Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that cause disease in human and animal populations worldwide. C. trachomatis is the most prominent cause of both bacterial sexually transmitted disease and infectious blindness in the world. Peptidoglycan (PG) plays a critical role in the physiology of all bacteria. It determines cell morphology, provides protection against osmotic stress, and plays a critical role in cell division. Fragments of PG are also recognized by mammalian receptors and stimulate the host inflammatory response during bacterial infection. Although recent metabolic labeling techniques finally succeeded in demonstrating the presence of PG in Chlamydia, large gaps in our knowledge still remain. What role does PG play in cell division? How are PG glycan chains assembled in the chlamydial periplasm? How does Chlamydia limit the production of degradation fragments that can stimulate the innate immune response? Chlamydia infection in both the ocular as well as genital niches induces a severe inflammatory response that leads to tissue damage including blindness and pelvic inflammatory disease. It is unclear to what extent components of Chlamydia PG are responsible for this response. We need more insight into how Chlamydia synthesizes and degrades its peptidoglycan to better understand the pathologic processes of Chlamydia disease.  The long-term goal is to determine the functions of peptidoglycan in Chlamydia physiology, specifically in cell division and development. The central hypothesis to be tested is that the PG synthesized by Chlamydia plays critical roles in cell division and the host immune response. A major focus will be on PG assembly, degradation, and recycling, which we hypothesize are central to these processes.  The interrelated Specific Aims of this proposal are: 1. Elucidate the role played by PG in chlamydial cell division 2. Identify and characterize the genes involved in assembly/polymerization and degradation of chlamydial PG 3. Determine the fate and immunostimulatory potential of chlamydial PG muropeptides subsequent to their degradation  Breakthrough technologies in experimental manipulation of Chlamydia make our proposal feasible: genetic transformation of Chlamydia, complementation vectors, inducible promoter constructs for controlled gene expression in Chlamydia, and allelic exchange/knockout mutagenesis. We will also employ metabolic labeling of PG, immune-reporter assays, mass spectroscopy, and superresolution microscopy. This research will fill in critical gaps in our understanding of Chlamydia growth and its recognition by host cells. The knowledge gained will provide information that may translate into new drugs to inhibit chlamydial PG synthesis or disrupt the PG fragments that can trigger the severe inflammation that accompanies Chlamydia infection."
"9237948","Title: Epigenetic Mechanisms of Developmental Regulation of Fetal, Newborn, and Adult Cerebral Artery Sympathetic Innervation and Alpha1 Adrenergic Receptor Subtypes Project Summary: During the past half century there has been the rising rate of preterm birth combined with a lowering of the age limit of viability. The premature fetus is more prone to germinal matrix and other intracerebral hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, and related problems as a consequence of stress during the process of birth. In contrast, the term-fetus is able to autoregulate cerebral blood ?ow (CBF) despite the increase in systemic pressure and minimize the occurrence of stress-induced hemorrhages. Recently, we have demonstrated that lack of cerebral blood ?ow (CBF) autoregulation in the premature fetus is associated with immaturity of the sympathetic (adrenergic) system. In concert with this, we also have demonstrated that the adrenergic system undergoes a signi?cant maturation with development. In the proposed studies, we attempt to determine the mechanisms by which the premature fetus can have greater cerebral autoregulation capability, as observed in the newborn lamb. In the ?rst three speci?c aims, ex-vivo, we will examine the role of DNA methylation, histone modi?cations, microRNA, and lncRNA on the expression of the three alpha 1 adrenergic receptor subtypes in premature fetus, near-term fetus, newborn lamb, and adult sheep. In the fourth speci?c aim, in vivo, in the chronically catheterized preterm fetus, near-term fetus, newborn lamb, and adult sheep, we will determine the effect of DNA methylation, histone modi?cations, microRNAs, lncRNA, and alpha 1-adrenergic receptor subtypes in CBF regulation with development in both the sexes. Overall, these studies will provide vital insights in the sympathetic regulation of CBF with development, and suggest approaches to prevent or ameliorate CBF dysregulation."
"9238370","ABSTRACT Audiometry, or threshold testing at frequencies essential for speech understanding, is the most common and universally accepted metric for hearing health. However, it is becoming clear from animal studies that there can be significant inner ear damage that is undetected by threshold measures and among hearing impaired individuals there can be substantial variability in functional metrics of hearing such as hearing in noise even across individuals with similar thresholds and no evidence of retrocochlear pathology. These findings have generated tremendous interest in ?hidden hearing loss? characterized by inner ear damage that is undetected by threshold measures. There is now speculation that loss of afferent synapses may underlie hearing-in-noise deficits, hyperacusis, and tinnitus. However, what is the evidence for functional deficits and where do these deficits begin? Surprisingly, there is no current evidence of any significant functional deficits associated with synaptopathy in animals and there is no compelling evidence in humans. Thus, it is essential to determine the critical boundaries for when functional deficits associated with hidden hearing loss begin. Establishing the relationship between specific patterns of cochlear damage such as loss of inner hair cells (IHC) or synapses and the corresponding functional deficits undetected by thresholds are critical in understanding risk factors, early detection, and intervention for early onset or undetected hearing loss. The overall aims of this proposal is to evaluate functional hearing impairment in an animal model with degradation of afferent synapses using noise-exposure or selective ototoxic loss of inner hair cells in the absence of corresponding threshold elevations. Specifically, what is the effect of this ?hidden? but significant cochlear pathology on hearing-in-noise, intensity discrimination, forward masking, tinnitus and physiological correlates of functional hearing? When do these deficits begin? When completed, this work will explicitly define the functional deficits encompassed within ?hidden hearing losses? induced by noise exposure or carboplatin. These data will provide the evidence urgently needed to guide potential changes to auditory monitoring plans recommended as best practice in hearing conservation programs, enhance site of lesion diagnosis, and reveal hidden functional deficit targets for rehabilitative purposes."
"9240383","Project Abstract Primary hyperparathyroidism, often caused by a single adenoma (80-85%) or four-gland hyperplasia (10-15%), can lead to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and resultant hypercalcemia. Surgical excision of offending lesions is the standard of care, as the removal of pathologic adenomas reduces PTH and calcium values to baseline and avoids the risk of associated morbidities like insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, low mineral bone density, and nephrolithiasis. The small size, variable location, and indistinct external features of parathyroid glands can make their identification quite challenging intraoperatively. Distinguishing them from adjacent fat, lymph tissue, or thymus tissue may be complicated further in previously operated necks. Patient prognosis depends heavily on complete resection of the involved parathyroid glands. The inability to accurately localize the parathyroid glands during parathyroidectomy and thyroidectomy procedures can prevent patients from achieving postoperative normocalcemia. There is a critical need for an improved intraoperative method for real-time parathyroid localization. The goal of this proposal is to develop new optical methods based on Dynamic Optical Contrast Imaging (DOCI) characterized by speed, low cost, and improved sensitivity and specificity, for enhancing intraoperative parathyroid localization. The imaging system leverages a novel realization of temporally dependent measurements of tissue autofluorescence that allow the acquisition of specific tissue properties over a large field of view. This system is optimized such that it can be used by surgeons at the time of resection surgery to localize parathyroid tissue and has been extensively validated in ex vivo samples. Companion histology has verified the sensitivity and specificity of the technique. In the proposed work we will reconfigure the imaging system for a large field of view (FOV), then pursue an intraoperative study using DOCI to localize parathyroid tissue. Companion visible imagery and histology will be analyzed at all stages of the work ensuring statistical diagnostic power of the technique. The goal of these surgeries is to remove the diseased thyroid or parathyroid tissues while minimizing risks to surrounding nerves and vessels. Noninvasive, real-time imaging methods that can accurately and efficiently identify parathyroid gland tissue in vivo and differentiate it from surrounding neck tissues would be transformative in gland localization. We hypothesize that the accuracy and efficiency of parathyroid resection will improve significantly when aided by our optical imaging technology. This intraoperative instrument would be the first of its kind, giving us the potential to significantly improve the rapid localization of parathyroid tissue, thus enabling the surgeon to preserve healthy tissue and improve patient outcomes."
"9242228","PROJECT SUMMARY Episodic memory, or the ability to remember  past events with specific detail, is central to the human experience and is related to learning and adaptive functioning in a variety of domains. In typically developing children, episodic memory improves emerges during infancy and improves during early childhood and beyond. Despite remarkable early episodic memory skills, most early recollections are lost to infantile amnesia, individuals' inability to recall events occurred in the first 2 or 3 years of life. Neuroscientific research has shown that the hippocampus plays a fundamental role in episodic memory, supporting the formation and retrieval of representations that bind the different aspects of an event. Of importance, developmental processes within the hippocampus are hypothesized to be primarily responsible for both the early emergence of episodic memory in children and the loss of early recollections due to infantile amnesia. However, these hypotheses are based on non-human models and no direct in-vivo evidence of early hippocampal contribution to early memory functioning and loss is available to date. This limitation is mostly due to the methodological challenge of acquiring neuroimaging data, particularly task-related functional neuroimaging data, from young children. The proposed research will explore new methods to test hippocampal structure and function in toddlers and begin to examine within-individual changes that underlie improvements and loss of episodic memory performance from 25 to 40 months, a period during which episodic memory improves, but infantile amnesia operates. Relevance to Public Health: Healthy episodic memory provides a foundation for the emergence and development of autobiographical memory, continuity of self from past to future, and is associated with the skills assessed in many measures of intellectual ability and achievement. Finally, the development of episodic memory is impaired following even mild forms of acquired neurological insult, mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, and neurodevelopmental disorders underscoring that a characterization of its development is key to understanding adaptive functioning in various populations of children."
"9245898","Project Summary/Abstract:  This application is for the formation of an Adult Clinical Center in response to RFA-RM-15-015 ?Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Clinical Centers (U01)? (MoTrPAC).  Physical activity is an important lifestyle behavior that has been shown to be associated with morbidity and mortality from numerous chronic diseases. This has led to current public health recommendations of 150 min/wk of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 min/wk of vigorous physical activity to achieve significant health- related benefits, and for recommendations to engage in resistance exercise. Despite the abundance of data to support physical activity as a key lifestyle factor that can prevent, delay, or reverse the onset of a variety of health-related conditions, the specific underlying physiological mechanisms and pathways by which this occurs are not fully established.  Our team of investigators is well-positioned to be an Adult Clinical Center and achieve the goals and objectives outlined in this RFA. We have the capacity in Pittsburgh to recruit, retain, train, and assess the 450 participants that are required at each Adult Clinical Center. We will recruit 450 participants at the Pittsburgh Adult Clinical Center, which will include untrained subjects who will be randomized to the intervention (72% of the sample, N=324) or control condition (12% of the sample, N=54) and trained subjects (16% of the sample, N=72).  Untrained participants will be randomized to one of the following for a period of 12 weeks: 1) Control (UN- CON) that will maintain their current level of physical activity; 2) Moderate-Intensity Physical Activity (UN-MOD) that will progress to 150 min/wk of supervised moderate-intensity endurance physical activity; 3) Vigorous- Intensity Physical Activity (UN-VIG) that will progress to 75 min/wk of supervised vigorous-intensity endurance physical activity; 4) Resistance Training (UN-RES) that will engage in supervised resistance exercise. In addition, exercise trained participants (50% endurance trained, 50% resistance trained) will be recruited and will undergo baseline testing only.  Thus, we propose to form an Adult Clinical Center at the University of Pittsburgh to achieve the following objectives of MoTrPAC: 1. To recruit, retain, and collect data on 450 participants (378 untrained and 72 trained) at the Pittsburgh site  that will contribute to the 2,700 total participants across the Adult Clinical Centers. 2. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our training program, we will compare changes in cardiorespiratory  fitness in untrained participants randomized to 12-weeks of moderate-intensity endurance exercise training  (UN-MOD), vigorous-intensity endurance exercise training (UN-VIG), resistance training (UN-RES) or control (UN-CON). 3. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our training program, we will compare changes in musculoskeletal  fitness in untrained participants randomized to 12-weeks of UN-MOD, UN-VIG, UN-RES, or UN-CON. 4. To compare cardiorespiratory fitness in participants recruited as endurance trained to participants  randomized to UN-MOD and UN-VIG following 12 weeks of training. 5. To compare musculoskeletal fitness in participants recruited as endurance trained to participants randomized  to UN-RES following 12 weeks of training. 6. To collect phenotypic data that will allow for characterization of the study participants. These data will be  provided to the Coordinating Center and utilized by the Bioinformatics Center, Metabolomics and Proteomics  Analysis Sites, and Genomics, Epigenomics, and Transcriptomics Analysis Sites. 7. To collect biological data according to the study protocol that will provide data to examine the molecular and  cellular transducers in response to acute and chronic exposure to endurance or resistance exercise training.

Our Exercise and Physical Activity Collaborative Team (ExPACT) ? an alliance of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Center for Exercise Medicine (UAB), Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes in Orlando, Florida (TRI-MD), and Ball State University Human Performance Laboratory (BSU) ? has extensive experience performing highly-controlled aerobic (AT) and resistance (RT) exercise training clinical trials in healthy and diseased populations. We have a lengthy history of maximizing human biospecimens (muscle, adipose, blood) to reveal molecular underpinnings linked to physiological and clinical outcomes of acute and chronic exercise stimuli. Moreover, the overarching goal of ExPACT is to contribute substantively to successful MoTrPAC planning, execution, and innovation. Phase I (Planning Year) Aim 1. We will effectively collaborate with MoTrPAC leaders and NIH leadership to help guide and finalize the structure and standard operating procedures (SOPs). Aim 2. Leveraging institutional resources committed to ExPACT and our previous experience, we propose to collect pilot biospecimens to facilitate the MoTrPAC Chemical Analysis Sites' ability to optimize analyses. Phase II (Recruitment and Testing Years 2-5) Aim 1. We will enroll 420 sedentary but healthy men and women 18+ y into a rigorously controlled, 12-wk, randomized trial of AT (n=185), RT (n=185), or no-exercise control (CON, n=50). ExPACT geography will enrich MoTrPAC racial, ethnic, urban, suburban, and rural diversity. The design incorporates comprehensive phenotyping to assess fitness and clinical outcomes, and human tissue phenotyping to link the molecular transducers with key biological responses to exercise. Aim 2. Pre- and post- training, we will obtain strategically timed biospecimens before and after acute exercise. To better understand the biological extremes, we will conduct the same acute response studies in highly-trained athletes (AT (n=20) or RT (n=20)). Serial biospecimen collection in CON will allow estimation of biological, seasonal, circadian and methodological variability. Aim 3. To enhance the overall scientific impact of MoTrPAC, we will seek additional funding to conduct innovative ancillary studies, which will markedly augment subject and tissue phenotyping and interpretation of the molecular maps. Phase III (Close-out Year 6) Aim 1. We will complete all ExPACT data entry, quality control, and central deposit procedures in collaboration with the MoTrPAC Coordinating Center, and we will actively contribute to the completion of biospecimen analyses, manuscript writing, and dissemination of results. We would be honored to collaborate with MoTrPAC to contribute future knowledge on the molecular mechanisms through which physical activity can improve or preserve health."
"9257767","Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Despite aggressive management of levels of lipids and glucose, both types 1 and 2 diabetic patients exhibit earlier onset and more extensive atherosclerotic lesions than non-diabetic subjects, and the response to lipid- lowering strategies is significantly less robust than the beneficial effects noted in non-diabetic subjects. Preclinical studies in diabetic animals have shown accelerated progression and impaired regression of atherosclerotic plaques, as well as increased retention of macrophages (MØs) in plaques. We will focus on diabetes-driven mechanisms linked to impaired atherosclerosis regression and the specific role of MØ perturbation. Our proposed studies are built on the discovery that transplantation of aortic arches from Ldlr-/- mice into diabetic mice deficient in RAGE or its cytoplasmic domain binding partner, DIAPH1, required for RAGE signaling, display significantly improved plaque regression, independent of changes in plasma glucose or lipid levels, compared to wild-type diabetic mice. Our earlier studies demonstrated that activation of RAGE is a critical component of the vessel wall response to hyperglycemia and that RAGE-driven mechanisms accounted for the observed acceleration and progression of atherosclerosis. In this application, using models of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance (IR), we will test the hypothesis that the consequences of hyperglycemia and RAGE/DIAPH1-dependent mechanisms in MØs modulate MØ trafficking (recruitment & retentions/stasis), MØ inflammatory polarization and MØ metabolism and oxidative stress, mechanisms which converge to suppress regression of established atherosclerotic plaques in diabetes. We will test novel pharmacological antagonists of RAGE/DIAPH1 in our murine model of diabetic atherosclerosis regression. These studies will provide novel insights into diabetes specific mechanisms that promote MØ accumulation and impair regression, and foster the development of novel therapeutic adjuncts for diabetic atherosclerosis."
"9263694","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease currently affecting 1 in 12 adults in the United States. T helper (Th) cells are immune cells that orchestrate the lung inflammatory response in asthma through secretion of inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of other immune cells. While the Th2 subset of cells has been most commonly studied in asthma, Th17 cells have also been implicated in disease pathogenesis in at least some subtypes of asthma. Th17 cells mediate anti-bacterial and anti-fungal immunity and they are clearly associated with autoimmune diseases, but their precise role in the pathogenesis of asthma remains poorly understood. The proposed work aims to elucidate the regulation of Th17 cells by microRNAs (miRNAs) to gain a better appreciation of their dysregulation in diseases such as asthma. miRNAs have emerged as important regulators of many aspects of immune cell differentiation and function. The cell fate decisions of activated T helper cells are particularly sensitive to precise dosing of regulatory factors, and are therefore subject to regulation by the fine-tuning activity of miRNAs. Recent work has shown that the miR-17~92 cluster restrains the expression of subset-inappropriate genes in T follicular helper (TFH) cells. In contrast, how miR-17~92 regulates the differentiation and function of Th17 cells remains unknown. The major goal of this work is to define the role of the miR-17~92 cluster in Th17 cell differentiation in vitro and its potential functional significance in asthma using airway inflammation models. Aim 1 will combine the use of miR-17~92 conditional knockout mice and manipulation of individual miRNAs within the cluster to clarify the role of these miRNAs in regulating Th17 cell differentiation in vitro and by the examination of Th17 resident tissues in vivo. Preliminary data suggests that miR-17~92 inhibits Th17 cell differentiation, which is opposite to its effects in Th1, Th2, and TFH cells. Aim 2 will assess the mechanisms by which miR-17~92 cluster miRNAs target gene expression networks that control Th17 cell biology. Finally, Aim 3 will determine the impact of miRNA regulation of Th17 cells in asthma using airway inflammation models. This work will provide valuable insights into the molecular events that govern Th cell fate decisions and plasticity and its impact in a common chronic inflammatory disease. Additionally, this work may help identify more specific treatments and improve outcomes for patients with sub-phenotypes of asthma where Th17 cells play a significant role in the inflammatory response."
"9366700","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric depression was almost unthinkable until several years ago. Now we not only know that major depressive disorder (MDD) exists in children and adolescents, but that it is a common condition. It is estimated that children and adolescents who suffer from MDD often develop conduct and anxiety disorders, and that up to 25% develop substance abuse disorder. Consequently, this has resulted in a disproportionate increase in the prevalence of antidepressants prescribed to populations below 20 years of age. Despite the heightened rates in antidepressant use, little is known about the potential long-term behavioral and neural adaptations resulting from antidepressant treatment during early development. To address this problem, the experiments described in this proposal will examine the long-term behavioral consequences of early life (postnatal day [PD] 35-49) exposure to fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, using C57BL/6 male and female mice. This will be accomplished within the framework of the following specific aims: [1] assess long-term consequences of chronic adolescent antidepressant treatment on the sensitivity to reward (drug), mood related behaviors (stress), and memory in adulthood (PD80+), and [2] evaluate the integrity of mood-related biological markers [extracellular signal regulated protein kinase-1/2 (ERK)], within the hippocampal formation, following chronic adolescent antidepressant exposure. It is expected that antidepressant exposure during adolescence will induce long-lived alterations associated with responses to stress, drug-rewarded behaviors, and memory. Furthermore, it is expected that site-specific neurochemical adaptations (ERK fluctuations within the hippocampus) to be a factor mediating these behavioral alterations as a function of juvenile antidepressant exposure. Collectively, the results of this preclinical work will provide first-line evidence on the potential risks of antidepressant exposure during adolescence."

We identified new and important roles for Chtf18, the murine orthologue of the yeast CTF18 gene, in mammalian meiosis. CTF18 (Chromosome Transmission Fidelity factor 18) encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein that is part of the replication factor C-like complex, CTF18-RLC. CTF18 is necessary for gamete viability and accurate chromosome segregation in yeast, and it is crucial for germline development and fertility in the fruitfly. CTF18-RLC associates with chromosomes to establish cohesion between sister chromatids during DNA replication, and interacts with multi-protein complexes necessary for chromosome cohesion, called cohesins, in both yeast and in human cells in vitro. However, the exact mechanism by which CTF18-RLC establishes sister chromatid cohesion and the role CHTF18 plays in mammals have not been elucidated. Previously, we showed that Chtf18 is expressed throughout the mammalian male and female germline, suggesting a role for Chtf18 in gametogenesis. Recently, we demonstrated a role for Chtf18 in male fertility and meiosis in vivo. In Chtf18-null mice, meiotic recombination is defective and homologous chromosomes separate prematurely during prophase I. Repair of DNA double strand breaks is delayed, and these persist into diplonema. In addition, MLH1 foci (markers of DNA crossovers) are decreased in pachynema, suggesting a defect in crossover formation. Recently, we found that Chtf18-null females are subfertile, homologues separately prematurely during meiosis I, and progression of Chtf18-null oocytes through metaphase II is impaired. Thus, our data demonstrate essential roles for Chtf18 in mammalian gametogenesis and meiosis. We hypothesize that Chtf18 plays a critical role in meiosis by facilitating DNA double strand break repair and crossover formation through association with cohesin proteins. We will test our hypothesis in three experimental aims: (1): to explore the role of Chtf18 in DNA double strand break repair and crossover formation; (2): to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying premature homologue disjunction in Chtf18-null mice; (3): to examine the consequences of Chtf18 disruption on chromosome alignment and segregation. Our proposed molecular, cell biological, and biochemical experiments will provide complementary approaches to elucidate the functions of Chtf18 in mammalian meiosis and meiotic recombination. Information gleaned from our studies will ultimately elucidate the molecular etiologies underlying chromosome mis- segregation and aneuploidy in humans."
"9323687","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vulnerability to mental illness and ability to cope with stress are powerfully shaped by individual differences in human temperament and personality. Understanding the mechanisms whereby biological and environmental factors interact to shape brain development, temperament, and vulnerability to stress and emotional dysfunction is crucial for generating improved preventative treatments for a variety of psychiatric disorders, such as major depression and anxiety. To elucidate molecular and neuroanatomical changes in the developing brain that lead to a highly fearful, anxious, and stress-vulnerable phenotype, we developed an advantageous rat model that may permit analysis of biological mechanisms of individual differences in temperament. To do so, we selectively-bred rats for differences in emotional reactivity, and combined this with molecular and epigenetic profiling. Our High-Responder (HR) rats vigorously explore novel environments and exhibit greater impulsivity, aggression, and risk-taking versus Low-Responder (LR) rats, which are very inhibited and show high levels of spontaneous anxiety and depressive-like behavior (i.e. immobility in the Forced Swim Test, diminished sexual interest, and anhedonia). Such HR/LR traits are heritable, but are also sensitive to early-life environmental factors, including naturally-occurring variation in HR v. LR maternal style. Using genome-wide expression profiling, we discovered dramatic gene expression differences in the developing hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex of HR vs. LR rats, including changes in genes involved in metabolism and synaptic plasticity. These findings suggest that the distinct HR/LR behavioral phenotypes involve molecular changes that drive differential establishment of hippocampal-limbic circuits. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest epigenetic differences (in HR/LR DNA methylation patterns) may elicit these differences in gene expression and ultimately behavior. The proposed work will use cutting-edge next-generation sequencing to map DNA methylation patterns (the methylome) in the developing and adult brain of HR and LR animals to (a) interrogate inborn methylome differences that may drive their distinct behavioral phenotypes; (b) determine how an early-life experience (cross-fostering) reconfigures the developing LR neural methylome to influence behavior; and (c) test whether manipulating DNA methylation in the HR/LR brain suffices to shift their phenotypes. We will thereby test our working hypothesis that HR/LR methylome differences constitute a key phenotype-driving molecular mechanism by testing whether manipulating methylation in the HR/LR brain modifies their behavior. This work will illuminate how epigenetic mechanisms may drive individual differences in emotionality, stress vulnerability, and risk for emotional dysfunction. Unraveling such complicated genetic, epigenetic, neurobiological, and environmental interactions in a model organism of temperamental and stress vulnerability/resilience differences should yield important results relevant to understanding the developmental neurobiology of mood disorders and how to develop improved treatments."
"9385624","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spatiotemporal coupling of the activity of osteoblasts (OB) and osteoclasts (OC) is required for balance in bone remodeling. However, this coupling activity can limit the effectiveness of current therapies to treat osteoporosis, as therapies that increase bone formation (e.g. teraparatide) also increase bone resorption, and treatments that block bone resorption (e.g. bisphosphonates) arrest new bone formation. Dysregulation of this coupling process also contributes to pathological changes in bone mass, such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone (PDB). PDB is a prevalent disorder affecting approximately 5% of elderly adults and is characterized by focal regions of highly exaggerated bone remodeling. Hence, understanding the molecular basis of OC/OB coupling is central to developing new treatments for bone loss and other disorders of bone remodeling. Here, we propose to expand our prior discovery that the late endosomal sorting protein CHMP5 is a novel dampener of NF-?B signaling and OC/OB coupling in OCs with the following aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the contribution of OC-specific deletion of CHMP5 to PDB-like phenotypes by examining whether transfer of CHMP5-deficient hematopoetic stem cells (HSCs) results in PDB-like phenotypes in irradiated WT mice and whether transfer of WT HSCs reverses PDB-like phenotypes in irradiated CHMP5-deficient mice. Additionally, to confirm relevance of CHMP5 to human disease, we will examine whether CHMP5 deficiency can result in Pagetic phenotypes in human OCs. In Aim 2, we will build upon our preliminary data that CHMP5 is a key regulator of NF-?B signaling and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation in OCs by performing biochemical studies to determine how dysregulation of the CHMP5 complex contributes to Pagetic phenotypes in OCs. First, we will examine whether inhibition of enhanced NF-?B activity can reverse PDB-like phenotypes of CHMP5-deficient mice. Additionally, we will identify the proteins regulated by the CHMP5 complex in OCs using a combination of ubiquitination proteomics and affinity purification-based mass spectrometry. Finally, functions of the identified proteins in NF-?B signaling and osteoclastogenesis will be validated in OCs. In Aim 3, given our preliminary data that the conditioned medium obtained from CHMP5-deficient OCs enhances OB activity, we will identify the OC-derived coupling factor(s) that promote OB activity using HPLC-based mass spectrometry. These putative osteogenic factors will be further validated by examining effects of overexpression and/or knockdown on promoting OB migration and/or differentiation. Upon completion of these aims, we will better understand how CHMP5 deletion in OCs contributes to the pathogenesis of PDB. As this disorder displays dramatic increases in OB activity that occur secondary to enhanced OC activity, harnessing this mechanism to promote bone formation would be an attractive approach for the treatment of disorders of low bone mass."
"9391771","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue homeostasis and regeneration are mediated by the coordinated growth of multiple cell types to generate tissue that sustains integrity and function of the organism. This ability to durably regenerate tissue relies on adult stem cells that reside in a specialized environment called the niche, which influences their self- renewal, growth and differentiation. Failure to maintain or mobilize stem cells results in tissue loss and dysfunction, while uncontrolled activation of these cells can fuel disorganized growth and cancer. Elucidating how key molecular signals govern stem cell behavior holds tremendous implications for designing targeted therapies to treat human diseases. A major challenge to examining how mammalian stem cells are regulated is the inability of conventional static analysis to follow the fate and behavior of cell populations in vivo over time. This proposal aims to address a major gap in our knowledge of how signals can engage a population of undifferentiated cells to yield robust and organized growth. In particular, is still unclear (1) wht cellular behaviors such as cell divisions and movement are regulated by key morphogenetic signals during regeneration, (2) how these signals are disseminated throughout a field of cells in to ensure robust but compartmentalized growth, and (3) how these mechanisms can contribute to disorganized and uncontrolled growth during tumorigenesis. The hair follicle is the ideal model to address these questions as it is exceptionally accessible and undergoes well-characterized cyclical regeneration in a manner dependent on resident stem cells. By coupling this model to a novel live imaging technique we are now uniquely poised to address these outstanding questions. In this project, we examine how Wnt/?-catenin signaling, a key molecular pathway required for hair follicle regeneration, is propagated throughout a population of undifferentiated cells to promote synchronous and coordinated growth. By live imaging, we have found that only a subset of cells is required to fuel the non-cell autonomous activation of this signal and growth behaviors throughout surrounding epithelial cells and is associated with upregulation of diffusible Wnt ligands. Our first aim uses both in vitro cell culture and genetic mouse models that activate ?-catenin in the presence or absence of Wnt secretion to determine the requirement for Wnt ligand secretion in promoting hair follicle regeneration. The second examines if Wnt secretion is required for epithelial Wnt activation in basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), the most common human skin cancer, which is dependent upon Wnt signaling for growth. We will also determine how sustained epithelial Wnt signaling can influence the mesenchyme to regulate BCC growth, using tissue grafting and genetic approaches to modulate epithelial and dermal Wnt activation in a BCC mouse model. Accomplishing these aims will provide novel insight into the principle mechanisms that ensure proper tissue regeneration and how they can also be exploited deleteriously to promote collective growth in cancer."
"9389238","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iatrogenic hypoglycemia is universally recognized as the number one barrier to the safe, effective management of blood glucose in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). In previous experiments in the dog, we observed that an increase in liver glycogen content augments counterregulatory hormone secretion during insulin-induced hypoglycemia, thereby increasing hepatic glucose production. The experiments in this proposal will determine to what extant an increase in liver glycogen content can improve hypoglycemic counterregulation in humans with and without T1D. The canine model will be used to improve our understanding of how this comes about.  Specific Aim #1 is to determine the effect of increasing liver glycogen deposition on insulin-induced hypoglycemic counterregulation in humans with and without T1D. This question will be addressed by studying two groups of people; one with T1D and one without. Both of these groups will undergo one experiment in which their liver glycogen content will be significantly increased using an infusion of fructose an another in which they receive a saline infusion so as to change liver glycogen only modestly. Then, all subjects will undergo a hypoglycemic/ hyperinsulinemic clamp to determine their counterregulatory responses in the presence and absence of increased liver glycogen content.  Hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) is a temporary condition that affects people with T1D. Therefore, Specific Aim #2 is to determine the effect of increasing liver glycogen deposition on insulin- induced hypoglycemic counterregulation in T1D humans with HAAF. The design of Aim #2 will be similar to that of Aim #1. However, on the day prior to metabolic testing,  T1D subjects will undergo a hypoglycemic/ hyperinsulinemic clamp to solicit HAAF. Then, on day 2, the liver glycogen content of each individual will be either increased or remain unchanged, followed by a hypoglycemic/ hyperinsulinemic clamp identical to Aim #1.  The final aim will utilize the canine model to more closely examine the mechanisms by which increased liver glycogen content improves hypoglycemic counterregulation. Specific Aim #3 is to determine the importance of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the brain and in the liver to the improved counterregulatory responses that occur as a result of increased liver glycogen content in the dog. To answer this question we will increase the liver glycogen content of animals and then, during insulin-induced hypoglycemia, selectively make either the head, or the liver euglycemic via glucose infusion, while the rest of the animal's body remains hypoglycemic."
"8998996","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Many Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans have experienced repetitive blast exposure mild traumatic brain  injury (mTBI) with persistent cognitive, emotional, and neurological postconcussive symptoms. Our own  neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker studies demonstrate consistent evidence of diffuse  axonal injury and functional deficits on neuroimaging and preliminary CSF biomarker evidence of incipient  tauopathy. There is an urgent need to develop effective treatments to reduce both the intensity of these  Veterans' current symptoms as well as their potential long-term risks for developing neurodegenerative  dementing disorders related to repetitive mTBI: chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's  disease (AD). Converging evidence from: 1) studies of neuroprotective effects of statins in animal models of  TBI; 2) our epidemiological studies of statin effects on clinical and neuropathological manifestations of AD; and  3) our 14 week pilot study of simvastatin vs. pravastatin effects on CSF AD biomarkers in middle-aged, non-  demented subjects suggest that statins may possess neuroprotective effects against pathologic processes  related to tau protein metabolism that appear to be a common feature of CTE, AD, and other  neurodegenerative sequelae of repetitive mTBI. In addition, our extensive CSF biomarker studies in AD  patients and normal controls, our past and current pilot clinical trials of simvastatin in cognitively normal  subjects, and our neuroimaging and CSF biomarker studies in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans together  demonstrate the feasibility of using CSF biomarkers of neurodegenerative processes (such as total (t)-tau and  phosphorylated (p)-tau181) and neurogenesis (brain derived neurotrophic factor) as viable and reliable outcome  measures in trials of putative preventive treatments in Iraq and Afghanistan subjects at risk of developing  neurodegenerative dementing disorders due to repetitive blast-exposure mTBI.   We propose a 12-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to establish proof-of-  concept for use of simvastatin (40 mg/d) for decreasing CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration and increasing  CSF neurotrophins in 120 Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with repetitive blast trauma mTBI. Specific Aims are:  Specific Aim 1: To examine the effects of 12 months of treatment with simvastatin 40 mg/day on CSF  concentrations of tau biomarkers (t-tau, p-tau181, and t-tau:p-tau181 ratio) and brain-derived neurotrophic  factor (BDNF) in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with repetitive blast concussion mTBI.   Hypothesis 1: Compared to placebo, simvastatin will reduce levels of CSF t-tau, p-tau181, and p-tau181:t-  tau ratio; and will increase level of CSF BDNF.  Specific Aim 2: To explore the effects of 12 months of treatment with simvastatin 40mg/day on CSF  A?42, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with  repetitive blast concussion mTBI.   Hypothesis 2: Compared to placebo, simvastatin will reduce levels of CSF A?42, and biomarkers of  oxidative stress (F2-isoprostanes) and neuroinflammation (interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-8, and S100?).   Because of concerns regarding potential adverse effects of statins, we will also administer a  neurocognitive test battery to monitor memory and other cognitive functions during the study period. We will  also monitor potential effects of simvastatin treatment on persistent postconcussive symptoms (PPCS),  posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, alcohol use, functional status, and health-related quality of  life. The findings of the proposed study may provide, in a relatively short period of time, proof-of-  concept in support of larger scale primary prevention trials to prevent neurodegeneration and  dementia in Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans and service members with repetitive mTBI."

"9186471","Attentional bias toward drug-related stimuli is commonly reported in substance use  disorders and is positively correlated with craving. By capturing attention and facilitating drug-seeking  behavior, alcohol-associated stimuli can promote continued drinking and relapse. The goals of this project  are to (1) determine the neuromodulatory role of dopamine in attentional bias to alcohol cues in heavydrinking  humans, (2) model early aspects of attentional bias to alcohol cues in rats, and (3) use that animal  model to mechanistically probe brain circuits mediating attentional bias, by using pharmacology,  electrochemistry, and optogenetics. These goals synergize with the overall aim of the Center to understand  alcohol induced pathology in brain circuits that regulate alcohol use. Moreover, this project potentially  identifies novel therapeutic targets for alcohol use disorders. The proposed studies test the overall  hypothesis that projections from the prefrontal cortex to the mesolimbic system regulate Pavlovianconditioned  attentional bias towards alcohol cues in heavy-drinking humans and binge-alcohol-exposed rats.  To address this hypothesis, two aims manipulate dopamine function in humans and rats to determine the  effects of dopamine on attentional bias to alcohol cues, and a third aim translates human measurements of  frontolimbic connectivity to rat studies that activate and inactivate particular neural pathways in order to  identify brain circuits mediating attentional bias. Together, these highly innovative studies reveal how chronic  alcohol exposure alters appetitive responses to alcohol cues. These translational studies examine pathology  in frontolimbic circuits associated with chronic alcohol exposure that manifest In altered attention and  response to alcohol-associated stimuli. The combination of human behavior and imaging with rodent  measures of behavior, dopamine release and selective manipulation of prefrontal cortical projections  provides a mechanistic approach to identify how alcohol cues usurp attention and behavior to perpetuate  compulsive alcohol use."
"9392601","Project Summary There is increasing awareness that aberrant neural circuit activity is a core manifestation of many neuropsychiatric diseases, including autism, schizophrenia, depression and Alzheimer's disease. This realization has opened tantalizing prospects for more powerful and precise therapeutic approaches based on retuning of abnormal circuit activity. However, we still lack crucial understanding of neural activity patterns during normal behavior and how these patterns are altered in disease. Many rodent models of human brain diseases are now available, but neuroscientists are still hindered by lack of a technology for visualizing activity in large populations of genetically identified neurons in the brains of behaving animal subjects. Inscopix, Inc. spun out of Stanford University to commercialize a miniature fluorescence microscope technology that lets neuroscientists visualize Ca2+ dynamics in up to 1200 neurons simultaneously in awake, behaving rodents at cellular resolution. The microscope is easily carried on the head of a mouse or rat, and enables continuous recording from the same group of neurons in a single animal for periods of days to weeks. Used in conjunction with genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators and our custom-designed optical microendoscope probes, the microscope enables targeting of predefined neuronal subpopulations, and entry to brain regions inaccessible to other large-scale recording technologies. In Phase I, we developed and validated a new version of the microscope that is substantially higher performing and more robust than the original Stanford prototype. Around it we built the nVista imaging system: an end-to-end solution for in vivo brain imaging that includes the miniature microscope with an integrated HD camera and electronics, and user-friendly data acquisition hardware and software. The nVista system has now been disseminated for beta testing to over 100 labs around the globe. This Phase II project will move the nVista system forward in its next steps towards marketing to the general neuroscience community, through the following aims. (1) Create a next-generation version of the nVista system for commercial dissemination. Making use of feedback from early adopters, we will refine the system's design for greater performance, reliability and ease of use, by incorporating an electronic focusing mechanism, enabling higher speed data acquisition and seamless interfacing with other data collection systems; (2) Extend the technology to rats by developing an accessory array for the nVista microscope that includes a new base plate attachment mechanism, protective head-mounted cone and cable sheathing, optical probes, and an optical data link to support commutators; and (3) Develop a next-generation data analysis platform with faster processing, customizability, and better visualization tools."

"9040795","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      While ongoing research has suggested there are disabilities associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), few imaging studies have examined the impact of their co- morbidity in Operation Enduring Freedom-Operation Iraqi Freedom-Operation New Dawn (OEF-OIF-OND) Veterans. Ragsdale et al (2013) have reported both increased PTSD symptoms and functional impairments in a group of Veterans suffering from both mTBI and PTSD, relative to a group of Veterans with PTSD alone. Yet even less research is concerned with the recovery these Veterans experience from treatment. The overarching goal of the present study is to investigate the global functional, psychological, and neural network recovery of the OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with this co-morbidity. Specifically, we propose to investigate changes in OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with both PTSD and mTBI who participate in a meditation intervention designed for Veterans (Inner Resources for Veterans; IRV). First we propose that IRV will be associated with improvements in community integration and quality of life. Secondly, we propose that Veterans completing a course of IRV will experience improvements in PTSD and postconsussive, including depressive, symptoms. Finally, we seek to show that practicing IRV meditation will improve functional connectivity in OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with co-morbid mTBI and PTSD. We believe that this proposal will not only help us define the problems of Veterans with co-morbid mTBI and PTSD more clearly, but also shed light on their potential for recovery afforded by effective treatment."
"9186472","Repeated binge alcohol drinking is a major public health problem and is thought to  lead to pathophysiological alterations in brain circuitry that contribute to alcohol dependence and addiction.  While complex behaviors such as ethanol consumption are likely controlled by a distributed, interconnected  network of brain nuclei, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) producing neurons within the central nucleus of  the amygdala (CeA) are thought to play a crucial role in progressively driving pathological ethanol  consumption. The CeA is composed of numerous neurochemically distinct neurons, and therefore  determining how endogenous CRF signaling modulates neural circuits via their functional connectivity with  postsynaptic targets has proven difficult due to technical limitations in evaluating specific long-range synaptic  projections. To circumvent this, we propose to use optogenetic techniques coupled with brain slice  electrophysiology and behavioral assays to examine the properties of CRF neuronal circuits in the extended  amygdala and to determine whether activation or inhibition of CRF containing neural circuit elements can  alter binge ethanol intake. We hypothesize that CRF producing neurons within the CeA project to the bed  nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and that activation of this pathway will be enhanced and required for  repeated binge ethanol intake. We will test this hypothesis using a multi-disiclplinary approach combining  both in vivo and ex vivo analysis of function. In total, the proposed research will provide essential  information concerning the role that the CRF projection from the CeA to the BNST plays in binge ethanol  drinking."

"9187813","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual prostheses based on electrical stimulation of the retina are an effective approach for treating blindness in individuals with photoreceptor degenerative diseases (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa). The epiretinal strategy, which was pioneered by our team, involves implanting the stimulating electrodes near the inner retinal surface. Compared with other strategies, epiretinal implantation surgeries are easier and are at risk of fewer complications. Epiretinal stimulation electrodes consist of metallic micro-disks of platinum, iridium, or titanium and their oxides, embedded in a flexible insulating polymer substrate such as polyimide, parylene, or silicone elastomer. The electrode array can be monitored with funduscopy and removed or readjusted post-implantation with minimal surgery. Our experience with chronic implantation suggests that mechanical damage to the retina is a significant concern for epiretinal prosthesis patients with electrical stimulation. Furthermore, preclinical studies hae shown that prolonged electrical stimulation can damage the retina. However, detailed knowledge of how this damage manifests in retinal implant patients is currently lacking. Ocular imaging technologies available in the clinic, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), are useful for patient monitoring but provide only limited information about retinal structure. Thus, there is a need for novel imaging modalities that can measure the fundamental mechanical properties of the retina over time in retinal prosthesis patients. The goal of this study is to develop and characterize novel tools for imaging the elastic properties of the retina under prosthetic electrical stimulation. To address this goal, we propose to use phase-resolved OCT to detect minute displacements induced by acoustic radiation force (ARF) in the retinal tissue layers. This will enable us to generate images depicting local displacements with nanometer resolution, providing details about the elastic properties of the retina that cannot be obtained with current imaging methods. We will also develop ultrasound (US) convex transducer arrays that can monitor retinal detachment and edema through the thin stimulating electrodes in areas where tissue damage is most likely to occur. We'll design and develop two convex single crystal arrays for imaging and an ARF transducer and integrated convex array ARF-optical coherence elastography (OCE) system that enables co-registered OCT, US, and ARF- OCE imaging; Model and measure the elastic properties of the retina with electrode array and conduct ex-vivo and in-vivo rabbit eye imaging to assess performance. Use ARF-OCE to detect retinal damage caused by mechanical stress and electrical stimulation."

"9219315","Project Summary Most, if not all, fluorinating reagents (electrophilic or nucleophilic) are actually made from hydrogen fluoride (HF). However, the gaseous and corrosive nature of HF excludes it from working laboratories where special equipment and training are not available. The complexes of HF with organic bases like pyridine-HF complex (Olah's reagent) and triethylamine-HF complex have been explored extensively as nucleophilic sources of fluorine, but use of these organic bases reduce the acidity of the system and may interfere with many metal catalysts. So far there is no HF-based nucleophilic fluorination reagent that works well in acid or transition metal catalyzed reactions. Our primary goal is to develop a new generation of HF-based nucleophilic fluorination reagents that is compatible with acids and metal catalysts based on a rational design. The same strategy can also be used for new HX (X = Cl, Br, I)-based halogenation reagents. Hydrogen bonding, rather than an ionic interaction, has been identified as the major interaction between HF and an organic base in complexes such as pyridine-HF (Olah's reagent). To reduce the volatility of an HF complex (make it a liquid or solid at room temperature), we have to use a relatively good hydrogen bonding acceptor (HBA) to complex with HF. Our hypothesis is: a strong (good) hydrogen bonding acceptor is not necessarily a strong base (BrØnsted or Lewis base). In this way, a compound that serves as good hydrogen bonding acceptor (better than pyridine or triethylamine), but is less basic, is expected to form a less volatile complex. And due to the low basicity of this HBA, the resulting HBA-HF complex will be compatible with acid catalysts or mediators. In this manner, we may achieve unprecedented reactivity and selectivity in HF-participating reactions. The first part of our research is the preparation of HBA-HX complexes. We are seeking `anomaly' HBAs, that is, good hydrogen bond acceptors but weak BrØnsted bases. The quantitative descriptor of hydrogen bond basicity and BrØnsted basicity shown in Figure 1 (based on Laurence and co-workers' database of hydrogen-bond basicity) is our primary guideline for the selection of suitable hydrogen bonding acceptors. The nucleophilic fluorination reagents proposed and the methodologies for their use will enable diverse-oriented, stereo- and regio-selective synthesis of fluoroamines, fluorohydrins, fluoroaminoacids, fluorinated aliphatic, alkenes, cyclic and heterocyclic compounds, through new synthetic protocols such as tandem HF-addition-metathesis, HF trapping in cationic cascade reactions, strain-release nucleophilic fluorinations, in-situ electrophilic fluorine formation, Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov hydrofluorinations. A similar strategy will be used to develop designer-HX based (X = Cl, Br, I) halogenation reagents. One of our reagents (DMPU-HF) is already commercially available, and we will commercialize other newly developed reagents to make our methods available to medicinal chemists worldwide."
"9049738","?      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The scientific goal of this F31 proposal is to investigate network-level alterations in brain integrity associated with genetic variation in four candidate genes implicated in age-related cognitive decline. Although a large body of research has identified focal alterations in brain integrity in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), it i likely that neurodegeneration affects interconnected cortical networks rather than single brain regions in isolation. The proposed project will focus on two resting state networks that include brain regions typically compromised by AD pathology: the default mode network (DMN) and executive control network (ECN). By studying carriers of risk alleles who do not show overt impairment, the proposed research may identify differences in brain network structure and function that serve as preclinical indicators of dementia. The primary aims are to (1) examine genotype differences in functional connectivity of the DMN and ECN; (2) to characterize the association between gene polymorphisms and white matter tracts connecting regions of the DMN and ECN, respectively; and (3) to examine global network differences associated with gene polymorphisms by using a graph theoretical approach to assess the organization of the integrated functional- structural network. This will be accomplished through analysis of DNA and multi-modal imaging data collected from approximately 150 healthy, cognitively normal middle-aged adults, including both carriers and non- carriers of risk alleles. Combining indices of functional and structural connectivity provides an innovative way of describing network integrity in adults at risk for AD. The findings will lead to a better understanding of network- level alterations in brain structure and function that may contribute to age-related changes in cognitive function. Studying middle-aged individuals may establish these network-level characteristics as important early indices of risk of impairment, which may inform prevention or early intervention efforts. Additionally, this proposal draws on the expertise of an exemplary interdisciplinary team to support the candidate's training as a developing research scientist. The training plan will develop competency in neuroimaging methods and quantitative analysis, expertise in connectivity analyses of resting state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, knowledge of the genetics of brain aging, responsible conduct of research, and scholarly dissemination of results. The fundamental outcomes of this proposal are well aligned with the goals of the NIA and may inform the development of novel AD detection and treatment strategies."
"9147494","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      (1) PURPOSE - The purpose of the project is to evaluate mechanisms and related treatment approaches in chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using a mouse model. The three goals of this project are: 1) To determine the effects of chronic TBI and PTSD on memory and fear extinction learning. 2) To examine the effects of chronic TBI and PTSD on neuroinflammation, DAI, glia reactivity and dendritic spine morphology in PFC, HIPP and BLA regions; to examine the relationship between brain and behavioral changes. 3) To examine the effects of valproate (VPA) on memory and fear extinction and neurobiological changes in chronic TBI/PTSD.     (2) BACKGROUND- (a) Scientific Rationale- TBI and PTSD have become the signature injuries from     OEF/OIF war zones. Focal and diffuse brain injury occurs in TBI and this damage contributes to the associated neurocognitive and behavioral deficits. This proposed study comprehensively examines the effects of combined TBI and PTSD on axonal injury, neuroinflammation, and dendritic plasticity. Based on the research literature, we hypothesize that pharmacological treatment with VPA will enhance fear extinction learning and spatial memory and promote neural restoration in models of TBI and PTSD. (b) How this Research will Advance Knowledge in Rehabilitation Research - By increasing our understanding of the mechanisms and sequelae of brain injury and co-existing fear conditioning in animal models, we can examine potential biomarkers and screen candidate treatment approaches for humans with TBI/PTSD. (c) Significance of the Research and How it Relates to RR&D Priority Areas - The research relates to the RR&D Priority Area of Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury. Using a model of chronic TBI and PTSD is of critical importance for understanding brain and behavioral mechanisms and for the development of effective treatments for veterans. (d) Direct Benefits and Quality of Services - This study examines the effects of TBI and PTSD that have been sustained by many OIF/OEF veterans and will examine biomarkers for these conditions that can be then tested in humans. After testing in this model, the clinically available agent VPA can be carefully developed in     studies for its pro-cognitive and fear extinction enhancing effects for veterans with TBI and/or PTSD.     (3) EXPECTED OUTCOMES OR PRODUCTS - The first outcome of this study is to demonstrate that FPI and coexisting fear conditioning (FC) in mice impair long-term memory and extinction learning; these effects are associated with reductions in dendritic morphology in PFC, HIPP, and BLA. The second outcome is to show that the cognitive and fear extinction impairments in the TBI/PTSD model are associated with axonal injury, glial reactivity, and neuroinflammation in PFC, HIPP and BLA. The third outcome is to demonstrate that VPA treatment reverses spatial memory and fear extinction deficits in this model and reduces these neurobiological changes at 6 and 12 months post-injury. Additionally, we will demonstrate that administration of VPA from injectable gelatin delivered to the FPI injury site enhances cognition and reverses neurobiological effects.     (4) METHODS AND RESEARCH PLAN - Male C57BL/6 mice are used because of their demonstrated utility in our FPI and FC model. Our FPI model uses a moderate level of percussive force to produce long-term brain injury. FPI mice will undergo cued FC procedures to produce a comorbid TBI/PTSD  model. Behavioral testing is performed in FPI/FC mice using Morris Water Maze memory testing and fear extinction procedures. Brains are harvested from mice to measure changes in PFC, HIPP, and BLA using quantitative immunohistochemistry for axonal injury (as measured by ?-APP), neuroinflammation (as measured by IL-6 and GFAP) and dendritic plasticity (Golgi-Cox staining). In our FPI/FC model, we will test the effects of parenteral treatment with VPA at two separate chronic time points at 6 and 12 months. We will also pilot an approach using a biomaterial matrix for direct and continuous VPA administration at the TBI injury site."
"9172212","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sensitive to changes in brain white matter. In a recent publication, our group demonstrated the ability of DTI to identify areas of white matter abnormality in postdeployment Veterans in whom the only reported exposure to conditions that might injure the brain was to primary blast forces. Department of Defense (DoD) surveillance data reported 287,861 total diagnosed traumatic brain injuries (TBI) from 2000 through November, 2013, 82.5% of which were mild in severity. It is estimated that 75% of mild TBI sustained during deployment are blast-related. It is likely that many more individuals are exposed to blast during deployment but do not display symptoms consistent with mild TBI (altered level of consciousness, amnesia). Adding to the complexity of the situation, a growing body of evidence demonstrates the potential of repetitive subconcussive events to injure the brain. Most deployment- related events involve a combination of primary blast and other forces, often described as ?blast plus? or blast-related TBI. Preliminary evidence suggests that the initial effects and symptoms of blast-related mild TBI may differ from other injury mechanisms. Differences in injury mechanism(s) and/or injury evolution make it essential to determine the effects in the human brain of exposure to primary blast.  We will use multiple advanced neuroimaging techniques to better understand the effect of exposure to primary blast forces on brain structure and function, cognitive function, and symptom presentation. This study will allow us to further investigate the nature of white matter abnormalities observed in Veterans exposed to primary blast forces, providing a better understanding of the possible changes in the brain caused by this exposure. Additionally, we will be able to investigate how these changes may affect brain function by examining alterations in brain networks. We will also examine how exposure to primary blast forces may alter the individual?s ability to focus, concentrate, learn, and perform complex tasks. Finally, we will examine symptoms present following exposure to primary blast forces including anxiety, posttraumatic stress, depression, irritability, poor sleep, and overall quality of life. This study will provide a comprehensive investigation of how exposure to primary blast may affect an individual.  Results of this study may have application for both active duty service members as well as Veterans. This study will provide a better understanding of how different levels of primary blast exposure affect brain structure and function. This will improve early identification of individuals at risk for developing white matter abnormalities and allow preventative measures to be taken. Better understanding of the symptoms of exposure to primary blast has the potential to improve evaluation and diagnosis of postdeployment Veterans, thus facilitating provision of appropriate treatments and interventions. Finally, results of this study may provide insight into the chronic effects of mild TBI. Based on our previous experience, all participants will be postdeployment Veterans at least one year out of service. Therefore, changes we see during this study will not be due to the immediate effects of primary blast exposure, and will represent alterations that are not likely to resolve on their own."
"9177772","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The TDP-43 protein plays a role in a broad suite of neurodegenerative disorders including Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and potentially, Alzheimer's disease. TDP-43 is a multifunctional protein with many known cellular roles. So, while the importance of TDP-43 in neurodegeneration is established, the mechanisms of TDP-43 toxicity are unclear. We have discovered a new role for TDP-43 in regulating small-RNA based gene silencing, which is critical to block expression of retrotransposons. Retrotransposons are virus-like sequences that are encoded in our genomes and are capable of replicating and inserting at new chromosomal positions. The toxic potential of transposons in the germline is established. So our discovery provides a plausible hypothesis for toxic effects of TDP-43 in neurons. Our preliminary studies provide strong evidence that TDP-43 normally helps to silence transposons and that this function is disrupted both in FTLD patients and a Drosophila disease model. Our proposed experiments will use genetic manipulations in Drosophila to test three key specific hypotheses: 1) that TDP-43 pathology disrupts argonaute-2 mediated silencing; 2) that TDP-43 pathology activates retrotransposons in Drosophila brain; 3) that Retrotransposon activation contributes to neurodegeneration"
"9181441","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurons exhibit diverse morphologies that influence how information is propagated and modulated through complex networks of connections. One key determinant of circuit function is the number and arrangement of dendrites. For instance, local interneurons extend multiple dendrites symmetrically from the cell body, whereas cerebellar Purkinje neurons elaborate a single huge dendritic arbor that is confined to the molecular layer. Like axons, dendrites develop from totipotent neurites that extend from the cell body of the differentiating neuron. One neurite becomes an axon. The remaining neurites are either retracted or retained to develop as dendrites. In vivo, these events are coordinated with the surrounding tissue, such that axons and dendrites develop in stereotyped locations where they are perfectly positioned to interact with appropriate synaptic partners. Our long term goal is to understand how extrinsic signals alter the intrinsic properties of naïve neurites, thereby ensuring that neurons acquire polarized morphologies that are correctly oriented with the rest of the circuit. To tackle this question, we will investigate mechanisms of dendrite specification in amacrine cells, which modulate the flow of information from the outer to the inner retina. Amacrine cells develop a single primary dendrite that points into a defined region of neuropil called the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Developing amacrine cells are bipolar as they migrate but become unipolar upon contacting the nascent IPL: the neurite that contacts the IPL is retained as a dendrite, but the neurite on the opposite pole of the cell is retracted. We have developed a time?lapse imaging system that allows us to document amacrine cells in the retina as they transition from a bipolar to unipolar morphology, both at the level of the overall cell shape and a the level of the cytoskeleton. We find that a key readout for this change in polarity is the positin of the Golgi apparatus, which moves into the nascent primary dendrite. In mice mutant for the atypical cadherin Fat3, this transition does not occur reliably, leading to the appearance of amacrine cells with two dendritic arbors and an ectopically placed Golgi apparatus. As a transmembrane receptor with a conserved intracellular domain harboring protein?binding motifs, Fat3 offers a potent entry point for understanding how extrinsic cues lead to intrinsic changes in neuronal morphology. Indeed, the Fat3 intracellular domain binds not only to known actin regulators (i.e. Ena/VASP family members) but also to proteins that control microtubule dynamics (i.e. CLASP1/2), suggesting that Fat3 coordinates dual effects on actin and microtubules. By pairing molecular and genetic studies of Fat3 and its effectors with time?lapse analysis of amacrine cell dendrite development in situ, we will gain new insights into the extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms that govern dendrite specification."
"9186460","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability but the neuroanatomical abnormalities that contribute to specific cognitive deficits in individuals with DS have not been well defined. Histopathological observations, though limited, have consistently implicated reduced neuron number as a major defect in the DS cerebral cortex. Yet the identity of the neuron subtype that is affected is not known and this lack of information lessens both our knowledge of DS neuropathology and our ability to define potential therapies. It is therefore critical to our understanding of the neurobiological basis of intellectual disability in DS to define the neurons that are reduced in DS cerebral cortex. This small self-contained proposal aims to test the simple hypothesis that there are fewer interneurons in human DS cortex. Inhibitory interneurons will be identified and counted in post-mortem DS human brain and compared to controls using modern techniques for immunostaining and quantification."
"9189613","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Like many neural circuits of the brain, the retina is composed of a network of cells with greatly varying anatomical and physiological properties. The most diverse types of cells, both in the retina and cortex, are inhibitory interneurons. Retina amacrine cells comprise over thirty types and influence the responses of ganglion cells, the output cells of the retina. Although the anatomy and physiology of amacrine cells have long been studied, there is little understanding as to whether they have specific and distinct roles, rather than each serving a similar, general function. A substantial barrier to the understanding of inhibitory interneurons has been technical limitations on studying single cells among a diverse population. This proposal seeks to characterize the population of inhibitory amacrine cells using a novel approach to optically record the visual responses of the amacrine cell population while simultaneously recording populations of ganglion cells using an electrode array.  This project focuses on responses to moving visual stimuli, which are ecologically important and critical to behavior and perception. The first aim of this proposal will measure the responses of a nearly complete amacrine population to moving stimuli and compare these with simultaneously recorded responses in the ganglion cell population. By measuring the similarity in responses between amacrine and ganglion cell populations, these experiments will test the hypothesis that amacrine cells are divided into two broad classes: one that resembles the more simple bipolar cell representation and one that is more tightly correlated with specific retinal ganglion cells. Te second aim of this proposal uses optical imaging and simultaneous intracellular and multielectrode recording to test the hypothesis that amacrine cells inhibit ganglion cells that the are correlated with under visual motion, despite the wide variation of preferred visual stimuli across amacrine cells. Finally, the third aim of this proposal will take advantage of our novel approach of directly perturbing individual interneurons intracellularly to test whether many types of amacrine cells act to reduce correlations in the ganglion cell population for different types of natural stimuli, thus creating an efficient representation of the visual scene.  These studies will not only add to the knowledge of how an inhibitory population represents and transforms visual information, but will also test general principles applicable to all neural circuits. The results wll have immediate applicability to the emerging field of retinal prostheses. The objective of a retinal prosthesis system is to treat prevalent diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa by replacing the function of the damaged retina with a high-resolution electronic circuit. Measurements of the retinal neural code and the computations that are performed will be directly useful for incorporation into these prostheses systems."
"9193055","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant The HIV-1 pandemic is a global emergency for which no cure exists. The early establishment of a latent reservoir of cells harboring replication competent integrated provirus remains the major barrier to a cure. The development of strategies to actively clear infected cells very early in infection could delay, or prevent reservor establishment in newly infected individuals, thereby lengthening the window in which post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is effective. The ability to reactivate and clear latently infected cell in chronically infected individuals could decrease reservoir size, thus reducing the lifelong dependence on ART in this population. In both cases, reduction of the latent reservoir is likely to require active killing of HIV-1 infected cells. Antibodies have the ability to mediate clearance of infected cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). However, whether or not anti-HIV-1 antibodies can clear infected cells by ADCC in vivo remains unproven. The proposed research investigates the ability of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) to clear HIV-1 infected cells in humanized mice, with a specific focus on their ability to alter the establishment and/or size of the latent reservoir. Specifically, this research will investigate: (1 bNAbs' efficacy as post- exposure prophylaxis due to their ability to clear infected cells and prevent reservoir establishment, and (2) bNAbs ability to clear latently infected cells from an established infection when combined with latency reactivating agents."
"9197589","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By the year 2020 the number of Americans over the age of 65 is projected to reach 55 million. It is therefore imperative that the ability of these individuals to live independently is preserved for reasons of personal dignity as well as the financial and public-health consequences that result from the necessity of long-term care. Unfortunately, a large proportion of elderly people experience memory decline that interferes with their quality of life. Understanding the neurobiology of memory impairments in advanced age, however, presents a significant problem, as memory processes are distributed throughout the brain and a fundamental gap exists in our understanding of how these structures interact. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to determine the alterations in network-level interactions that underlie cognitive impairment in advanced age. The primary objective of the current proposal is to identify age-associated changes in medial temporal lobe-prefrontal functional connectivity that contributes to memory deficits. State-of-the-art methodologies in neurophysiology, anatomy and behavioral analysis will be integrated to test the central hypothesis that age-related memory impairments manifest from dysfunction in cross-regional interactions among prefrontal and medial temporal lobe circuits by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Do deficits in cortical functional connectivity mediate memory impairments, 2) Does age-related perirhinal dysfunction impact activity dynamics within the hippocampus, and 3) Do age-related reductions in prefrontal cortical activity impact functional connectivity in the rhinal cortices. Our rationale is that by elucidating how aging influences systems-level dynamics, we will be better positioned to develop interventions that broadly improve cognition. The proposed research is innovative, because state-of-the-art neuroanatomical measures and neurophysiological techniques will be integrated with measures of behavioral deficits in young and aged rats in order to probe how local dysfunction manifests as network impairments or elicits compensatory mechanisms. The significance of successful completion of these experiments will be to provide an unprecedented understanding of the association between functional connectivity and cognition that will enable future interventional studies aimed at restoring memory network interactions in the context of aging and neurodegeneration."
"9217514","Abstract Autophagy, a key host defense pathway, has an essential role in both innate and adaptive immunity. However, many microbes have evolved mechanisms to evade, subvert, or exploit autophagy. Bacterial and viral pathogens can block autophagosome fusion with lysosomes to evade degradation, or utilize nutrients in such vesicles. It has been demonstrated that stimulation of autophagic pathways in macrophages causes mycobacterial phagosomes to mature into phagolysosomes, which can then overcome the trafficking block imposed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, induction of autophagy can suppress intracellular survival of mycobacteria. We hypothesize that mycobacterial virulence factors mediate autophagy evasion in order to ensure survival within the infected macrophages. The identification and characterization of such virulence factors will allow us to understand the mechanisms by which autophagy affects the outcome of host-microbe interactions and immune responses. Through loss-of-function screening of mycobacteria using transposon mutant screening, we were able to identify thirteen chromosomal regions responsible for manipulating mycobacterial infection-induced autophagy. Remarkably, six of these regions contain genes belonging to the PE/PPE protein family that are especially abundant in pathogenic mycobacteria and have been shown to play diverse roles in mycobacterial pathogenesis and in modulating critical innate immune pathways. However, no PE/PPE proteins are known to be associated with autophagy pathways. Thus, the goals of this project are to investigate the roles and mechanisms of a subset of PE/PPE proteins and to determine the consequences of autophagic degradation of mycobacteria on innate and adaptive immunity. Increased knowledge of M. tuberculosis infection-induced autophagy presents an opportunity to uncover new and promising therapeutics against tuberculosis to prevent mycobacterial infection and survival within the host. Additionally, the pro- autophagic mutants generated in this study may have significant application in the development of effective, safe and persistent TB vaccines."
"9226400","Abstract The continuous epidemic of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-coronavirus (MERS- CoV) has posed a threat to global public health, calling for the development of innovative and effective intervention strategies. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein, which mediates virus binding to the receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), contains a critical neutralizing domain (CND), serving as an important target for the development of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. A number of RBD-targeting neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with potent neutralizing activity and/or protection against MERS-CoV infection have been reported. In spite of their superior safety and strong specificity, these conventional antibodies have large size (e.g., 160 kDa for IgG) and complicated structures. These characteristics result in instability and limit rapid, large-scale production. Different from conventional antibodies, variable domains of camelid heavy chain-only antibody (VHH), or nanobody (Nb), has small molecular size (~15 kDa), strong thermal stability, high production yield and other good druggabilities, making it particularly suitable for rapid and large-scale production as an antiviral drug with affordable price to meet healthcare needs during an outbreak. We have previously developed several effective RBD-specific mouse and human neutralizing mAbs and identified three RBD-targeting neutralizing Nbs. Based on our experience and preliminary data, we hypothesize that a novel, stable, and effective RBD-specific neutralizing Nb can be developed to combat MERS. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to generate humanized MERS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing Nbs with extended half-lives; 2) to characterize MERS-CoV RBD-specific humanized Nbs; and 3) to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of RBD-specific humanized Nbs against MERS-CoV infection. The long-term goal of the proposed study is to develop a novel nanobody with good druggability for the prevention and treatment of MERS-CoV infection. Similar approaches can be applied to develop prophylactic and therapeutic agents against other class I enveloped viruses with epidemic/pandemic potential."
"9223504","Project Summary I am an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and am very committed to improving my understanding of the mechanisms of Gram-negative resistance so I can ultimately become a future leader in developing, validating, and implementing rapid diagnostics for the detection of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms (MDRGNs). In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assigned the highest threat level to carbapenemase- producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), declaring they require urgent public health attention. CPE are endemic in the US mid-Atlantic region, representing 13% of clinical isolates of healthcare-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae. CPE bacteremia are associated with mortality upwards of 60%. Improving outcomes of patients with CPE bacteremia requires their prompt detection to ensure patients receive optimal antibiotic therapy as early as possible. There is no standardized, easy-to-use, reliable assay for carbapenemase detection. Most diagnostic laboratories do not test for carbapenemase production, potentially leading to poor patient outcomes. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) is a technology used to detect microorganisms that has become increasingly commonplace in diagnostic laboratories. It is rapid, cost-effective, and accurate. Species and genus identification are available in as little as 10 minutes from the time bacterial growth is detected in sterile specimens. MALDI TOF is currently not being used for the identification of antibiotic resistance in clinical practice. We believe we can capitalize on this FDA-approved technology to detect carbapenemases directly from blood culture broths at least 27 hours earlier than existing methods. Although the distribution of carbapenemases endemic to the mid-Atlantic US has not been previously characterized, it is estimated that approximately 50% of carbapenemases are KPC-3 carbapenemases. Our preliminary data indicate that MALDI TOF can be successfully used to identify the presence of KPC-3 carbapenemases. We believe that we can expand upon this and build a comprehensive MALDI TOF library to rapidly detect the wide variety of carbapenemases endemic to the US. The overarching goals of this proposal are to (a) identify the organism and carbapenemase-encoding gene combinations in a highly endemic region for CPE using existing isolates from 8 hospitals; (b) develop a comprehensive MALDI TOF library for the rapid detection of carbapenemases directly from positive bloodstream isolates with the goal that this library can eventually be exported to clinical microbiology laboratories across the country for rapid detection of CPE; and (c) determine the accuracy and potential impact of MALDI TOF on optimizing antibiotic therapy for patients admitted to any of 5 hospitals in the Hopkins Health System with CPE bacteremia. Because the K23 mechanism does not allow for experimental diagnostics to directly impact patient care, the results of the proposed method in Aim 3 will not be used to inform decisions regarding patient care but will lay the groundwork for a future R01 interventional study. For me to be able to continue as a clinician investigator, receiving a Career Development Award is essential. Because of the extremely busy clinical pediatric infectious diseases service at Johns Hopkins Hospital, I currently devote approximately 70% effort to clinical and administrative responsibilities. Without the protected time for additional training to advance my research career afforded by a K award, it would be extremely difficult to conduct effective and meaningful research. Furthermore, I want to change my focus from clinical outcomes studies to understanding how to enhance rapid diagnostic assays to improve the detection of MDRGNs. Since I do not have a basic science background, a Career Development Award would afford me time to improve my understanding of available assays for both phenotypic and genotypic detection of MDRGNs so that I can ultimately become a leader in the field of rapid diagnostics for MDRGNs. Without a clear understanding of the mechanisms of Gram-negative resistance, I believe I will only have a superficial understanding of the Gram- negative crisis. Although I have begun to explore training in molecular diagnostics of Gram-negative bacteria this past year, the laboratory methodology involved in my proposal is labor intensive and entails multiple complex steps. I would benefit from further mentorship to be able to function independently in the laboratory setting. I am very optimistic about my proposed future path. Developing a strong foundation in laboratory methods for identifying Gram-negative resistance is critical for me to become an independent clinician investigator in developing, validating, and implementing rapid diagnostics assays for the detection of MDRGN organisms."
"9224053","Abstract This research proposal seeks to advance our current knowledge on the identification of language impairments in bilingual children by examining the differences in patterns of language growth and cognitive/processing skills between bilingual children experiencing first language loss and those with language disorders using retrospective and prospective longitudinal approaches. Hispanic children are disproportionally underrepresented in special education programs and are less likely than other children to be identified as having speech and language impairments. This disproportionality might be due to the difficulty experienced by speech-language pathologists in identifying whether variations in language performance constitute a language disorder or a characteristic of typical bilingual learning. The main challenge in identifying language impairments in Spanish-speaking children lies in our limited understanding of their language growth patterns since most of these children experience a drastic shift in primary language exposure and use from Spanish (home language) to English (school language). This shift in language exposure often results in a temporary period of time in which their Spanish skills are no longer developing and their English skills are not fully developed yet, due to limitations in input rather than learning capabilities. This poses a critical problem for the accurate identification of language disorders in this population because both typically developing bilingual children experiencing first language loss (i.e., a decline in their first language skills due to limitations in input) and bilingual children with language disorders show low grammatical skills in both languages. It is imperative to examine the differences between these two groups of children so that early and accurate identification is possible. The PI has a strong background in language development and assessment in bilingual children, but lacks the necessary methodological skill set to conduct prospective and retrospective longitudinal studies, and the background knowledge to fully understand the role of cognitive/processing skills in language acquisition. The proposed training plan has the following learning objectives: 1. Design and execute retrospective studies to differentiate patterns of language growth between children experiencing first language loss and bilingual children with language impairments using existent longitudinal databases (Mentor: Francis); 2. Develop a strong understanding of cognitive/processing mechanisms and their role in language acquisition (Mentor: Hernandez); 3. Design and execute an innovative prospective study to differentiate patterns of language growth and cognitive/processing skills between children experiencing first language loss and bilingual children with language impairments using clinical samples (mentors: Francis and Lesaux); and, 4. Transition to scientific independence (Mentors: Fletcher and Francis). This study will improve the accuracy of language assessment practices for Spanish-speaking children by differentiating patterns of first language loss from language impairments."
"9227549","PROJECT SUMMARY Novel Antitrypanosomal Alkaloids for Chagas Disease Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is a WHO Neglected Tropical Disease and CDC Neglected Parasitic Infection estimated to infect 8 million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America, with increasing incidence in the U.S. (?300K). It is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted primarily via the feces of triatomine bugs, blood-sucking insects that feed on humans and animals, as well as via blood transfusions and from infected mother to fetus in utero. Clinical development of Chagas disease involves two distinct stages: an acute phase, usually asymptomatic, followed by a chronic phase, in which ?30?40% of infected individuals develop life-threatening, irreversible cardiomyopathy and/or digestive megasyndromes, often many years after the initial infection. The only available therapeutics, benznidazole and nifurtimox, were developed decades ago and suffer serious limitations, including poor efficacy in the chronic phase of the disease, long treatment regimens (60?90 days), significant side effects that lead to treatment discontinuation, contraindication during pregnancy leading to congenital infections, and intrinsic drug resistance in some strains. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for new, more effective, less toxic drugs to treat Chagas disease. To address this problem, the labs of Derek Tan (MSKCC) and James McKerrow (UCSD) have recently identified two novel antitrypanosomal alkaloid lead compounds with nanomolar in vitro activity against intracellular amastigotes, no cytotoxicity against mammalian host cells, acceptable pharmacological properties, and promising in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of acute Chagas disease. Based on these strong preliminary results, we propose herein to develop optimized lead compounds with potent in vitro antitrypanosomal activity, low host cell cytotoxicity, suitable pharmacological properties, clean toxicological profiles, and potent in vivo efficacy. We will also seek to determine mechanisms of action of the optimized leads. Our multidisciplinary, collaborative team has comprehensive expertise in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, parasitology, pharmacology, toxicology, and mouse models of Chagas disease. We will pursue this work through two specific aims: (1) We will design and synthesize analogues of the lead compounds to elucidate structure?activity relationships and address any pharmacological liabilities. (2) We will evaluate analogues for in vitro antitrypanosomal activity, mammalian cell cytotoxicity, and pharmacological and toxicological properties; in vivo pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and efficacy in a mouse model of acute Chagas disease; and mechanisms of action. Our overall goal is to develop one or more optimized lead compounds for further preclinical and ultimately clinical development toward new drugs to treat Chagas disease."
"9234310","Project Summary/Abstract Psychological stress can induce activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, impairing the function of multiple biological systems and posing a risk to mental and physical health. In contrast, positive social interactions, especially social support from deeply rooted social bonds, can ameliorate stress-induced mental, physiological, and behavioral deficits and improve an individual's overall well-being?a phenomenon known as social buffering [1, 2]. Such social buffering effects have been described in both human [3-5] and animal models [6, 7]. Although we have begun to understand the neuromechanisms underlying biobehavioral responses to psychological stress, little is known about the neuromechanisms by which social support buffers the stress response [1]. This is largely due to the difficulties inherent in studying neurobiological mechanisms in humans as well as a lack of appropriate animal models to assess the effects of social buffering. Recently, the socially monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) has emerged as an animal model to study the neurobiology of social behavior. In prairie voles, mating induces pair bonding, which is regulated by several neurochemicals including oxytocin (OT), vasopressin (AVP), corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [8, 9]. Pair bonding reduces stress-induced anxiety-like behavior by attenuating the action of the HPA axis [10]. Interactions with the partner also promote the release of central OT [11], which plays a role in attenuating the biobehavioral response to stress in female voles [12]. Using this unique animal model, we propose, in Specific Aim 1, to examine how social buffering by a sibling cage mate or a bonding partner attenuates immobilization (IMO)-induced stress responses in male and female prairie voles. We will examine the effects of social buffering on (1) anxiety-like, depression-like, and affiliative behaviors, (2) circulating levels of corticosterone (CORT), (3) CRH, OT, AVP, GABA, and their receptors gene and protein expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and (4) neurochemical release in the PVN during IMO and social buffering. In Specific Aim 2, we will perform pharmacological manipulations with behavioral testing to examine the functional role of PVN OT, and its interactions with GABA, CRH and AVP, in the social buffering of the stress response. In Specific Aim 3, we will examine the neurochemical and physiological involvement of PVN neuromicrocircuitry in the regulation of social buffering. Data from this study will not only enhance our understanding of sex differences in the neurochemical regulation of social buffering of stress responses but also further establish a much needed animal model for such investigation."
"9236442","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Monocytes and macrophages (M?) sense the presence of pathogens, tissue damage, and host-derived mediators in their environment and respond by differentiating into distinct functional phenotypes that mediate host innate immune responses. The process of M? differentiation has often been described in terms of ?plastic- ity,? implying that these cells modulate their functions through rapidly reversible differentiation steps in re- sponse to environmental changes in the host. For example, ?classically activated? M? (CAM; M1) are highly microbicidal, yet their production of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide may also damage host tissue. At the other end of the functional spectrum, ?alternatively activated? M? (AAM or M2), induced by IL-4 and IL-13, mediate ?wound healing? through elimination of damaged tissue and other anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Dur- ing the past three decades, the PI has undertaken research designed to dissect the complex molecular under- pinnings of M? differentiation and how this impacts host defenses and disease outcome. In the proposed stud- ies, the central hypothesis to be tested is that activation of specific intracellular signaling pathways distal to en- gagement of TLR4 and/or other signaling receptors by influenza-induced PAMPs and DAMPs serve to pro- gram expression of discrete cassettes of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes that control the manner in which the host M? responds to infection. Two Specific Aims are proposed to test this hypothesis in vitro and in vivo, with the ultimate goal of identifying novel therapeutic interventions for diseases where M? are required for contain- ing the invading pathogen and/or resolving tissue damage caused by pathogens or the host inflammatory re- sponse to infection. Both male and female mice (because of the availability of genetically engineered strains), and cotton rats (that are uniquely susceptible to human non-adapted isolates of influenza) will be utilized as models of primary (1o) influenza infection and 1o influenza infection followed by secondary (2o) bacterial infec- tion. The proposed innovative experimental approaches are designed to: (1) identify TLR4-interacting signaling receptors (i.e., PAR2, RAGE, CD11b/CD18) and delineate the contributions of these interactions to regulation of M? differentiation/susceptibility to influenza infection; and, (2) identify influenza-triggered, epigenetic and/or M? differentiative mechanisms that mediate susceptibility to 2o Gram-positive bacterial infection. At the conclu- sion of these comprehensive studies, key processes that govern interactions of TLR agonists that lead to changes in M? activation will have been defined that, in turn, can be expected to translate into reasonable and practical therapeutic approaches for controlling invading pathogens or counteracting inflammatory damage to tissues induced by pathogens, ultimately providing evidence-based therapies to treat infectious diseases."
"9237139","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that manifests predominantly as a destructive synovitis. In spite of the prominence of the synovial inflammation, many immunological abnormalities are systemic. Autoantibodies are not tissue-specific and are directed against global antigens such as Ig Fc determinants and neoantigens of citrullinated peptides. T cell abnormalities in RA are already detectable in naïve T cells. Naïve T cells from RA patients have a lowered signaling threshold of the T cell receptor which may explain why failure in immune tolerance to neoantigens such as citrullinated peptides is the immunological hallmark of RA. They have defects in DNA repair mechanisms which predisposes for increased apoptosis susceptibility and accelerated immunosenescence. And they have rewired their metabolic network shunting glucose preferentially into the pentose phosphate pathway to reduce oxidative stress and produce metabolites necessary for synthetic activities. This application aims at gaining a deeper understanding of T cell dysfunction in RA by characterizing their epigenetic landscape. We will use a recently developed platform, assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC)-sequencing that allows genome-wide mapping of the open chromatin within small populations of isolated T cells including antigen- specific T cells. [Three aims are proposed. The objective of Aim 1 is to identify RA-associated epigenetic signatures in naïve T cells by comparing patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis and age-matched controls and relate them to the signatures in memory T cells and autoantigen-specific T cells. Aim 2 will explore the influence of disease activity and treatment on these signatures. By examining transcription factor (TF) target sequences at accessible sites, we will define transcription factor networks that are associated with RA and/or related to cytokine exposure in peripheral blood or the synovial tissue. In Aim 3, we will explore the functional consequences of differential chromatin accessibility by comparing open sites to the transcriptome of T cell subsets before and after activation. In addition, we will determine the relationship of open sites to eQTLs and to causal SNPs implicated in RA. These studies will provide a comprehensive map of promoter and enhancer accessibilities in RA T cells that may determine the transcriptome at resting stage as well as their ability to respond and develop into autoantigen-specific effector T cells.]"
"9237143","Numerous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have established that circulating levels of testosterone decline with age in men, and this decline has been associated with parallel age-related metabolic and pathophysiological changes such as increased fat mass, cardiovascular risk, and incidence of frailty, depression, osteopenia, osteoporosis, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and decreased muscle/bone mass, and sexual function. Likewise, aging of the human ovary also results in a gradual decline in ovarian steroid production, followed by an abrupt and complete cessation of both progesterone and estrogen production at the onset of menopause. Similarly, human aging is accompanied by a dramatic decline in adrenal androgens (DHEA, DHEAS) and alterations in cortisol and aldosterone production and secretion. Similar to humans, aging in experimental rodents is also associated with profound changes in the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones, particularly testosterone. Moreover, most of the age-induced alterations in the testicular (testosterone) and adrenal steroid responses in experimental rodents are reflective of the response in humans. Although the various cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling this aging defect in rodents have not been unequivocally identified, recent studies mainly from this laboratory have established a causal link between increased ROS formation/excessive oxidative stress and oxidative damage (especially from life-long continued processing of cholesterol for steroid production) to the cellular machinery involved in cholesterol transport to mitochondria, resulting in attenuated cholesterol transport with consequent impairment of steroidogenesis during aging. The cytosolic Sod1peroxiredoxins (Prdx) and mitochondrial Sod2 peroxiredoxins are the most potent anti-oxidant defense systems in steroid producing cells. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the functional expression of both cytosolic and mitochondrial Sod-Prdx antioxidant axes is coordinately and robustly downregulated most likely via excessive oxidative damage during aging. Using the above information, we propose the following 3 specific aims to investigate our hypothesis that increased ROS formation/excessive oxidative stress and ensuing oxidative damage to cytosolic and mitochondrial Sod-Prdx antioxidant axes, leads to downregulation of functional expression of crucial proteins involved in cholesterol transport to (SNAREs) and within the mitochondria (StAR) for side- chain cleavage (Cyp11a1), resulting in impaired cholesterol transport to mitochondria and failed steroidogenesis. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of oxidant-sensitive p38 MAPK will attenuate or prevent age-related decline in steroid hormone synthesis and secretion. Specific Aim 1: Examine a functional link between ROS induced impairment of expression of components of the Sod-Prdx axes and oxidative stress-induced down-regulation of SNAREs and StAR, resulting in loss of steroidogenic response during aging; Specific Aim 2: Assess the contribution of Sods and Prdx proteins in ROS-mediated inhibition/inactivation of specific SNAREs and StAR, impaired cholesterol transport to mitochondria, and inhibition of steroidogenesis in aging; and Specific Aim 3: Determine whether pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of p38 MAPK reverses impaired steroidogenesis during aging or in antioxidant-deficient mouse models. The planned studies involve a multi- level approach including use of state-of-the art biochemical, cell biology, and molecular biology techniques, several metabolic aging mouse and rat models, and genetically altered mice with increased or decreased expression of specific antioxidant enzymes and pharmacological intervention strategies to achieve the stated goals."
"9237216","The Cancer and Stem Cell Biology (CSCB) Program Area was established in 2010, in response to increasing evidence that the concepts and tools of stem cell biology can be used to gain new insights into cancer biology, and to take advantage of the tremendous expansion and productivity of the stem cell research community at UCLA. The primary goal of the CSCB Program Area is to link basic and translational investigators interested in the unique biological processes shared by malignancy and stem cells. The fundamental biology that characterizes these two fields can be viewed as the control of the opposing processes of self-renewal and differentiation. The balance of these processes is, in turn, determined by cell intrinsic and micro-environmental cues. These common mechanisms are studied by CSCB investigators using normal stem cells and their malignant counterparts from two experimental platforms: Hematopoiesis and Epithelium. Similarly, clinical research projects in CSCB focus predominantly on hematologic and genitourinary malignancies. Scientific interactions between the two platforms are driven by three main integrating themes that are relevant to the study of malignancy and stem cell biology irrespective of the specific tissue/cell source: 1) the regulation of growth and differentiation in tissue-specific stem cells during malignant transformation and normal development; 2) the role of microenvironment in tumor formation and stem cell regulation; 3) the use of pluripotent stem cells as a model to study basic mechanisms of self-renewal and transformation.

Of this amount, peer-reviewed funding totaled $13.5M in total costs, including $3.4M from the National Cancer Institute. As with other programs, JCCC fosters a number of interactive activities and shared resources that support investigators in HARP. During the current grant cycle, funds from the JCCC in the form of the CCSG Developmental Funds, institutional support and philanthropic gifts to HARP total $2,043,085. These funds supported seed grants, program area leadership support, as well as the annual disparities symposium hosted by HARP in the community. The HARP program is highly interactive, with 15% of its publications reflecting intra-programmatic efforts and 11 % reporting inter-programmatic collaborations. 178 (28%) appeared in high-impact journals. Accruals to prevention trials totaled 1,186, screening 1,021, early detection/diagnostic 1,151, epidemiologic/obs/outcome 1,426, correlative 113. The goals of the HARP are to advance understanding of cancer risk and protective factors and to identify strategies to make the latest cancer prevention knowledge and technologies accessible to the population at large. HARP research spans four broad focus areas: 1. cancer risk and protective factors/etiology, 2. primary prevention, 3. screening/early detection, 4. infrastructure projects supporting community engagement. Two major themes characterize the research of this program: cancer disparities and translational research (mainly T3 and T4). These themes are not mutually exclusive, and in fact most projects in the program incorporate both.

"9239071","Abstract BRAF kinase is frequently found mutated in human tumors and in the majority of melanomas. RAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib improved survival of melanoma patients with BRAF(V600E) tumors. Unfortunate- ly, responses are usually temporary, followed by development of resistance, most commonly due to ineffective inhibition of RAF and reactivation of ERK signaling in the presence of the drug. In addition, RAF inhibitors in- duce second site tumors, due to RAS-dependent paradoxical activation of RAF and downstream ERK signaling in normal cells. Outside of melanoma, RAF inhibitors showed limited efficacy in patients colorectal and thyroid BRAF(V600E) tumors, also due to ineffective inhibition of RAF/ERK signaling in these tumors. More recently, combinations of RAF and MEK inhibitors showed improved efficacy compared to RAF inhibitor monotherapy, but resistance eventually emerges as well. Resistance mechanisms identified to the RAF/MEK inhibitor combi- nation are similar to the ones identified for RAF inhibitor monotherapy, suggesting that ineffective inhibition of RAF is a critical limiting factor in both contexts. There is thus a pressing need for improved therapeutic strate- gies targeting oncogenic BRAF, such that durable responses and minimal side effects can be achieved. Our previous work showed that regulation of BRAF kinase by dimerization determines both the development of re- sistance to currently used RAF inhibitors and inhibitor-induced RAF paradoxical activation, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Recently, next generation RAF inhibitors with different structural and biochemical properties have entered preclinical and clinical development, but the most appropriate clinical context for their use is unknown. The goal of this proposal is to accomplish a detailed understanding of the mechanisms governing the targeting of oncogenic BRAF by small molecules inhibitors and to use this knowledge in order to design more effective RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies. More specifically, we will 1) characterize the mechanistic basis of resistance to RAF inhibitors due to BRAF dimerization by linking the conformational changes induced by inhibitor binding to BRAF to the biochemical effects of the inhibitor, 2) gain a detailed understanding of the biochemical mechanism of paradoxical RAF activation by inhibitors in cells with wild-type BRAF and 3) identify effective RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies for tumors with dimeric BRAF that would overcome RAF dimer-mediated intrinsic or acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors. The mech- anistic insights gained by the proposed experiments will enable the rational design of more effective small mol- ecule inhibitors and RAF inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies targeting oncogenic BRAF signaling, with mini- mal side effects and prolonged time to resistance."
"9239667","ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) develops from dysregulated differentiation and self-renewal programs in the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or early progenitors. The leukemia fusion protein CBF?-SMMHC represses the transcription regulatory program of the core-binding factor RUNX1/CBF? and generates preleukemic myeloid progenitor cells. These cells are susceptible to induce myeloid leukemia in cooperation with other oncogenic mutations. However, the pathways targeted by this fusion protein to induce pre-leukemic blasts, and the pathways involved in the oncogenic switch to leukemia are not known. We have developed a small molecule inhibitor of CBF?-SMMHC activity that binds to the fusion protein with high specificity, and disrupts CBF?-SMMHC/RUNX1 binding. As a result, RUNX1/CBF? dimers increases their occupancy at the promoters of target genes and induces the transcription regulation of RUNX1/CBFB target genes Preliminary studies show that pharmacologic CBF?-SMMHC inhibition induces apoptosis in inv(16) AML cells but not to other AML types or normal hematopoietic progenitors, suggesting an oncogene addiction switch. We hypothesize that CBF?-SMMHC blocks the differentiation of preleukemic cells by disrupting expression of CBF targets, and that this event is reversible. However, the progression from preleukemia to leukemia is based on transcriptional and chromatin changes directed by CBF?-SMMHC-mediated regulation of RUNX1/CBF? activity. In addition, we will evaluate the hypothesis that this switch is due to the upregulation of MYC expression, and that in leukemic cells (but not in preleukemic cells) MYC activity maintains the survival programs. This hypothesis will be testes in the following three specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Determine how CBF?-SMMHC induces MYC expression and maintains AML survival. Specific Aim 2. Elucidate the transcription and chromatin modification directed by CBF?-SMMHC. Specific Aim 3. Determine the targets of CBF?-SMMHC mediated pre-leukemia and leukemia initiation. In summary, the proposed studies combine our expertise in core binding factor leukemia, our mouse models for inv(16) AML and our novel pharmacologic inhibitor to investigate the mechanism of CBF?-SMMHC directed preleukemia and the oncogene addiction in leukemia initiation and maintenance."
"9241506","Macrophages can have profound effects on the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by shaping the innate immune response. For example, pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages secrete tumor necrosis factor-? (TNF) and Interleukin-1 (IL-1), both of which can promulgate kidney injury and fibrosis. Through activation of type 1 angiotensin (AT1) receptors in the kidney, the renin angiotensin system (RAS) similarly plays a key role in progressive kidney damage culminating in renal fibrosis. However, in contrast to the pathogenic actions of renal AT1 receptors, our recent studies have shown that stimulation of AT1 receptors directly on macrophages suppresses their generation of M1 cytokines and thereby protects the kidney from progressive fibrosis. We further find that activating the AT1 receptor on macrophages enhances their expression of the transcription factor Krüppel like factor 4 (KLF4). In other disease models, KLF4 blunts the M1 polarization of macrophages, limiting their secretion of TNF, and we find that global TNF-deficiency ameliorates hypertensive CKD induced by RAS activation. We therefore hypothesize that AT1 receptor activation on macrophages attenuates RAS-dependent kidney damage and fibrosis by enhancing KLF4-mediated suppression of TNF. To test this, we will first determine the role of macrophage KLF4 in kidney disease, assessing renal damage and fibrosis in mice lacking KLF4 only in macrophages and wild-type controls subjected to the chronic angiotensin II infusion (HTN) and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) models of kidney injury and fibrosis. We predict that KLF4-deficiency in macrophages will exacerbate RAS-dependent CKD by exaggerating their generation of TNF. Therefore, as a next step we will assess the contribution of the enhanced TNF production in macrophages to RAS-dependent CKD by subjecting mice with macrophage- specific TNF deletion (TNF MKO) to our HTN and UUO models of RAS activation. Lastly, our hypothesis predicts that during treatment with a global AT1 receptor blocker (ARB), TNF induction accruing from AT1 receptor blockade on macrophages will diminish the renal protection afforded by blockade of renal AT1 receptors. To test this, we will compare HTN- and UUO-induced renal injury in TNF MKO and wild-type mice treated with an ARB and will determine if mice with macrophage-specific deletion of both TNF and the AT1 receptor have less kidney injury than those lacking the macrophage AT1 receptor alone. In the near term, these studies should guide strategies to use cytokine receptor blockade in conjunction with ARBs during progressive CKD. Over the longer term, distinguishing the contribution of AT1 receptors in the kidney to promote CKD progression from the protective effects of AT1 receptors on macrophages to mitigate M1- dependent tissue damage should facilitate the design of improved treatments for CKD."
"9242628","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over the past 75 years, researchers in digestive diseases at the University of Chicago have made crucial advances in the understanding of clinical disease behavior and progression, therapeutic efficacy, disease monitoring, cost-effectiveness assessment, genetics of IBD, epigenetics of IBD, microbial influences on gastrointestinal function, immune mechanisms, normal physiology and pathogenesis of luminal diseases. The investigators in the DDRCC have increasingly recognized that a comprehensive understanding of the clinical behavior, phenotype, epidemiology and pathophysiology of human disease requires the analysis of clinical data, analysis of human cells and tissues and the establishment/advancement of human model systems and cellular experiments. The ITR core was created to enable translational research by providing the infrastructure and means to integrate clinical information with experimental data relating to the microbiota, the intestinal tissue, the immune system and the genetic and epigenetic make-up. The ITR Core has the singular goal of establishing a centralized service to provide consultative and hands-on technical expertise to conduct associated human studies, key clinical database information that could be used for clinical trials recruitment, outcomes analysis, therapeutic efficacy studies, and in conjunction with biospecimen recruitment, a source of well-phenotyped samples as reagents for basic science and translational research. The Specific Aims of the ITR Core are summarized as follows: (1) to provide services for human biospecimen-based study design and cellular analysis; (2) to provide the infrastructure and services to optimize clinical database utilization and (3) to provide the infrastructure and services to optimize human biospecimen utilization. In particular, the ITR Core has worked steadfastly to optimize consultation services for human study design, create a dynamic mechanism to access and assess clinical data and to create an efficient workflow for patient and biospecimen recruitment. All improvements have been integrally supported by the University of Chicago and collaborative resources to address the needs of DDRCC investigators and to create an ITR Core that functions as a critical resource for the other DDRCC Cores. Since September 1, 2009, 27 DDRCC members (53% of membership) have utilized the ITR Core and 2568 Genesys IBD Registry and 603 Celiac Disease Registry patients have been recruited, with a total of 4477 patient recruited through the ITR Core for all GI studies in the past 5 years. The ITR Core has also built a repository of biospecimens to facilitate the rapid generation of data which includes 16,291 biospecimens on 1002 patients, including whole blood DNA, serum, biopsy RNA, biopsy DNA, flash frozen biopsy samples and FFPE tissues. The ITR core will continue to build on the infrastructural foundation established over the last 4 years to meet the growing and changing needs of DDRCC investigators for clinical database information and well-phenotyped biospecimens.

"9242749","ABSTRACT Rickettsiae are obligately intracellular bacterial pathogens transmitted by ticks, fleas, lice and mites. The clinical manifestations and morbidity of diseases caused by Rickettsia vary from mild to very severe and fatal. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by Rickettsia rickettsii; it is the most prevalent rickettsiosis in the Americas and known for its malignancy. Two other rickettsioses in the Americas caused by the emerging pathogens R. philipii and R. parkeri are typically milder in most individuals. One current view of the evolution of Rickettsia species postulates that rickettsial pathogenicity does not correlate to a gain in effectors of bacterial virulence, but rather with a loss of regulatory molecules which suppress expression of virulent phenotypes. We found that a 19 kb chromosome insert in R. philipii, the nearest relative of R. rickettsi, contains genes which are associated with control and/or attenuation of virulent phenotypes in many bacteria. Some of these genes are uniquely present in R. philipii and other rickettsiae of low pathogenicity, but absent in highly virulent rickettsiae such as R. rickettsii. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that the proteins encoded by some of the insert genes may attenuate the ability of those Rickettsia which contain these elements to cause severe infections in humans. The goals of the research proposed in this application are (1) to confirm that important functions are encoded by the chromosomal insert genes in R. philipii, and (2) to determine if they indeed modulate rickettsial pathogenicity. We will test our central hypothesis by accomplishing the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To obtain directed knockout mutants of genes encoded by the R. philipii chromosome insert. Aim 2. To assess the phenotypic differences of wild and knockout strains of R. philipii in in vitro host-cell interaction models and by comparative transcriptome analysis. With these tools we will be able to demonstrate the utility of a new genetic knockout system to inactivate selected rickettsial proteins and to conduct functional and structural studies on these proteins. These experiments will address the mechanisms of pathogenesis employed by different Rickettsia and the results may be useful in efforts to develop improved patient adjunctive therapies, and provide a novel assay pathway for screening for more effective antibiotics against rickettsioses."
"9244132","Ascaris is an important human parasite infecting a billion people leading to significant morbidity. Understanding the genome integrity, chromosome dynamics, and the role of programmed DNA elimination in the regulation of gene expression in Ascaris are important for understanding its biology and pathogenesis. In most organisms, the genome remains constant during their life. However, during the development of early Ascaris embryos, major genome changes can occur in pre-somatic cells leading to a reduced somatic genome. Little is known regarding the reorganization of the chromosomes and the molecular mechanisms of this process. We recently demonstrated that during Ascaris DNA elimination, ~13% of the germline genome sequence is thrown out, including ~700 genes. The ~700 eliminated genes are primarily expressed in the Ascaris germline and early embryo, suggesting that DNA elimination in Ascaris is an essential, irreversible mechanism for silencing a subset of germline- and early-embryo-expressed genes in somatic tissues.  Chromosome level reference genomes are needed to better understand Ascaris chromosome behavior during DNA elimination. I propose to generate chromosome level genome assemblies for both the Ascaris germline and somatic genomes. Chromosomal assemblies will reveal the distribution and organization of DNA breakpoints along the chromosomes to enable further insight into the DNA elimination process. DNA replication stress is a common and major source of endogenous DNA double-stranded breaks. In Ascaris, endogenous DNA breaks are required for the DNA elimination process. I hypothesize that replication stress may lead to breakpoints in DNA elimination. I propose to establish a DNA replication timing profile during programmed DNA elimination and use the chromosomal assemblies to better define early and late replicating regions. I will test whether replication stress is associated with DNA breaks for elimination by analyzing the replication timing in (1) high transcription regions; (2) difficult to replicate regions; (3) low replication fork density regions; and (4) genomic regions with long genes. DNA replication timing will also provide additional basic information that has not been determined in any nematode and might identify new targets for rational drug design.  A related horse parasitic nematode, Parascaris, also undergoes DNA elimination. The chromosome numbers of Ascaris and Parascaris are drastically different in their germline but strikingly similar in their soma, making them an attractive comparison for analysis of the breaks and sequences eliminated at the chromosomal level. Genome comparisons will illuminate the conservation and divergence of the retained chromosomes, eliminated DNA, and breakpoints. Examining conserved features between Ascaris and Parascaris will enable me to identify characteristics of DNA elimination and to gain insights into the mechanisms for DNA breakage and chromosome segregation. This chromosomal level comparison will also allow me to study whether DNA elimination in these parasites is a mechanism to generate a specific set of somatic chromosomes from different numbers of germline chromosomes in the somatic tissues.  My proposed studies will (1) define the chromosomal distribution of the DNA breakpoints, chromosomal changes, and the final somatic chromosomes organization after DNA elimination in a parasitic nematode and (2) establish a DNA replication timing profile for Ascaris to determine whether DNA replication stress contributes to the generation of DNA breaks associated with DNA elimination. My genome work will also comprehensively define the genes, regulatory elements, and the organization of genetic elements along Ascaris chromosomes providing a key resource for the nematode community. Development of chromosome level genome assemblies and an understanding of the organization and dynamics of the chromosomes will shed light on an unusual mechanism of gene and genome regulation in this important parasite and will provide an improved genomic resource for other molecular, immunological and cell biology studies on Ascaris."

From there, annotated metabolites will be validated, and unknown metabolites will be identified through a combination of novel compound synthesis, MS/MS data and NMR spectroscopy structural elucidation. The important metabolites that emerge from untargeted profiling will guide subsequent targeted quantitative metabolite measurements in plasma and tissue samples. We propose a proteomics workflow that includes global quantitative proteomics in muscle, adipose, and exosomes and assessment of posttranslational modifications using phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and indices of oxidative modifications. Global, discovery proteomics will guide targeted, quantitative proteomics of salient proteins in plasma (e.g., irisin, myostatin). Our peptide synthesis capabilities allows for custom synthesis of any stable isotope labeled peptides for standards for quantitation. In addition, we will measure stable isotope enrichment of labeled amino acids in plasma, muscle compartments, and individual skeletal muscle proteins thus offering an insight on how PA influences amino acid kinetics, protein metabolism, and translation of gene transcripts to individual proteins. Isotopic enrichment of lipids in plasma and tissues will enable measurements of fatty acid kinetics in response to PA. Advanced statistical methods will fuse proteomics and metabolomics data to generate molecular concept maps of PA. Here we propose to leverage a productive ongoing collaboration between metabolomics and proteomics experts at Mayo and University of Wisconsin as a single integrated analytical resource dedicated to uncovering molecular signatures of PA. Our goal is to not only contribute our analytical expertise, but also contribute our knowledge of muscle and adipose tissue biology to the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)."
"9259094","Abstract This proposal seeks to elucidate the dynamics and function of histone H3 lysine 36 methylation (H3K36me) and demethylation. Proper methylation and demethylation of H3K36 are critical for regulation of gene expression and organismal development. Defects in genes responsible for adding and removing this post- translational modification lead to developmental disorders and cancer. Understanding the dynamic nature of H3K36me is the focus of this study. Gaps in the field include understanding how demethylation relates to transcription, when and where demethylation functions across the genome and how this impacts organogenesis. While addition and removal of H3K36me are known to occur, the kinetics of this process remains largely unexplored. This project focuses on understanding these rapid dynamics using recently developed, innovative optogenetic tools that offer unprecedented control of enzymatic activity. The first aim seeks to understand the role of this dynamic equilibrium in transcription and gene expression regulation in the genetically tractable model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The hypothesis is that histone demethylases function collaboratively to erase H3K36me co-transcriptionally, which then permits proper histone acetylation required for chromatin remodeling during transcription elongation. To test this idea, a photoactivatable variant of Set2, the enzyme that catalyzes H3K36me, will permit characterization of the kinetics of loss of the modification, quantification of the impact of known and uncharacterized demethylases, clarification of the co-transcriptional role of these demethylases and identification of locations across the genome where they function. Preliminary results demonstrate rapid removal of H3K36me upon removal of Set2 and also suggest a role for the uncharacterized demethylase Ecm5 in removing H3K36me2. The second aim seeks to fill the knowledge gap linking dynamics of methylation and demethylation to the developing vulva in Caenorhabditis elegans, a paradigm for understanding signal transduction and cell specification in a multicellular organism. The hypothesis is that light-control of MET-1, an enzyme that catalyzes H3K36me3 in worms, will enable a new capability to study kinetics of this epigenetic mark and its role in cell fate determination in vulval development. Toward development of a photoactivatable variant of MET-1, pilot studies in tissue culture will guide engineering of C. elegans using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to effect whole- gene replacement of met-1, rendering MET-1 under optogenetic control. Using light-activatable MET-1, reciprocal shifts at defined stages of vulval development will test the kinetics of chromatin alterations and their impact on organogenesis. Finally, a reporter gene expression system and RNAi-mediated knockdown of known and uncharacterized demethylases will elucidate the impact of methylation dynamics on gene expression. Ultimately, this study will advance our understanding of epigenetic regulation of gene expression and development and establish new optogenetic methods to study dynamics of epigenetic modifications. !"
"9261018","Project Summary / Abstract  This proposal is requesting partial funding support for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty to participate in the inaugural Gordon Research Conference (GRC) entitled ?Neuroimmune Communication in Health and Disease,? which will be held in Ventura, CA from January 15-20, 2017. The overall goal of this international conference is to increase our understanding of mechanisms that regulate neuro-immune interactions during homeostasis and neurological disorders. The field of neuroimmunology has evolved considerably over the past two decades and emerged as one of the fastest moving disciplines in biomedical research. This inaugural GRC is specifically designed to capture the breadth of the field through cutting-edge sessions focused on how the immune system helps maintain and shape a healthy CNS, as well as how it participates in various pathophysiological conditions, such as autoimmune disease, stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, infections, CNS injury, and cognitive dysfunction. This meeting will represent a blend of immunology and neuroscience, and will congregate top tier scientists operating at the nexus between these two disciplines. Novel concepts pertaining to the complexities of the neural-immune interface will be explored and discussed in featured talks and daily poster sessions. An intended strength of this meeting will be the lively discussions and support / encouragement of young scientists in the field, especially trainees.  The program will open with a keynote session focused on lessons learned from the study of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The meeting will then proceed with 8 focused sessions that explore the contemporary field of neuroimmunology with topics that include: 1.) microglial functions during homeostasis and neurological diseases, 2.) immune signaling in the CNS, 3.) immune system in support of brain function, 4.) immunity and neurodegeneration, 5.) DAMPs, PAMPs and alarmins that regulate immunity in the CNS, 6.) microbiome-brain communication, 7.) impact of infectious immunity on CNS function, 8.) PNS-immune interactions. There will also be a special workshop dedicated to the challenges facing women in science. Having a dedicated GRC that delves into diverse aspects of the neural-immune interface fills a critical niche not provided by other neuroimmunological meetings, which are often more narrow in scope. With this meeting, we intend to reflect the full diversity of global neuroimmunology research by hosting a group of scientists and clinicians that are breaking new ground in the field. We believe that a balanced meeting bridging the fields of neuroscience and immunology is the best way to promote cross- disciplinary interactions and fuel the next generation of first rate neuroimmunological research. Lastly, this GRC is highly translational and is of great relevance to human health. Nearly all neurological disorders trigger an immune response, and it is now recognized that disequilibrium in the neural-immune interface can trigger a plethora of diseases in the CNS and periphery."
"9261314","The majority of PDAC cases in humans carry mutations in the KRAS gene. While oncogenic KRAS is sufficient to initiate the formation of pre-cancerous lesions in the pancreas, the development of invasive PDAC requires an accumulation of additional genetic and epigenetic alterations in other tumor susceptibility loci as well as changes in cytokine signaling. Inflammatory cytokines produced by the stroma and, more importantly, by the cancer cells themselves are important drivers for pancreatic cancer progression. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)-class cytokines are considered master regulators of cancer-associated inflammation and they all signal through specific ligand-receptor complexes that share the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) signal transducing subunit, which activates Janus kinases (JAKs) and their downstream Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs). IL-6-class cytokines are responsible for the persistent activation of STAT3 in cancer cells, which is a prerequisite for the progression of KRAS-driven pancreatic neoplasms. Using a novel genetically engineered mouse model, we can demonstrate that JAK1, and not JAK2 as commonly believed, is crucial for the activation of STAT3. Given the importance of IL-6 and STAT3 in malignant transformation, our findings provide a sound rationale for elucidating a potentially pivotal role for JAK1 in pancreatic carcinogenesis. The immediate objectives of this proposal are to mechanistically define how JAK1/STAT3 signaling contributes to the genesis and progression of PDAC. To accomplish this goal, we will use human pancreatic cancer cells and a state-of- the-art genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer to determine the biological significance of JAK1 in pancreatic cancer progression (aim 1). After establishing that targeting JAK1 is sufficient to block the activation of STAT3 and prevent pancreatic cancer metastasis, we will perform genome-wide transcriptome analyses to ascertain and validate new targets of JAK1/STAT3 signaling in PDAC. To assist the development of pharmacological agents that specifically target JAK1, we will further define sets of downstream target genes that can be used as biomarkers for a successful inhibition of this particular signaling pathway in human pancreatic cancer cells (aim 2). In the final aim of this project, we will examine the biological significance of two JAK1 downstream targets, RUNX1 and c-FOS, in pancreatic cancer progression with particular emphasis on their suggested role in the regulation of factors for extra cellular matrix remodeling. In an effort towards clinical translation, we will test a recently developed JAK1 inhibitor to assess whether this agent is able to selectively block the activation of STAT3 and expression of validated downstream target genes in pancreatic cancer cells. In summary, this will be the first comprehensive study that addresses a specific role for JAK1 in adenocarcinoma, and the collective results of this project are expected to provide new and detailed insight into the molecular and biologically relevant functions of this important member of the Janus kinase family in pancreatic carcinogenesis."
"9313135","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes severe bone loss which may result in pathologic fractures and, consequently, increased morbidity and health care costs. To date, the most effective strategies for preserving or restoring bone after SCI have utilized electrical stimulation (ES)-induced musculoskeletal loading. One critical question is whether the beneficial effects of ES reflect a decrease in the elevated rate of bone resorption, increased formation of new bone, or both. Answers to these questions are likely to guide the development of future strategies to minimize bone loss after SCI by identifying those components of bone metabolism that are not optimally stimulated by ES and might therefore be targets for additional types of intervention. Our preliminary data indicate that one week of reloading of bone after SCI by ES reduced bone resorptive activity through the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity in a rat model of SCI. Importantly, ES reversed SCI-induced upregulation of the expression in osteoblasts of the Wnt inhibitors (DKK1, sFRP2 and SOST) and increased expression in these cells of the Wnt-responsive gene osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts.  SCI related-bone loss may be worsened by reduced circulating levels of testosterone because this steroid hormone has anabolic actions on bone and its levels are commonly reduced after SCI. Recently, we observed that nandrolone, an anabolic steroid, reduced bone loss after paralysis due to SCI. Interestingly, nandrolone increased the expression of OPG, Runx2 and LRP5 in bone marrow-derived osteoblasts from SCI rats. LRP5 is a Wnt co-receptor closely linked to the control of bone mass, and Runx2 is another Wnt-responsive gene, and is involved in osteoblast differentiation. These findings suggest that one effect of nandrolone in unloaded bone is to stimulate Wnt signaling in osteoblasts and that Wnt signaling explains at least some of the protective effects of nandrolone on bone after SCI.  The central hypotheses suggested by our findings are: 1) ES effects on bone are due to a decrease in the elevated rate of bone resorption and increased formation of new bone; 2) anabolic steroids will provide additional or synergistic benefits to SCI-related bone loss when applied in conjunction with ES. If this is the case, these findings would be readily translated to clinical cae, and would provide an innovative therapeutic strategy for the marked loss of bone following SCI. As such, the following specific aims are proposed:  Specific Aim 1. To determine how ES alters the rates of bone formation and resorption and the properties of bone cells, and to characterize the effects of ES on bone mass. We will determine how longer or higher intensity of ES (i.e., 3 months for one hour a day or 1 month for 3 hours a day) alters BMD and BMC, and both metabolic and histomorphometric measures of bone resorption and bone formation. We will also test how longer periods or higher intensity of ES alter numbers of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in cultures of bone marrow cells and examine changes in expression in these cells of genes for their differentiation and activity.  Specific Aim 2. To determine whether a combination of ES and an androgen will reduce SCI- related bone loss to a greater extent than either ES or androgen alone. Nandrolone will be administered with or without concurrent ES. We will compare the effects on bone and bone cells of nandrolone combined with ES with the effects observed for ES or nandrolone alone. The possible role for other cellular and molecular mechanisms by which SCI-related bone loss is reduced by ES alone or nandrolone alone or in combination will be studied using DNA microarry analysis."
"9280878","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     RELEVANCE: This study will test a novel percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic implant for transfemoral amputees as an alternative to a socket prosthetic limb attachment system. This work aims to address the complications associated with socket technology with a device that is implanted directly into the residual bone and can be used to improve the quality of life for Veterans amputees. Dr. Erik Kubiak and his collaborators have the clinical and research foundation on which to successfully complete this work.  The Department of Veterans Affairs currently provides care for over 340,000 individuals with limb loss. The rate of amputations within the U.S. military population has doubled over the past decade as a result of the Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom conflicts compared to previous wars. The majority of these amputees are eager to regain function but face ongoing burdens as a result of their limb loss. The current prosthetic socket system is fraught with complications and is difficul to use in cases where the residual limb is short and with multiple-limb loss. Commonly, socket wearers experience recurring complications, which include skin breakdown due to friction, discomfort, limb pain, infection, insecure socket fixation, and frequent re-fitting due to body mass changes. These challenges prohibit most amputees from comfortably wearing their prosthesis more than a few hours a day.  OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to test a novel percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic implant in Veteran transfemoral amputees. The following specific aims will be tested:  AIMS: 1) Evaluate a new percutaneous prosthetic attachment system for safety in a limited  number of human subjects (N=10); 2) Optimize the surgical technique for implanting the  percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic attachment system in a limited number of human  subjects; 3) Develop post-operative monitoring and rehabilitation techniques specific for subjects  implanted with this percutaneous osseointegrated device to measure efficacy; 4) Build the clinical  platform for transferring osseointegrated technology to other VA and military institutions.  METHODS: Ten subjects that have undergone transfemoral amputation not due to peripheral vascular disease, complications from diabetes, or infection will be enrolled at the George E.  Wahlen VA Medical Center, Salt Lake City, Utah. All subjects will receive the percutaneous osseointegrated device. The surgical protocol will consist of a two-stage procedure. The endo-prosthetic portion of the device will be implanted at Stage 1. The exo-prosthetic portion of the device will be implanted six weeks later to allow the soft tissue envelope to mature and regain a viable blood supply. Subjects will be systematically monitored for one year following the Stage 2 surgery for data collection. Subjects will be followed for life as part of routine clinical care. Each subject will undergo careful assessment prior to the implant surgery and during the one-year follow-up period. Radiographs, DEXA scanning, microbiology and validated tools for monitoring activity, impairment and patient satisfaction will be used to objectively quantify prosthetic utilization and patient quality of lif.  SIGNIFICANCE: The success of this novel percutaneous osseointegrated prosthetic device has the potential to significantly improve VA clinical care for amputees by reducing complications associated with traditional socket attachment system. This research would also greatly improve the Veteran's function and overall quality of life."
"9391772","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a five-year mentored training program for the career development of a physician- scientist to examine how physiologic stress pathways induced by catecholamines and glucocorticoids regulate cutaneous immunity to pathogens. Currently, little is known about how transcriptional networks elicited by these stress molecules globally regulate inflammatory responses to cutaneous pathogens in humans. Using high throughput RNA sequencing, this proposal will allow the investigation of how catecholamine- or glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional networks intersect with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced inflammatory pathways. This network analysis will be applied to skin lesions of leprosy patients to analyze their contribution to leprosy pathogenesis. Finally, the effects of stress molecules on T cell polarization and antimicrobial responses to M. leprae will be determined as it is a cutaneous pathogen whose control is dependent on appropriate TLR-mediated immunity. This project addresses several goals of NIAMS including how neural inputs control cutaneous inflammatory and host defense pathways in macrophages, and how they regulate T cell polarization and antimicrobial pathways in leprosy. The candidate previously completed a PhD studying the generation of adaptive immune responses in murine sepsis and will have completed both clinical residency training and a post-doctoral fellowship through the STAR program research track at UCLA. Through this proposal, he will develop new molecular techniques, including high throughput RNA sequencing and the computational analytical skills required to understand transcriptional regulation, restriction enzyme-based promoter accessibility studies, and chromatin histone immunoprecipitation to increase his molecular skills. He will also expand his clinical translational skills, as this proposal has a large translational component involving healthy controls and leprosy patients. These new techniques and skills can be applied to virtually any skin disorder. This critical mentored phase of training will be performed under the mentorship of Stephen Smale, PhD, an expert in the field of transcriptional regulation of immune responses, and Robert Modlin, MD, a pioneer in translational cutaneous immunology research, both of whom have trained numerous independent investigators. Additionally, these two PIs are collaborators on UCLA's NIAMS-funded P50 Center for Research Translation in skin disease, and will be able to provide additional support through their existing collaboration. The K08 award will allow the investigation of this research in the context of a much larger goal. This research will improve the understanding of how inflammatory transcriptional networks are regulated by physiologic stress pathways in the skin and provide insight into potential therapeutics for cutaneous immunity. This program will allow the candidate to develop the skills and tools needed to embark upon this research project, while having the necessary mentorship and support needed towards the goal of maturing into an independent investigator."

Together, the mentor, co-mentors, and collaborators are fully committed to assisting the Candidate reach her research training and career development goals and to ensuring the Candidate's successful transition from postdoctoral fellow to independent researcher. During the independent K99 award phase, the Candidate will obtain additional training in mixed methods research and developing country health systems and will use secondary data to assess the relationship between quality of care, as traditionally defined, and continued contraceptive use. During this time Dr. Tumlinson will also design and implement primary data collection activities in Western Kenya that integrate qualitative research techniques and health systems approaches. During the independent R00 award phase, the Candidate will apply the cross-disciplinary tools developed during the K99 component to assess critical service delivery barriers in Kenya. The proposed research is both novel and of major public health importance, with enormous relevance for reducing maternal, infant, and child mortality in developing country settings. The short-term benefits from this study will be a contribution to the understudied area of family planning service delivery barriers resulting from chronic absenteeism, bribery, and patient abuse."
"9343088","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Discovery of pathways that implicate complex diseases in humans is at the forefront of biomedical research. Many scientists are specifically interested in discovery of local causal pathways that contain only direct causes and direct effects of the phenotype or target molecule of interest. In the current project we propose a new framework and methods to enable accurate discovery of local causal pathways by integrating high-throughput observational data with efficient experimentation strategies. At the core of this framework are computational causal discovery methods that account for multiplicity of causal pathways consistent with the data. This phenomenon confounds the causal role of the variables and leads to a large number of false negative and false positive predictions in the output of all current causal discovery algorithms. The framework is designed specifically for biomedical researchers by taking into consideration their significant resource limitations and experimental workflow. For this reason, one of the primary objectives of the proposed framework is to minimize the use of costly wet-laboratory experimental resources while achieving high discovery accuracy. The proposed project extends our prior work, where we have studied the phenomenon of multiplicity of molecular signatures and causal pathways consistent with the data and provided a family of new methods (called TIE*) that can provably and efficiently discover from observational data all signatures of the phenotype. Even though TIE* methods can extract multiple signatures of the disease, determining its local causal pathway and causal role of the involved molecular variables requires new methods that are proposed herein. We hypothesize that the new methods for discovery of local causal pathways from a combination of observational and experimental data can achieve higher discovery accuracy than existing observational approaches while using fewer experimental resources than existing experimental approaches. Briefly, we propose to develop new accurate and experimentally efficient local causal pathway discovery methods; extensively evaluate new and existing methods both in realistic in-silico and real biological data and pathways; improve understanding of assumptions of these methods and their practicality in high-throughput data; and apply these methods to two ongoing front-line biomedical projects to generate and experimentally validate new insights about two diseases. The first biomedical project aims to understand molecular mechanisms leading to metastasis and lymph node involvement from locally advanced breast cancer. The second biomedical project aims to unravel the fatty liver disease-related local causal pathways."

"9177755","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age of acquisition effects on sign language development and brain processing Age of first-language acquisition, L1 AoA, has enduring effects on adult language abilities and brain language processing. Using deaf signers' acquisition of ASL as a model for the critical period for language, this project investigates three questions. How does L1 AoA affect the development of simple compared with complex and inter-sentential structure? Does the brain process language differently when language development begins at older as compared to younger ages? Are there links between language development and brain language processing? The language and neuroimaing studies employ a retrospective, cross-sectional design. Comprehension and production of American Sign Language, ASL, is investigated with sentence-to-picture matching tasks with accuracy and reaction time as dependent measures, and detailed linguistic analyses of picture descriptions given in ASL. Brain language processing is investigated with aMEG and fMRI using match-mismatch designs with pictures and signs. L1 AoA is controlled by testing two unique groups: one is deaf adoptees raised by ASL signing families; the other is deaf immigrants who learned ASL in school after immigrating to the USA with their hearing, non-signing families. Individuals in both groups acquired language in either early or late childhood. Comparing the language and brain language processing of the two groups helps determine if the amount of input during language development mitgates L1 AoA effects on language and brain processing. One control group is deaf adults who learned ASL from infancy; their results show language and brain processing patterns associated with an onset of language acquisition in infancy. A second control group is L2 learners of ASL; their results show what language brain processing patterns look like when a L2 is learned in later life. The language hypotheses are that simple sentence structures can be acquired at any age but that complex and inter-sentential structure cannot, both in comprehension and production. The brain processing hypotheses are that an early onset of language acquisition is necessary for the classic language network in the left hemisphere to develop fully. When the onset of language acquisition is late, posterior regions responsible for visual and spatial processing predominate language processing. Level of language skill is predicted to relate to these two types of brain language processing. The results will provide information crucial for clinical and educational services for the deaf population as well as for theory building about the relation of language to brain development."
"9180704","?    DESCRIPTION:  Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration in glaucoma is both a spatial and temporal progression of physiological dysfunction. Recent studies indicate that deficits in anterograde transport in RGC axons precede their physical loss and axon conductance is compromised during this early phase of degeneration. Interestingly, these functional deficits in axon physiology tend to occur in clusters of neighboring RGCs, suggesting that external cues in the immediate milieu may play a role in spatial spreading of functional deficits. Currently the physiological relevance of spatial aspects in the glaucomatous neurodegeneration process is poorly understood because traditional assays do not have the spatiotemporal resolution to probe groups of cells throughout an intact neurodegenerative tissue. The lack of effective assays to probe groups of cells in a spatiotemporally controlled manner, while maintaining their in vivo structural and chemical relationships poses a major challenge to our understanding of neurodegeneration in a variety of diseases. To address this issue, we are developing a versatile graphene-based microfluidic platform, which allows for recording and manipulating electrical activities of individual cells in a whole retinal tissue, long term ex vivo culture of retina in god health, multiple point-access to the retina for local stimulation through chemical factors, as well as high resolution confocal microscopy examination of the retina. A unique advantage of graphene is that its whole volume is exposed to the environment, which maximizes its sensitivity to local electrochemical potential change. For example, graphene transistors are capable of detecting individual gas molecules, due to its high surface to volume ratio and high electron mobility (100 to 1000 times higher than silicon). The high electron mobility also enables graphene transistors to operate at very high frequencies (up to 500 GHz), leading to high temporal resolution. Because of its strength and flexibility, graphene can adhere to cell membranes or tissue slices to achieve high electrical sensitivity. Furthermore, a single-layer of graphene transmits more than 97% of incident light, making it ideal to be used as transparent electrical devices that are compatible with optical imaging techniques. Recently, we have shown that scanning photocurrent microscopy can provide a local photoconductance map with a precision 10 times greater than the diffraction limit. As such, our unprecedented neurotechnology, a rare combination of graphene probes, scanning photocurrent microscopy, and a novel microfluidic platform, will enable new assays to study cell-cell interactions that regulate neurodegenerative disorders of retina."

This program is also intended to address the critical shortage of academic researchers in speech, language and hearing research, by drawing trainees from a very broad range of academic disciplines (i.e., including Biomedical Engineering, Neuroscience, and Speech, Language, and Hearing). During the training period, trainees will complete a range of required courses, participate in a weekly research symposium, and will complete a lab rotation that complements their research focus area. These activities have been selected to broaden the trainees' understanding of the full continuum of health research (i.e., from basic research through implementation of clinical practice). Trainees will integrate broadly into the community of researchers at Boston University in Communication Sciences and Disorders, and will also participate actively in national scientific conferences. The Training Faculty supporting this Training Program includes a very broad range of NIH-supported academic researchers focused on speech, language and hearing research. Key outcomes include the full range of accomplishments anticipated for high-achieving pre- and postdoctoral scholars: contributions to peer-reviewed manuscripts, application for federal research (e.g., NIH NRSA mechanisms) and/or training support, active participation in national or international scientific conferences, and eventually, employment by research universities with high levels of research activity."
"9172209","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The peripheral visual field is largely unexplored to our current method of clinical testing, static  threshold automated perimetry. Until the advent of computerized perimetry (quantitation of the visual field) 35 years ago, clinical practice was to test the full visual field manually by kinetic  (moving target) Goldmann perimetry. With the evolution to computerized static perimetry, the focus shifted to the central 30°. This seldom tested area, outside the central visual field, represents over 3 times the territory currently evaluated. This is important because the peripheral field is critical for navigation of the environment (functional vision), can be the earlest site of visual field defects, may be the most appropriate territory to follow patients needing changes in intervention and gives a more detailed and full evaluation of vision.  Our pilot data shows that advances in knowledge from our past Merit Reviews coupled with new methodology will now allow us to develop testing of the full visual field using static stimuli in a time-efficint precise and accurate way. This will give a comprehensive assessment of the visual field.  Main Hypothesis: Using larger perimetric stimuli in the peripheral visual field along with a Bayesian testing strategy will allow an efficient, accurate and precise perimetry method so that testing of the full visual field is practical and produces an improved assessment of vision.  Specific Aim 1. Characterize the location of far peripheral visual field defects of optic neuropathies to static stimuli. We will test the full visual field in 120 stable glaucoma and idiopathic intracranial hypertension subjects with a broad range of optic nerve damage to determine where defects occur in the far peripheral visual field to static automated testing. Specific Aim 2. Develop a Bayesian strategy to test the full visual field in less than 10 minutes per eye. We will develop a pattern of test locations in the central and peripheral field based on where visual field defects most often occur. By only using stimulus sizes and intensities that give excellent repeatability, a  Bayesian test strategy, and results from frequency of seeing curves, we will develop a new perimetry test. Specific Aim 3. Validate the full visual field testing using the new Bayesian strategy perimetry test. Sixty healthy observers will be tested twice and normative limits for the new test calculated. The 120 optic neuropathy subjects will be retested and the results compared. Specific Aim 4. Correlation of structure of the retinal nerve fiber layer and function (perimetry) using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with the full visual field will provide stronger correlations than only the central visual field.  We expect to find visual field defects i the peripheral visual field in cases where central visual field testing is normal and develop a tes that will give a better assessment of visual function. This will allow more accurate results leadin to earlier detection of diseases like glaucoma, earlier disease intervention and better structure /  function correlations. Improved test precision will lead to lower retest variability and earlier detection of visual field change. Also, with cases of moderate to severe visual loss, evaluation of  the full visual field will provide a larger area to monitor for changes in vision. Lastly, using lager stimuli will lead to almost a doubling of the effective dynamic range of the test that will lead to  better assessment of veterans with poor vision. These test attributes should allow improved functional visual assessment for veterans with glaucoma and other optic neuropathies and improved outcome measures for VA rehabilitation research protocols."
"9184542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite dramatic treatment advances in the past few decades, there remain subsets of pediatric leukemia that are very difficult to treat. A striking example is a particularly aggressive type of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) caused by rearrangement of the genes NUP98 (nucleoporin, 98-kd component of nuclear pore complex) and NSD1 (nuclear receptor-binding SET domain protein 1). This rearrangement leads to fusion of the normally separate NUP98 and NSD1 proteins. The first NUP98-NSD1 fusion was identified less than fifteen years ago, and it has since become clear that these genetic lesions are often missed by routine genetic testing of AML patients. Recent comprehensive studies using a specific detection method found that AML harboring NUP98- NSD1 was present in 4-5% of pediatric AML, associated with a grim 4-year event-free survival rate of 10-30%. Thus novel therapies specifically targeted to this group of pediatric patients are urgently needed. AML harboring NUP98-NSD1 fusions is initiated through activation of the expression of specific cancer-causing oncogenes, which results in a failure of the normal process of cell differentiation to give specific types of blood cell. Undifferentiated cells acquire the ability to proliferate unchecked, and it is this acquired capacity for self- renewal that is the key trigger for these cases of pediatric leukemia. NSD1 is a methyltransferase enzyme that activates gene expression by methylating a specific lysine residue in histones, affecting their interaction with DNA. Therefore, small molecules that inhibit the enzyme activity of NSD1 should be effective in reversing activation of the specific genes causing AML and allow malignant cells to revert to a normal differentiated form. Our goal is to develop a suite of assays to enable high-throughput screening of several hundred thousand compounds to discover inhibitors of the NSD1 enzyme, and to characterize these inhibitors to identify selective chemical probes and lead candidates as molecular therapies targeted to childhood leukemia's harboring the NUP98-NSD1 fusion."
"9187473","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technological advances in gene and cell therapies, retinal prostheses, and chemical photoswitches all show promise for restoring sight to the blind; however an accurate understanding of the functional role of each of the different types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in human behavior is key to realizing the potential for these therapeutic approaches. The long-term goal of the Neitz labs is to understand all the circuitry responsible for human vision using the non-human primate as a model. As a step toward achieving that goal, this proposal focuses on the circuitry involving RGCs that receive input from short wavelength (S) cones. Color vision has served as a premier example of a success in understanding the biological underpinnings of perception. While the characteristics of the cones and the spectral sensitivities of the photopigments and their importance for trichromatic color vision are understood in detail, understanding of how the outputs of the cones are processed to give rise to perceptions is still far from complete. The S-cone pathways play a role in the conscious perception of all hues and supply retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with important information regarding color for circadian rhythms. Based on the long known discrepancies between primate retinal physiology and human color perception, and on new data from the Neitz lab, the Neitz's hypothesize that S-cone input to hue perception is present both in the blue-yellow and red-green systems. The model makes specific predictions regarding the activities in midget ganglion cells in response to selective activation of S cones, including that midget ganglion cells receiving S cone input would not respond to white-dark edges and in this manner would differ from the conventional L vs. M midget ganglion cells that do respond well to white-dark boundaries. To test predictions of this model, I propose the following specific aim: Specific Aim 1: Optically record and analyze the activity of RGCs receiving S cone input in primate retina by using the biosensor ArcLight introduced by viral mediated gene delivery. The complete circuitry for processing S cone signals will be worked out using a custom visual stimulus to activate only S cones. ArcLight labeled neurons receiving S cone input will change in fluorescence intensity."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) is a highly productive research network that is essential to advancing the science and practice of pediatric critical care medicine. The overall aim of this renewal application is for Wayne State University (WSU), under the leadership of Kathleen Meert, MD, to continue as a clinical site in the CPCCRN. Dr. Meert, PI for the CPCCRN at WSU for the past 10 years, is a pediatric intensivist with a wealth of clinical and translational research experienc and an established track record of scientific publications for the CPCCRN. Additionally, Dr. Meert has demonstrated research expertise in behavioral medicine and communication science. Strengths of WSU as a clinical site include the Children s Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a free-standing, tertiary care, academic children s hospital offering the full spectrum of pediatric and surgical subspecialty services. The PICU at CHM is a 38-bed multidisciplinary unit that cares for >1500 patients/year with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Over 85% of PICU patients have follow-up within the institution. CHM is an American College of Surgeons verified Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center and an American Burn Association verified Burn Center. Additional strengths of WSU include its vast experience with federally-funded multicenter research networks such as the Neonatal Network, Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Intervention, Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials Network, Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network, and the Children s Oncology Group. The concept proposal included in this application builds on prior CPCCRN research, led by Dr. Meert, demonstrating many challenges to achieving high quality parent-clinician communication in PICUs. High quality communication is especially important for parents with low health literacy, a key contributing factor to child health disparities. Patient- and family-centered communication (PFCC) may improve the quality of communication but depends, in part, on parents  active participation (e.g., question asking) during clinical interactions. The objective of the concept proposal is to develop a novel communication intervention, the Question Prompt Toolkit; and determine the extent to which the intervention can enhance PFCC in PICUs, and thus improve child and family outcomes. The central hypothesis is that use of the Question Prompt Toolkit will increase parents  active participation in clinical interactions, knowledge, self-efficacy and trust, reduce parent's  anxiety, and ultimately contribute to better health-related quality of life for the child and reduced family burden, especially for families with low health literacy. The hypothesis will be tested in multicenter research that pursues 2 specific aims: (1) Develop the Question Prompt Toolkit for use among parents of critically-ill children; and (2) Determine the extent to which the Question Prompt Toolkit can enhance the use of PFCC in PICUs and improve child and family outcomes. The proposal is significant because it will contribute a new communication intervention that can be applied in PICU practice to address parents'  communication needs and improve health outcomes."
"9189638","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oocytes and preimplantation stage embryos are exquisitely sensitive to their environments, and even minor alterations can lead to significant effects on adult health (e.g,. adult hypertension following maternal low-protein  diet during the preimplantation period).  Learning how minor, transient changes in the oocyte/early embryo environment can have such long-term, persistent, and serious effects is vital for improving human health.  This proposal is founded on three central hypotheses: (1) in order for transient treatments of oocytes/early embryos to exert long-term effects on adult phenotype, heritable, stable, epigenetic changes must arise that modify gene expression, development, and physiology~ (2) Because these changes arise a result of oocyte/early embryo exposure, and persist, they should exist in all cells and tissues of the adult body, and will likely affect a brod range of characteristics. (3) Because placental function is key to post-natal phenotype, epigenetic changes also arise in the placenta to affect its function, which in turn affects post-natal health. The objectives of this proposal are to determine when epigenetic changes occur, their stability, their affected genes, and their affected processes. Microsurgical oocyte manipulation and manipulation of embryo culture medium together provide a unique system to do this.  We observed in mice that inter-strain germinal vesicle transfer (iGVT) results in a pronounced growth deficiency in a large fraction of female progeny.  Additionally, altering the zygotic REDOX state (ZRS) by changing the pyruvate and lactate content in the culture medium for 10 h of culture can lead to transient or persistent post-natal growth effects. Together, these results establish iGVT and ZRS manipulation as ideal approaches that can be combined for studying the origins and nature of epigenetic changes that underlie abnormal fetal, post-natal and adult phenotypes that arise from early effects on oocytes and zygotes, and testing whether such effects can be prevented. Our Aims are to determine the  mechanistic connections between oocyte (iGVT) and embryo (altered ZRS) perturbations in modifying post- natal growth, to identify the nature, timing, and stability of epigenetic changes and the array of affected genes  and to determine possible overlap with epigenetic effects observed for human assisted reproduction and other  variables affecting progeny growth."
"9195211","PROJECT SUMMARY While circulating endothelial cells (ECs) show the potential to home to sites of vascular injury, aiding in its repair, they are difficult to isolate and expand in vitro, requiring animal products that are potential pathogenic, curtailing their use as vascular therapeutics. To this end, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) including human embryonic (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCS), serve as a potential renewal source of ECs. While their derivation from hPSCs have been achieved, the chemical cues used to induce their differentiation is ill-defined due to the inherent variability in animal serums used in the maturation media. In addition, the effect of physical cues relevant to the developing vasculature such as confinement and shear stress towards EC fate decision and arterial/venous specification have yet to be elucidated. The goal of this proposed research is to achieve a homogenous population of arterial or venous ECs in a clinically relevant manner. Our aims are to: (1) Establish a chemically-defined differentiation protocol that promotes EC commitment from hPSCs; (2) guide EC fate via confinement in chemically-defined culture conditions and (3) determine the effect of shear stress on EC arterial/venous specification. To achieve these aims, a highly interdisciplinary approach is taken, incorporating the fields of stem cell and vascular biology as well as engineering principles. Successful completion of these aims will broaden our understanding of the physio-chemical factors driving stem cell fate, with considerable impact in using the differentiated cells as vascular therapeutics."
"9191371","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to investigate the neural mechanisms whereby perceptual information guides oculomotor choices; speci?cally, we propose to record neuronal activity in the context of urgent decision-making, which allows us to dissociate perceptual and motor performance with unprecedented effectiveness. Neuroscientists have successfully studied choice behavior with numerous tasks in which a perceptual judgment is made and is followed by a motor report, but this approach has limitations. First, it allows various covert factors such as attention, anticipation, or task difculty to be traded against each other, creating ambiguities that cannot be resolved via standard psychophysical metrics, i.e., reaction time and choice accuracy. And second, serialization suppresses the rapid, reciprocal interaction between perceptual-analysis and motor-planning processes from which informed saccadic choices normally arise. In contrast, our approach is based on a recently developed task in which decisions are urgent, minimizing both of these problems. Notably, our framework also includes a heuristic model that relates neuronal responses to the subjects' behavior in this task with great quantitative detail. Thus, we propose to study how perception informs motor planning during urgent saccadic choices, engaging these processes within their natural time scale and dynamics and accurately relating them to psychophysical performance over time (during a trial). In the proposed experiments, oculomotor activity will be recorded from monkeys trained to perform several variants of our urgent choice task. Three problems will be addressed. First, the internal organization of the Frontal Eye Field (FEF), and how distinct neuron types within it participate in choice behavior. The idea is to simultaneously manipulate temporal and attentional demands to avoid the arti?cial alignment between attention and eye movements that standard tasks typically impose, and which confounds their neural correlates. The goal is to determine the contributions of FEF visual, visuomotor, and motor neurons to key neural functions: perceptual discrimination, attentional deployment, and motor planning (Aim 1). The second problem is how separate sensory cues are integrated to in?uence a motor plan and the ensuing choice. So, when an urgent decision is based on two informative features (e.g., shape and color) rather than one alone, perceptual performance may increase either because the perceptual process starts sooner or because it becomes more ef?cient, for instance, but each mechanism will have distinct psychophysical and neuronal signatures (Aim 2). Finally, both the FEF and lateral intraparietal area (LIP) are crucial for generating eye movements, but establishing essential functional distinctions between them has been dif?cult. We propose that fundamental differences should be observed when both urgency and attentional demands are varied during saccadic choices. This work will provide critical insight about how perceptual information is dynamically translated into motor output, will characterize how sensory information is integrated to generate enhanced behavioral performance, and will determine the degree of specialization of FEF and LIP in these processes. 1"

"9199139","Toxoplasma gondii is a prevalent human parasite that can cause severe disease in immune compromised individuals and fetuses. It is recognized as an important opportunistic pathogen in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) where it causes necrotizing encephalitis. It is believed that these episodes of central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis are due to transition of latent encysted bradyzoites (found in tissue cysts) into tachyzoites leading to increased inflammation and necrosis. The persistence of bradyzoites within tissue cysts is critical for latency and the major risk factor for reactivation during immune suppression. We have established that cysts are enclosed in highly glycosylated cyst wall, but the role(s) of glycosylation in persistence and the pathogenesis of parasites are not fully understood. Several glycoproteins are known to be expressed and localized to the cyst wall. We have demonstrated that one of these cyst wall glycoproteins, CST1, is critical in the differentiation of the parasites and formation of the cyst wall structure. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that CST1 is primarily modified by o-linked glycosylation and that this glycosylation of CST1 is critical for cyst wall stability. A limitation of studies on glycosylation of proteins in intracellular parasites has been the ability to get selective labeling of parasite proteins without those of the host. This R21 will focus on a glycomic analysis of T. gondii using novel reagents we have developed that employ click chemistry and genetically modified T. gondii strains. This technique is applicable to many compounds and, once validated, will provide a tool for selective delivery of small molecules to obligate intracellular pathogens, permitting selective labeling of these organisms as well as selective targeting of pathways. The proposed studies utilize a proteomic approach employing click chemistry and mass spectrometry to validate this new strategy. This will enable us to characterize the T. gondii glycoproteome during cyst formation. The interdisciplinary team that has been assembled for this project includes internationally recognized expertise in T. gondii bradyzoite biology (Dr. Louis Weiss), orthogonal click chemistry (Dr. Peng Wu) and glycobiology (Dr. Pamela Stanley)."
"9197286","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proximal tubule (PT) of the kidney is the primary site for reabsorption of ions, solutes, and filtered low molecular weight (LMW) proteins. PT cells acutely modulate ion transport capacity in respond to changes in fluid shear stress (FSS) that accompany alterations in glomerular filtration rate. This proposal is focused on understanding whether PT cells also adjust the capacity of megalin-and cubilin- mediated endocytosis of LMW proteins in response to altered demand. Defective uptake of these proteins leads to tubular proteinuria, which can eventually lead to renal failure. We have discovered that apical endocytosis of the megalin/cubilin ligand albumin as well as fluid phase markers is markedly increased upon exposure of PT cells to FSS. Moreover, primary cilia are required for this response. The aims of this proposal are to (1) determine how changes in FSS are transduced into effects on apical endocytosis and (2) determine whether defective modulation of flow-dependent endocytosis contributes to LMW proteinuria observed in animal models for Lowe Syndrome, an X- linked disorder that may involve defects in ciliogenesis. We have assembled an outstanding team of investigators with essential expertise to carry out this broad range of studies. The results of our experiments will provide key information about a newly discovered pathway that plays an essential role in maintaining kidney function."
"9206831","Project Summary/Abstract  Many cells possess projections from their surfaces called cilia. Mouse genetics has been instrumental in uncovering novel requirements for cilia in development, such as left/right axis specification, and skeletal and neural tube patterning. During mammalian development, cilia generate and sense flow, and interpret intercellular cues, such as Hedgehog signals. Defects in ciliary function in humans cause diverse diseases known as ciliopathies. Despite the importance of the cilium, fundamental aspects of ciliary biology, including how cilia are constructed, how they signal, and how they coordinate diverse developmental events, remain poorly understood.  To illuminate answers to these longstanding questions, we propose to make use of a unique resource, the knockout mouse mutant strains being created by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). We have developed an innovative algorithm and demonstrated that it can identify mutant lines for which ciliary analysis will be valuable. We will use this algorithm to select mutants, and use these mutants to answer three complementary questions about cilia:  1) How are the sophisticated structures and subdomains of cilia built and contribute to ciliary function?  2) How is ciliary motility established and regulated?  3) How do cilia transduce intracellular signals, such as Hedgehog signals, and how does loss of this  intercellular communication contribute to the pathogenesis of ciliopathies?  To address these questions, we will combine advanced imaging approaches, including super-resolution microscopy, micro-computed tomography, with novel genetic tools such as transgenes that label cilia with GFP. The expertise accrued during our combined 25 years working on cilia in mouse development will allow us to use the novel mouse mutants to uncover novel principles underlying ciliogenesis and ciliary signaling. These discoveries will help identify the causative genes for orphan diseases, and illuminate the developmental origins of human ciliopathies."
"9199455","PROJECT SUMMARY  The generation of high-affinity antibodies and avoidance of autoimmune responses after microbial infection or vaccination requires precise control of the germinal center (GC) reaction by follicular T-cell subsets. Follicular helper CD4+ T (TFH) cells induce GC formation and help GC B cells to produce protective antibody responses to invading pathogens. FoxP3+ follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells inhibit TFH-driven GC responses and prevent emergence of auto-reactive B-cells and autoantibody formation. A key element in stable differentiation of both TFH and TFR is expression of the antagonistic Bcl6?Blimp1 pair of transcription factors (TF). Our recent studies of TFH differentiation have revealed that (a) ICOS-dependent binding of OPN-i to the Bcl6-RD2 domain promotes association of Bcl6 with the Mi-2? nucleosome remodeling and histone- deacetylase complex (Mi2??NuRD) and (b) this Bcl6-containing complex is essential for efficient repression of Blimp1, TFH lineage stability and repression of alternative TH fates. We examine the molecular basis of this process in SA1. Analysis of ICOS+ TFR has also revealed an association between OPN-i, Bcl6, and components of the Mi2?-NuRD complex. We test the hypothesis that OPN-i-dependent formation of the Bcl6?Mi-2?-NuRD complex regulates a common genetic program expressed by TFR and TFH cells. This will entail identification of shared genetic loci that are co-occupied by Bcl6 and Mi2-?-NuRD according to Bio-ChIP-Seq and ?ChIP-reChIP? analyses (SA2). Finally, we define the mechanism that allows co-expression of the antagonistic Bcl6?Blimp1 transcription factors in TFR and the contribution of Blimp1 to stable development and function of TFR cells is addressed in SA3. These studies should provide new insight into the molecular control of TFH/TFR differentiation and establish a foothold for new therapeutic approaches to autoimmune disease."
"9212271","Abstract Studies of one of the most important tumor suppressor genes, RB1, have transformed the treatment of human cancer. This success was based on targeting E2F-responsive genes that were deregulated as a direct consequence of dysfunctional pRB. However, there is accumulating evidence of a multifaceted role of pRB and its involvement as a major regulator in processes outside the cell cycle. In particular, we rediscovered one of the first pRB-interacting proteins, KDM5A, in a screen for cellular factors critical for pRB function during differentiation. We found that KDM5A is directly downstream of pRB in the pathway, as decreasing KDM5A protein levels in RB-deficient cells was reminiscent of the effects of reintroducing pRB: it increased the activity of cell-type-specific transcription factors, and restored gene expression and morphological changes associated with differentiation. KDM5A is a demethylase that reads and removes methylation from lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) at a subset of pRB target genes. Surprisingly, we found that pRB function at the onset of differentiation converges on activation of KDM5A target genes encoding mitochondrial components. Accordingly, overexpression in Rb-deficient cells of a major regulator of mitochondrial functions, PGC-1?, restored differentiation, phenocopying the reintroduction of pRB. In order to mechanistically understand the link between mitochondrial metabolic regulation and the induction of differentiation, we propose to study the RB pathway downstream of KDM5A: (1) we will investigate which functions in the mitochondrion are necessary and sufficient for differentiation rescue; (2) we will explore a therapeutic strategy for activation of mitochondrial function in cells from RB-deficient small cell lung cancers; (3) we will investigate whether there is a correlation between pRB deficiency and the mitochondrial signature, and how this relates to patient prognosis; and (4) we will study how mitochondrial genes are regulated by pRB, KDM5A and associated transcription factors. The relevance of KDM5A inhibition to cancer cell metabolism and differentiation is of great interest, as KDM5A is likely to be targeted by small-molecule inhibitors."
"9213116","Abstract The goal of this work is to clarify the role of spatial factors in the difficulty experienced by listeners with hearing impairment (HI) in understanding the speech of one particular talker in a mixture of talkers. Because HI listeners perform poorly when competing talkers are spatially separated, it is often assumed that an inability to exploit spatial cues is at the root of the problem. However, direct evidence for spatial deficits in HI listeners is lacking, as are clear links between spatial hearing and speech intelligibility. The experiments proposed here will carefully unpack and characterize the mechanisms affecting listeners with hearing loss in spatialized speech mixtures. The experiments proposed under Aim 1 will focus on the impact of reduced audibility, and determine the extent to which this basic deficit limits access to spatial information in addition to speech information. A stimulus processing approach that isolates clean ?glimpses? of the target sound in speech mixtures will enable intelligibility to be assessed in the absence of any explicit spatial task. Controlled manipulation of the spatial cues available in the stimuli will reveal the extent to which acoustic head-shadow contributes to the glimpses. Experiments under this aim will also explore the conditions under which access to high frequencies in speech is critical, and relate this knowledge to the benefits obtained from high-frequency amplification hearing aids. The experiments proposed under Aim 2 are designed to clarify the role of binaural temporal fine structure (TFS) in speech mixtures. The working hypothesis is that, although the amplitude envelopes of speech convey the primary information needed for high intelligibility, TFS carries auxiliary cues for sound source location that enable segregation of competing sounds. This hypothesis will be tested by comparing the effect of disrupting TFS on speech intelligibility for mixtures in which segregation is difficult versus relatively automatic. Parallel experiments will measure discrimination of the spatial location of speech sounds under the same conditions, in order to directly explore the link between spatial hearing and speech source segregation. Experiments in HI listeners will reveal whether these listeners exhibit an impairment specifically involving binaural TFS, an issue that remains unresolved in the literature. A critical aspect of this work will be to carefully consider the relationship between ?acoustic? TFS (extracted using signal processing techniques) and neural TFS (as coded in the auditory-nerve) in the context of speech signals. The experiments proposed under Aim 3 will examine a relatively unexplored but potentially crucial aspect of listening in speech mixtures: the rapid improvement in intelligibility over time that occurs when the listening environment is stable (e.g., when the talker of interest stays fixed at one location). A new speech task will be created that is optimized to observe the build-up, and the availability of different cues will be manipulated to determine the basis of the build-up in listeners with normal hearing. Performance will also be examined in HI listeners to determine whether they experience a similar build-up, and results will be related on an individual basis to the specific deficits identified in Aims 1 and 2. 1"
"9219647","ABSTRACT Despite recent advancements, metastatic pancreatic cancer remains a lethal disease with an average survival of less than one year. New targeted treatments are desperately needed. Identifying and expanding patient subgroups that would benefit most from promising targeted agents will immediately impact patient outcomes. The primary impact of our proposal relates to the clinical implementation of PARP inhibitors, harnessing a proven synthetic lethal therapeutic strategy personalized for a subset of pancreatic cancer patients. Recent whole genome sequencing of 100 pancreatic cancers highlighted the opportunity to use PARP inhibitor therapy targeted for tumors with a `DNA repair-BRCA-signature' subtype. Our work will expand three fronts of investigation and innovation in an effort to optimize the most promising drug class for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients. Aim 1 will expand our recent discovery that a post- transcriptional mechanism driven by the mRNA stability factor HuR, provides a resistance mechanism for pancreatic cancer cells exposed to PARP inhibitors. In this aim, we will extend our pre-clinical mouse modeling to establish HuR as a facilitator of PARP inhibitor resistance and establish that inhibiting HuR may sensitize all pancreatic tumors, regardless of DNA repair status, to PARP inhibitors. Aim 2 will further define, using cutting edge molecular and cell-based techniques and assays, a PARP inhibitor mechanism of action which is contingent upon a novel HuR-regulated target [i.e., (Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG)]. Aim 3 will leverage our molecular understanding of HuR biology and the identification of two small molecule inhibitors of HuR to develop novel and translatable strategies to enhance PARP inhibitor efficacy using a patient derived (i.e., organoid technology), live biobank from an ongoing PARP inhibitor trial conducted by investigators from the present proposal. The translational significance of our work relates to our efforts to improve upon a promising, personalized approach to pancreatic cancer through increased understanding of a recently discovered PARP inhibitor resistance mechanism. Our ultimate aim is to optimize a best-in-class treatment strategy presently limited to tumors harboring DNA repair deficiencies, so that this therapeutic strategy may be extended to include all pancreatic cancers, regardless of the DNA-repair status (i.e., BRCA2 mutant and wild type)."
"9221565","Project Summary Intracellular bacterial pathogens modulate host cell functions to generate intracellular niches that promote their survival, proliferation and persistence within their host. Determining the mechanisms used to create these niches is critical to understanding their pathogenesis. Many intracellular bacteria of public health concern exploit the host cell's secretory pathway, specifically the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), to support biogenesis of their replicative niche and intracellular growth, emphasizing the importance of this organelle in pathogenesis. Bacteria of the genus Brucella, the causative agents of the worldwide zoonosis brucellosis, undergo an intracellular cycle that culminates in the biogenesis of a replication- permissive Brucella-containing vacuole (rBCV) derived from the ER, ensuring their long-term survival and proliferation. rBCV biogenesis invokes functions of the host secretory pathway at the ER interface and requires the bacterium's VirB Type IV secretion system (T4SS), via delivery of effector proteins that presumably modulate various ER functions. Despite the established role of early secretory trafficking in the Brucella infectious cycle, whether and how Brucella exploits additional ER functions remains a knowledge gap in our understanding of its pathogenesis. We have recently identified a series of T4SS effectors, among which BspA contributes to rBCV biogenesis and bacterial replication and binds the host ER-associated degradation (ERAD) E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH6/TEB4, suggesting it impacts the ERAD pathway. Interestingly, pharmacological interference with ERAD, a central component of ER homeostasis, enhances replication of Brucella, suggesting that this pathway is deleterious to the bacterium's infectious cycle and possibly targeted by BspA. Here we will test the hypothesis that the Brucella T4SS effector BspA interacts with MARCH6 to interfere with ERAD functions and promote rBCV biogenesis and bacterial replication. First, we will use molecular and cellular approaches to elucidate the role the ERAD pathway plays in the Brucella infectious cycle and determine whether Brucella modulates it. Second, we will use various cellular and biochemical approaches to characterize the mode of action of the Brucella T4SS effector BspA on MARCH6 and elucidate the molecular basis of its contribution to rBCV biogenesis and Brucella replication. The proposed studies will likely uncover a new role of ERAD in bacterial pathogenesis, define the mode of action of a Brucella T4SS effector, and likely generate a new paradigm of pathogen interactions with the ER, a host cellular compartment essential to many intracellular microbes."
"9222222","Project Summary Multidrug-resistant forms of Plasmodium falciparum contribute directly to the massive global burden of malaria, which, as of 2015, impacts nearly 200 million people and result in over 400,000 deaths per year. P. falciparum resistance to the former first-line drugs chloroquine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine has now exacerbated the emergence and spread of resistance to the current first-line drug artemisinin (ART) and some partner drugs used in first line artemisinin (ART)-based combination therapies (ACTs). To achieve the stated goal of malaria elimination, new therapeutic strategies are essential to eliminate multi-drug resistant parasites. Recent studies of ART-resistant parasite strains suggest that they can resist drug-mediated killing by up-regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a process that depends on activation of the multi-catalytic proteasome complex. Consequently, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to be highly synergistic with ART derivatives. Unlike ART, these inhibitors are also active liver, gametocyte and oocyst stages. Therefore, compounds that selectively target the Plasmodium proteasome have the potential to be curative while also blocking transmission from human to insect vector and reducing the emergence of drug resistance. We hypothesize that ART, as well as other classes of current anti-malarial drugs and preclinical candidates, induce stress pathways in P. falciparum that depend on proteasomal activity to achieve resistance. We also hypothesize that proteasome inhibitors have the potential to be broadly used to suppress the onset of multidrug resistance in native parasite populations. This proposal is built around strong preliminary results using substrate screening assays and our recently solved cryo-electron microscopy structure of the P. falciparum 20S proteasome to design selective inhibitors of the parasite proteasome with nanomolar potency that effectively clear rodent malaria infections in vivo. We find that proteasome inhibitors show a high degree of synergism when combined with ART and are potent against ART-resistant field isolates. Our preliminary results therefore establish the paradigm that the proteasome is a viable anti-malarial drug target. We propose developing improved parasite-specific proteasome inhibitors that have enhanced potency, selectivity and bioavailability while simultaneously defining the mechanism and conditions by which inhibitors can optimally synergize with anti-malarial agents to prevent the spread of resistance."
"9222505","Project Summary/Abstract Malaria is responsible for nearly 500,000 deaths each year with most of those occurring in children under the age of five. There are approximately 200 million new cases each year and over 40% of the world population is at risk for infection. Malaria is caused by parasites in the genus Plasmodium, with P. falciparum being the most common and deadly. To combat emerging resistance, new antimalarial drugs that target novel biological aspects of parasite biology must be developed. Within the parasite is an unusual organelle called the apicoplast. The apicoplast is a relic chloroplast that has lost its photosynthetic capability but retains several important biochemical pathways. The parasite is dependent upon the apicoplast for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid units and it is essential for survival in both the erythrocytic and liver stages of infection, suggesting that it is an excellent drug target. The apicoplast has its own genome along with organelle-specific enzymes for DNA replication and repair. The lone DNA polymerase in the apicoplast (apPOL) is essential and preliminary data suggest it is a highly druggable target. We hypothesize that the inhibition of apPOL will disrupt apicoplast reproduction and cause the delayed death of the Plasmodium parasite. Thus, an apPOL inhibitor could serve as a combinational partner with current fast-acting malaria drugs and for chemoprotection against parasite infection. We propose to employ a target-based approach to identify inhibitors of apPOL that kill the Plasmodium parasite in culture. These inhibitors will then be chemically elaborated and optimized through an x-ray crystal structure-guided medicinal chemistry program. The optimized compounds will be tested in treatment and prophylaxis mouse malaria models. The completion of this proposed research will significantly impact the search for new antimalarial drugs by adding novel compounds to the discovery pipeline."

The elimination of infected livestock combined with vaccination of seronegative animals has effectively reduced the incidence of human brucellosis in many countries. However, brucellosis remains problematic in countries in Central and South America, the Middle East, Mediterranean rim, Africa, and Eastern and Central Asia where many infected animals remain. To date, there are no effective vaccines for humans, and because of limited efficacy of conventional vaccines for livestock, such threat makes it difficult and costly to eradicate the disease.  Humans and animals acquire infection via their oropharynx and upper respiratory tract following oral or aerosol exposure, and ultimately results in a systemic disease. Only few studies have considered the mucosal aspects of Brucella's pathogenesis. Given the relevance of mucosal exposure for Brucella infection, a vaccine devised at immunizing the oropharyngeal mucosa and associated lymphoid tissues has a high potential of success. In a quest to develop a more efficacious vaccine, several live attenuated Brucella mutants were generated, and when given mucosally, they confer complete protection against virulent Brucella challenges. Although mice have long been instrumental in our understanding of immunity to Brucella, infections need to be studied in animals that are natural hosts for Brucella, and one that share both physiological and immunological traits with humans. Hence, we seek to develop an animal model that reflects human brucellosis. Domestic, pigs' close resemblance to human immune system and anatomy of the oropharyngeal mucosa will allow us to study mucosal aspects of brucellosis in a natural host. The proposed work will investigate whether pigs can be adapted as a surrogate model to define the tenets of protective immunity subsequent oropharyngeal vaccination. Studies in Specific Aim 1 will determine the best oral vaccination regimen using our attenuated Brucella mutants. Studies in Specific Aim 2 will define which innate and adaptive cells induced in the oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues by oral vaccination to learn the source of the IFN- ?- and other cytokine-producing cells needed to resolve Brucella infections. Upon conclusion of these studies, we will establish an animal model for human brucellosis to enable future testing of brucellosis vaccines."
"9226266","Plasmodium falciparum is a deadly parasite that causes malaria in humans and is responsible for nearly 600,000 deaths very year. Malaria is endemic in large regions of the world infecting nearly ~300 million people every year. There are no effective vaccines against malaria and antimalarial drugs are the mainstay of treatment. Unfortunately, the parasite has gained resistance to all clinically available antimalarial drugs and these drug-resistant strains are spreading throughout the world. This is threatening all the progress that has been made against this disease in the last decade. Thus, it is imperative that we constantly identify potential drug targets to stay ahead of this nefarious disease. The parasites from the genus Plasmodium that cause malaria are single celled, eukaryotic pathogens. Since human cells are also eukaryotic, it can be tricky to develop drugs that specifically kill the parasite and don't have too many side effects. The parasitic Plasmodium cell is amazingly complex with two organelles that carry their own genetic material, the mitochondrion and a unique plastid of algal origin known as the apicoplast. The apicoplast is present only in the parasite and not in the human host. This makes it an ideal drug target since attacking the apicoplast will affect only the parasite and not the human host. In fact, some antibiotics have shown success as antimalarial drugs because they target essential biological processes in the apicoplast. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive the biology of this unique parasite organelle remain unknown, which hampers antimalarial drug development. The proposed studies target an important set of genes that we hypothesize to act as key regulators for the biogenesis of the apicoplast. Our preliminary data show that one of the targeted genes is essential for parasite growth underscoring the importance of this pathway in the biology of P. falciparum. We will apply genetic, cellular, and biochemical approaches to characterize the various roles that these genes play in the biogenesis of this essential parasite organelle. Attaining the aims of this proposal will uncover the novel biology of the apicoplast and identify parasite-specific essential proteins that can be targeted for antimalarial drug development."
"9226809","Poxviruses comprise highly dangerous emerging and re-emerging pathogens of humans and other vertebrates. They continue to have significant impact on public health despite eradication of smallpox, the deadliest disease in human history. Poxviruses are also being actively developed to treat various infectious diseases and multiple cancers. All poxvirus mRNAs transcribed after viral DNA replication have a poly(A) leader in their 5'-untranslated regions (5' UTRs). Though it is well established that the 5' UTR of an mRNA plays an important role in regulating eukaryotic mRNA translation, it is yet elusive whether the poly(A) leader facilitates viral mRNA translation during poxvirus infection. This lack of knowledge represents a major gap in understanding the fundamental mechanism of poxvirus gene expression. Using vaccinia virus, the prototypic poxvirus, the objective of this project is to determine the role of the poly(A) leader in translation of vaccinia virus post-replicative mRNAs and the mechanism by which the poly(A) leader functions. Our preliminary data support a hypothesis that the 5'-poly(A) leader confers a selective translational advantage specifically in vaccinia-infected cells that may involve both cap-independent and cap-dependent translation. The hypothesis will be tested through two aims. In Aim 1, the role of the poly(A) leader in translation of vaccinia post-replicative mRNAs will be determined. In aim 2, the roles of cap-dependent and cap-independent modes in translation of poly(A)-leader-containing mRNA will be examined. This project is expected to identify and establish a fundamental mechanism used by vaccinia virus to selectively translate its post-replicative mRNAs.  "
"9230498","Homeostatic survival of B lymphocytes is carefully regulated, and disruption of this regulation is an important factor in pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases and B cell malignancies. The latter are the most common hematologic cancers in the US population as well as in Veterans, in whom age/gender status, as well as exposures related to their service, can increase risk of B cell cancers. The signaling adapter protein TRAF3 plays an important, B-cell-specific role in restraining homeostatic survival and B cell activation. B cell TRAF3 deficiency in a mouse model causes abnormally high B cell survival that results in accumulation and infiltration of multiple organs and tissue with B cells, autoantibody production, and predisposition to B cell tumors. In humans, mutations of the TRAF3 gene are now recognized as common in B cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma. The proposed project will address the hypothesis that functional TRAF3 deficiency can also be caused by cellular events leading to TRAF3 membrane sequestration and/or degradation. Thus, TRAF3- regulated B cell survival abnormalities can contribute to an even higher proportion of malignancies than just those with genetic TRAF3 mutations. The proposed project will also build upon new information acquired during the most recent funding period, identifying B cell survival pathways regulated by TRAF3. The goals of the project are to determine how cellular signaling results in functional TRAF3 deficiency in B cells, and to identify TRAF3-regulated targetable B cell survival pathways, in both model systems and samples of human B cell malignancies, via the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the mechanisms and impact of TRAF3- receptor interactions and TRAF3 deficiency on TRAF3-regulated B cell survival pathways. 2) Identify drugs/compounds effective in selectively blocking the abnormally enhanced viability of TRAF3-deficient B cells. 3) Define the association between TRAF3 status and B cell survival pathways, in human B cell malignancies. The expected outcomes of the proposed project are an accurate and detailed understanding of how B cell survival is regulated by TRAF3-mediated pathways, how key pathways can be targeted to counteract enhanced survival of TRAF3-deficient B cells, and how TRAF3 status is related to phenotype in BCL and MM. This knowledge is expected to provide valuable information to inform the best selection of therapeutic options and strategies to prevent and treat drug resistance and recurrence in human B cell malignancies."
"9235834","PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States and is an important cause of morbidity and mortality, not only in the US, but also worldwide. Over the past decade, obesity has been recognized as an important risk factor for asthma. Epidemiologic studies reveal associations of obesity with the development of asthma, increased risk of asthma exacerbations, and greater risk of hospitalization for asthma. Several studies indicate that conventional asthma therapy has reduced efficacy in obese people with asthma. Our novel preliminary data reveals that signaling through the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP- 1R) significantly inhibited lung IL-5 and IL-13 protein and airway eosinophilia in murine in vivo models of both: a) the early innate response prior to the onset of robust adaptive immunity, and b) adaptive immune responses driven by CD4+ Th2 cells. These preliminary data lead us to propose the hypothesis that GLP-1R signaling is a negative regulator of both the early innate and adaptive immune responses in a model of asthma generated by Alternaria airway challenge during high fat diet-induced obesity. This proposal will determine how GLP-1R signaling regulates the activation of host innate immune cells and signaling pathways to the microbial antigens in Alternaria alternata that lead to allergic inflammatory responses in obesity. The proposed studies are paradigm shifting in that they will determine the mechanisms by which GLP-1R signaling: a) inhibits allergen-induced group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) function and airway epithelial cell IL- 33 production, and b) modulates dendritic cell migration and activation of naive T cells, and T regulatory cell (Treg) function. These proposed studies are clinically relevant in that we will define potential mechanisms by which a GLP-1R agonist, currently FDA approved for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, may be effective in the treatment of allergic airway inflammatory diseases such as asthma in the setting of obesity. The proposed studies will advance the field by defining a novel mechanism that negatively regulates immune responses to the protease containing allergens such as Alternaria alternata in the setting of obesity."
"9235872","Solid organ transplantation necessitates the use of lifelong immunosuppression. In particular, the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are utilized in nearly all transplant recipients as they are potent immunosuppressants. In kidney transplantation, the use of CNIs has led to the very low rejection rates of ~7-10% per year. However, long term graft survival has not improved substantially with their utilization, with a mean half-life of 10 years for kidney transplants. A key contributor to late graft injury is CNI-nephrotoxicity which is manifested by declining kidney function and the histological features of interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and arteriolar hyalinosis. The mechanism by which CNI induce kidney injury and failure is multifactorial, and to date, there are no specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate this injury. The goal of this submission is to identify a novel and clinically applicable strategy to ameliorate CNI-associated kidney injury. Recently, AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of cell metabolism, autophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, has been linked to modulating kidney injury. Further, loss of AMPK activation is associated with organ inflammation and fibrosis. We hypothesize that AMPK activation could ameliorate some of the adverse metabolic consequences in renal tubular epithelium and as a corollary, AMPK activation could be a clinically relevant intervention to mitigate long term CNI nephrotoxicity. Our study will focus on cyclosporine A (CsA), a classic CNI therapeutic agent. We will utilize a complementary series of studies, both in vitro and in vivo, using a mouse model of CsA injury that we have used successfully in our laboratory. In vitro, we will focus on renal tubular epithelium, the primary target of in vivo injury. We will study both the impact of AMPK activation as well as knock down using pharmacologic agents and silencing RNAs. Outcomes will include assessments of bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, pro-inflammatory markers and the DAMP HMGB1, and paracrine impact on macrophages and their differentiation. In vivo, we will test the impact of AMPK activation on ameliorating CsA renal injury by assessing kidney function (serum creatinine), mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators within the kidney, and biochemical, cellular and histologic assessments of injury and fibrosis. We will assess both pre-emptive inhibition as well as determine the impact of AMPK activation after established CsA nephrotoxicity. To complement these pharmacologic studies, we will also employ the novel use of AMPK ?1 and ?2 deficient mice. Cross-transplant studies will allow us to dissect the role of systemic versus renal expression of AMPK in injury. We believe that this comprehensive approach will provide key mechanistic insights into ameliorating or mitigating CNI nephrotoxicity. The use of a clinically relevant activator, metformin, will provide an opportunity for rapid translation into our human recipients of kidneys and other solid organ transplants."

"9240301","Title: Characterization of the Role of ADAR1 in Oncogenic Transformation of Progenitors Project Summary Our overall goal is to define the role of ADAR1 in the oncogenic transformation of pre-leukemic progenitors in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) into self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Recent research suggests that ADAR1-mediated RNA editing is an essential driver of human cancer progression. Though many RNA editing sites have been identified, the functional relevance of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing, especially in primary patient samples, is still unresolved. This study represents a unique opportunity to understand the consequences of malignant RNA editing in cancer stem cells that drive cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. Inflammatory cytokine driven activation of ADAR1 has been implicated in malignant reprogramming of progenitors into self-renewing cancer stem cells in a broad array of malignancies. Previously, we showed that ADAR1 enhances self-renewal of pre-leukemic progenitors in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in part as a result of A-to-I editing induced missplicing of GSK3?, which prevents degradation of the self-renewal agonist, ?-catenin. More recently, ADAR1 has been shown to play a role in microRNA biogenesis and specifically impairs let-7 family microRNA production. Notably, ADAR1 is also upregulated during progression from myelofibrosis (MF) to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). In this grant, we will first examine if ADAR1-mediated RNA editing can alter self-renewal capacity, survival, and cell cycle in primary patient progenitors and normal progenitors following lentiviral transduction with MPN oncogenes. Given that >90% of A-to-I editing events occur in the context of primate-specific Alu elements, the necessity of Alu sequences for ADAR1 function will be assessed using both human and mouse progenitors. Secondly, the impact of RNA editing on let-7 microRNA biogenesis and degradation will be determined. Lastly, we discovered that ADAR1 edits APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase, which introduces C-to-T mutations in a broad array of malignancies. Moreover, multiple A-to-I editing sites occur in intronic, exonic, as well as protein coding regions of APOBEC3D and 3G, suggesting that ADAR1 might regulate APOBEC expression and protein function. Thus, we aim to decipher the role of ADAR1 in deregulation of APOBEC3s and introduction of DNA hypermutation patterns during evolution of pre-leukemic progenitors into leukemia stem cells. In addition to vastly expanding our knowledge of A-to-I editing function in progenitor cell maintenance, this research program will inform the development of malignant ADAR1 editase detection and inhibition strategies that may help to prevent progression of MPNs to acute myeloid leukemia."
"9237531","Despite the high prevalence of biofilm-related oral diseases such as dental caries, there are no clinically effective therapies to disrupt virulent biofilms, resulting in >$40 billion expenditures annually in the US. Effective control of cariogenic biofilms is notoriously challenging because the bacteria are enmeshed in a protective extracellular matrix rich in exopolysaccharides (EPS). Furthermore, EPS-enmeshed bacteria create highly acidic microenvironments that promote acid-dissolution of tooth enamel, leading to the onset of dental caries. Current antimicrobial agents are incapable of disrupting the EPS matrix or affecting the physico- chemical aspects of caries and often fail to efficiently kill the microbes within biofilms, resulting in limited efficacy in vivo. To overcome these remarkable hurdles, we have developed an exciting therapeutic strategy using biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles (IO-NP) with catalytic activity and pH-responsive properties that display both anti-biofilm and anti-caries actions. IO-NP exhibit peroxidase-like activity at acidic pH values that rapidly activates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in situ to simultaneously degrade the protective biofilm EPS-matrix and kill embedded bacteria with exceptional efficacy (>5-log reduction of cell viability) in 5 minutes. Moreover, IO-NP also reduce apatite demineralization in acidic conditions. We hypothesize that IO-NP synergizes with H2O2 to amplify anti-biofilm effects and prevent the onset of dental caries in vivo via nanocatalysis and enhanced in situ production of antibacterial, EPS-degrading and demineralization-blocking agents at acidic pH. The significance of this work is to develop a feasible and superior anti-biofilm and caries preventive approach compared to current chemical modalities. To test our hypothesis, we will optimize the efficacy of IO-NP/H2O2 to further improve anti-biofilm and demineralizing-blocking activities (Aim 1). We will enhance the catalytic activity of IO-NP by inclusion of specific metal salts into the nanoparticles, and explore the effects of various dextran- based coatings to increase IO-NP localization within biofilm structure. Furthermore, we will incorporate calcium-phosphate into IO-NP to enhance its effects on demineralization. Then, we will evaluate the efficacy of enhanced IO-NP/H2O2 for biofilm control in vitro using a mixed-species, cariogenic biofilm model (Aim 2). We will further elucidate the biological actions of IO-NP/H2O2 using time-lapsed confocal and biophysical methods to examine spatiotemporal degradation of EPS-matrix, bacterial killing and cohesiveness within intact biofilms. The effects on enamel demineralization will be assessed using micro-hardness and micro-CT. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the biocompatibility and efficacy of the developed IO-NP/H2O2 therapy in hindering cariogenic biofilms and the onset of carious lesions in vivo using a rodent caries model with a clinically-relevant topical treatment regimen. Successful completion of these aims will provide a framework for further formulation development and clinical efficacy studies. Importantly, IO-NP can be synthesized with low cost at large scale while H2O2 is readily available, which could lead to a feasible new anti-biofilm/anti-caries therapeutic platform for topical use."
"9244170","Obesity is highly prevalent and problematic among the US obstetric population, necessitating the development of novel interventions to simultaneously address the associated health risks for both mother and child. The long-term objective of this study is to reduce risk for obesity-related health conditions during and after pregnancy among overweight/obese mothers and their infants. We have developed an innovative, theoretically-driven 10-session intervention to be delivered during pregnancy, which aims to (1) limit gestational weight gain, (2) increase uptake of gestational diabetes (GDM) screening, and (3) promote maintenance of exclusive breastfeeding. The intervention will be integrated into an existing, midwife-delivered model of group prenatal care (GPNC): CenteringPregnancy and piloted among pregnant women (n=80) in American Samoa.  Specific aims are to: (1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of the GPNC intervention by measuring group attendance, attrition, and collecting quantitative and qualitative measures of feasibility and acceptability; and (2) to demonstrate the preliminary efficacy of the intervention by examining gestational weight gain, uptake of GDM screening, and breastfeeding. In a randomized controlled design, overweight/ obese women will be randomly assigned to the GPNC intervention (n=40) or individual standard of care (n=40). We hypothesize that the intervention will result in reductions in the proportion of women exceeding Institute of Medicine gestational weight gain guidelines, improvements in the uptake of GDM screening and longer maintenance of exclusive breastfeeding. We will explore processes underlying any positive intervention outcomes by measuring pregnancy knowledge, self-efficacy, social support (foundations of the social cognitive theory underlying the intervention), and the adoption of healthful dietary and physical activity behaviors.  Existing interventions to promote the adoption of healthful behaviors in pregnancy and the early postpartum period have had limited success, particularly among low-income, ethnic minority groups who are most at risk of entering pregnancy overweight/obese and experiencing poor pregnancy outcomes. Our intervention design is responsive to key barriers faced by overweight/obese low-income populations and will be tested in a population not only in critical need (86% of American Samoan women are overweight or obese when they become pregnant versus ~42% of the general US population) but characteristic of other low- income, low-health literacy groups across the US.  Integrating a theoretically-driven intervention, tailored for low-income, overweight participants, into prenatal care presents a promising opportunity to provide sustainable care and impactful health promotion. Targeting this high risk population means this study is poised to have significant public health impact and the use of an existing, widely-used, insurance-supported prenatal care curriculum offers high potential for future scalability."
"9244962","7. Project Summary/Abstract. Staphylococcus aureus colonizes 30-50% of the population and is the leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections, osteomyelitis, pneumonia and endocarditis. At a time when hospital-acquired staphylococcal disease is decreasing, particularly dangerous clones of S. aureus pose a major health threat to otherwise healthy individuals, especially children. These community-acquired (CA) infections are the most frequent cause of emergency room visits and are resistant to a number of first- and last-line antibiotics (for example, amoxicillin and vancomycin). The use and misuse of these antibiotics promotes the rise of resistance by selecting for growth; therefore it is preferable to disable the ability to cause disease than to kill the bacteria. Previous work has shown that the S. aureus regulatory protein CodY helps to suppress the production of virulence factors when activated by the amino acids isoleucine, leucine and valine (ILV), and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). In the absence of active CodY and suppression, toxins and other disease-causing factors are elevated and those bacteria are significantly more virulent. Moreover, maintaining activity during growth keeps CodY-dependent genes repressed. Therefore, CodY could be exploited as an anti-virulence therapy and allow at-risk patients to clear the infection naturally. Before doing so, it is essential to establish that CodY activity changes within tissues during infection. If so, administering analogs of ILV and guanine nucleotides that prevent loss of CodY activity could potentially prevent staphylococcal disease. In this proposal we seek to do two things to reveal the relationship between CodY, host nutrients, and regulation of gene expression: i.) assess whether host tissue affects CodY-dependent gene expression using cutting edge in vivo and ex vivo live imaging and fluorescent reporters, and ii.) determine whether increasing ILV abundance in staphylococci during infection affects pathogenicity. We will collaborate with CA-staphylococcal biologist Michael Otto (National Institutes of Health), and preclinical imaging experts led by Christopher Albanese (Georgetown University Medical Center). Together, we will employ a multifaceted approach to gain a deeper understanding of CodY function in vivo and to test this anti-virulence approach."

"9187008","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autoimmune  hepatitis  (AIH)  is  a  chronic  disease  characterized  by  recurrent  hepatocellular  injury,  circulating  autoantibodies, and autoreactiv T-cells. Despite established guidelines for the diagnosis of AIH, key triggers  and  immunologic  pathways  are  poorly  understood.  Therapy  remains  dependent  on  chronic  glucocorticoids  with numerous associated adverse effects. Further, disease monitoring is sub-optimal and there is a need for  predictive  immune  biomarkers  to  link  immunopathogenesis  to  the  clinical  status.  Macrophage  Migration  Inhibitory Factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates the host response to infection and stress  by activating key innate and adaptive immune pathways. MIF's bioactivity and MIF polymorphisms have been  implicated in many autoimmune disorders. Applying this to the field of hepatology, the applicant initiated the  first  investigation  of  MIF  autoimmune  liver  diseases.  This  K08  proposal  is  directly  based  on  that  work,  now  published  in  Hepatology,  under  the  hypothesis  that  MIF  plays  an  active  role  in  AIH  by  directly  inducing  and  sustaining  the  inflammatory  cascade  through  interactions  with  T-cells.  Anti-MIF  therapy  and  MIF  modulation  by  a  neutralizing  MIF  receptor  (CD74)  are  hypothesized  to  be  protective.  Further,  MIF  polymorphisms  are  hypothesized to correlate with disease severity, and longitudinal serum MIF and CD74 levels may reflect AIH  disease activity. Accordingly, the aims of this proposal are to: 1) Define the rol of MIF in signaling pathways  of immune-mediated liver inflammation in a mouse model of T-cell hepatitis~ 2) Define the cellular mechanisms  responsible for release of the MIF receptor CD74 and its modulating effect on MIF bioactivity~ and 3) Define  the  relationship  of  functional  MIF genetic  polymorphisms,  and  MIF  and  CD74  serum  levels,  to  the  disease  course in AIH patients. Supporting data indicates that MIF absence in knockout mice protects against T-cell  liver injury, and that a small-molecule MIF inhibitor is similarly protective. The circulating formof CD74 inhibits  MIF  bioactivity  and  is  released  from  hepatic  cells  following  stimulation  i  vitro.  Finally,  a  genetic-clinical  relationship  between  a  high-risk  MIF  allele  (-173*C)  nd  increase  in  both  serum  ALT  and  prednisone  requirements  was  found  in  AIH  patients  from  the  US  and  from  Japan.  Based  on  these  results,  the  K08  proposal will define a key mechanistic role for MIF in the immunoregulation of AIH, enabling new strategies for  therapy and disease management. To accomplish this, a mentored and integrated five-year strategic plan for  research and training will enable the applicant to experimentally test these hypotheses and to develop into an  independent  investigator  devoted  to  translational  hepatology.  The  application  of  MIF  to  AIH  is  novel  and  independent  from  the  focus  of  both  co-mentors, Drs.  James  Boyer  and  Richard  Bucala.  The  collaborative  environment at Yale University, combining training experience in hepatology and immunobiology, represents  an ideal setting in which to conduct this mentored career development project in translational hepatology."
"9188554","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We are proposing a technology to help in three key areas of proteomics including (a) recognition of protein interactions, (b) characterization of post translational modifications, and (c) quantitative measurements at high spatial and/or temporal resolution to address the dynamics of protein interactions. Several significant types of protein interactions remain difficult to study with existing technologies. For example, the analysis of membrane protein interactions (mostly glycol proteins) is challenging, because these proteins are not stable outside of their native amphiphilic cellular environment. Analysis of interaction kinetics between small molecules (<500 Da, including a vast majority of metabolites and drugs) and proteins is also lacking, because these molecules are too small for fluorescence labeling, and the binding signals are too weak for label-free detection methods. Similarly problematic is the characterization of protein post-translational modifications, which alter protein behavior due to the attachment of a small functional group after translation. Specifically, we propose an electrochemically-enhanced plasmonic imaging (ECEPI) system to address key needs for quantitative analysis of protein interaction dynamics, including the ability to study membrane protein interactions in their native cellular state, characterization of small molecule interaction and post-translational modifications, measurement of interactions at high spatial and temporal resolution for the study of sub-cellular processes, and performing high-throughput analysis in multi-cellular and microarray formats. The ECEPI system relies upon careful integration of three core technologies: 1) the electrochemical surface plasmon resonance systems that have been successfully commercialized by Biosensing Instrument Inc. (BI) for their unique capabilities and solid performance, 2) a proprietary high resolution distortion-free prism-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging system currently under development at BI for high-throughput interaction analysis, and 3) a highly sensitive impedance imaging technique invented at Arizona State University. The success of this project will lead to a new instrument that is capable of:  1) Label-free real-time recognition and quantification of protein interaction kinetics; 2) Real-time characterization of post-translational modifications of proteins; 3) Quantitative measurement of small molecule interactions with proteins; 4) In situ quantification of membrane protein (and glycoprotein) interactions in their native cellular  environment with cell-based assay; 5) High-resolution analysis of sub-cellular processes and; 6) High-throughput analysis in multi-cellular and microarray formats"

His training plan includes: 1) training in the application of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to in vivo studies of neurotransmitter activity and brain metabolism 2) training in the use of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to examine neural network activity 3) training in the design and execution of patient oriented investigation and 4) training in the responsible conduct of research.  A hallmark feature of bipolar disorder is that it is episodic in nature with what appear to be spontaneous transitions to pathological states and subsequent reversion to euthymia or transition to another state. There is little understood about the biology that gives rise to this instability in mood state or the processes that make these states transitory. This study proposes that the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder is characterized by: 1) original abnormal functional coupling between the brain regions involved in affective regulation, and 2) compensatory changes in neurotransmission. These alterations set in motion a series of forces that generate instability in brain function.  The candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) explore th relationship between brain network activity and mood state in bipolar disorder and 2) test a model of mood state switching that proposes a balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission that can compensate for trait related alterations in brain network connectivity.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by observing brain network activity as well as measuring neurotransmitters and markers of neuronal activity in vivo. These experiments will be performed in a single cohort of subjects with bipolar disorder longitudinally through clinical states of mania and euthymia. In doing so, this study seeks to minimize many substantial confounds of studying this disorder including disease heterogeneity, diagnostic instability, and medication effects.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the physiology of state switching in bipolar disorder. This disorder is a common and debilitating illness and current treatments are only partially effective. An understanding of the physiologic basis of transitions between states will allow the development of better interventions to prevent pathological switching to mania or depression."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Upper extremity hemiparesis has a profound and lasting negative impact on quality of life and independence in activities of daily living for stoke survivors, yet, despite many investigations, there are no gold standard treatments in current clinical practice. We have carried out a progressive research program that has demonstrated the effectiveness of robotic therapy in chronic stroke patients, and then optimizing the type of robotic therapy and associated therapy that these patients receive. But gains in the chronic group are modest on average, and despite an intuition that earlier intervention will be beneficial, there is little data to confirm that. Therefore, we propose to build upon our expertise with robot-assisted training for chronic stroke impairment in order to evaluate the potential of predictive models that would select patients with better chances of making functional gains. Our clinical hypothesis is that kinematic and physiological biomarkers of recovery potential exist, and include baseline motor ability in both functional tasks and in the robotic environment, and measures of corticospinal tract effectiveness determined by transcranial magnetic stimulation. Functional and anatomical measures of connectivity, and plasticity relevant genotype are secondary biomarkers to test. Time after stroke is another promising marker to test, with strong implications for clinical practice. We also propose a secondary mechanistic hypothesis that maladaptive transhemispheric cortical inhibition will be altered by the intervention. Specific Objectives: Create a predictive model of function and disability following the intervention. Measure the effects of 12 weeks of robot-assisted therapy and transition to task training at > 6 months after stroke. Create a model that predicts clinically meaningful change in Fugl-Meyer in response to the intervention and test the validity of the model. Determine the effect our hybrid method of training has on interhemispheric inhibition by using transcranial magnetic stimulation to study silent period and recruitment curve. Patients with moderate to severe arm dysfunction (based on Fugl-Meyer scores of 7 to 45) of >6 months duration who are medically stable and do not have contractures or other impairments that would interfere with training will be enrolled. 96 subjects will be assigned to a single study arm with a multiple baseline approach to ensure stability of measures. Evaluations will be conducted by an examiner who has no knowledge of the predictive model. The first four weeks of training will consist of wrist robot training sessions, te second four weeks will consist of planar robot training sessions and the third four weeks will consist of alternation wrist and planar training sessions. Robot training sessions will be 45 minutes in duration followed by 15 minutes of training on functionally relevant tasks (translation to task training (TTT)). Clinical evaluations will include Stroke Impact Scale (Primary Outcome), Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Motor Performance Section Test, Wolf Motor Function Test, Action Research Arm Test, and activity monitor of home arm use. Kinematic analysis will be conducted pre and post training. A majority of patients will be consented for TMS and MRI. In those subjects intrahemispheric inhibition will be determined at each outcomes measurement visit. MRI will be performed only at the baseline period, and will be used to define the lesion type, white matter integrity and functional connectivity of the corticospinal tract. At the conclusion of  these aims we will have a method for clinical decision-making regarding intensive arm therapy late after stroke, and a better mechanistic understanding of how it works. The method will be disseminated throughout the VA medical system and beyond."
"9181424","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) induces neovascularization in the avascular cornea including the genesis of blood and lymphatic components referred to as hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis respectively. Clinically, angiogenesis of the central cornea has a detrimental impact on visual acuity and in many instances, the success of corneal engraftment following transplantation. Previously, we have found HSV-1 induces lymphangiogenesis following cornea infection that requires the local (i.e., epithelial cell) production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A mediating its effects through VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Moreover, we found the immediate early gene-encoded protein ICP4 of HSV-1 drives expression of the VEGF A gene through Sp1 and (perhaps) EGR1 promoter sites. Consistent with these findings, corneal lymphangiogenesis does not act through toll-like receptors or require a MAP kinase pathway of induction. This is a novel observation unique to the pathogen. Newly acquired data included in this application demonstrates corneal neovascularization following HSV-1 infection proceeds at much more robust pace after the virus clears the cornea between day 10 and day 30 post infection (pi). During this time period, we have identified several pro- angiogenic factors in addition to VEGF A including interleukin (IL)-6, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) that are up regulated and peak at day 14 pi. We have also identified cells including neutrophils, macrophages, inflammatory monocytes, and T cells that reside and are maintained in the cornea throughout the robust neovascularization period of the cornea post HSV-1 infection. Additional preliminary results suggest IL-6, HGF, and inflammatory monocytes are most closely associated with the progress in neovascularization of the cornea post virus clearance between days 10-30 pi. As such, we propose to test the hypothesis that IL-6 and HGF facilitate the development and maintain corneal lymphatic vessels upon clearance of HSV-1 (aim 1). In addition, preliminary results suggest the reduction in VEGF A expression and loss of lymphatic vessels in the cornea post HSV-1 infection significantly reduces the adaptive immune response to the pathogen resulting in a higher viral yield in the trigeminal ganglion. We hypothesize the reduced adaptive immune response is due to a loss of functional antigen presenting cells in the draining lymph node (aim 2). Collectively, the proposed experimental design will allow us to characterize corneal lymphangiogenesis relative to HSV-1 infection with the anticipated outcome of the identification of additional pro-angiogenic factors and pathways as candidate targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9185326","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cataract formation is the most common cause of vision loss, accounting for 51% of cases of blindness worldwide. In the US, cataract operations cost the Medicare system approximately $5 billion annually. Epidemiologic studies show that the pathogenesis of human cataracts involves genetic, environmental, and other disease-associated risk factors. In particular, 50% of childhood cataract cases have a genetic basis. The lens crystallins protein family accounts for 90% of lens proteins and plays a key role in lens transparency. Research has identified point mutations in the genes encoding ?-, ß-, and ?-crystallins, which lead to hereditary human cataract formation either at birth or at an early age. Functional studies on hereditary cataract formation could provide important information about the etiology of age-related cataracts. ?-crystallin is an aggregate of two polypeptides, ?A- and ?ß-crystallin, that are expressed in lens epithelial and fiber cells. Human patients harboring single point mutations in ?A- and ?ß-crystallin genes develop hereditary cataracts. To understand disease etiology in hereditary cataracts, we have used embryonic stem cell-based technologies to generate knock-in mice expressing proteins containing either the ?A-R49C or ?B-R120G mutation in ?-crystallins. These two mutations are associated with human autosomal dominant hereditary cataracts. We are also studying a knockout mouse lacking both ?A- and ?ß-crystallin. These mouse models develop cataracts at an early postnatal age and are important tools for understanding the disease process. Our first aim will test the hypothesis that ?A-crystallin mutation or deletion causes upregulation of histone and metabolic enzyme expression in the developing lens at an early postnatal age. The second aim will test the hypothesis that mutant ?A- or ?ß-crystalline disrupts normal lens protein homeostasis, leading to abnormal protein loss through autophagy. To address these aims, we will use complementary biochemical, cell biological and genetic approaches which are quantitative, objective and not subject to observer bias. The results of our studies will provide new insights into the molecular basis of lens development and cataract formation and promote the development of strategies to delay or prevent cataracts."
"9187472","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defining the structure of a canonical decision making circuit, from its inputs to its outputs, is one of the principal goals of cognitive neuroscience. T this end, visual perceptual decision making is a fundamental cognitive function in which visual information provides the basis for choosing an appropriate response. In the simplest case, the link between sensory evidence and a behavioral choice is binary: an oncoming car suddenly veers into one's lane and a quick decision must be made - to swerve left or right. However, when vision is compromised, whether through disease or trauma, these decision mechanisms must adapt to degraded input, impaired associative visual processing, or both. As a consequence, visual misperceptions occur more frequently, and the process of translating sensation to action becomes increasingly susceptible to errors of identification and categorization that must be recognized. Understanding the neural mechanisms by which visual perception interacts with higher-order categorization and error detection is thus essential to understanding abnormalities in patients. In this proposal, we build upon previous work studying perceptual decision making in primates and humans to evaluate the process by which humans make higher-order visual decisions. One hypothesis is that both lower-order (i.e. perceptual) and higher-order (e.g. categorization) decisions may differ in the source of their inputs but are mediated by the same decision making network. An alternative hypothesis argues that categorical uncertainty, whether related to the separation of object classes or to the separation of correct from erroneous responses, represents a more abstract feature related to confidence and context that engages different decision processes. Under this hypothesis, perceptual and categorical uncertainty should activate different circuits. By using a combination of behavioral psychophysics, mathematical models, functional MRI, and EEG in a well-validated visual paradigm, here we will attempt to define the brain networks and mechanisms that allow humans to make visual categorization decisions and to detect errors."
"9191342","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Real-Time Unbiased Pathogen Detection in Febrile Illnesses by Nanopore Sequencing Acute febrile illness is one of the most common presenting symptoms in clinical medicine, with a broad differential that includes a variety of infectious etiologies. Conventional laboratory testing can take days to a result, and most rapid detection technologies such as PCR are limited to the detection of a single or narrow range of targets. Unbiased diagnosis of all pathogens in a single test by metagenomic next-generation sequencing has proven feasible, although still requires >24 hours due to long sequencing times, lack of portable instrumentation, and/or the complexity of bioinformatics analysis. Here we propose to use the Oxford Nanopore, a USB-sized, portable sequencing instrument with current read capacity of 500 Gb data and >100,000 reads, to develop a diagnostic assay to rapidly diagnose patients with acute febrile illness by screening for all potential pathogens in under 2 hours. We have already demonstrated in preliminary data that metagenomic detection of Chikungunya and Ebola virus performed by real-time nanopore sequencing and analysis is possible with a 6-hour sample-to-answer timeframe. In years 1-2 (R21 phase), we will optimize the assay, validate it in a CLIA-certified laboratory by developing standard operating procedures, establish its performance characteristics including sensitive, specificity, and limits f detection, and develop standalone and cloud-based software pipelines for real-time sequencing analysis. In years 3-5 (R33 phase), we use it to test positive and negative control clinical samples from patients with acute febrile illness. We will also use it to investigate clinical samples from patients with febrile respiratory and systemic illnesses and infected by a variety of pathogens, including influenza virus, Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Chikungunya virus, enterovirus D68, and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria). We will also test the platform at point-of-care field sites in California (California Department of Public Health), Central America (American Red Cross) and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Africa (Institut National de Recherches Medicales). Ultimately, the goal of this 5-year project is implementation of a field-ready, real-time sequencing assay for unbiased pathogen diagnosis of acute febrile illness by metagenomic nanopore sequencing."
"9194421","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Down Syndrome (DS) is the most common known genetic origin of intellectual disability and has an estimated incidence of 1 in every 1000 live births. Such children face unique challenges as they enter into the school years, because the speech that was previously adequate for communication with familiar partners in supportive settings is often not sufficient for academic communication with unfamiliar partners. Indeed, 95% of parents surveyed reported that their children with DS had difficulty being understood by persons outside their immediate social circle (Kumin, 1994). This has significant implications for academic, social, and vocational success; children with limited language skills are at risk of falling behind nondisabled peers academically and experiencing social isolation. Secondary issues often arise when children experience frustration in communication, commonly in the form of challenging behaviors. All aspects of development are further compromised when these behaviors involve aggression toward others, have significant health implications when they are self-injurious, and exacerbate service costs when they necessitate extensive behavior management plans.  Children with DS are in desperate need of communication interventions that provide them with the tools to succeed throughout the school years. One form of intervention is called aided augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). In typical clinical applications, aided AAC systems employ picture books, tablet-style computers that present the user with graphic symbols, and sometimes text or synthesized voice output. Because AAC relies on vision rather than sound/speech for access to the communication messages, it is critical to map out how children with DS examine and extract information from visual AAC displays. Otherwise there is the risk of implementing systems that are poorly matched to children's skills and needs, a practice that in turn results in limited use or abandonment of the system.  Few current AAC designs consider the fit between the system and the visual processing skills of users, and most are uninformed by empirical knowledge about human visual information processing. Moreover, little is known about visual processing in persons with significant communication limitations associated with DS. This research aims to improve the design of AAC displays through characterization of visual attention patterns to different AAC displays and their effects on functional use. Eye tracking - rarely used in DS - will reveal attention patterns/processes that typically go unrecorded in behavioral research. Our three-phase program will begin with eye tracking studies of visual attention under largely non-social laboratory conditions. In the next phase, we will introduce social interactions and record gaze path using mobile eye tracking technology. In the final phase, we will translate the knowledge gained in the laboratory studies to optimize functional communication in individuals with DS in performing tasks that represent typical daily life activities."
"9197938","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) in elderly is a medical crisis in the United States. VCI is closely associated with hypertension. 67 millions of adults in the United States (33.3% of the population) have hypertension and over 40% of hypertensive patients develop VCI. The Medicare costs for the treatment of hypertension exceeds $47 billion/year and 159 billion/year for dementia. Aged people, especially those with hypertension that is associated with a higher incidence of developing vascular cognitive impairments (VCI) commonly have impaired myogenic response and autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, the mechanism of how these cerebral vascular impairments contribute to the development of VCI is still obscure, part of the reason has been the lack of genetic animal models exhibiting an impaired myogenic response. We first discovered that FHH rats have impaired myogenic response of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and fail to autoregulate in the cerebral circulation, and this impairment is restored by substitution of 2.4 Mbp of chromosome 1 of Brown Norway (BN) rats containing 15 genes including Add3. In the preliminary studies, we found that the expression of Add3 is reduced in FHH relative to FHH.1BN rats and the rescued vascular reactivity of MCA in FHH.1BN rats was back to be impaired after knocking down of Add3 using DsiRNA. We also have preliminary results in the whole animal level to support this view using our newly generated Add3 transgenic and knockout (KO) rat models. As expected, KO of Add3 impairs, and knockin of wildtype (WT) Add3 enhances the myogenic response in freshly isolated MCA in vitro and autoregulation of CBF in vivo. Moreover, we observed vascular remodeling, blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, neurodegeneration, learning and memory cognitive impairments those are all characters' of VCI after induction of hypertension in FHH rats. Thus, we hypothesize that Add3 plays an important role in the regulation of impaired myogenic response and autoregulation of CBF, and contributes to the development of age and hypertension related VCI in FHH rats. In this proposal, we will use our newly created Add3 transgenic FHH rats (FHH.Add3TG) vs. FHH rats to examine the myogenic response and autoregulation of CBF, as well as the development of VCI as they age and after the induction of hypertension. These studies should provide novel insights into the role of Add3 in the regulation of the myogenic response and its contribution to age-related small vessel disease, especially in hypertensive individuals, and supply the scientific community with the first genetic animal model in which the myogenic response is impaired to study mechanisms involved in VCI as age. The results will be critical for the development of new treatments to postpone the onset of age and hypertension related vascular diseases."
"9197705","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic studies in model organisms have provided tremendous insights into neural development and revealed surprising similarities between vertebrates and invertebrates in the genes and pathways controlling the patterning and wiring of the nervous system. Compared to neural development, much less is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms that help maintain the integrity and function of the diverse differentiated neurons after they are fully developed and integrated into neural circuits. It is expected that elucidation of the mechanisms central to neuronal maintenance in model organisms will inform similar processes in humans, impairments of which underlie various neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons diseases, for which there is currently no effective treatment. Drosophila has served as an excellent model system to elucidate the signaling network that directs mitochondrial quality control, a multifaceted process encompassing fission/fusion dynamics, transport, and autophagy (mitophagy). This mitochondrial quality control process is crucially important for the structural and functional integrity of dopaminergic neurons, the cell types that are lost to Parkinsons disease. Our recent genetic studies have revealed novel roles of the conserved target of rapamycin signaling complexes (TORC1 and TORC2) in regulating mitochondrial function and maintaining dopaminergic neuron integrity, although paradoxically TORC1 and TORC2 exhibit opposite effects in this process. The goal of this proposal is to use molecular genetic, genomic, biochemical, and cell biological tools available in Drosophila to decipher the mechanisms of action of TORC1 and TORC2 in mitochondrial regulation, in an effort to understand in molecular terms how mitochondrial abnormality arises and how it impacts neuronal integrity in age-related neurodegenerative disease conditions. The hypothesis to be tested is that TORC1 and TORC2 play central roles in dopaminergic neuron maintenance by directing distinct aspects of mitochondrial regulation, with TORC2 regulating mitochondrial quality control whereas TORC1 regulating mitochondrial respiratory chain complex biogenesis through translational regulation. Key findings from the fly studies will be validated in patient-derived, dopaminergic neuron-based disease models. Greater understanding of the functions of the genes to be studied in this project will provide novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms linking mitochondrial regulation to neuronal maintenance. This will ultimately contribute to the treatment of a host of neurodegenerative conditions associated with mitochondrial dysfunction."

"9176019","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic liver and metabolic diseases inflict substantial morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Only a minority of patients with end-stage liver disease receive liver transplantation. Derivation of hepatocytes from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is a promising transplant alternative, however this technology has not reached patients due to immature phenotype and inadequate engraftment of the cells. Interestingly, hiPSC derivation of hepatocytes offers a powerful tool for studying liver development, which in turn will provide insight as to how hepatocellular and metabolic diseases arise when developmental processes are subverted. Although specific mechanisms are unknown, the pioneer chromatin remodeling factor, FoxO1, is implicated in metabolic disorders, liver fibrosis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. FoxO1 function is well characterized in matur hepatocytes where it regulates blood glucose levels. In addition to contributing to energy homeostasis FoxO1, and closely related FoxO3 (FoxO1/3), regulate cell cycle inhibition genes to promote maturation of adipocytes and cardiomyocytes. Despite these findings, FoxO1/3 have never been studied in the developing liver. This proposal is the first to demonstrate FoxO1/3 expression throughout all stages of human hepatocyte differentiation. We hypothesize that FoxO1 contributes to human hepatocyte differentiation through chromatin remodeling at metabolic genes and that FoxO1/3 regulate antiproliferative genes early in development. An innovative hiPSC-to-hepatocyte differentiation process and techniques unique to labs studying chromatin remodeling will be used to study roles of FoxO1/3 in human liver development. Aim 1 will derive hepatocytes from hiPSCs and evaluate the impact of FoxO1 knockdown on metabolic gene expression at each stage by qRT-PCR. FoxO1 chromatin binding and opening will be assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase I digestion, respectively. Rescue of FoxO1 knockdown cells by FoxO1 wild type or C-terminal deletion mutants will elucidate the mechanism by which FoxO1 opens chromatin. Aim 2 will characterize phosphorylation states of FoxO1/3 during the early stages of hepatocyte differentiation. Cytoplasmic sequestration of FoxO1/3 due to phosphorylation will be confirmed by western blots of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Two prominent liver development pathways will be assessed for contribution to phosphorylation. Small molecule inhibitors will inhibit each pathway and changes in FoxO1/3 phosphorylation status will be assessed. Alteration of FoxO1/3 target cell cycle inhibition gene expression will be measured. Phosphomutant FoxO1/3 transgenes expressed in differentiating cells will confirm the significance of regulation by phosphorylation during liver development by comparing gene expression profiles in microarray analysis. This proposal will establish specific molecular mechanisms by which FoxO proteins contribute to human liver development through regulation of metabolic and cell fate genes."

"9187469","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Support is requested to continue a productive collaboration aimed to develop, test, and extend computational models of eye movement control in visual decision making and visual search. Our research program is guided by converging constraints from computational, behavioral, and neurophysiological perspectives that link detailed patterns of behavior in humans and monkeys performing visual saccade tasks with patterns of modulation in neurons recorded in monkeys through the use of computational models that predict behavioral and neural dynamics. We propose new computational modeling of existing monkey behavioral and neurophysiological experiments and new computational modeling of new human experiments that mirror and significantly extend experiments previously conducted with monkeys. Our theoretical foundation is a class of stochastic accumulation of evidence models that mathematical psychologists and systems neuroscientists have converged upon as a general theoretical framework to understand and explain the time course of visual decision making; these include an interactive race model and a gated accumulator model we proposed previously. Unlike most approaches, (1) we quantitatively test alternative model architectures (including race, diffusion, competitive, gated accumulators) on detailed behavioral data in both humans and monkeys, including response probabilities and distributions of correct and error response times for saccades, (2) we constrain model mechanisms and model parameters based on neurophysiological recordings, specifically neurons in frontal eye field (FEF) hypothesized to represent the evolving time-course of task-relevant visual evidence, (3) we quantitatively test model architectures on how well they predict the recorded dynamics of neurons involved in make a visual decision, specifically neurons in FEF that determine when and where the eyes move. Aim 1 will develop and test the gated accumulator model against alternative models of countermanding and control of saccadic eye movements. Aim 2 will develop and test the gated accumulator model against alternative models of speed-accuracy control of saccadic eye movements in visual search. Aim 3 will investigate how to scale the broad class of stochastic accumulator models, including gated accumulator, from a single accumulator associated with each response to ensembles of thousands of accumulator neurons associated with each response. To understand normal behavior as well as illness, disability, and disease, abstract computational models, like stochastic accumulation of evidence models, can be a just right theoretical level in that best-fitting parameters of these models can characterize well individual differences in behavior and provide theoretical markers for understanding brain measures - our models provide that just right theoretical level. Yet to the extent that certain neurological conditions have a biophysical basis at the level of individual neurons and neural circuits, we also need to understand how these abstract computational models map onto neural circuits - making this mapping is also core to our proposed work."
"9187808","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Classic galactosemia (CG) is a potentially lethal genetic disease that results from profound loss of galactose-1P uridylyltransferase (GALT); CG is the second most common metabolic disorder identified by newborn screening in the US. Despite neonatal diagnosis and lifelong dietary restriction of galactose, which is the current standard of care, a majority of affected children grow to experience a constellation of debilitating cognitive, behavioral, movement, female reproductive, and other disabilities. The mechanisms that underlie these long-term complications remain unknown, hindering prognosis and the development of more effective treatments. The goals of this project are to define the mechanism(s) of acute and long-term outcomes associated with GALT deficiency and leverage that knowledge in a preclinical setting to identify and test candidate pharmacological interventions for CG. To achieve these goals we will apply a combined model system plus human subjects approach. Specifically, we will conduct systems-level biochemical and genetic studies in a Drosophila melanogaster model of GALT deficiency that demonstrates both acute galactose sensitivity in development and also galactose-independent adult movement, female fertility, and learning- related behavioral phenotypes, with targeted follow-up studies using patient samples to ensure relevance. This strategy circumvents the otherwise crippling effect of limited patient numbers to enable the open-minded studies of mechanism needed to understand the bases of acute and long-term outcomes in CG. Our Specific Aims include: (1) define the metabolomic consequences of GALT deficiency in both Drosophila and humans, (2) identify genetic modifiers of acute and long-term outcomes in GALT deficient Drosophila and patients, and (3) test candidate pharmacological modifiers of outcome using a GALT-null Drosophila model of CG. The results of these studies will reveal what causes the acute and long-term sequelae of CG and will provide a first evidence-based step toward improved intervention."
"9187820","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The cause(s) of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remain unknown, as well as the factors that result in the progression of this disease. No established medical treatments have yet been shown to benefit patients with this disease, and IPF continues to have a worse prognosis than many common malignancies. Recent findings of our research group, as well as others, show that autoantibodies are associated with IPF progression. Results of an early ongoing pilot study further indicate that specific treatments aimed at reducing pre-existing autoantibodies and/or minimizing their future production improve lung function among very ill IPF patients who are having disease exacerbations. We hypothesize that antibody-mediated autoimmunity can play an important role in IPF progression. The presence of autoimmunity could explain the refractoriness of this disease to current therapy, since many autoantibody lung diseases are resistant to treatment with corticosteroids. However, focused treatments targeted at autoantibodies or the lymphocytes that produce these immunoglobulins often have greater efficacy for these diseases than steroids or other nonspecific therapies.  Accordingly, we propose here a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) vs. placebo, among patients with IPF. Fifty-eight (58) ambulatory IPF subjects at four participating U.S. medical centers will be randomized (1:1) to either the experimental arm (rituximab) or placebo. The primary end-point is a global assessment of circulating autoantibodies. Secondary end-points are measures of a specific autoantibody that is associated with clinical progression (anti-heat shock protein 70), as well as a measure of lung function (forced vital capacity), and adverse event rates. We anticipate the novel experimental treatment will show targeted efficacy for reduction of autoantibodies, a favorable safety profile, and possibly stabilization of lung function.  Results of these investigations will establish the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of rituximab treatment in IPF patients. Ultimately these studies could challenge current paradigms of IPF pathogenesis, and substantially alter treatment approaches to patients afflicted with this morbid, refractory disease."
"9190842","Project Summary  The recent advances in homogeneous nickel catalysis have showcased the ability of nickel to facilitate challenging transformations. Most reactions are performed using the temperature, air, and moisture unstable complex, Ni(COD)2 (COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene). Do to the instability of this nickel catalyst, high-throughput experimentation (HTE) of nickel catalyzed reactions could not be performed. HTE is an important tool for rapid reaction optimization because many variables are screened and large quantities of data are collected for further understanding the reactivity. This proposal describes a strategy to perform HTE with Ni-catalysis to expedite the optimization of difficult chemical transformations necessary for drug development.  Recently, a new class of Ni(II)-precatalysts have been developed by Jamison, Yang, Percec, Buchwald, and Hartwig. The precatalysts offer many advantages over traditional nickel catalysts, such as Ni(COD)2, and other available precatalysts because of their moisture- and air-stability, ease of activation, and reduced catalyst loadings. However, because the ligands are preinstalled, the precatalysts cannot directly participate in HTE.  Continuous-flow chemistry has several notable advantages over traditional batch chemistry, including the ability to telescope syntheses and purifications. Due to the streamlining capabilities, developing a continuous- flow synthesis of the Ni(II)-precatalysts will enable their on-demand production. Furthermore, the flow synthesis could then be integrated into an HTE-system previously developed by the Jensen group.  The current Ni(II)-precatalysts are phosphine-based. NHC-based precatalysts exist, however, these precatalysts are not easily activated. Before designing a flow synthesis for NHC-based precatalyst, a new class similar to the phosphine-based precatalysts will be investigated.  Lastly, the value of the HTE system will be demonstrated through optimizing a novel reaction of high importance: Ni-photoredox catalyzed trifluoromethylation. Ni-catalyzed trifluoromethylations have not been realized due to the difficulty of nickel to form bonds between carbon and highly electronegative groups. However, Ni-photoredox utilizes a higher oxidation state, Ni(III), that has been shown to facilitate these difficult bond formations. Through leveraging Ni-photoredox catalysis and the developed HTE-system, new and efficient methods of trifluoromethylations will be developed."
"9192920","All humans age, though the rate of aging is highly variable and likely influenced by one's genetic composition; our cells accumulate damage over time, and this damage can lead to increased disease susceptibility, decreased ability to respond to injury, reduction in sensory systems, among many other detrimental changes. While not necessarily deadly on their own, they lead to a greatly increased risk of death. In order to begin the clinical work in reducing the effects of aging, research must first elucidate the biochemical interactions causing such effects. This project will identify and describe pathways containing conserved longevity-related protein synthesis genes using the model organism, C. elegans. The nematode C. elegans is an excellent model for aging due to its short lifespan, small number of cells, ease of genetic manipulation, and large fraction (>80%) of conserved genes. The reduced expression of protein synthesis genes post-developmentally increases worm lifespan, even up to 50% higher, but the reasons for this lifespan increase are unknown. It has recently been described that reducing protein synthesis cause developmental arrest if given during the larval stage. Given this connection, and multiple previous studies describing similar longevity-related antagonistic pleiotropy, we seek to characterize the protein synthesis pathways involved in both phenotypes; this includes testing the hypothesis that these two phenotypes may use the same pathway as we have recently determined both of these states share a stress resistance phenotype (a metric of increased healthspan). Aim 1 will compile a list of deregulated genes via RNA-seq when worms undergo arrest or longevity in response to reduced protein synthesis. Using this list, and three previously-identified genes that can control the arrest phenotype, we will characterize their spatiotemporal expression patterns, using GFP-bound promoters, and how they correlate with the longevity, arrest, and stress resistance phenotypes. Finally, we will determine if rescuing wild type expression levels of these deregulated genes rescues any of the same phenotypes, indicating their importance in that response. Aim 2 will determine the effects of reducing protein synthesis in a tissue-specific manner (hypodermal, intestinal, muscular, or neuronal) using tissue-specific RNAi strains, which will identify where in the worm the longevity pathway is taking place, including revealing how the signaling and cell-cell crosstalk interacts between cell types to confer longevity, arrest, and stress resistance. The second part of Aim 2 involves coalescing information from our spatiotemporal analysis and tissue-specific studies in order to rescue genes found to be important in conferring these survival-promoting phenotypes in order to determine their importance on a cell or tissue-based level. The description of these protein synthesis genes, particularly in relation to their physiological effects, discovered pathways, and correlation with arrest states and stress resistance, will establish a better connection between enhanced longevity and how that longevity is conferred in order to enable the eventual treatment of aging-related ailments and disease."
"9198250","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 7-Dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) is an important lipid in human biology. It is the immediate biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol and it is also a precursor to vitamin D3. Very recent discoveries indicate that 7-DHC is very prone to undergo free radical chain oxidation with molecular oxygen, i.e. lipid peroxidation. Indeed, 7- DHC's reactivity makes it more susceptible to lipid peroxidation than nearly any other known compound. Lipid peroxidation is associated with many human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's, ALS, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. Many of the compounds formed during lipid peroxidation have potent biological activities and neurodegeneration may be associated with these toxic peroxidation products.  A human syndrome affecting 1 in 20-70,000 individuals, Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS), is caused by a defect in the enzyme (Dhcr7) that promotes the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis. This defect results in an increase by up to 10,000-fold of 7-DHC concentrations in individuals suffering from this syndrome. SLOS causes a range of brain abnormalities and these patients also exhibit mental retardation and autism-like symptoms. This proposal is focused on the consequences of the accumulation of 7-DHC in SLOS. Our guiding hypothesis is that the peroxidation of 7-DHC and the formation of 7-DHC oxysterols plays an important role in the pathophysiology associated with SLOS.  The hypothesis also states that accumulation of 7-DHC, either by genetic disposition or by exposure to small molecules that disrupt cholesterol biosynthesis can have health consequences. This focuses our studies in the next grant period to assessing the distribution and metabolism of 7-DHC oxysterols in cells and tissues, defining mechanisms associated with 7-DHC oxysterol pathology, devising strategies to reduce fluid and tissue levels of 7-DHC and/or its oxysterols in vivo, and accurately measuring levels of sterols and oxysterols in SLOS affected, SLOS carrier and control human plasmas in order to enable therapeutic studies. We assert that methods to accurately measure 7-DHC and its oxysterols in cells, fluids and tissues and strategies to understand and moderate the pathophysiology associated with this sterol will have an impact on a number of health issues ranging broadly from errors in sterol biosynthesis to drug toxicity and exposures.  Lipid peroxidation is frequentl linked to neurodegenerative disorders and the relevance of this research to public health is the linkage of the fundamental studies in the chemistry and biology of peroxidation and its inhibition proposed here to neurodegenerative disorders, including a devastating syndrome, SLOS."
"9213939","Project Summary  Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) affects as many as 80% of critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults. Delirium is associated with substantial negative outcomes, including increased complications during hospitalization and long term effects on cognitive function and health status in ICU survivors. Sleep disturbances, iatrogenic/environmental factors, and biobehavioral factors may affect risk of delirium. This randomized clinical trial will test the effectiveness of a nonpharmacologic intervention to prevent delirium. The Family Automated Voice Reorientation (FAVoR) intervention uses scripted audio messages, recorded by the patient's family and played at hourly intervals during daytime hours, to provide information about the ICU environment to the patient; this ongoing orientation to the ICU environment through recorded messages in a voice familiar to the patient may enable the patient to more accurately interpret the environment and thus reduce risk of delirium. Increasing awareness of daytime by cuing patients during waking hours may also improve day/night orientation and nighttime sleep, further reducing risk of delirium. The primary specific aim of the project is to test the effect of the FAVoR intervention on delirium in critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults during hospitalization in the ICU. Secondary aims are to: (1) explore if the effect of FAVoR on delirium is mediated by sleep, (2) explore if selected biobehavioral factors may potentially moderate the effects of FAVoR on delirium, and (3) examine the effects of FAVoR on short term (immediately after ICU discharge) and long term (1 and 6 months after hospital discharge) outcomes, including cognitive function and patient-reported health status. A prospective, randomized, experimental design will be used to accomplish the specific aims. Subjects (n=178) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups (intervention or control) within 36 hours of intubation and ICU admission. The intervention group will receive FAVoR over a 5-day period, while the control group will not. Delirium free days, the primary outcome measure, will be assessed by Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) over the 5 day period. During the 5 day period, continuous polysomnography and actigraphy data and data related to iatrogenic/environmental and biobehavioral factors will be collected. After ICU discharge and at 1 and 6 months post-hospital discharge, follow up data (including cognitive function, patient reported health status, polysomnography, and actigraphy) will be collected. The effect of FAVoR on delirium free days will be tested using a Chi-square test; if there are unbalanced covariates, then covariance adjustment will be performed by using logistic regression that includes both the treatment assignment and the unbalanced covariates. Partial least square structural equation models will be used to analyze the relative importance and the pathways of secondary aim variables. FAVoR holds promise for reducing delirium in critically ill adults, improving sleep in the ICU, and secondarily benefitting cognitive function and health status in ICU survivors."
"9198179","Project Background/Rationale: The mission of the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) is to fill gaps in knowledge about the basic science of concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), determine its effects on late-life outcomes and neurodegeneration, identify Service Members most susceptible to these effects, and identify the most effective treatment strategies. The CENC is a multi-center collaboration linking premier basic science, translational, and clinical neuroscience researchers from the Department of Defense, VA, academic universities, and private research institutes to effectively address the scientific, diagnostic, and therapeutic ramifications of mTBI and its long-term effects.  The Houston-based CENC Neuroimaging Core is comprised of an interdisciplinary team of neuroimaging experts from neuroradiology, neuropsychology, MR physics, information technology and computer programming, and statistics who facilitate sequence development and pulse programming, training and supervision of technologists, acquisition of imaging data, quality assurance, conventional and advanced imaging analysis, transfer and storage of imaging data, and assistance in interpreating neuroimaging data for existing and future Consortium projects. The Core is comprised of both VA- and academic-affiliate resources; an expansion of existing Core funds already granted to the academic affiliate (Baylor College of Medicine) is needed due to the Consortium's growth and the resulting change in the Core's scope of work. Specifically, expansion of the number of study sites for existing studies and the addition of several new projects has substantially increased the Core's responsibilities, including additional oversight, quality control, analysis, and administrative duties for Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC)-based Core investigators and staff. Project Objectives: Objectives of the Neuroimaging Core are to: 1) assist in the acquisition of brain imaging data, including conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), detailed volumetry and cortical thickness, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI); 2) transfer, convert, analyze, and store brain imaging data; 3) direct and assist in performing quality assurance of the scanners at all sites involved in imaging data collection; and 4) communicate with the investigators of projects involving imaging to facilitate integration of imaging data into the projects to address their aims. Project Methods: The collective expertise of the investigators in the Core facilitates utilization and analysis of several conventional and advanced imaging techniques. MEDVAMC-based Core personnel, including MR physicists, oversee quality assurance testing on each magnet, which is performed on a regular basis to ensure scanner accuracy, stability, and comparability. Core personnel assist in the pulse programming and sequence development for advanced MR sequences used in specific projects. Core investigators provide additional training to MR technologists and also to project coordinators on preparing participants to undergo imaging. Core personnel additionally provide assistance with computer programming to facilitate data sorting and analysis. Due to the complex nature of transferring and storing very large amounts of data as well as frequent software updates required by some imaging analysis programs, individuals with IT expertise are also involved. Core personnel also train and supervise all image analysts, assist in the interpretation of imaging data, and assist in manuscript preparation.                       "
"9198426","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will use quantitative genetic techniques to identify genes and alleles that influence a constellation of psychologically complex behavioral phenotypes that are associated with drug abuse. Our center capitalizes on a number of recent advances in study design, next-generation sequencing and statistical methods that together create an exceptional opportunity. Whereas the past two decades have seen enormous advances in both forward (phenotype to genotype) and reverse (genotype to phenotype) genetic studies in mice, there has been much less progress developing and applying the same techniques in rats. Although both forward and reverse genetic studies in mice have been extremely fruitful, many important but complex psychological processes are difficult or impossible to study in mice. For this reason we are proposing to adapt a variety of genetic techniques that we have already used successfully in mice, for behavioral studies in rats. In the current application, we propose to employ state-of-the-art tools to elucidate the genetic basis of a variety of behaviors that are relevant to drug abuse in 4,800 rats. A key strength of our center is that we utilize a unique rat heterogeneous stock (HS). These rats, sometimes referred to as N/NIH, are an HS that was created in 1984 by intercrossing 8 inbred rat strains and have been maintained as an outbred population for 65 generations. This has given rise to numerous accumulated recombinations that make them an ideal resource for performing studies that are analogous to human genome wide association studies (GWAS). Significantly, all 8 inbred founder strains have recently been re-sequenced, identifying 7.2 million SNPs. We will genotype these rats using an innovative next-generation sequencing-based method that provides ~100K SNPs at an extremely low cost. We will use these data to infer haplotypes, which will allow us to impute all 7.2 million SNPs in each rat. In addition to identifying associations between these SNPs and the behavioral traits, we will also examine gene expression in 72 behaviorally naive rats focusing on 4 key brain regions. We will use these data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate all of these data to identify specific genes that influece behavior. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also identify co-heritability among these traits, as well as pleiotropic effects of individual loci on multiple putatively related behavioral domains.  Finally,  the proposed center includes numerous educational, career development and public outreach activities. We will implement a program to train high school and undergraduate students. In addition, technicians, graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty will receive career development advice in the form of individual development plans and research performance progress reports. Finally, we will engage in public outreach programs that will draw on diverse communities in Chicago, Buffalo and Memphis."
"9204662","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that circulating estrogen and striatal dopamine (DA) receptor availability interact with one another to influence self-control. Specifically, we predict that increased circulating estrogen wil decrease DA D2-type receptor availability, and this decrease in DA receptor availability will decrease performance on two self-control tasks, the Stop-Signal Task and an emotion regulation task. Self-control tasks have previously been shown to be influenced by DA signaling in both animals and humans, and a smaller number of studies have shown a relationship between estrogen levels and performance on self-control tasks. Therefore, we will test our hypothesis first by measuring DA D2 receptor availability in the brain using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging and measuring estrogen levels in blood serum (Aim 1). Next, participants will complete two self-control tasks that share a common neural substrate: the Stop Signal Task, a measurement of impulsive action (Aim 2) and cognitive reappraisal of emotions (Aim 3). We will enter the results of each behavioral experiment into a statistical model with serum estrogen levels and striatal DA D2 receptor availability measured by BPND to test our hypothesis that circulating estrogen decreases DA D2 receptor availability, and this decrease in receptor availability decreases self-control. If the data support this hypothesis, our findings wil suggest that hormone state is an important factor to consider in experiments that involve self-control tasks and, more importantly, when attempting to modify behaviors that depend on self-control, in particular, addiction."
"9221467","ABSTRACT Objective: We propose an innovative approach towards the discovery of new targets for anti-Candida drug development. Our approach is based on the concept that, although invasive C. albicans infections typically originate from commensal populations populating the host gut mucosa and skin, the critical transition from superficial to invasive infection is absent from the standard intravenous injection model of virulence. Therefore, we will develop improved animal models that better represent the natural history of disseminated candidiasis and to exploit the new systems to identify much-needed antifungal drug targets. Rationale: Candida albicans is a yeast component of the human microbiome that persists stably on mucocutaneous surfaces of the gut, skin, and genitourinary tract for the lifetime of the host. It is also a pathogen that causes highly morbid invasive infections in patients with certain risk factors, such as exposure to antibiotics, immunosuppressants, parenteral nutrition, or intravenous catheters. Candida spp. are the fourth most common cause of bloodstream infections in US hospitals, and mortality from candidemia remains high at ~40%. The most important therapeutic intervention in treatment of bloodstream candidiasis is the early initiation of antifungal antibiotics, such that mortality increases with each day that appropriate therapy is delayed. Unfortunately, our antifungal armamentarium is currently limited to only a handful of drugs. Moreover, the choice of drugs in debilitated patients is often further limited by significant toxicities (e.g. amphotericin, azoles), restricted tissue distribution (e.g. echinocandins), and complex drug-drug interactions (e.g. azoles). These issues and the emergence of drug resistance in selected clinical isolates have created an urgent need for additional, potent, safe antifungal drugs. Unlike many microbial pathogens, C. albicans infections typically originate from the commensal population, when yeasts on the skin or in the gut manage to penetrate through epithelial barriers. We propose that the specific pathogen functions required for this transition have been missed by current methods for investigating virulence. To test this hypothesis, we have initiated development of animal models of invasive candidiasis that include 1) the transition from localized skin infection (cellulitis) to bloodstream infection and 2) invasion of gut commensals through the gastrointestinal mucosa to surrounding organs. We propose to exploit these models to screen C. albicans mutant collections for functions required for disseminated disease. Our functional screens and focused follow up studies will identify novel targets for the prevention and treatment of invasive candidiasis."
"9221624","Using the formation of a virus particle (virion) from SV40 minichromosomes as a model for the generation of repressive chromatin by nucleosome remodeling, we will characterize how the combination of nucleosome location and associated histone modifications controls gene expression. Our central hypothesis is that the nucleosome location and the histone modifications associated with the nucleosome directly contribute to reorganization. The specific aims are (1) To characterize the changes in nucleosome positioning and corresponding histone modifications during the encapsidation of minichromosomes late in infection and (2) To determine which transcriptional regulatory sequences direct nucleosome positioning and histone modifications during encapsidation. For comparison purposes bulk nucleosome locations will be determined from micrococal nuclease digestion of chromatin from minichromosomes and disrupted virions. The location of nucleosomes containing specific histone modifications along with all of the other nucleosome positions in each sample of chromatin will be obtained using our modified ChIP-Seq procedure, which we developed. Intact SV40 chromatin will be immune selected with antibody to a particular histone modification bound to agarose, the ChIP chromatin purified on the agarose, and fragmented by micrococcal nuclease digestion. The DNA present in the agarose-bound chromatin fragments and the free fragments will be separately purified, libraries prepared, and paired-end sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq. The location of nucleosomes will then be determined from a bioinformatics analysis of the sequencing reads in the parallel libraries. SV40 chromatin will be obtained from wild-type and mutant minichromosomes and encapsidation intermediates and recombinant constructs containing specific regulatory elements within a defined chromatin reporter region. The changes in nucleosome location and histone modifications will then be correlated with the process of encapsidation and the presence of specific DNA elements. The proposed studies are innovative because for the first time we will be characterizing both nucleosome location and histone modifications in the same nucleosomes while remodeling to repress transcription is occurring as part of virion formation. The work is also significant since linking histone modifications to nucleosome location would advance our understanding of how nucleosome location is regulated. Because SV40 is also a model for closely related human pathogens understanding epigenetic repression by nucleosome positioning may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to address the disease caused by the pathogens."
"9222102","Discovery of novel therapeutics for fungal pathogens Abstract Fungal central nervous system (CNS) infection continues be an important cause of mortality and morbidity. Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) and Candida albicans (C. albicans) represent the important fungal pathogens causing CNS infection. Successful treatment of C. neoformans and C. albicans CNS infection is compromised by development of antimicrobial resistance and limited repertoire of antifungal drugs against resistant C. neoformans and C. albicans infection. This application, submitted in response to RFA-AI-15-054, proposes to develop early stage translational research focused on the discovery and development of novel therapeutics against CNS infection caused by eukaryotic fungal pathogens, C. neoformans and C. albicans. Recent studies have shown that CNS-infecting pathogens exhibit the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, the essential step in the development of CNS infection. Since C. neoformans and C. albicans dissemination to the brain is likely to involve their penetration of the blood-brain barrier, we developed the in vitro blood-brain barrier model with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) to investigate C. neoformans and C. albicans penetration of the blood-brain barrier. The HBMEC monolayer, upon cultivation on collagen-coated Transwell inserts, exhibits morphological and functional properties of tight junction formation and a polarized monolayer, a unique property of the blood-brain barrier endothelial cells. We showed that C. neoformans and C. albicans strains exhibited the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. We hypothesize that targeting C. neoformans and C. albicans penetration of the blood-brain barrier provides a novel approach for discovery of novel therapeutics for fungal CNS infection. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary identification of montelukast (an antagonist of cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor or CysLT1) and gefitinib (an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor or EGFR) that inhibited C. neoformans and C. albicans penetration of the blood-brain barrier. CysLT1 and EGFR have not been previously recognized for their contribution to fungal CNS infection and represent novel therapeutic targets for C. neoformans and C. albicans CNS infection. Determination and validation of CysLT1 and EGFR for their contribution to C. neoformans and C. albicans penetration of the blood-brain barrier will, therefore, facilitates discovery of novel host-specific therapeutic targets common to C. neoformans and C. albicans, which is consistent with the FOA of RFA-AI-15-054."
"9225439","Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an enteric pathogen commonly associated with traveler's diarrhea, infecting approximately 280 million people annually. Although most cases are not life threatening, it is estimated that 300,000 to 700,000 infants and children are killed by this pathogen each year. Dehydrating diarrhea is produced when the pathogen elaborates the heat-labile (LT) and/or the heat-stable (ST) toxin. In the decades since their discovery both enterotoxins have been extensively characterized. The other well characterized category of ETEC virulence factors are the adhesins; both fimbrial and afimbrial. Although there are exceptions; the vast majority of research in this field involves some aspect of LT, ST, or adhesin biology/epidemiology. However we have recently discovered a new ETEC virulence factor. We propose that this virulence factor is a novel third enterotoxin that enhances ETEC virulence by blocking the activation of a newly described effector of innate immunity [Perforin-2 (P2)]. This enteroxotin is deployed by an atypical Type 1 Secretion System that accepts its substrate from the periplasm rather than the cytosol. In Aim 1 we will characterize the virulence factor's mechanism of action and cellular target(s). In Aim 2 we will characterize its secretory pathway. By elucidating the molecular mechanism(s) of this novel virulence factor we will gain new insight into ETEC pathogenesis which may lead to novel therapeutics to reduce the global burden of ETEC infections. These studies will also provide new knowledge of an atypical protein secretion system that may be applicable to other bacterial pathogens. In addition these studies will enhance our understanding of P2; an important but under characterized component of the innate immune system."
"9225929","Project Summary Over 5.1 million Americans suffer from heart failure (HF), leading to an annual estimated $32 billion societal cost. Although survival from HF has improved, a diagnosis of HF is similar to some forms of cancer, with 50% of patients dying within 5 years. Ventricular assist devices (VADs) have improved survival in patients with advanced HF. Over 17,000 patients with advanced HF received VADs in the last decade. VAD devices are surgically implanted into the heart and provide circulatory support to the patient. A driveline passes from the device through the skin, connecting to a system controller that in turn is connected to a power source. Risks after VAD implantation include life-threatening driveline infections that can lead to device malfunction. At the time of VAD implantation, patients and their caregivers are educated about VAD self-management. After discharge, patients and caregivers are required to engage in daily VAD self-management and recognize VAD-specific signs and symptoms requiring immediate medical attention. With improper VAD self- management, patients can die from preventable complications. Unfortunately, no rigorous standardized training exists for patients and caregivers to ensure mastery of VAD self-management. Traditionally, VAD training consists of patients and their caregivers watching a video or demonstrating VAD-related techniques and then performing these techniques, first under supervision, and within days, independently. This process leads to uneven skill acquisition and may cause unnecessary harm to the patient. Simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) can be used to prevent such uneven skill acquisition and potential patient harm. SBML is an intense form of competency-based education in which learners are required to meet or exceed a predetermined high level of skill on a simulator. Our research demonstrates that SBML is a more effective strategy than traditional education in improving clinical skills and patient care. Therefore, we propose to create and test an SBML intervention for VAD self-management and compare the intervention to traditional (usual) VAD training. Our specific study aims are to: AIM 1. A) Complete semi-structured interviews with nurses, physicians, patients and caregivers to identify common and unique barriers and facilitators encountered regarding VAD self-management. B) Develop an SBML VAD self-management curriculum informed by the interviews and current best practices. AIM 2. Compare performance of VAD self-management skill of sterile dressing changes and VAD-related controller functions between SBML-trained and the usual VAD training group immediately following training, and at one and three months after VAD implantation. AIM 3. This exploratory aim will examine VAD-patient driveline infections, and all-cause and infection-related re-hospitalizations through one and three months after VAD implant, between the SBML intervention group as compared to the usual VAD training group."
"9235740","The focus of this proposal is on GSDMB (gasdermin B) a gene on chromosome 17q21, a chromosomal region which has been highly linked to human asthma in several genome wide association studies. Moreover, as asthmatics with a SNP linked to chromosome 17q21 have increased expression of GSDMB, we generated transgenic mice which overexpress the human GSDMB transgene. Preliminary characterization of these GSDMB transgenic mice demonstrate that they have increased expression of the same GSDMB regulated pro-inflammatory and remodeling pathways we noted in human bronchial epithelial cells overexpressing GSDMB in vitro. The investigation of the function of GSDMB in the lung in asthma in this grant proposal will be facilitated by the development of unique reagents in the PI?s lab that are not commercially available (e.g. human GSDMB cre activated transgenic mice for cell specific conditional over- expression of the transgene; full length GFP labeled and unlabeled human GSDMB construct for in vitro studies; adenoviral human GSDMB construct to transfect into human lung bronchial epithelial cells in vitro). We will also study how GSDMB expressed in human lung ex vivo influences bronchodilation, bronchoconstriction, and airway remodeling using novel assays developed by my co-investigator Dr Kurten. The use of these novel approaches to study the function of GSDMB in human lung, as well as the development of novel reagents and GSDMB mutant mice will allow us to test the hypothesis that in vivo GSDMB expression in lung contributes to inflammation, and remodeling, with resultant effects on airway responsiveness.

"9237679","TMD (Temporomandibular joint disorders) affect 5-10% of the population in this country, with severe TMD requiring surgical repair. The cause for TMD is often hard to determine, and the pathophysiology underlying this affliction remains unclear, as the mandibular condylar cartilage (MCC) differs considerably in its development and structure from both a growth plate or an articular cartilage. However, the regulation of TMJ development and growth has been under-studied. Chondrogenesis in the TMJ or limbs has been considered a linked but separate process from osteogenesis during endochondral bone formation. How can the inherited message be transmitted from chondrocytes, which supposedly undergo cell death before bone formation, to the cells that form bone? The answer to this question may lie in recent studies indicating that a direct transformation of chondrocytes to osteoblasts occurs. Yet, the following key questions remain: how is this cell transformation linked to bone growth and remodeling? What is the underlying molecular mechanism? Which genes are required for cell transformation? We propose that chondrogenesis and osteogenesis are one continuous process in which chondrocyte-derived bone cells (CBC) define the overall pattern of MCC-ramus and contribute to bone remodeling via Bmpr1a (BMP receptor 1a, a key receptor for BMP2 and BMP4) and ?-catenin. This hypothesis is based on: 1) Published data from our lab and others demonstrating that direct cell transformation occurs in MCC and limbs; 2) Deleting Bmpr1a or ?-catenin in chondrocytes leads to drastic changes in the condyle and limbs during growth and bone remodeling, though deletion of either gene in bone cells has little impact on the skeletal pattern; and 3) The molecular regulation of cell transformation is highly dependent on the skeletal elements, developmental stage, and different genes. We will test this hypothesis using the following highly related but independent Aims: 1) To determine molecular regulation of cell transformation by Bmpr1a during growth and bone remodeling. Working hypothesis: the CBC defines the overall morphology of the condyle and limbs via BMPR1A that plays variant roles in different elements of the skeleton; and 2): To determine molecular regulation of cell transformation by ?-catenin during growth and bone remodeling. Working hypothesis: ?-catenin plays variant roles in the condyle vs. limbs in defining skeletal pattern and bone remodeling in a manner that differs from Bmpr1a; and 3): To determine how chondrocytes demineralize cartilage matrices and form bone cells ex vivo, and shift expression profiles of genes directly linked to bone cells in vitro. Working hypothesis: HCs, which migrate, play a dual role in removing calcified cartilage and cell transformation. We expect that CBC is responsible for most endochondral bone formation and remodeling, regulated by Bmpr1a and ?-catenin. We predict that this phenomenon also occurs in limbs, although differentially regulated by these genes. Finishing this project will likely revise the current dogma, provide new knowledge in this understudied area, and form a basis for developing novel approaches to prevent, diagnose, and treat TMD, as well as other skeletal diseases."

However, few therapies are available that improve functioning or prevent functional decline in people with PAD.  Metformin is an inexpensive, widely available, well tolerated biguanide medication and the most commonly prescribed drug for Type 2 diabetes mellitus worldwide. Recent pre-clinical and preliminary human evidence suggest that metformin has previously unrecognized therapeutic properties. Therapeutic properties of metformin in pre-clinical models that may benefit people with PAD include: calf skeletal muscle increases in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1?) (a major regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis), calf skeletal muscle increases in mitochondrial protein expression and activity, increases in capillary density in ischemic tissue, reductions in oxidative stress, increased autophagy (repair of cellular damage), and improved endothelial function. These therapeutic properties target pathophysiologic conditions present in PAD. Therefore, we hypothesize that metformin will improve lower extremity functioning in people with PAD, by facilitating favorable changes in calf skeletal muscle and by increasing calf skeletal muscle perfusion. No randomized clinical trials have studied whether metformin improves lower extremity functioning in PAD. A definitive trial is needed.  We propose a placebo controlled double-blind randomized clinical trial to establish whether metformin (2,000 mgs daily) improves and/or prevents decline in walking performance in people with PAD. Participants will be 212 people with PAD who do not have diabetes mellitus, since metformin is a first-line therapy for Type 2 diabetes. Our primary outcome is change in six-minute walk at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are 6-month changes in treadmill walking performance, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, calf skeletal muscle biopsy measures, patient-reported walking performance, and quality of life. Calf muscle outcomes consist of changes in PGC-1? abundance, mitochondrial quantity, mitochondrial enzyme activity, capillary density, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced tissue damage, and autophagy.  If metformin improves functional performance and prevents functional decline in PAD, this widely available, inexpensive, and well tolerated medication will have a major impact on preventing mobility loss and improving quality of life in the large and growing number of people with PAD."
"9238174","Abstract The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2016 there will be 1.7 million new cancer cases diagnosed and 600,000 cancer deaths in the United States. Although advances have been made in the treatment of cancer with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and with biologics, there is a critical need to develop novel treatment approaches with promise for improved selectivity, potency, and efficacy. This project introduces a new and previously untested platform strategy to enhance the efficiency of delivery of macromolecules to the cytoplasm of targeted cells. The central component of the strategy is the use of ?catch-and-release? monoclonal antibodies (CAR), with pH-dependent receptor binding. The CAR antibodies are conjugated to highly potent macromolecular toxins (CAR-toxin) and to endosome escape peptides (CAR-EEP). Combined administration of CAR-toxin and CAR-EEP conjugates allows efficient, targeted delivery and release of the toxin in the cytoplasm, enabling highly selective and potent anti-cancer efficacy. To pursue this project, we have developed a novel catch-and-release anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibody (10H6), with high affinity CEA binding at physiological pH, and with dramatically reduced binding at acidic pH. Preliminary data have been generated to assess the binding, cytotoxicity, and pharmacokinetics of 10H6, which in sum, strongly support the feasibility of the work. An interdisciplinary team has been assembled to evaluate this approach, with three experimental aims that will: (1) examine and optimize the utility of catch and release conjugates for cytoplasmic delivery of macromolecules to cancer cells in vitro, (2) test hypotheses regarding the tumor selectivity of in vivo disposition of the antibody conjugates, and (3) evaluate the safety and efficacy of the catch-and-release mAb conjugates in the treatment of mice bearing human xenograft tumors. The project, if successful, will establish a new targeting concept, with potential utility in enhancing the efficiency of cytoplasmic delivery of virtually any macromolecule to any type of cancer."
"9241701","Serological evidence of infection with Toxoplasma gondii can be seen in up to 40% of humans. Infection with this Apicomplexan parasite can cause a severe congenital infection with an associated fetopathy. T. gondii is also a cause of opportunistic infections in immune compromised hosts. The predilection of this parasite for the central nervous system (CNS) causing necrotizing encephalitis and the eye causing chorioretinitis constitutes its major threat to patients. In both congenital infection and in immune compromised patients CNS and ocular toxoplasmosis is believed to be a consequence of the reactivation of chronic or latent infection due to persistent tissue cysts (bradyzoites) of T. gondii. The presence of these tissues cysts in brain and muscle are critical for persistence of this protozoan parasite. We have established that cysts are enclosed in highly glycosylated cyst wall, but the role(s) of glycosylation in persistence and the pathogenesis of parasites are not fully understood. Several glycoproteins are known to be expressed and localized to the cyst wall. Our laboratory group has demonstrated that one of these cyst wall glycoproteins, CST1, is critical in the differentiation of the parasites and formation of the cyst wall structure. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that CST1 is primarily modified by o-linked glycosylation and that this glycosylation of CST1 is vital for stability of the cyst wall. This R21 will focus on the development of a novel approach and reagents that we have developed that employ click chemistry and porcine leukocyte esterase (PLE) to allow selective labeling of glycoproteins in this obligate intracellular organism. Using genetically modified T. gondii strains that have various glycosyltransferases (ppGalNAc-Ts) knockouts we will characterize the o-glycoproteome of T. gondii during cyst formation. The proposed studies utilize a proteomic approach employing click chemistry and mass spectrometry to validate our new PLE click chemistry strategy. This PLE technique is applicable to many compounds and, once validated, will provide a tool for selective delivery of small molecules to obligate intracellular pathogens, permitting selective labeling of these organisms as well as selective targeting of pathways. The interdisciplinary team that has been assembled for this project includes internationally recognized expertise in T. gondii bradyzoite biology (Dr. Louis Weiss), orthogonal click chemistry (Dr. Peng Wu) and glycobiology (Dr. Pamela Stanley)."
"9242329","Osteoporosis (porous bone disease) is a disease of the skeleton that can have debilitating effects on many US veterans. An estimated 44 million Americans, or 55 percent of the people 50 years of age and older, are currently at risk for osteoporotic fracture. Improved treatment options for the disease require a greater understanding of the cellular events and signaling pathways that control bone metabolism. The proposed research capitalizes on human diseases that result in very high bone mass. The genetic causes of these high bone mass diseases?craniotubular hyperostosis, sclerosteosis, van Buchem's disease?provide insight into how bone mass can be manipulated in osteoporotic patients to improve their skeletal health and prevent fractures. Many of the high-bone-mass associated diseases are caused by mutations in a cell signaling pathway called ?Wnt.? Thus, manipulation of the Wnt pathway holds great promise for skeletal health improvement. This pathway is particularly attractive as a therapeutic target because it can be manipulated to increase new bone formation, rather than simply prevent further bone loss (which is how all but one of the currently available FDA-approved therapies work). The long term goals of the proposed project are twofold: first, we seek to understand how the secreted inhibitors of Wnt signaling function as a coordinated unit (i.e., a milieu), by adjusting their expression levels when other members of the unit are adjusted (e.g., inhibited or deleted). Those adjustments in expression in the members of the milieu represent prime targeting opportunities to enact large changes in anabolic action in bone, as our supporting data suggest. We also seek to understand how this Wnt inhibitor milieu controls the anabolic action of mechanical loading?a potent anabolic stimulus that has lasting benefits to the skeleton. We seek to understand whether certain members of the inhibitory milieu function as ?homing signals? to ensure that new bone is added where it is needed most ? to the high strain regions of the bone, and that it is not added where it is not needed ? to the low strain regions of the bone. Again, our data suggest that the Wnt inhibitory milieu plays a significant role in this process. Our second goal of the application is to conduct functional studies targeting the Wnt inhibitor milieu, that have direct applicability to future therapeutic approaches in patients. Bone wasting conditions such as mechanical disuse (e.g., bedrest, paralysis) and glucocorticoid therapy (a drug used for treating inflammation and immuno- suppression) are common among veterans. Based on measurements we and others have made regarding the changes in expression of Wnt inhibitors following disuse and glucocorticoid exposure, we hypothesize that the ?compensatory milieu? of four Wnt inhibitors?Sost, Dkk1, sFrp4, and Wise?coordinate via unknown mechanisms to prevent anabolic action in the presence of disuse glucocorticoid therapy. We propose to target the entire milieu in different combinations, to determine whether we can restore anabolic activity in mice exposed to these bone wasting conditions. If so, those studies would have far-reaching implications for the design of therapies aimed at treating veterans with disuse- and glucocorticoid-induced bone deficiencies. Another functional study we will undertake, which also capitalizes on the biology of the Wnt inhibitor milieu, is to determine whether we can reduce the dose/volume of Sost antibody required to generate a significant anabolic response by additionally blocking accessory Wnt inhibitors that are part of the compensatory milieu. We have already shown that we can dramatically increase the anabolic efficacy of Dkk1 antibody if we use it in the presence of Sost inhibition. We anticipate a significant osteoanabolic effect using much lower doses of antibody if we simultaneously block other accessory Wnt inhibitors. In this renewal Merit application, we address these questions in order to identify new ways to improve bone health among the veteran population, and among the public in general."
"9242623","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching objective of this DDRCC is to foster and facilitate research in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and related inflammatory diseases of the bowel. This theme has defined our GI program for 75 years, ever since Dr. Joseph B. Kirsner, the founder of modern gastroenterology at the University of Chicago, put forward the hypothesis that inflammatory bowel diseases are caused by combination of genetic, immunological, and microbial factors. We now know this is indeed the case, but recognize that other factors associated with recent changes in environment, lifestyle, and diet, are contributing to the increased prevalence and incidence of these diseases. The DDRCC has been the foundation of IBD research at the University of Chicago allowing us to build a highly collaborative, multidisciplinary team, a fully integrated translational research infrastructure, an state-of-the-art core facilities and services. In addition, the DDRCC has partnered with two University of Chicago affiliates, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) at Woods Hole, to attract new investigators to the field and leverage their resources, talent, and facilities for the investigation of inflammatory diseases of the bowel. The central hypothesis of the collective group is that IBD and related inflammatory diseases of the bowel arise from a confluence of host, microbial, immunological, and environmental factors. The program is now in its 24th year, and, despite being a highly focused research program, the research base has steadily increased to 51 full and 16 associate member investigators with a total annual direct cost funding for digestive diseases of $14.8 million, of which ~$5.7 million comes from NIDDK (21% increase from 2009). The program has 4 major interrelated research themes that focus on the etiopathogenesis of IBD: (1) host immune/tissue responses, (2) the gut microbiome, (3) host genetics and gene function, and (4) environmental modifiers. The 4 DDRCC cores embracing these themes have continuously evolved to meet the needs of investigators and to anticipate new trends and technologies in biomedical research. The DDRCC has received tremendous institutional support as 1 of 5 priority areas designated for development by the Division of Biological Sciences. The DDRCC has successfully supported new investigators, but also drawn in talented scientists outside of the field of digestive diseases  (15 now full members since 2010). Over the past two funding cycles, the P&F program has resulted in over $25M in extramural funds, or a 25 to 1 return-on-investment. Over the past funding cycle, 56% of the 306 publications acknowledging the DDRCC for its support were coauthored by two or more DDRCC members, indicating a high level of collaborative science. The number of high impact papers (Impact factor>20) published by DDRCC members has nearly doubled compared to the previous funding cycle. Thus, the DDRCC has successful met its goals of advancing the science and translation of discovery in inflammatory diseases of the bowel. The DDRCC as a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It provides strategic vision, cutting-edge, high quality, and cost-effective services and resources, and gives opportunity to current and next generation scientists to flourish in a highly collaborative and productive environment."
"9243340","Systematic reviews of treatments for mental health disorders should be exploited in order to obtain accurate information about efficacy of current interventions, and to use existing data to plan future clinical trials. Most systematic reviews result a graphical networks of multivariate, multi-arm data, often with up to 50% missing outcomes. Missing clinical trial outcomes are frequently a result of outcome reporting bias (ORB), in which outcomes are unreported based on observed level of significance. Such bias causes pooled meta-analytic effect sizes to be biased. To obtain unbiased and precise network meta-analytic effect sizes, networks should be jointly analyzed using a multivariate network meta-analytic (MNMA) framework, which has not yet been proposed. Under a Bayesian paradigm powered by Markov chain Monte Carlo tools, the methods described in this proposal will exploit outcome correlation and mitigate effects of ORB via the development of the MNMA model, resulting in less biased and more precise pairwise estimates of treatment effects (even for treatments that have been weakly or never-compared). Based on these results, predictive distributions will be used to inform operating characteristics of new clinical trials. Goals: Multivariate NMA will be developed and apply it to 3 case studies: systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of second-generation anti-depressants for the treatment of adult, adolescent, and older adult major depressive disorder, respectively, for which outcomes have been already shown to be subject to reporting bias. Comparisons with univariate NMA methods will be made. A methodology for future trial design will be developed utilizing Bayesian predictive inference informed by the multivariate network. This approach would refine power and sample size calculations resulting in optimally-powered and more efficient trials for weakly- or never-tested treatments. Software will be completely generalizable to networks arising from all clinical disciplines and will be disseminated freely."
"9245774","ABSTRACT  Exercise is a powerful physiological stimulus contributing to disease prevention and intervention. The protective and preventive effects of exercise are well-documented for metabolic, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers. While scientists acknowledge the extensive benefits of exercise, there is still insufficient understanding about the underlying mechanisms by which exercise prevents disease and improves health across diverse organ systems. The NIH Common Fund has developed a forward-looking funding mechanism ? six tethered RFA's tied to creating a research consortium, the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) ? to create resources and critical information for exercise and health investigators well into the future. Two products of the MoTrPAC collective efforts will be a publically available data resource that will enhance and accelerate subsequent mechanistic research on diseases and conditions affected by physical activity; and a biorepository of clinical and animal model samples to be used in studying exercise biology. Based on prior collaborative efforts, our group believes that we are ideally positioned to propose a protocol that will respond directly to the RFA, while at the same time execute the large volume of tests to complete the ~450 people required at each site within the MoTrPAC consortium. To accomplish all of our Clinical Center goals, we have developed a consortium ? the North Carolina Clinical Site Consortium (NCCSC). The NCCSC consists of the experienced research teams Duke University School of Medicine; East Carolina University (ECU); and Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM). As described in the study plan, the NCCSC weighed a number of alternatives for training regimens, timing, and type of tissue sampling, sample sizes for the four obligated study groups, and other factors, while staying within budget constraints. The following Aims will maximize the value of the data and sample repositories; this will be accomplished with the enrollment of 540 individuals and finishing 450.  · Aim 1: To determine the response of molecular transducers to a single acute bout of either aerobic or  resistance training.  · Aim 2: To determine the responses of molecular transducers to a chronic exercise training program of  either aerobic or resistance training.  · Aim 3: To determine the responses of molecular transducers to a detraining period following either aerobic  or resistance training."
"9246359","A Pediatric Clinical Center for Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC): Towards a Molecular Map of Exercise in the Pediatric Origins of Health Across the Lifespan The goals of this research are to: 1) map the molecular mechanisms through which exercise benefits health in children and adolescents, a critical period of change in the human phenotype, and 2) provide the MoTrPAC consortium with rigorously collected and reproducible data from exercise studies in children and adolescents. This proposal is based on exciting discoveries in a range of disciplines, including: 1) new insights into age- dependent progression of gene expression during growth in children, 2) emerging data highlighting the central role played by leukocytes (n.b., an accessible tissue in child health research) in transducing exercise into health benefits, 3) pilot data showing remarkable interaction between the molecular transducers of growth and the molecular transducers of exercise, and 4) novel approaches to measuring and understanding physiologic and morphometric responses to acute and chronic exercise in children. In the proposed acute exercise studies, the immediate physiologic, proteomic, metabolomic, and leukocyte function and transcriptomic response to a brief exercise-induced perturbation in cellular homeostasis will be measured in a cross section of early- and late-pubertal boys and girls. In the proposed chronic exercise studies (a 12-week, prospective, aerobic exercise training intervention), we will compare the magnitude of the biomarker and molecular adaptation to training, along with the accompanying morphometric and physiologic changes between early- and late-pubertal girls and boys. The combined data from the acute and chronic exercise studies will be analyzed with systems- computational techniques to map the networks that transduce physical activity to health in the growing child and adolescent. Because phenotype is a ?moving target? during growth, we will use accurate methodologies (such as DXA for body composition and breath-by-breath gas exchange for cardiopulmonary exercise testing) that have proven in our hands to be feasible in large numbers of children and adolescents. Traditional exercise testing will be complemented by laboratory-based ?real-life? exercise protocols, and in all cases, scaled to each participant?s physical fitness, estimates of habitual physical activity, noninvasive measures of vascular health, and training volume and mode. In this way, the pediatric and adult data will be readily integrated. As an academic health center unit devoted uniquely to the study of physical activity and health in children in a very diverse region, our group is exceptionally qualified to contribute to the MoTrPAC consortium. We 1) published a series of discoveries of novel genomic and epigenetic exercise biomarkers in circulating leukocytes in both children and adults, 2) performed thousands of pediatric exercise tests, 3) conducted many successful prospective exercise training interventions in early and late pubertal children, and 4) were leaders in Project HEALTHY, the large NIH multicenter study to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes in children, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This research will ultimately enable child health professionals, families, and community leaders to optimize the use of exercise to promote health during a critical period of growth."

"9255306","Project Summary The objective of this proposal is to break the vicious cycle of obesity/metabolic dysfunction during pregnancy. Lifestyle interventions in obese women during pregnancy have had limited success in improving maternal or offspring short and long-term metabolic health. We propose that lifestyle interventions need to be initiated prior to conception in overweight and obese women (henceforth referred to as obese) in order to first improve maternal metabolism. Lifestyle interventions will take place in the Cleveland Community Recreation Centers. Metabolic evaluations will be conducted in the Clinical Research Units of the Case Western Reserve Clinical Translational Science Center (CTSC). This strategy will result in decreased fetal adiposity and improved metabolic function in the offspring. We plan to recruit 200 obese women to pursue the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To investigate the physiological significance of lifestyle intervention in preparation for pregnancy (LIPP) on maternal and neonatal metabolism and adiposity in humans. Specific Aim 1a. We hypothesize that preconception lifestyle intervention will facilitate lower maternal insulin resistance, inflammation, weight, adiposity, incretin response and energy expenditure compared to usual care. We will link these changes in maternal metabolism with fetal growth (SA1b). Specific Aim 1b. We hypothesize that in women initiating pre-pregnancy lifestyle intervention will deliver a baby with lower birth weight and fat accretion, insulin resistance, and inflammatory profile at birth. Body composition will be measured using anthropometrics and air displacement densitometry (Pea Pod). Specific Aim 2: To determine the molecular effects whereby lifestyle intervention initiated before pregnancy improves placental mitochondrial lipid oxidation and lipid accumulation. We hypothesize that lifestyle intervention before pregnancy will improve placental mitochondrial oxidation and decrease lipid esterification/storage. Isotope-labeled fatty acid oxidation and esterification will be quantified in vitro in placental explants from a subset of women. Mitochondrial lipid metabolism and content will be measured using qRT-PCR and Elisa. Placental lipids will be quantified by mass spectrophotometry and correlated with neonatal adiposity and maternal metabolism providing a mechanistic link to SA 1."

Resources to support two predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees per year are requested. While considerable progress has been made in identifying the genetic and molecular bases of inner ear deficits, the biological bases of centrally-generated hearing and balance disorders, which are increasingly recognized as major contributors to auditory and vestibular dysfunction, are still poorly understood. The proposed program is intended to generate auditory and vestibular scientists who can address these problems, through training in basic neuroscience and the clinical aspects of hearing and balance disorders. A group of 15 preceptors who are committed to auditory and vestibular neuroscience research and to recruit and educate outstanding pre- and postdoctoral fellows will comprise the training faculty. The research methodology employed by the preceptors ranges from cellular and molecular to developmental to systems and cognition using a variety of model systems, ensuring that trainees use are exposed to the breadth and variety of technical and conceptual approaches that define modern research in the field. In addition to conducting research, trainees attend monthly research seminars, and participate in a series of professional development workshops that provide explicit training in such survival skills as written and oral communication, obtaining jobs and grants, teaching, and managing a research lab. All trainees must submit a fellowship application as part of the program, the writing of which will be facilitated by periodic meetings with a local committee that provides advice and guidance, as well as utilizing grant-writing workshops provided by the office of academic career development.

In contrast, the basic sciences postdoctoral training offers little exposure to the clinical setting, making translational research difficult. The goal of this application is to provide research training in otolaryngology and its related sciences. Support is requested for in-depth training for 1) residents, 2) postdoctoral fellows, 3) predoctoral students and 4) short-term medical students. All trainees will receive an interactive basic research experience with ongoing exposure to and interaction of trainees in the clinical setting through conferences and courses. The pre- and postdoctoral trainees will have a 24-month block of training. Research training for MDs will begin in medical school with students doing short-term (3-month) projects and continue through the residency program with a 2-year block midway through the clinical training. One resident will be admitted each year into this research track. Early introduction and continued research involvement throughout the residency will increase our ability to attract academically oriented faculty members into the field, with backgrounds to become independent investigators. This cross-field exposure will enhance the experience for trainees and promote clinical and basic science interactions as a faculty. A major strength of the program is drawing members of the faculty from a wide variety of departments of the School of Medicine and across the UC campuses involved in otolaryngology related research. This will enhance collaborative efforts in related fields of hearing, balance, smell, taste, speech, language and head and neck cancer. All faculty members have primary or secondary appointments within the Department of Otolaryngology, creating an ideal environment for translational research between basic and clinician scientists.

"9277645","Reactivation of dormant Toxoplasma gondii bradyzoite cysts in the central nervous system in AIDS patients causes Toxoplasmosis, a dangerous and difficult to treat recurrent encephalitis. No treatments are currently available for AIDS patients to eliminate the dormant Toxoplasma bradyzoite cysts, to prevent their reactivation, or to prevent the development of new cysts after reactivated disease occurs. The absence of any current curative or preventative treatment for AIDS patients to reduce the risk of disease associated with Toxoplasma infection is due primarily to a major gap in basic knowledge regarding the fundamental parasite biology of chronic infection. Several Toxoplasma rhoptry secreted (ROP) protein virulence factors are crucial for parasite survival during acute infection and enable parasite survival necessary to establish the chronic stages of infection defined by bradyzoite cysts. Our recent findings identified novel rhoptry proteins encoded by the ROP38 locus that while essential for the chronic bradyzoite cyst stages are not necessary for the acute stages of infection or parasite virulence. Consequently, investigation of the ROP38 locus enables a specific analysis of mechanisms that influence cyst burdens in chronic infection. The ROP38 locus contains 6 genes that encode ROP proteins with signatures of active kinases (ROPKs). In this exploratory R21 project we will examine aspects of host - parasite interaction and mechanisms associated with the ROP38 locus that are crucial for chronic stages of infection. This is a novel area of biological investigation because the existence of ROPKs that control chronic infection but not acute infection were previously unknown. Through the investigation of the biological functions of the ROP38 locus, this high risk - high impact exploratory R21 study has the potential to reveal new aspects of parasite biology."
"9293622","The overarching goals of Dr. Myers' research program are to apply exercise therapy and lifestyle intervention to help restore function, reduce disability, and reduce health care costs in Veterans with chronic disease. These areas include diagnostic and prognostic applications of cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and the physiologic effects of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs in patients with chronic heart failure, coronary artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm disease, spinal cord injury, mild cognitive impairment, and chronic renal failure. He is currently PI on two VA RR&D projects, one entitled, ?PCI Alternative using Sustained Exercise (PAUSE),? and the other entitled, ?Exercise to Prevent Muscle Mass and Functional Loss in Elderly Dialysis Patients (PERFECT).? The PAUSE project extends his work on the clinical applications of rehabilitation in patients with cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in Veterans, and in addition to assessing the physiologic effects of exercise and lifestyle intervention as an alternative to invasive treatment of coronary artery disease, the study addresses the cost effectiveness of non-invasive (lifestyle intervention) vs. invasive (coronary stenting) strategies. The PERFECT trial focuses on the effects of exercise therapy on muscle mass and function in chronic renal failure. Renal failure is an important condition in the VA because of its cost (estimated to be the second most costly condition in the VA), its prevalence (estimated to be 34% higher than the general population), and its devastating effects on physical function and disability. Dr. Myers current work also includes three funded projects involving the effects of exercise therapy in patients with mild cognitive impairment. These studies are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise augmentation strategies along with cognitive training interventions to improve cognitive performance in older Veterans with mild cognitive impairment. Dr. Myers initiated and manages a relational database of clinical, angiographic, and exercise test responses dating back to 1987. This database has been a resource for answering many epidemiologic questions affecting Veterans (termed the Veterans Exercise Testing Study, or VETS). The VETS study is an ongoing, prospective evaluation of Veteran subjects referred for exercise testing for clinical reasons, designed to address exercise test, clinical, and lifestyle factors and their association with health outcomes. Studies from the VETS cohort have addressed the prevalence, temporal trends, and health care costs associated with statin use, obesity, chronic heart failure, cardiac rhythm abnormalities and other chronic conditions, and how these conditions are influenced by fitness and physical activity patterns. Analyses from the VETS cohort have influenced guidelines on exercise testing from major health organizations. He coordinates two other national data bases, a 7-center heart failure cardiopulmonary exercise test consortium, and the AHA/CDC- sponsored Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: A National Data Base (FRIEND). The FRIEND initiative is designed to develop a national fitness registry in order to better inform clinicians and the public about the importance of physical activity and fitness and their role in the prevention of chronic disease. As Co-PI, he recently completed a 6-year NIH-funded Specialized Center of Clinically-Oriented Research (SCCOR) project entitled, ?Exercise Therapy in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Disease.? The SCCOR program was initiated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to foster multidisciplinary research on clinically relevant topics facilitating basic science findings to be more rapidly applied to clinical problems, with an emphasis on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of a particular disease. This project has particular relevance to Veterans, since it has been shown that the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurism disease in Veterans >60 years is 14.3%, with potentially lethal consequences if the disease is not treated."

In this proposal, I am seeking support for a significantly new research endeavor, as I turn my attention to the pathologic thrombosis inherent to systemic autoimmune diseases such as SLE. Dr. David Pinsky, an expert in cardiovascular medicine and the interplay between inflammation and thrombosis, will be my primary research mentor going forward. Formal Instruction: My scientific goals include: (1) applying models of neutrophil activation and thrombosis to the rheumatic diseases, (2) working effectively and efficiently with patient samples, and (3) mechanistically studying platelet signaling and activation. Basic science coursework will be through several centers at the University of Michigan including the Center for Statistical Consultation and Research, the Flow Cytometry Core, and the Center for Live Cell Imaging. I also plan to regularly attend the intensive Symposium on Hemostasis, held biennially in Chapel Hill, NC. Equally important are my career development goals, which include: (1) improving written and oral communication skills, (2) developing IRB proposals for research on human subjects, and (3) enriching my mentoring skills. Specific instructional programs and courses will be utilized including the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research, IRBMED, the Program for Education and Evaluation in Responsible Research and Scholarship, and the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program. Research: Globally, I plan to explore the hypothesis that exaggerated NET formation is an important mediator of pathologic thrombosis in SLE and APS patients. Aim 1 will study the role of antiphospholipid antibodies (the hallmark of APS, and also frequently found in SLE) in activating neutrophils to release NETs. Aim 2 will explore the extent to which SLE platelets interact with neutrophils to promote NET formation. Aim 3 will build on the human studies of Aims 1 and 2 by testing the importance of neutrophils and platelets in animal models of autoimmune-mediated thrombosis and vascular damage."
"9102294","The thymus produces an abundance of MHC restricted, self-tolerant CD4 helper and CD8 cytolytic T cells to participate in adaptive immune responses. Such ?conventional T cells? develop in response to low-affinity TCR interactions with MHC molecules that display a diversity of self-peptides in the cortical region of the thymus. In contrast, high affinity interactions result in clonal deletion, but can also support the survival and differentiation of mature regulatory effectors in some contexts. These effectors include foxP3+ natural regulatory T cells (Treg), intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), and CD1d restricted natural killer T cells (NKT). This proposal will explore the role of high-affinity TCR signaling in clonal deletion and NKT effector differentiation. In the previous period we developed a novel approach to capturing T cell clones that are normally destined for deletion. Here we apply this approach to study the repertoire, reactivity, and structure of clones deleted at the early (DP) stage versus those deleted at the late (SP) stage. Specifically we hypothesize that early deleted clones have a distinct interaction with MHC that is less dependent on peptide, whereas late deleted clones have classic peptide-MHC reactivity. Experiments are proposed that will characterize the distinct autoimmune pathologies created by the escape of early versus late deleted clones. Lipid-specific natural killer T cells (NKT) are derived from thymic progenitors that survive strong signaling in the thymus and develop into 3 major effector subsets that produce distinct cytokines, as we showed in the previous period. One of these subsets (NKT2) produces IL-4 in the steady state and this influences multiple aspects of immune cell development to promote type II immune responses. Our research will identify key molecules controlling the differentiation of NKT cells; further characterize the effects of NKT2 produced IL-4 on lymphoid, myeloid, and stromal cells; and define how NKT cells traffic to unique tissue environments to impact immune responses."
"9343205","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brainstem stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can lead to devastating disability, resulting in part from communication impairment and immobility. In the most severe cases, patients become locked-in - awake and alert, but unable to move, control their environment, or ask for help. In these disorders, as well as other neurologic diseases and injuries, the desire or intention to move remains fully intact, but the motor centers of the brain are disconnected from their targets in the brainstem or spinal cord, resulting in paralysis. The development and testing of a technology that enables someone with severe paralysis or locked-in syndrome to communicate independently and reliably would revolutionize the fields of assistive technology and neuroengineering, and would be critical steps toward re-enabling limb movement after paralyzing disease or injury. Based on encouraging preliminary findings from participants with tetraplegia and limited communication, this proposed translational research will seek to further develop a neural interface system that can record brain signals and permit persons with paralysis to control communication software, simply by imagining the movement of their own paralyzed arm or hand. Up to five participants with brainstem stroke or ALS will receive a 96-microelectrode array (4x4 mm) which will record the individual and summed activities of ensembles of neurons in the motor cortex. In addition to further assessing the safety of this implanted medical device, this research will support the development of reliable neural decoding algorithms that permit persons with paralysis to use their natural movement-related cortical signals to drive a communication device for speech synthesis and improved environmental control."
"9377446","Abstract The histone H3 variant, centromere protein A (CENP-A), also localizes to DNA at double-strand breaks (DSBs), implying involvement in responses to DNA damage. CENP-A is normally a constituent of centromere specific chromatin, which forms the foundation for assembly of the kinetochore, a proteinaceous structure comprising a number of conserved protein complexes, that serve as the interface between chromosomes and spindle microtubules. CENP-A plays a crucial role in centromere identity and kinetochore assembly, and is essential to centromere and kinetochore functions, but why it should be recruited to DSB foci is not known. Our working hypothesis is that CENP-A is recruited to DSBs to create a DNA damage-specific form of chromatin to which DNA-damage checkpoint/repair proteins are recruited. Based on this idea, we propose a new model to describe an important mechanism of survival of unrepaired DSBs. In this model, unrepaired DNA damage produces acentric chromosome fragments that may harbor essential genetic information. To stably inherit these acentric fragments, a neocentromere must be formed at the DSB site marked by CENP-A protein on the broken chromosome fragment. The neocentromere facilitates microtubule attachment and proper segregation during mitosis. We hypothesize that incorporation of CENP-A at a DSB site can result in the formation of a neocentromere, and survival of cells following the failure to repair DSBs induced by chemotherapeutic agents or radiation therapy.  The specific objective of this proposal is to determine the role of CENP-A in the DDR. Aim 1. Determine significance of CENP-A localization at DSB sites. We will introduce DSBs into chromosomes in cells depleted of CENP-A, then analyze DNA damage checkpoint activity and DNA repair kinetics at the DSB site, and determine if recruitment of known DNA damage checkpoint/repair proteins to DSB sites is abrogated. Furthermore, we will measure DNA repair activity, and survival in cells depleted of CENP-A. Aim 2. Determine if neocentromere formation occurs at the site of DSBs. We hypothesize that a neocentromere or a ?pseudo?-neocentromere assembles at the DSB site in a CENP-A-dependent manner. Some spindle assembly checkpoint components have been identified at DSBs, but it is unknown whether a functional kinetochore, which can capture microtubules, is assembled. To test this hypothesis, we will perform immunofluorescence microscopy to detect all the kinetochore components. We will also examine whether neocentromere formation is increased when DDR pathways fail. These studies will provide novel insight into the role of CENP-A in cell survival.  The research project will establish a novel role of CENP-A in the DDR, and reshape the map of the DNA-damage signaling pathway. If neocentromere formation occurs at the DSB site, it will represent a previously unknown mechanism for protecting cells from genome instability in response to DNA damage."

Program members provide a wealth of behavioral, basic, clinical, policy, outcomes, and social scientific knowledge and expertise not only to the CC Program, but to the OSUCCC as a whole. The overall CC Program goal is to conduct research to reduce the incidence, mortality and morbidity of cancer, which is accomplished by employing a transdisciplinary research team approach. The Specific Aims of the CC Program are to: 1) Identify molecular, genetic, and behavioral factors related to cancer incidence and mortality; 2) Develop and test behavioral interventions to prevent or detect cancer early; and, 3) Assess and intervene on issues of cancer survivorship. An additional developing aim of the CC Program is to address policy in relation to cancer prevention, detection, and care. Within these aims, research focuses on cross-cutting themes including underserved/minority populations within our catchment area, communication research, tobacco use and toxicity (including regulatory science), and behavioral strategies that capitalize on our members' strengths, such as epidemiology, biology and behavior. The program now has 2 NCI P50-funded Centers, both showcasing not only our multi-level focus but also the transition from observational to interventional studies. In addition, many of our interventions, e.g., Patient Navigation and Bio-Behavioral Intervention to Reduce Stress after Breast Cancer, have been incorporated into clinical care. Moreover, our research has contributed to policy changes, most notably the establishment of a smoke-free campus at OSU. During this past funding period (2009 - 2014), the Program members published a total 611 articles in peer-reviewed journals of which 32% have intra-programmatic collaboration, 20% have inter-programmatic collaborations, and 404 (66%) of the publications represent multi-institutional collaborations. Many of these publications fall within each of these categories bringing the total collaborative publications to 85%. CC Program funding stands at $6.8M of which $6.2M is peer-reviewed funding and of that, $3.9M (63%) is NCI funding. CC Program investigators have enrolled 9,205 participants to research studies over the last 5 years, 64% to externally peer-reviewed studies and 34% to institutional studies, 1.2% to cooperative trial group studies and 0.8% to industry studies. Of these, 6,964 (76%) were enrolled on interventional studies and 2,241 (24%) on non-interventional studies. Future goals focus on increasing research in: 1) policy, allowing us to take advantage of health care policy initiatives; 2) molecular and genetic epidemiology and 3) patient outcomes, fostering more inter-programmatic research with clinicians."
"9381048","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Matthew J. Sikora began his research career during his undergraduate and graduate training in pharmacology at the University of Michigan. During this time, Dr. Sikora developed an interest in translational research that moves laboratory findings to clinical application. Also, he developed a passion for cancer research, and committed to a career in breast cancer research. During his post-doctoral training at the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Sikora began to study endocrine response and resistance in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), a poorly understood subtype of breast cancer. This research has allowed Dr. Sikora to develop his strengths in pharmacology and endocrine therapy, while also exploring his interest in individualized medicine and developing translational research projects. Dr. Sikora has been working toward the goal of becoming a principle investigator at a top-tier academic institution and comprehensive cancer center, with the ultimate goal of translating his research progress to improve cancer therapy and patient outcomes.     Training: This research project includes important training aspects that will both augment Dr. Sikora's current research strengths and allow him to differentiate himself from his mentor. The overall focus of the research project (described below) will provide Dr. Sikora with extensive experience in elucidating signal transduction pathways, which has not previously been a component of his training. This experience is critical in understanding and targeting mechanisms of therapeutic resistance. Additionally, his focus on Wnt signaling is a new area of research for his current mentor, Dr. Steffi Oesterreich. A co-mentorship with Dr. Caroline Alexander, an expert in Wnt signaling in the mammary gland, will provide a unique direction for Dr. Sikora's independent research career. This project will also utilize novel model systems that will allow Dr. Sikora to rapidly test therapeutic strategies directly in patient tumor tissue. Throgh collaboration with Dr. Karen Knudsen, Dr. Sikora will develop the ex vivo tissue culture model to assess the function of Wnt signaling inhibitors in patient-derived ILC tissues. The training in bot signal transduction and novel model systems, in conjunction with Dr. Sikora's unique background in pharmacology and endocrine therapies, will provide Dr. Sikora with a unique niche in breast cancer research that will allow him to impact patient care.     Research: The overall hypothesis of this project is that invasive lobular carcinoma cells utilize unique signaling pathways driven by WNT4 that represent putative targets to modulate endocrine response in ILC. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims: Aim 1: Identify the WNT4 receptor complex that regulates estrogen-induced growth in ILC cells. Wnt ligands bind and activate frizzled (FZD) receptors which subsequently activate dishevelled (DVL) proteins to initiate signaling; DVL proteins are also subject to direct inhibition. To identify the WNT4 receptor and associated proteins, we will use novel immunoprecipitation methods (IFAST) to identify protein-protein interactions among WNT4 and receptor proteins. This will couple with siRNA and small molecule inhibitors to identify receptor complex proteins necessary for estrogen-induced growth. Receptor complex activity will also be assessed in ex vivo cultures of cell line xenograft tumors as a novel 3D model of ILC. Aim 2: Identify the non-canonical WNT4 signaling cascade in ILC cells. A defining feature of ILC is loss of E-cadherin; uniquely in ILC cells, this also causes ?-catenin protein loss and dysfunction of canonical Wnt signaling. WNT4 likely utilizes novel non-canonical pathways in ILC. We will examine WNT4-mediated activation of signal transduction cascades using protein arrays. Additionally, we will define the specific transcriptional program downstream of WNT4 signaling via CRISPR-mediated knockout of the WNT4 gene and the ER binding site at the WNT4 locus. The role of non-canonical signaling in regulating ILC cell viability and proliferation will also be assessed in 3D models of ILC. Aim 3: Determine whether WNT4 drives estrogen-independence and endocrine resistance in ILC. This aim will initiate translation of this project toward clinical application. To examine the role of WNT4 signaling in endocrine resistance, we will use siRNA and WNT4 pathway inhibitors to target novel estrogen independent variants of ILC cell lines. Further, WNT4 pathway gene expression will be measured in ILC patient specimens with long-term follow-up data. Ex vivo cultures of patient-derived ILC tumor tissue will be used to identify therapeutic strategies that can effectively inhibit WNT4 signaling and improve endocrine response for ILC patients. ILC represents an understudied patient population, ideal for individualized therapies to improve patient outcomes. We hypothesize that targeting WNT4 and downstream signaling pathways will improve endocrine response in ILC cells. This project will elucidate previously uncharacterized pathways, and will identify putative targets for therapy to prevent or reverse endocrine resistance in ILC. By testing hypotheses in novel models, archival patient samples, and patient-derived tissues, this project will rapidly translate results to clinical application to ultimately improve ILC patient outcomes."

"9110049","Jak, Amy: Novel White Matter Imaging to Improve Diagnosis of Mild TBI Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also knows as a concussion, is prevalent in military personnel and has been deemed the ?signature injury? of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cognitive complaints, headaches, nausea, and dizziness, among others, are common and expected symptoms following mTBI. These symptoms resolve within 7-10 days in most individuals, though 90 days is often referenced as the duration of ?normal? recovery after a mild TBI. However, 15-30% of individuals do not recover along this timeline and experience persistent post-concussive symptoms. Psychological factors have been shown to play a substantial role in the persistence of post-concussive symptoms beyond 90 days. Because post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is also highly prevalent in combat Veterans and highly comorbid with mTBI in this population, it has been difficult to tease apart the etiology of persistent cognitive symptoms in the comorbid group and determine if remote history of concussion is contributing to current behavioral symptoms or if the presentation is driven by mental health factors. Traditional structural neuroimaging techniques are largely insensitive to the subtle damage resulting from mTBI. Newer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition methods such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) have shown more promise in identifying changes in white matter integrity following mTBI. However, even this advanced technology produces equivocal results, has revealed changes in white matter integrity in both mTBI and PTSD, and lacks the sensitivity or specificity to identify the underlying cause of any white matter changes. This proposal, therefore, will utilize a new approach for assessment specifically of myelin abnormalities, multicomponent-driven equilibrium single-pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT), to calculate myelin volume in vivo. We propose to conduct neuroimaging using standard structural and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as well as mcDESPOT on 82 Veterans with a history of mTBI, PTSD, or both, as well as controls. We will also serve as a coordinating site for post-processing and analysis of mcDESPOT data collected at other consortium sites. We hypothesize that mcDESPOT will be more sensitive and specific to mTBI than DTI and persistent cognitive symptoms in those with a history of mTBI will correlate more strongly with mcDESPOT findings. There have been no published reports using mcDESPOT in TBI and if this imaging sequence demonstrates improved sensitivity and specificity over current white matter imaging techniques, it could emerge as a way to disentangle TBI-related residual brain damage from mental health driven symptoms as well as to identify individuals who may be at higher risk for poor recovery after mTBI."
"9246912","PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) and the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) jointly propose the creation of a University of Texas Adult Clinical Center (UTACC) for the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC). We will integrate resources and combine our expertise to provide a state-of-the-art center for comprehensive studies on physical activity in adults. The Specific Aims of the UTACC are: 1) To participate in the planning of the multi-center trial; 2) To enroll 450 participants in the acute and chronic exercise training studies, conduct physiological assessments, and collect biospecimens (muscle, adipose, and blood); and 3) To analyze and interpret outcome data and disseminate findings to the scientific community. We will use innovative tools to maximize participant retention and enhance fidelity and adherence to the exercise training protocols. The UTACC will have a significant impact on the MoTrPAC ? and advance the field of exercise science ? based on our strengths, feasibility of the proposed study, and expected outcomes: The strengths of the UTACC include our long-track record of performing human studies on molecular transducers of exercise; shared resources and years of networking through the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center network and the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium; and our success with enrolling understudied populations such as older individuals and Hispanics-Latinos. The feasibility for the UTACC is high due to our experience with clinical trials on physical activity; our substantial expertise in collecting muscle and adipose biopsies in humans undergoing exercise studies; and our access to outstanding clinical research facilities in which to conduct human research in a safe environment. Expected outcomes of this program include the determination of baseline molecular signatures associated with metabolic health and physical performance; the integration of multi-omic data for the elucidation of molecular networks that control metabolic responses to exercise and how they influence physical performance; and discovery of novel mediators (proteins, metabolites, miRNAs) of the beneficial effects of exercise."
"9174842","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Central nervous system (CNS) injury and/or degeneration triggers numerous changes in gene expression, signaling and cellular interactions that result in permanent changes in tissue architecture and CNS function. Astrocytes respond to injury in a process referred to as reactive astrogliosis that includes both beneficial and ultimatey harmful functions. Cyclic-AMP (cAMP) has been demonstrated to play a significant role in regulating astrocyte physiology both during development and in response to injury. Recently, soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), a unique bicarbonate- and calcium-activated source of cAMP, was shown to play a role in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and axon growth. In astrocytes, sAC-mediated signaling underlies a major metabolic pathway that provides energy to neurons during ischemic-like conditions. Our and others' data suggest that sAC signaling in astrocytes is necessary for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and perhaps for regeneration after optic nerve injury. Based on our preliminary data, I hypothesize that astrocyte sAC is required for RGC survival and neurite patterning during development, and that sAC activity in astrocytes promotes RGCs survival and regeneration after optic nerve injury. To address this hypothesis, I will determine the levels of sAC expression in astrocytes during development and after ONC injury by immunofluorescence. To investigate astrocyte sAC in retinal development and reactive astrogliosis, I will use a floxed sAC allele to conditionally knock-out sAC in astrocytes at differnt developmental time points and after optic nerve injury to specifically measure the effect of astrocyte sAC on RGCs. The overall goal of this study is to better understand how astrocyte sAC influences reactive astrogliosis and neuronal survival and regeneration, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target."

"9184565","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The melanocortin receptors (MCRs) are G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) that modulate and control many critical physiological processes in animals including pigmentation, response to stress, feeding behavior, energy balance, sexual function and behavior, inflammatory response, cardiovascular function, immune response, pain and others. They also are involved in many of our most common degenerative diseases including adrenal dysfunction, obesity, anorexia, pigmentary disorders, sexual dysfunction, prolonged and neuropathic pain, inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular disease and others. Yet there are few compounds that have been developed and are pharmaceuticals in use for treatment of these diseases which are our most common and difficult to treat diseases. This grant is dedicated to developing more potent, receptor selective, and specific and most efficacious ligands for the melancortin 1(MCI), melanocortin 3 (MC3), melanocortin 4 (MC4), and melanocortin 5 (MC5) receptors. These novel ligands, which are biological stable and available for in vivo applications, will be useful for studying the pharmacology, physiology and medical applications of melanotropin ligands. The specific aims we will pursue include: 1) development and use of novel protein/peptide topologies and scaffolds, in conjunction with novel constrained amino acids, to design and synthesize novel orthosteric, allosteric, and biased melanotropin peptides and peptide mimetics with enhanced stability, bioavailability, selectivity and potency for the melanocortin receptors; 2a) to examine binding affinities, cyclic AMP production, efficacies, Ca+2 assays and assays for ?- arrestin. The novel ligands for the hMC1R, hMC3R, hMC4R and hMC5R receptors will be examined with special attention to the development of biased ligands; and 2b) use of novel selective ligands, especially those with biased activity, to explore novel physiological functions that can lead to novel drugs with our collaborators."
"9254870","Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the proposed project is to evaluate and commercialize a combination of proprietary magnet assemblies and magnetic nanoparticles that has been shown in small animal and cadaveric large animal and human studies to improve delivery of medications to the inner ear. Studies using the system (which uses magnetic forces to inject drug-eluting magnetic nano-particles into the inner ear) have successfully reduced the degree of hearing loss and tinnitus in rats due to acoustic trauma, and have conferred hearing protection against chemotherapy regimens in mice. The amount of drug reaching the inner ear was increased ten-fold and the drug distribution uniformity was increased three-fold, as compared to the current standard of trans-tympanic injection into the middle ear. Our strategy is to demonstrate the utility of the magnetic injection system as a platform technology addressing the $4 billion hearing market, starting with a compelling orphan indication (sudden sensorineural hearing loss) that is currently without a cure and is considered an otologic emergency. Subsequently, we shall address other cochlear conditions such as tinnitus and protection of hearing during chemotherapy regimens that are also not adequately addressed by the current standards-of-care. The FDA recommends testing in at least two mammalian species, the second of which should be a non-rodent mammal before entry into human trials. Based on successful Phase 1 results in rodents, and on reviewer suggestions, in Phase 2 we shall conduct large animal testing in sheep. Sheep are recognized to have a similar ear anatomy and hearing as compared to humans, and a common animal model submitted to the FDA. We aim to: Aim 1: Select sheep noise trauma conditions based on previously published data. Aim 2: Select dose and show therapeutic effect for noise-trauma-induced hearing loss in sheep. Aim 3: Conduct a detailed safety and toxicology study in healthy (no noise trauma) sheep. We anticipate that small (Phase 1) and large animal (Phase 2) safety and therapeutic effect data in animals will support an IND (Investigational New Drug) filing to the FDA. Approval of an IND by the FDA is required to allow entry into human clinical trials."
"9370091","Abstract The long-term goal of our research is to elucidate the neuroprotective mechanisms of 17E-Estradiol (E2) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and develop strategies for the discovery of suitable SERMs that can be used as neuroprotectants without risks of cancer for women or of feminizing effects for men. 17E- Estradiol (E2) has been shown to be neuroprotective in various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and Parkinson?s disease (PD). Some SERMs, including tamoxifen (TX), also possess neuroprotective properties in the experimental models of AD, PD and ischemia. Although the mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration are incompletely understood, impairment of astroglial glutamate transporters is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD as well as manganism (Mnism) caused by chronic exposure to manganese (Mn). Mn inhibits glutamate uptake and decreases glutamate transporter expression, which is vital in regulating extracellular glutamate levels. Though E2 appears to regulate astroglial glutamate transporter expression, the mechanism underlying E2 regulation remains elusive. Furthermore, TX and other SERMs, which are considered potentially therapeutically advantageous over E2 due to their lack or diminished negative side effects on the breast and uterus, unfortunately have not been examined to determine whether they exert potentially beneficial enhancement of astroglial glutamate transporter expression or activity, a deficit in the field that needs addressing. To address these gaps in our knowledge in this important area, we will use Manganism (Mnism) as an experimental model for impaired glutamate transporter-induced neurodegeneration, as Mn treatment is well established to induce impairment of glutamate transporters associated with neurotoxicity. Our central hypothesis is that E2 and TX can reverse Mn-induced inhibition of glutamate transporter activities by both modulation of transporter trafficking and by estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent expression of glutamate transporters via modulation of growth factors, in particular transforming growth factors (TGF)-D and TGF-E1. Our overall hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims: 1) whether E2/TX reverses Mn-induced glutamate transporter inhibition by enhancing activity, expression and trafficking of the transporters, 2)whether E2/TX effects on glutamate transporters are ER-subtype dependent, 3) whether TGF- D and TGF-E1 mediate ER-dependent E2/TX-reversal of Mn-induced inhibition of glutamate transporters, 4) whether E2/TX treatment leads to neuroprotection against Mn-induced neurotoxicity in vivo by enhancing glutamate transporters. Our studies will provide novel insights into the mechanism(s) underlying the neuroprotective role of E2/TX in the model of Mnism and will offer potential insights into novel targets for treatment of a wide array of neurodegenerative disorders."
"8862439","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to develop a new, multifaceted education and training program in patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR). Set in the medically underserved community of the Bronx, it represents a partnership between the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (a research-intensive medical school), which will develop and deliver this educational program, and Montefiore Medical Center (a community-oriented academic medical center and primary-care-focused healthcare delivery system), whose clinicians will be trained as researchers. The program will have 3 distinct but connected components: an educational program in the fundamental methodologies of PCOR, leading to a Certificate; an advanced learning collaborative, where faculty and students learn, develop, and debate advanced and emerging PCOR methodologies; and an experiential short-term fellowship based at Montefiore's care management company, CMO, where selected, highly motivated PCOR Certificate graduates will get hands-on PCOR experience under close and expert supervision. This program plays to the strengths of Einstein's teaching and research faculty, and to Montefiore's leadership in delivering high-quality, cost-effective care in a diverse and economically disadvantaged inner-city setting. The program will maintain an innovative focus on engagement (of patients, communities, payers, and other 'stakeholders') and on dissemination and implementation of research findings. One aspect of community engagement will be the requirement that fellows obtain consultation from a community research review board as they develop their research projects. The entire program will be evaluated carefully under the aegis of an independent evaluation unit examining both process and outcomes. These evaluation data will be presented to an executive committee (overseeing the program's day-to-day operations) and an advisory committee (a panel providing expert guidance on an annual basis), and the program will be revised as needed, in accordance with these findings. Through this program, we will imbue a cadre of clinicians from different health professions with knowledge and skills in PCOR. Graduates of our Certificate in Patient-Centered Outcomes Research will use what they learn to advance evidence-based clinical practice, to advocate for evidence-based healthcare improvement, and to meaningfully contribute to multidisciplinary PCOR teams. Those who complete our fellowship will go on to lead PCOR teams and enhance the PCOR workforce.

"9049999","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a severe disorder that affects 3-7% of all pregnancies. It is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia is characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation. Left untreated, it can lead to maternal seizures, multi-organ failure, and death. Delivery is the only cure, which often necessitates preterm birth. Despite extensive investigation, the etiology of preeclampsia is poorly understood. Improved understanding of the disease could significantly improve clinical care for pregnant women. Recently metabolomics (i.e., metabolic profiling, meaning the examination of cellular metabolites such as sugars, amino acids, organic acids, nucleotides, and lipids) has emerged as a promising technique for understanding complex diseases, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. This approach is also useful for understanding disorders of pregnancy, since maternal metabolites represent the output of a network of interactions between maternal, fetal, and placental compartments. Initial metabolic profiling experiments in women with preeclampsia have demonstrated altered metabolites; however, these studies have significant limitations. Specifically, (1) the metabolic signatures reported in women with preeclampsia have been unique in each study; (2) subgroups of women with preeclampsia have been analyzed together (i.e., those with early- and late-onset disease); (3) only one time point in gestation has been analyzed in each study; (4) urine analysis is lacking from most studies. We propose here the first longitudinal, global metabolic profiling of both maternal plasma and urine in each trimester of pregnancy in women who developed early-onset preeclampsia (requiring delivery prior to 37 weeks). The samples for this analysis are already banked and ready for use. The cohort includes 2105 total women, 56 of whom developed early-onset preeclampsia. We will characterize the global metabolic profile in maternal blood and urine in women with early-onset preeclampsia and matched controls using well-established liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy platforms. Changes in metabolites will be analyzed between trimesters for each patient. Additionally, differences in metabolites between preeclamptics and matched controls will be analyzed by trimester. We will then assess if the metabolic phenotype can identify subgroups of patients based on their clinical phenotypes with a focus on gestational age at delivery, infant birth weight, and abnormal laboratory studies. These experiments will define the metabolic profile throughout pregnancy in women who develop early-onset preeclampsia and will enhance our understanding of pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. Ultimately, this knowledge has the potential to lead to new predictive tests and treatments for preeclampsia."
"9045660","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a rare (1 in 770,000) autosomal recessive genetic disease with clinical signs apparent in early childhood. It is characterized by insulin-dependent diabetes, followed by optic nerve atrophy, vision loss, hearing loss, diabetes insipidus and neurodegeneration, resulting in death in middle adulthood, typically due to brainstem atrophy-induced respiratory failure. There currently are no treatments that slow or stop this devastating deterioration. However, much is known about the mechanisms underlying these effects. The causative gene (WFS1) was identified by our group in 1998, and a number of loss-of-function mutations have been described. Cell and animal models have determined that WFS1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-embedded protein called wolframin and that mutations lead to disturbances of ER calcium homeostasis, driving ER stress-mediated apoptosis. This process kills insulin producing pancreatic ?-cells, leading to diabetes, and is thought to underlie the striking neurodegeneration in WFS. Work in animal models of WFS is progressing rapidly towards the identification of viable interventions for this process. Neurological features of the disease may be the most feasible to target and monitor in clinical trials, due to the fact that ?-cell loss in the pancreas has already occurred by the time  patient is diagnosed with WFS. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of information on the pattern of neurodegeneration associated with WFS, particularly in the early stages of the disease. Thus, the goal of the current proposal is to determine the pattern of early neurodegenerative changes in WFS. We will perform cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments of youth with WFS, targeting sensitive neural systems with quantified neuroimaging and behavioral measures. In addition, we will establish the utility of a WFS severity rating scale (WFS Unified Rating Scale or WURS). Preliminary data support the feasibility of this approach and its potential to generate important new information about neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative patterns in WFS. This work is necessary to position the field for future clinical trials to test interventions for WS neurodegeneration. Ultimately, a better understanding of the trajectory of neurodegeneration in WFS and the development of effective interventions may be relevant to other more common neurodegenerative and endocrine (Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes) diseases in which ER stress has been implicated."
"9136784","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a slowly progressing multifactorial disease involving genetic ab- normalities and environmental insults. AMD is the leading cause of blindness for Americans over age sixty. As the population ages, the prevalence of AMD will continue to grow, reaching a maximum risk rate of ~30% at age 75. Since smoking significantly increases the risk of AMD and there is a 20% higher incidence of smoking in veterans than in the general U.S. adult civilian population, the VA system will have to provide care for poten- tially up to 7 millio or more AMD cases. Current available treatments focus on the late stage of the disease (choroidal neovascularization; CNV); however, those come with significant risks and only target subpopulations of AMD patients. No treatment is available for early AMD (>85% of all cases). Thus it is paramount that we learn on how to detect AMD early and develop treatments that allow for early disease prevention. While mech- anistic studies have shown that inflammation and smoking are fundamental components of both forms of AMD, genetic studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms in different complement proteins each increase the risk for developing AMD. One of the most detrimental mutations occurs in factor H (fH) an essential inhibitor in the alternative pathway (AP) of the complement cascade. Overall, it has been hypothesized that inadequate con- trol of complement-driven inflammation may be a major factor in disease pathogenesis in AMD. A recent clini- cal trial (Genentech; lampalizumab blocking an activator of the AP), supports the hypothesis that the AP is a critical target in AMD. We have established that complement, and in particular AP activity is involved in differ- ent mouse models of AMD, including smoke-induced ocular pathology and laser-induced CNV. Finally, we have generated a targetable CFH, CR2-fH. CR2-fH uses the Complement Receptor 2 domain to specifically target factor H to sites of complement activation. The CR2 domain ensures targeting to membranes without relying on the endogenous ligand-binding domains present in CFH that harbor some of the genetic mutations. We have demonstrated efficacy in vitro and in vivo for reducing AP-dependent pathology using CR2-fH. One of the limitations of protein-based therapeutics is delivery. For short-term treatments, intravitreal injections are used for long-term treatments, other avenues need to be explored. Here we wish to test two therapeutic strat- egies in models of AMD: delivery of CR2-fH using AAV vector therapy using both preventative and therapeutic applications. Here we will be guided by our overall hypothesis that pathologic activation of the AP of comple- ment injures the RPE, and ultimately leads to the development of AMD. We further hypothesize that long-term delivery of the alternative pathway inhibitor CFH will provide an effective therapy for AMD."
"9146168","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental illness associated with devastating symptoms that are difficult to treat due to incomplete understanding of SCZ pathophysiology. Emerging genetic and post-mortem SCZ studies have revealed altered neurochemistry and implicated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. However, it remains unknown how NMDAR dysfunction differentially impacts excitatory (E) vs. inhibitory (I) neurons, which both express NMDARs and may produce neural deficits in SCZ through contrasting mechanisms. In parallel, non-invasive neuroimaging studies have repeatedly identified severe neural deficits during cognitive performance and during task-free resting state. However, it remains unknown if the same underlying synaptic mechanisms can link neuroimaging findings across cognitive states and task-free states. Providing this unification is vital to bridge mechanistic knowledge gaps regarding neural states in SCZ. Findings from our recently published resting-state neuroimaging study identified increased global brain signal variability in SCZ, which we reproduced in silico, using a biologically-plausible computational model of large- scale neural systems, by perturbing E/I balance - an effect expected to occur as a consequence of NMDAR dysfunction. These observations established a parsimonious link between a computationally modeled synaptic mechanism and network-level neuroimaging findings in SCZ. Based on this effect, we hypothesized that cellular-level dysfunction in SCZ may map onto key dependent measures that are quantifiable via state-of-the- art neuroimaging across cognitive states in SCZ. This research proposal is designed to test this hypothesis via two specific aims. The first aim will extend our published model in three major ways: (i) we will explicitly model E and I neural population effects separately, to dissociate E vs. I dysfunction; (i) we will expand the model to include simulations of a cognitive task-state, allowing for a unified framework capturing cellular-level dysfunction across baseline and cognitively-active states; (iii)  we will implement functional differentiation across model nodes. Thus, the model will explicitly translate biophysically plausible large-scale neuronal dynamics to simulated neuroimaging data, allowing explicit neuroimaging features to be linked to focused synaptic perturbations. The objective of the second aim is to utilize new data from an ongoing task-based and resting-state study of SCZ with matched healthy subjects, allowing for empirical neuroimaging validation of modeling predictions across mental states. We will explicitly quantify dependent neuroimaging measures predicted by the model (Aim 1) to reflect distinct cellular-level dysfunction in SCZ. Critically, the proposed dependent measures (signal variance and covariance) will be assessed in parallel across the model and empirical data, allowing for concurrent progress across both aims. This project, if successful, can help elucidate cell-specific mechanisms of synaptic deficits  in SCZ, directly informing neuroimaging marker development and ultimately guiding targeted treatment toward underlying sources of SCZ neuropathology."

"9180053","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fusion genes are common chromosomal aberrations in many cancers, and can be used as prognostic markers and drug targets in clinical practice. By using whole transcriptome sequencing, we and others [1, 2] have discovered FGFR3-TACC3 fusions in glioblastoma (GBM) at a recurrence rate of up to 8.3%. The fusion, caused by a tandem duplication event on 4p16.3, promoted cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. Overexpression of the fusion in astrocytes lead to cellular aneuploidy [1], however the mechanisms facilitating aberrant chromosomal segregation remain to be elucidated. FGFR3-TACC3 fusion positive cells exhibited higher sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor U0126 or pan FGFR inhibitor PD173074 but were more resistant to the frontline GBM chemotherapy drug, Temozolomide (TMZ). Thus, our studies have identified a novel genetic alteration in GBM that is critical for at least two major hallmarks of this deadly disease: genomic instability and resistanc to chemotherapy. A recent report showed that the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion also occurs in bladder cancer [3]. Thus, the significance of this newly recognized genetic event is likely broad. We seek to further characterize this novel FGFR3-TACC3 oncogene. We hypothesize that the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion protein is a key genetic aberration that significantly modifies the signaling pathways during glioma development and progression contributing to the hallmarks of GBM. We plan to test our hypothesis by performing experiments that will determine the critical phosphorylation sites and domains within the fusion that promote tumor development, to determine the molecular mechanisms by which the fusion is resistant to temozolomide treatment, to determine the mechanisms by which the fusion promotes abnormal chromosomal segregation, and finally to determine the efficacy of current pharmacological inhibitors in treatin fusion containing tumors. We will use both in vitro and in vivo approaches to answer these questions."
"9180698","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cystic kidney diseases are characterized by hyperproliferation of normally quiescent renal epithelial cells, which profoundly alter the organ architecture and impair renal function over time. The slow accumulation of cysts throughout adult life highlights the progressive aspect of the disease and, in theory, provides a relatively large window of time to treat affected individuals. However, there are as yet no effective molecular therapies that successfully halt or slow disease progression. As such, understanding the underlying cellular and molecular defects that contribute to the disease progression is critica in developing an effective therapeutic strategy. The central problem addressed in the proposed research is to define how defects in the biogenesis and function of an essential microtubule-based organelle, the centrosome, contributes to the cystic transformation of renal epithelial cells. The centrosome, along with its associated structure the cilium, act together as a cellular signaling center to organize and regulate the activity of important developmental signaling pathways including Hedgehog, mTOR, Notch and Wnt, among others. Mutations in proteins that localize and function through the centrosome-cilium complex cause human disease conditions termed ciliopathies, which include polycystic kidney disease and nephronophthisis. Recent studies have noted the presence of ectopic centrosomal structures (meaning too many centrosomes per cell) in renal epithelial cells isolated from patients and animal models of polycystic kidney disease. Surprisingly, this phenotype has been mostly ignored, and considered a potential secondary effect of cystic cell transformation and proliferation. However, we believe that abnormal centrosome biogenesis may play an important causal role in the pathogenesis of the disease, and our preliminary data support this theory. We recently demonstrated that the formation of ectopic centrosomes in kidney epithelial cells results in aberrant ciliary signaling, disrupted epithelial cell polarity, migration, and division. These are characteristic of cellular transformations that occur during cyst formation and progression, and suggest a potentially novel mechanism (the formation of ectopic centrosomes) by which cystogenesis may occur. In addition, using novel genetic mouse models with which we can alter centrosome biogenesis in vivo we show, for the first time, that the formation of ectopic centrosomes indeed leads to rapid cystogenesis. This exciting discovery supports our hypothesis that ectopic centrosome biogenesis alone is sufficient to trigger cyst formation and growth, even in the absence of mutations in cystic genes. The proposed experiments will determine the mechanism(s) by which aberrant centrosome biogenesis leads to the development and growth of renal cysts in vivo, and test whether inhibiting the formation of these ectopic centrosomes can halt or slow cystogenesis. These studies will help in understanding the fundamental cellular events that trigger cystogenesis, and characterize a potentially new therapeutic target for treatment of cystic kidney disease."
"9186473","The pathological consequences of ethanol dependence that involve adaptations of  GABA-A receptors include heightened CNS excitability, seizures, tremor, anxiety, and cognitive deficits. We  have shown that the GABA-A receptor adaptations involved are dependent upon PKC gamma and  moderated by protein kinase A (PKA). The goal of this project is to systematically delineate the protective  role of PKA in ethanol dependence pethology mediated by GABA-A receptors and to determine the cellular  localization of GABA-A receptor adaptations in cortical circuits. The first aim will examine PKA regulation of  GABA-A receptor trafficking and synaptic function in cultured cortical neurons. We will investigate whether  pharmacological activation of PKA or inhibition using siRNA alters ethanol-induced internalization of GABA-A  al receptors and increased surface expression of a4 receptors. The second aim will determine if PKA  modulates the ethanol dependence phenotypes of GABA-A receptor trafficking, increased seizure  susceptibility or withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior in vivo. PKARlip mutant mice (PKARlip-/-) will be  utilized since they exhibit complete loss of PKARlip expression and 50% loss of the A kinase anchoring  protein (AKAP150), producing phenotypes with GABA-A receptor dysfunction. We will examine receptor  surface expression, seizure thresholds and withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. The final aim will  identify the cortical neurons that exhibit ethanol-induced alterations in the trafficking and function of GABA-A  al and a4 receptors and test their sensitivity to PKA activity. We plan to determine the effects of chronic  ethanol exposure on GABA-A al and a4 receptors using specific markers for GABAergic interneurons  (parvalbumin) or pyramidal projection neurons (Cam Kinase II) via dual label confocal microscopy.  Electrophysiological responses will be determined by voltage clamp recording within slices and the effects of  PKA activation will be determined in these cells. These studies will delineate the role of PKA in GABA-A  receptor adaptations associated with ethanol dependence and identify intracortical pathology that results  from GABA-A receptor adaptations to chronic ethanol exposure. This work will elucidate specific targets for  reversal of ethanol dependence pathopathology."

"9186558","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular mechanisms that control unremitting lung fibrosis remain poorly understood, resulting in the unfortunate fact that targeted therapies for pulmonary fibrosis are lacking. This proposal focuses on elucidating the roles of ?rrestins (?r1 and ?r2) in regulating lung injury and fibrosis and to determining the feasibility that targeting ?rrestins as a novel therapeutic approach for lung fibrosis. Progressinve lung injury and fibrosis is a cause of major morbidity and mortality as in the case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We have demonstrated the roles of extracellular matrix (ECM), innate immune, and chemokine receptors in regulating lung injury and fibrosis. We recently identified that ?r1 and ?r2 play a role in fibrogenesis by regulating fibroblast invasiveness. ?rrestins are adaptor proteins for G-protein coupled receptors, some of which have been suggested to play a key role in lung fibrogenesis. One of the pathologic hallmarks of IPF is the destruction of basement membrane. In the bleomycin-induced mouse lung fibrosis model, loss of either ?r1 or ?r2 results in protection from mortality, inhibition of matrix deposition, and protected lung function. However, isolated lung fibroblasts from bleomycin-treated ?rrestin null mice fail to invade ECM while displaying altered expression of genes involved in matrix production and degradation. These data implicate ?rrestins as mediators of fibroblast invasion and development of pulmonary fibrosis, thus representing a potential target for therapeutic intervention for patients with IPF. Our data further showed that genes related to basement membrane degradation and cell-matrix adhesion were altered in ?rrestin deficient fibroblasts. Interestingly, ALL 13 these genes are regulated by transcription factor MyoD, 12 by oncogene Maf. Both MyoD and Maf have been shown to play a key role in cell differentiation by promoting cell cycle arrest. Our data suggest that MyoD and Maf interact with ?rs and regulate fibroblast invasion. Based on these data we have generated the hypothesis that (1) progressive lung fibrosis requires the the presence of ?rrestins and (2) ?rrestins complex with transcription factors MyoD and Maf leading to the development of a pathogenic fibroblast phenotype that invades tissue and transmits signals from the ECM to fibroblasts. We will test this hypothesis to determine the roles of ?rrestins of different cell types in regulating lung fibrosis; determine te role of MyoD-Maf in regulating ?r2-mediated fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis, as well as investigate the effect of the blockage of ?rrestin signaling on pulmonary fibrosis."
"9186561","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Clinical Problem: 10% of all children born in the United States suffer from preterm birth and 10% of these develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease associated with significant respiratory complications that continue into adulthood. BPD results from a disruption in pulmonary vascular and alveolar growth. Epidemiological studies have shown that maternal complications of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), increase the risk for BPD. However, the mechanisms through which maternal complications of pregnancy lead to more severe BPD are unclear. We speculate that maternal complications of pregnancy disrupt angiogenesis in preterm newborns resulting in more severe BPD. The Candidate: I am an assistant professor in the Department of Pediatrics and board certified in pediatric pulmonary medicine. As an NIH K12 award recipient, I performed basic science research in endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) biology and became proficient in EPC isolation and characterization. My past studies demonstrated that EPCs from preterm infants are highly proliferative and uniquely susceptible to oxidative stress. I then showed that cord blood EPCs are decreased in preterm infants who later develop BPD. These findings inspired my current research interest, to utilize advanced biostatistical methods to link epidemiological risk factors for BPD with angiogenic biomarkers to suggest mechanisms of BPD pathogenesis and identify those preterm infants at greatest risk. I have described a focused career development plan that will enable me to independently conduct clinical-translational research. This K23 Career Development Award application will provide three years of critical support so that I may achieve my short-term goals: 1. To learn state-of-the-art quantitative applied biostatistical methods.  2. To apply statistical mediation analysis to test my specific hypothesis. This will enable me to attain my long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician scientist who will effectively translate mechanistic basic studies in pulmonary vascular development into new insights regarding the pathogenesis and potential treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). During the second year of this award period, I will submit my first R01 application concerning angiogenic biomarkers and BPD outcomes in childhood. The Research: Based on the current literature and our preliminary data, the central hypothesis to this proposal is that maternal complications of pregnancy alter angiogenic biomarkers in preterm infants suggesting a disruption in EPC- mediated angiogenesis that results in severe BPD. In this study, we will utilize an integrated translational approach to connect epidemiological risk factors for BPD with novel mechanistic biomarkers and longitudinal assessments of BPD severity in a well-characterized cohort of mothers and their preterm newborns. To test the hypothesis above, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: To determine whether specific maternal complications of pregnancy are associated with altered cord blood angiogenic biomarkers. We will test the hypothesis that antenatal complications of pregnancy decrease cord blood angiogenic biomarkers (ECFCs, CPC:non-CPC, angiogenic cytokines), disrupt ECFC function in vitro, and increase endothelial microparticles, an independent marker of vascular injury, providing further evidence that angiogenesis is disrupted in the lungs of preterm infants who develop BPD. Aim 2: To determine whether peripheral blood angiogenic biomarkers are associated with BPD severity during the first year of life. We will test the hypothesis that circulating ECFCs are decreased and ECFC function is disrupted in preterm infants who develop severe BPD with chronic hypoxemia, hospital readmissions/ED visits, and pulmonary hypertension by echocardiography during early life. Aim 3: To perform statistical mediation analysis to determine whether BPD is associated with maternal complications of pregnancy through impaired angiogenesis as suggested by angiogenic biomarkers. We will utilize novel biostatistical methods to test the hypothesis that maternal complications of pregnancy are associated with BPD through disrupted angiogenesis in preterm infants. This research plan represents the logical next step for my research. As I perform the outpatient follow-up visits, I will have direct interaction with the study participants The Environment: As described in this proposal and the letters of support, I have strong multidisciplinary mentorship by established investigators (from the Departments of Pediatrics in the University of Colorado School of Medicine, the Colorado School of Public Health, and the Colorado Clinical Translational Sciences Institute). My mentoring team has extensive experience in clinical translational research and a strong track record of prior successful mentorship. This environment has enabled me to develop the skills needed to perform the angiogenic assays, to develop a clinical database, and will ensure the success of this proposal to prepare me for independent research."
"9187803","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide a unique source of stem cells that have the potential to differentiate into any cell type o the body, including retinal ganglion cells. Furthermore, when derived from a patient's own somatic cells, they have the potential to faithfully serve as a model system of glaucoma. Previously, we have shown the ability to derive various retinal cell types including retinal ganglion cells from hiPSCs. In the current proposal, hiPSCs will be derived from patients with normal-tension primary open angle glaucoma, which would constitute a source of cells with a high predisposition to retinal ganglion cell damage. Conversely, wild type hiPSCs will be utilized as a point of comparison which would have a greater resistance to glaucomatous injury. The comparison of retinal ganglion cells derived from these two sources will allow for the identification of factors contributing to glaucoma-related symptoms. To test this hypothesis, retinal ganglion cells derived from both sources will be examined for the accumulation of reactive oxygen species characteristic of a glaucomatous condition, both under control conditions as well as after exposure to environmental stressors such as hydrogen peroxide. Viability of these cells will also be tested through the use of apoptotic assays to identify differences between the two populations. It is expected that such stressors will result in increased apoptotic activity in those cells derived from glaucoma patients compared with those derived from ocular hypertension sources. Additionally, the role of astrocytes in the progression of a glaucomatous phenotype will be tested. Astrocytes will be derived from patient-specific hiPSCs and co-cultured with retinal ganglion cells. Analysis will be performed to determine the extent of astrocyte contribution to the glaucoma disease phenotype. The successful completion of the aims of this proposal will establish patient-specific hiPSC- derived retinal ganglion cells s a valuable model system for studies of glaucoma, and will also serve as a significant basis upon which to design new pharmaceuticals for the treatment of this disease."
"9188085","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is mounting evidence that diabetes mellitus affects retinal neurons before abnormalities of the retinal vasculature are apparent clinically. However, relatively little is known about these neural deficits and how they affect visual function in diabetic patients who have minimal or no clinically-apparent diabetic retinopathy (M/N DR). The objective of this proposal is to develop and apply novel approaches for characterizing the nature and extent of visual dysfunction and its potential relationship to neural processes in M/N DR patients. Achieving this objective will provide important new insight into neural dysfunction in patients who have M/N DR and will establish new tests that are capable of classifying patients who have not yet developed clinically- apparent retinopathy, a group that cannot be staged or subtyped according to standard scales. This new insight and the ability to subtype these patients would be of great use in clinical trials that aim to slow or prevent neurodegeneration. Three complementary aims are proposed that use imaging, psychophysical, and electrophysiological techniques to provide new views of retinal function and structure in M/N DR patients and to address important questions generated by our preliminary investigations: Aim 1 will determine the relationship between contrast sensitivity deficits and retinal structure in M/N DR patients by simultaneously acquiring microperimetric contrast sensitivity measurements and optical coherence tomography measurements. Aim 2 will identify the mechanisms underlying electrophysiological abnormalities in these patients by measuring the electroretinogram (ERG) using standard full-field brief flashes of light, contrast- modulated sinewave flicker, focal maculr ERGs, and multi-focal ERGs. This comprehensive battery of electrophysiological tests will be used to challenge common assumptions regarding the sites of disease action that underlie ERG abnormalities. Aim 3 will measure and model contrast sensitivity deficits in diabetic patients who have M/N DR using a visual-luminance-noise-based paradigm that will provide insight into sites and mechanisms of disease action. After accomplishing these aims, we will have: 1) established clinically-applicable approaches to vision assessment that can quantify neural abnormalities in diabetic patients who have M/N DR; 2) gained new insight into the sites and mechanisms that underlie impairments in visual function in these patients. This line of study is particularly important and timely as new therapeutic approaches for treating early- stage retinopathy are being investigated, but the tools that are currently available to subtype patients and evaluate therapeutic efficacy lag behind."
"9197649","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are defined by their unique ability to differentiate into all mature blood cell lineages while at the same time regenerating themselves, in a process termed self-renewal, to sustain hematopoiesis throughout mammalian life. A model explaining the nature of HSC divisions proposes that the mode of a division of a stem cell (symmetric versus asymmetric) may determine the cell fate of the resulting two daughter cells, with a symmetric division resulting in daughter cells with simila regenerative potential and an asymmetric division leading to daughter cells with a dissimilar potential. Terminologies like polarity and division symmetry have already been previously discussed in other stem cell systems, including hematopoiesis. The molecular mechanisms of the triad HSC polarity - division symmetry - cell fate though has eluded the HSC field to date and which factors instruct this process is not known. The markers of polarity associated with division asymmetry are also ill-defined. We propose to investigate a molecular link, i.e. Cdc42 activity, in the stem cell polarity - mode of division - cell fate relationship. A new concept that Cdc42 activity and cell polarity represent a dial-able threshold in a bell shaped manner in determining stem cell fate (i.e. high and low Cdc42 activity could both cause a loss of polarity and affect the mode of the cell division and fate), is proposed. A rigorous examination of the influence of Cdc42 mediated polarity/apolarity on the mode of stem cell division and daughter cell fate will strongly benefit the stem cell field and will impact the therapy of blood diseases such as bone marrow failure and aging. We propose three specific aims: First, we will examine the potentially causal relationship between cell polarity and the mode of HSC division by a series of in vitro and in vivo cell polarization and division symmetry analysis at single cell resolution. Second, we will define the role of Cdc42 in regulating the ratio between polar and apolar HSCs and consequently the cell fate. Third, we will determine the signaling pathway from HSC polarity into divisional asymmetry by examining non-canonical Wnt5a regulated Cdc42 activity and subsequent actomyosin and JNK/p38 signaling in polarity and division symmetry of HSCs. The studies will use state of the art immunofluorescence, chemical biology, mouse genetics, and stem cell methodologies like single cell transplants to define the molecular basis of cell polarity and divisional symmetry and their causal role in determining HSC cell fate."

"9188472","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a worldwide leading cause of heart attacks, death and disability, and leads to billions of dollars of healthcar expenditures each year. Clinically, a widely effective interventional treatment for CAD is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using coronary metal stents. Over 1 million coronary stents are placed annually in the US alone. Yet, two complications can limit the benefit of coronary stents: restenosis (scarring), and thrombosis (clotting). Prevention of plaque progression and stent complications would eliminate hundreds of thousands of invasive catheterizations, heart attacks, and deaths each year.  Biologically, inflammation underlies all of these diseases: atherosclerosis, stent restenosis, and stent thrombosis. Yet the in vivo mechanisms by which inflammation drives plaques progression and the injury response to stenting remains poorly understood. The ability to quantitatively image inflammation in vivo, especially with translatable technology, could provide clinically relevant, vital new insights into these disorders. To address this unmet need, our laboratory is developing coronary artery-targeted intravascular near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) molecular imaging approaches to image and quantify arterial inflammation and stent healing. Most recently we have developed an early-stage intravascular NIRF-optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI, Nature Medicine 2011; 17:1680-4) system to quantitatively image molecular signals in the context of arterial structure.  The objective of this Proposal is to develop translatable intravascular NIRF-OFDI molecular-microstructural imaging approaches to better understand mechanisms of plaque progression and stent complications. This Proposal tests the central hypothesis that integrated NIRF-OFDI will comprehensively assess the role of in vivo inflammation in driving plaque progression, stent restenosis, and stent thrombosis. Our long-term goal is to assess inflammatory mechanisms in human coronary arteries and to ultimately reduce the immense burden of CAD and stent complications. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: Specific Aim 1. To engineer a next-generation intravascular NIRF-OFDI 2.9F catheter system. Specific Aim 2. To determine how plaque inflammation modulates atheroma progression and stent restenosis. Specific Aim 3. To determine how plaque inflammation modulates stent healing and risk of stent thrombosis. This research will transform the field of atherosclerosis and coronary stenting by (1) providing new, valuable pathobiological knowledge about the role of inflammation in regulating atheroma progression, restenosis, and stent malhealing; and (2) provide translatable strategies for inflammation-structural imaging, to ultimately improve the outcomes of patients with CAD and those undergoing coronary stenting."
"9195011","Alzheimer?s Disease Viewed as a Neurovascular Inflammatory Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder lacking effective treatments. Most clinical trials testing the long-standing amyloid hypothesis of AD have shown little promise. The future of novel treatments targeting other pathophysiological processes in the disease is uncertain. Growing evidence supports a role for neurovascular inflammation as a major causative or exacerbating factor in AD onset and progression. However, the scientific community has yet to label AD a vascular disease and questions remain about the viability of neurovascular inflammation as a potential therapeutic target. To address this controversy head-on, the New York Academy of Sciences will present a 1-day symposium and simulcast Webinar, ?Alzheimer?s Disease Viewed as a Neurovascular Inflammatory Disorder? on 12/6/2016. The goal of this symposium is to evaluate clinical and preclinical data investigating the role of neurovascular pathology in the development of AD. Critical barriers to understanding how to clinically test vascular-based hypotheses for the treatment of AD will be discussed, including recent imaging advances for monitoring disease progression. Moreover, emerging science on molecular and physiological processes that can be leveraged as targets for novel therapeutics will be presented. This symposium will fill an important gap in the conference landscape, presenting a focused, in-depth discussion on the synergies between AD and vascular disease research, building upon the recently defined need to better understand neurovascular dysregulation in AD and vascular dementia (36). This landmark event will unite 200 in-person basic, translational, and clinical researchers ? along with a global audience of Webinar participants ? from academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations, working on neurodegenerative disorders and vascular disease in an effort to understand, prevent, and treat AD and vascular dementias such as small vessel disease (SVD). Sessions will address 5 central aims: (i) Elucidate the relationship between genetic information and neurovascular pathology in AD and SVD; (ii) Explore novel molecular targets and physiological processes critical to vascular function and CNS health, using human studies and animal models; (iii) Describe clinical aspects of neurovascular dysregulation and inflammation in AD and SVD and identify biomarkers for vascular-based mechanisms; (iv) Identify knowledge gaps and future research required for breakthroughs in prevention and treatment of AD; and (v) Showcase and encourage the participation of Early-Career, female, and Underrepresented Minority investigators via short talks, poster presentations and prizes, travel fellowships, and discounted registration. In addition, the NINDS? specific goal of disseminating information will be met through a simulcast Webinar and publication of an enduring open-access Academy eBriefing. A collaborative, multidisciplinary approach will be critical to meeting the urgent unmet need for AD patients. To that end, this event will consider new disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets for AD, from a broad range of perspectives."
"9213733","Project Summary A major effort in cancer research is focused on identifying genes directly responsible for promoting cancer progression (referred to here as ?drivers?). Perhaps nowhere is this need more acute than for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a notoriously aggressive disease without durable treatment options. Identifying PDAC drivers and understanding their mechanism-of-action is critically important, as this information could inform new PDAC diagnostics and therapeutics. To identify such PDAC drivers, we developed novel genetic screening technologies to identify genes found mutated in PDAC that functionally cooperate with KRAS, the major driver gene found in pancreatic cancer, to promote PDAC tumor development in mice. Our approach identified the NAD Kinase (NADK), which is known in other organisms to influence redox metabolic pathways that regulate cell growth and resistance to growth-related oxidative stress. Our preliminary results indicate that NADK activation robustly drives PDAC initiation and growth, and NADK depletion significantly decreases PDAC growth concomitant with high oxidative stress owning to changes in redox state. Recent work by others has demonstrated the importance of redox pathways such as the glutamine reprogramming pathway (GRP) in promoting and maintaining PDAC growth. We hypothesize that interplay between the GRP and NADK activity centrally influences redox state and PDAC growth. We further hypothesize that NADK represents a redox vulnerability, as inhibiting NADK in patient tumors would serve as a means to selectively kill PDAC cells or sensitize them to cancer chemotherapeutics. In Aim1 we will use a large panel of PDAC cell lines and tumors genetically modified to inducibly express or deplete NADK and GRP expression to evaluate their relative roles in influencing redox state, oxidative stress and PDAC growth in culture assays and mice. In addition, we will examine the combined effect of NADK depletion and gemcitabine, a first-line PDAC chemotherapy agent and inducer of oxidative stress, to determine whether adjuvant use of NADK inhibitors would synergize with gemcitabine to kill PDAC cells. Finally, we will measure relative levels of NADK protein and oxidative stress on clinically- and genomically-annotated PDAC patient tumors, work intended to correlate these markers with gemcitabine response to provide insight on NADK inhibitor responder (patient) identification. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the in vivo role of NADK and therapeutic potential of NADK inhibitors by employing a novel electroporation model that allows rapid and cost-effective NADK expression and depletion in the context of activated KRAS in the mouse pancreas. In addition, we will examine NADK?s role in PDAC development and maintenance of tumor redox state using a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC harboring a NADK conditional knockout allele. In the future, these models will also serve as a platform for testing additional chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., gemcitabine) in the context of targeted NADK depletion."
"9206159","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Local recurrence is the most common pattern of failure for retroperitoneal, abdominal, and pelvic (RAP) sarcomas. Despite a macroscopically complete resection, surgical margins are typically positive due to large tumor size and anatomic complexity, resulting in 5-year local recurrence rates of 50% to 90%. Mortality is due to locoregional rather than distant failure and therefore, strategies to improve survival must reduce locoregional failure rates. Trials evaluating perioperative and/or intraoperative external beam radiation therapy, single-dose hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy have failed to demonstrate benefit.  We recently developed a novel, flexible, tissue-conforming, biocompatible polymer film (Biomacromolecules, 2012, 13, 406-411) that can be placed intraoperatively over the entire tumor resection bed to slowly elute the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (Pax-films) locally and kill residual tumor cells. When utilized in our mouse surgical model of recurrent sarcoma, Pax-films markedly increased local tissue paclitaxel levels, avoided systemic toxicity, reduced locoregional recurrence rates, and improved overall survival without healing complications (Annals of Surgical Oncology, 2012, 19, 199-206.). Utilizing an organotypic in vitro culture method that preserves tumor architecture and microenvironment, enables pharmacodynamics profiling of a given tumor's response to chemotherapeutic drug delivery providing the means to predict which specific histologies, or potentially which specific patients, benefit the most from Pax-films. Lastly, we have established mouse xenograft models capable of rapid local tumor recurrence after surgery which allows us to evaluate efficacy of anti-neoplastic therapy against a variety of human sarcomas in vivo. With these skill sets and resources in hand, we can now address the following three specific aims:  SPECIFIC AIM 1: Investigate efficacy and pharmacodynamic profiling of the Pax-film response against resected patient-derived sarcomas in vitro.  SPECIFIC AIM 2: Define the pharmacodynamic profile and mechanism of action of Pax-films in the prevention of locoregional recurrence of human sarcoma xenografts in vivo.  SPECIFIC AIM 3: Assess safety, feasibility, and perioperative morbidity of Pax-film implantation in a pre- clinical large animal model of surgical resection. Successful completion of this proposal will answer the hypothesis that prolonged exposure to paclitaxel-loaded polymer films will: 1) reduce tumor cell viability in vitro for human-derived sarcoma cell lines and patient tumor samples as assessed via organotypic culture; 2) reduce locoregional recurrence rates and improve survival in mouse surgical models of human sarcoma; and 3) prove to be safe and feasible for locoregional drug delivery, achieving high local tissue drug levels with low systemic delivery, when implanted in a large animal along tissue planes and vital structures commonly exposed during clinical extirpative sarcoma surgery."
"9216153","ABSTRACT Epithelial barrier dysfunction has been implicated as central to initiation and propagation of allergic disease. Despite differences in location and histology, the epithelium of the skin, airway, and intestine commonly functions as a critical barrier against the environment, providing innate defense against pathogens and bridging innate and adaptive immune responses. Atopic march, high co-morbidities among allergic diseases, unity of mucosal responses in upper and lower airway allergic disease, and barrier defects in intact non-lesional skin of atopic dermatitis patients all point to a systemic aspect of allergy. However, systemic mechanisms that would drive common epithelial dysfunction in seemingly disparate allergic diseases remain elusive and are not well understood. By conducting comparative bioinformatics analysis of epithelial barriers in different diseases, we made striking preliminary observations about unexpected hormonal imbalances associated with epithelial dysfunction in allergy. In concordance with these findings, we detected significant changes in circulating levels of hormones in pediatric patients with asthma and eczema when compared to healthy controls, including a decrease in plasma levels of insulin and an increase in levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and growth hormone (GH). Strikingly, we found that hormone levels were equally altered in the plasma of food allergy patients avoiding trigger foods and not experiencing allergic inflammation, suggesting that hormonal changes may represent an overlooked but significant underlying component of allergic disease at the systemic level. Based on our preliminary findings, we formulated our central hypothesis that systemic changes in hormone levels promote regional dysfunction and remodeling of epithelial barriers in allergic disease. We propose to test this hypothesis with the following three specific aims: 1) to identify hormone-responsive genes and signaling networks in multiple allergic diseases, consistent with the concept of systemic pathogenesis, using a computational approach; 2) to determine whether systemic levels of hormones in allergic individuals are altered and correlate with tissue expression of hormone-responsive genes; and 3) to test whether hormonal imbalance promotes epithelial barrier dysfunction in absence of active inflammatory process, in organotypic epithelial cultures. Collectively, this study will investigate the connection between hormonal changes and epithelial dysfunction in asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy, which represents an entirely overlooked systemic aspect of these diseases that has potential to be transformative to the field of allergy."
"9218966","Abstract: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a lethal hematological malignancy for which standard therapy is rarely curative. We have developed a personalized AML vaccine in which patient derived leukemia cells are fused with autologous DCs such that a broad array of antigens are presented in the context of DC mediated costimulation. The vaccine effectively targets clonal diversity including the LSC compartment and induces responses against neoantigen targets generated from the patient specific mutational events. We are completing a phase II study in which patients with AML who achieve remission following standard therapy undergo serial vaccination with DC/AML fusions. Vaccination resulted in the dramatic expansion of AML specific lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Remarkably, despite a median age of 60 with predominant intermediate and high risk disease, 75% of patients remain in remission at a median of 4 years of follow up. The goals of the present study are to more fully examine the DCAML fusion vaccine and confirm these dramatic clinical findings in the context of a randomized trial design. A fundamental challenge to developing sustained anti-leukemia immunity and durable disease response is overcoming the immunosuppressive milieu by which tumor cells evade host immunity and re-introduce tolerance. In the present study, we will also examine the potential synergy of vaccine mediated T cell expansion with PDL1 blockade to prevent the reestablishment of tolerance. Each of the treatment arms will be assessed with respect to the expansion of T cells targeting whole AML cells, LSCs, and leukemia associated antigens. Based on analysis of the AML mutational events, a neo-antigen profile will be generated for each patient and their functional relevance will be interrogated by assessing the native immune response following exposure to the whole cell vaccine. To define biomarkers predictive of response, the immune landscape of the bone marrow microenvironment, presence of AML driver mutations, gene signature for LSCs and immunoregulatory pathways, and noncoding RNAs regulating antigen presentation and costimulation will be interrogated with respect to their correlation with immune response and clinical outcome."
"9222665","SUMMARY  Candidiasis is an opportunistic fungal infection that has high prevalence among immunocompromised individuals and is a common cause of neonatal bloodstream infections in premature infants. Candidiasis is a leading cause of fungal infections-related mortality in the neonatal intensive care unit. Candida albicans is the major fungal organism responsible for oral, cutaneous, genital and urinary tract infections, and systemic or disseminated disease with multi-organ involvement. The crude and attributable mortality rates associated with candidiasis and invasive candidal infections are very high. Despite antifungal treatment, 20% of infants who develop invasive candidiasis die, and neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in nearly 60% of survivors. Given the limited number of suitable and effective antifungal drugs, together with increasing resistance of the pathogens to azole antifungal agents culminate in the need for new antifungals. The development of therapeutic agents that have the ability to inhibit the biofilm formation and modulate inflammatory response can have major impact on the prevention and treatment of candidiasis.  In this R21/R33 RFA titled ?Discovery/Development of Novel Therapeutics for Eukaryotic Pathogens? we propose to discover and develop natural product based agents as novel antifungal therapeutics. We will utilize a coculture strategy by culturing Candida albicans with individual organisms from large, well characterized bacterial and fungal collections. The hypothesis is that by mimicking the natural competition between two organisms we will be able to trigger the biosynthesis of the silent secondary metabolism pathways that will be able to inhibit C. albicans growth. Because of the large number of coculture experiments during the initial R21 stage, we propose to use a recently developed microfluidic device to increase the output of these coculture experiments for the identification of lead compounds. In the R33 stage of the project we propose to optimize top hits from the R21 phase of the project by engineering the biosynthetic pathways of the natural products. The translational significance of this work is that it could lead to a novel pharmacological therapeutic to prevent or treat candidiasis in humans."
"9225857","Summary The classical Bordetella species are genetically related obligate respiratory pathogens of mammals. Bordetella pertussis is an obligate human pathogen and the agent of pertussis, which remains a serious endemic disease. Bordetella parapertussis causes whooping cough in humans and some strains infect sheep. Bordetella bronchiseptica infects a wide range of nonhuman mammals, although strains have been isolated from humans. A significant hindrance to preventing pertussis is the lack of knowledge of B. pertussis basic biology and metabolism in its natural human host environment. Most bacterial pathogens require nutritional iron and must overcome host-imposed iron restriction for successful in vivo growth. Classical Bordetella species require TonB-dependent uptake systems to use their native alcaligin siderophore, xenosiderophores, and hemin as iron sources. Inflammation increases vascular permeability, promoting extravasation of plasma components onto the respiratory epithelial surface where Bordetella cells colonize. Therefore, plasma iron-containing proteins such as transferrin or hemopexin may provide iron to Bordetella. Human serum can serve as a relevant surrogate for the host environment in Bordetella studies. Our results revealed that B. pertussis exhibits robust growth in iron-depleted medium containing complement-inactivated human serum as the sole source of iron. Conversely, B. bronchiseptica showed a profound growth defect in the same human serum-containing medium, and this defect was relieved by addition of iron. Studies with B. pertussis mutants lacking their native siderophore or heme receptors or TonB still retained the ability to grow in human serum, revealing an apparently novel iron uptake mechanism. This project will use genetic and biochemical approaches to characterize this B. pertussis iron acquisition mechanism and identify the bacterial components as well as human serum iron sources involved. Surveys of the ability of different Bordetella species and strains to grow in human serum will determine the breadth of this iron uptake system and correlate its presence with the organism's host range. The research is important since it will characterize a new iron uptake system that may also be a human host-specific trait of B. pertussis."
"9229849","PROJECT SUMMARY Recent evidence indicates that endothelial cell via angiocrine factors promote tumor growth and metastasis. Understanding how excessive amount of angiocrine factors are produced and how they influence tumor development might unveil novel targets for therapies. Our exciting preliminary data demonstrates Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1), a tumor suppressor gene, regulates Neuropilin (NRP)-1 and VEGF, suggesting that LKB1 may be a central mediator of angiogenesis and tumor growth through its inhibitory function on NRP-1 and VEGF. The central hypothesis of this application is that LKB1 in both ECs and tumor cells down-regulates NRP-1 and other pro-angiogenic factors (PDGF & FGFR) while inhibiting Sp1-induced VEGF transcriptional activation thereby maintaining a state of suppressed angiogenesis and tumor growth. There are three interrelated aims to validate or to refute this hypothesis. Aim 1 is to establish if LKB1 leads to decreased VEGF expression through impeding transcriptional activation hence altering physiological angiogenesis. Aim 2 is to establish if LKB1 suppresses NRP-1 and other non-VEGF growth factors-mediated angiogenesis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the contribution of LKB1 down-regulation of VEGF and NRP-1 within the vascular niche in vivo. We fully anticipate the completion of this project will help define the molecular mechanism by which LKB1 suppresses transcriptional expression and activity of VEGF, NRP-1, and other pro-angiogenic factors (FGFR & PDGFR) within the vascular niche resulting in a reduction in tumor growth and ischemic angiogenesis."
"9231351","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised application proposes to renew R01 AG030146, Genetic Epidemiology of Cognitive Decline in an Aging Population Sample. Cognitive decline in older age and its most severe manifestation, Alzheimer's disease, are public health problems of enormous magnitude that are projected to become much larger with the continued growth of the oldest population groups. We propose to build on our previous work to further the understanding of the genetic architecture of these important and common phenotypes through an integrated consideration of both epigenomic variation and genomic variation. The proposed work offers substantial potential for increasing our understanding of these phenotypes among African Americans (AAs). An integrated approach to genomic and epigenomic variation may be especially relevant in a study comparing results among AAs and European Americans (EAs) because of the different average exposures to life experiences and environments of these two racial/ethnic groups. The plasticity of the epigenome makes it an excellent place to search for long-lasting traces of past events such as midlife or earlier social and experiential disease risk factors that may be important to understanding racial/ethnic differences in disease risk. We will initially conduct a multi-ethnic meta-analysis of these phenotypes in existing genome wide association scan (GWAS) data from seven cohorts of AAs and EAs representing a large portion of available GWAS data for AAs. We will obtain additional genomic data for a large sample of 5000 AAs and 5000 EAs from these cohorts to characterize the relation of the class of genomic variation in the 0.001-0.05 frequency spectrum to cognitive decline by interrogation of coding and splicing variation throughout the human genome. We will then assemble a comprehensive picture of possible causal genomic variants and of their interconnections using integrated functional dissection of phenomic, transcriptomic (RNA and miRNA), and epigenomic (DNA methylation and H3K9Ac profiles) data available for two of the biracial cohorts. Finally, we will generate DNA methylation profiles and miRNA from 100 AA brains (50 with Alzheimer's disease and 50 controls) from these same two cohorts ) to perform targeted investigations of the role of DNA methylation and miRNA in susceptibility loci of AA subjects and compare these results to those obtained from EA subjects."
"9235613","Sarcomas are cancers arising within bone and soft tissue which rank among the most difficult cancers to treat. Limb-salvage therapy has reduced the incidence of disfiguring amputations, however many sarcomas involve crucial anatomical structures precluding this approach. Additionally, five year survival for metastatic sarcomas is only 16%, underscoring the need for new therapeutic targets. The Hippo pathway is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase cascade which negatively regulates the TAZ and YAP transcriptional coactivators. TAZ and YAP have emerged as important oncogenes in a number of cancers including breast, colon, liver, lung, and thyroid cancers. Our preliminary data shows that TAZ/YAP are activated in the majority of sarcomas (66%), something that has not been previously demonstrated. Our long-term goal is to effectively target the Hippo- TAZ/YAP signaling axis in sarcomas for therapeutic benefit and to identify patients who would benefit from such therapy. Our objective in this proposal is to elucidate the upstream mechanisms by which TAZ and YAP are activated in sarcomas in order to identify additional targets for therapy. Our central hypothesis is that TAZ and YAP are activated in sarcomas because of abrogation of the Hippo pathway due to 1) loss of expression of the Hippo kinase components (primary lesion) or 2) activation of the PI3 kinase pathway which suppresses or bypasses the Hippo pathway (secondary lesion). We thus propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that loss of expression of the Hippo kinases is a major modality by which TAZ/YAP are activated to drive sarcomagenesis. Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the PI3 kinase pathway activates TAZ/YAP to drive sarcomagenesis. The approach is innovative in the applicant's opinion, for the following reasons. Although the Hippo field has focused almost entirely on post-translational mechanisms of regulating the Hippo-TAZ/YAP axis, using an unbiased, tissue based approach, we identified that loss of expression of the Hippo kinases at a protein level is a major mechanism by which the Hippo pathway is dysregulated in sarcomas and other cancers. This same approach and mouse modeling also identified the PI3 kinase pathway as a bona fide activator of TAZ/YAP; the first time this has been shown in vivo or in clinical cancer specimens. The proposed research is significant because it will identify novel therapeutic targets upstream of TAZ/YAP which we anticipate can be used combinatorially with anti-TAZ/YAP approaches in sarcomas and other cancers.  "
"9232434","TET2 (ten-eleven translocation (TET) oncogene family member 2) is emerging as an important tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers, including in leukemia. Through three consecutive oxidation reactions, TET2 converts 5-methylcytosine into 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5hmc), 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine. 5- carboxylcytosine can then be converted to cytosine by the base excision repair pathway or during normal DNA replication, resulting in base demethylation. The current paradigm is that loss of function TET2 mutations results in DNA hyper-methylation, leading to decreased tumor suppressor gene expression and tumor development. However, we currently have a poor understanding of the nature of genes and regulatory elements that are under the control of TET2 and the ways in which TET2 may be targeted to DNA. Preliminary data presenting here comparing the epigenome of leukemic cells harboring wild-type versus TET2 mutations indicate that loss of TET2 function does not alter global methylation, but methylation of specific non-CpG island enhancer elements. As TET2 does not harbor a sequence specific DNA binding domain, it is hypothesized that recruitment to these enhancer elements is dependent on associations with specificity factors that interact with DNA in a sequence specific manner. The goal of experiments outlined in this R03 proposal is identify such proteins. We will then determine how depletion of these factors alters TET2-DNA interactions, genome wide 5hMC modification, and gene expression. Results from these experiments will advance our understanding of DNA methylation in general and specifically of TET2, one of the most frequently mutated genes in hematologic malignancies."
"9236404","Prostate cancer is diagnosed in approximately 16% of U.S. men, at a median age of 67 years, and the survival rates are high. Survivors are likely to experience poorer quality of life (QOL) due to the long-term side effects of treatment that are coupled with age-related declines in physical, mental and social functioning. Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in prostate cancer survivors, but it is also one of the least understood cancer-related symptoms. Fatigue is associated with psychological distress, disruptions of sleep quality, and impairments in health-related QOL. Inflammatory processes and changes in the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system may also play a role in cancer-related fatigue. Thus, effective treatments for fatigue in elderly prostate cancer survivors are urgently needed. Prior research has shown that Tai Chi Qigong (TCQ), a mind-body exercise intervention, can improve physical and emotional health. However, no definitive clinical trial has demonstrated its efficacy compared to activity-matched and health education control groups as a treatment for fatigue in senior, inactive prostate cancer survivors. Therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial of TCQ for reducing fatigue in prostate cancer survivors. This mind-body exercise intervention focuses on deep breathing techniques, slow deliberate movements, holding specific postures, and meditation to induce relaxation. In this trial, 210 elderly prostate cancer survivors (? 60 years) with fatigue will complete either a TCQ, streching movement or health education class. Classes will be held for 60 minutes, twice a week, over a 12-week period. Guided by biopsychosocial and psycho-neuroimmunology models we will test the hypotheses that a TCQ intervention, as compared to stretching movement or health education, will: 1) reduce fatigue (primary outcome) in inactive, elderly, prostate cancer survivors; 2) reduce inflammation as indexed by a vertically integrated approach: systemic levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (ELISA), Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 stimulated monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines, activation of inflammation-related transcription factors (e.g., NF-?B) and gene expression profiling with promoter based bioinformatics; and 3) regulate the expression of genes from two major functional clusters previously found to be associated with fatigue in prostate cancer patients: a) inflammation, vasodilation and metabolite sensing and b) energy and adrenergic activation. Measurements (baseline, 6-week midpoint intervention, and 1-week, 3-months, and 12-months post-intervention) will assess fatigue as well as potential mediating factors including psychological distress, mental and physical QOL, sleep quality, perceived stress, physical activity, and social well being. We hypothesize that relative to the streching movement and health education control conditions, TCQ will result in improvements in fatigue, in inflammation biomarkers and gene expression markers associated with fatigue. We will also evaluate underlying physical, psychosocial and biological pathways by which TCQ exerts its effects on fatigue."

Our partnerships with engineering and  chemistry, the Molecular Biology Institute, the Broad Stem Cell Research Center and the California Nanosystems Institute, combined with our newly formalized affiliation with Caltech, have made us stronger and more successful in this time of great opportunity in cancer research.  In this section, we first describe the Louis Factor Health Sciences Building, which serves as the JCCC's administrative and research focal point. We then summarize the research facilities that are of greatest relevance to the JCCC, beyond traditional department-based laboratory space within the School of Medicine, College of Letters and Science, and School of Engineering. Next, we describe hospitals and clinical facilities that support the clinical and clinical research missions of the JCCC. Finally, we describe other key facilities."
"9240170","Natural products have a proven record of providing a significant fraction, either directly or as lead compounds, of human medicines. Among natural products, the terpenoids (isoprenoids) stand out as being the largest class (>50,000 already known), with the 20-carbon diterpenoids targeted here forming a significant fraction of these (>12,000 known). The extensive diversification of diterpenoids indicates that the manifold hydrocarbon skeletons that can be formed from this C20 backbone provide privileged scaffolds for derivation of biological activity. Indeed, a number of diterpenoids are used as pharmaceuticals (e.g., the anti-cancer paclitaxel/TaxolTM and antibiotic mutilins) or research tools (e.g., the protein kinase C activating and tumor promoting phorbol esters, and adenylate cyclase activator forskolin). In addition, we have contributed to the discovery that the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilizes diterpenoid metabolism in construction of an immune-modulatory factor. The enzymes that produce the underlying hydrocarbon scaffolds catalyze complex electrophilic reactions that form new carbon-carbon bonds, which are of significant mechanistic interest. Our long-term goal is to engineer enzymes and metabolic pathways for the production of targeted libraries and specific individual terpenoid ?natural? products for pharmaceutical investigation and use. This revised renewal proposal focuses on the critically important scaffold assembling diterpene synthases/cyclases. Here we propose to build on our findings from the previous grant period, which includes discovery of means by which these enzymes may be re-engineered for novel product outcome. In particular, the objective of this proposal is to build on our on-going detailed studies of enzymatic structure-function relationships, and to also demonstrate our understanding of their catalytic mechanism by re-engineering activity, specifically to incorporate the addition of water to generate hydroxylated products. Such re-engineering will be enabled by the innovative approach taken here of combining quantum chemical calculations on simplified theozymes to identify key functional groups and their optimal positioning relative to high-energy intermediates, which will guide Rosetta based enzyme (re)design, followed by biochemical characterization of the (re)designed enzymes, with the results then informing subsequent (re)design efforts. We further will investigate the potential pharmaceutical activity of the resulting hydroxylated diterpenes, leveraging our modular metabolic engineering system used to characterize biochemical function. In particular, the resulting recombinant bacteria will be fed to a variety of Caenorhabditis elegans disease models to determine the ability of the the produced hydroxylated diterpenes to alleviate the relevant symptoms."
"9241080","Summary Physical inactivity is a major public health challenge underlying a broad range of health problems at all ages. While physical activity (PA) has shown to produce relevant health benefits, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly known. The coordinated effort of clinical and animal studies supported by bioinformatics and chemical analyses will achieve the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) goals of assessing the molecular changes that occur in response to PA. The Consortium Coordinating Center (CCC) for the MoTrPAC will provide support for the organization, administration, planning, standardization, documentation, monitoring and reporting activities relating to the MoTrPAC. The CCC will play a pivotal role in ensuring the cohesion of the MoTrPAC by enhancing communication and integration across all study components, including the Clinical Sites, the Preclinical Animal Study Sites, the Bioinformatics Center, the Chemical Analysis Sites, and the various study committees. The CCC will develop strategies and strategic planning processes by integrating activities of the MoTrPAC investigators with the input provided by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, the External Scientific Advisors, outside experts, and the NIH.

"9241697","The five subtypes of dopamine receptors (D1-D5) are members of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. The D1 and D2 subtypes are the most abundant and mediate most classic dopamine-dependent behaviors. This application is focused on the D2 receptor and, in particular, on the functional significance of a 29-residue fragment in the third cytoplasmic loop that is alternatively spliced to produce the short and long forms of the D2 receptor, D2S and D2L. Considerable evidence indicates that the D2 receptor is the primary autoreceptor that regulates DA neuron activity and DA release, and it is widely accepted that D2S is that autoreceptor, whereas D2L is the postsynaptic receptor expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons. In contrast, our work supports a model in which rodent dopamine neurons express both splice variants, and both function as autoreceptors with some subtle differences. We have determined that one difference between the splice variants is their rate of calcium-dependent desensitization and we now propose to evaluate the significance of this difference for cocaine-induced sensitization, reward, and aversion, while also comparing other functional properties of the splice variants. In the first specific aim we will compare additional aspects of the function of D2L and D2S as the presynaptic autoreceptor that inhibits dopamine release, dopamine neuron firing, and locomotor activity. We will use virus-mediated expression of D2L or D2S in the midbrain of D2 receptor null-mutant (D2-KO) mice and of mice with regional D2 receptor knock- out, to restore the expression of either D2L or D2S in dopamine neurons prior to assessing measures of D2 autoreceptor activity. We will also determine if both variants regulate G protein-mediated signaling in striatal neurons. This aim will focus on receptor localization and regulation of dopamine release and reuptake, and will explore the hypotheses that cocaine alters the distribution or expression of the variants. The second specific aim is based on alternative hypotheses that a cocaine-induced somatodendritic autoreceptor switch from D2S to D2L triggers or reflects other changes that produce behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference to cocaine, and decreased aversion, or that the phenotype switch is a compensatory mechanism that mediates decreased reward and increased aversion. In this aim we will test these hypotheses by measuring cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference, and conditioned taste aversion in mice expressing only D2S or D2L autoreceptors. Experimental support for either hypothesis will provide valuable insight into the relevance of D2 receptor alternative splicing for DA neuron function."
"9242630","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Tissue and Cell Analysis (TCA) Core provides traditional and cutting-edge technologies necessary for morphological analysis of cells, tissues from experimental animals, and human tissues. Dr. Jerrold Turner, M.D., Ph.D., is a subspecialty-trained GI pathologist who is an expert in routine and advanced imaging approaches and data interpretation. The Co-Director, Dr. Vytas Bindokas, Ph.D., has an extensive understanding of the newest imaging technologies and post-acquisition analytical tools. Together, their complementary skill sets provide users with the guidance needed for effective use of available resources. The TCA is closely aligned with the other Cores of the DDRCC, providing members with the capability of tissue and cell analysis of human and experimental samples derived from their services. The importance of services provided by the TCA Core has only increased in recent years as use of animal models and human specimens has grown exponentially. Tools needed to study these include H&E tissue preparations, simple and complex immunohistochemical stains, and more complicated preparations. The TCA Core also provides a longitudinal array of human specimens that have been well-characterized and preserved, anatomic pathology consultation, instruction in all techniques,(including immunohistochemistry), and specialized guidance specifically related to study of gastrointestinal disease. Slide-scanners can create virtual slides that can be viewed using a computer and virtual microscope software. This makes it possible to preserve the samples for viewing over extended periods of time or to share slides electronically, and greatly simplifies photomicroscopy. In order to study the diverse specimen preparations generated by DDRCC members, the TCA Core provides access to advanced imaging technologies, including superresolution microscopy that makes it possible to overcome the diffraction-limited 250 nm resolution of light microscopy by an order of magnitude. Other tools, including widefield deconvolution, laser scanning confocal, and spinning disk confocal microscopy make it possible to perform intravital imaging of cultured cells and genetically modified animals expressing fluorescent- tagged proteins. These are able to provide previously unattainable views of ongoing pathobiology that allow unprecedented insight into disease mechanisms. Further, as computer power has grown, advanced software that simplifies complex morphometry of enormous 5D (x,y,z,t,?) datasets has become available. The TCA Core has invested in these costly programs and makes their use available to DDRCC members at minimal cost. Perhaps most importantly, the TCA Core provides expert assistance and education in the use of the growing array of routine and highly specialized technologies that are available. This is essential, as the pace of advances makes it difficult for most investigators to be comfortable with or appreciate the benefits of these new tools."
"9244190","Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread parasite of animals that causes zoonotic infection in humans. Although acute infections in healthy adults are normally resolved without serious consequences, infection of immunocompromised individuals can lead to serious complications. Additionally, because chronic infections are not cleared by the immune system or by normal antibiotic treatment, individuals remain chronically infected for life. The presence of semi-dormant tissue cysts that can reactivate predisposes infected individuals to the risk of complications in the event of waning immunity. One of the key features of T. gondii that enables it to persist in the host is the ability to block immune responses, and thereby prevent clearance of the parasite. Among the pathways that are perturbed by T. gondii infection are the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. Control of T. gondii infection relies on activation of STAT1 by IFN-?, which is essential to upregulate antimicrobial pathways in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. However, when cells are infected by T. gondii before encountering IFN-?, the parasite is able to block STAT1-mediated transcription resulting in reduced control of infection. Global analysis of gene expression reveals that the majority of IFN-?-activated genes are blocked by prior infection with T. gondii. The block in STAT1 signaling occurs in both rodent and human cells, although the molecular basis for this trait has not been previously identified. In preliminary studies we have identified a T. gondii protein that binds to phosphorylated STAT1 dimers and prevents activation of downstream genes. This effector, known as T. gondii Inhibitor of STAT Transcription (TgIST) blocks IFN-?-induced gene expression mediated by STAT1. TgIST is both necessary and sufficient for blocking STAT1- mediated transcription in mouse and human cells. TgIST binds to a host repressor complex that alters chromatin structure. The proposed studies will define the role of host chromatin modifiers in modulating STAT1 transcriptional complexes using gene disruption by CRISPR/Cas9 combined with various reporter assays. Additionally, we will implement a variety of cellular, biochemical, and genetic methods to define the domains necessary for export and trafficking of TgIST to the host cell nucleus, where it is active."
"9246108","Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases."
"9245566","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Recent advances have led to the development of clinical tests that provide site-of-lesion information about vestibular (inner ear balance) function in patients suffering from dizziness or imbalance. Specifically, the vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) supplements the vestibular test battery by providing information about otolith organ function (a type of vestibular  sensory organ). Although VEMPs are becoming more widely used in vestibular clinics throughout the world, the clinical significance of otolith organ dysfunction is unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the consequences of otolith organ dysfunction on postural stability. These findings may lead to the development of novel approaches for patients with otolith organ dysfunction. The vestibular system is comprised of two types of sensory organs (semicircular canals and otolith organs) with unique contributions to balance. Loss of vestibular function can occur in one or both labyrinths, in one or both branches of the vestibular nerve, and in one or more vestibular sensory organs. Symptoms of vestibular loss include postural instability, visual blurring, and dizziness and/or imbalance. Moreover, the incidence of falls is greater in individuals with vestibular loss than in healthy individuals of the same age. The incidence of dizziness and imbalance increases in populations relevant to VA healthcare: older adults and individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Preliminary data suggest that otolith dysfunction is prevalent in Veterans with TBI. Most research examining the effect of peripheral vestibular dysfunction on postural stability have used measurements of horizontal semicircular canals (hSCC) to determine vestibular loss (e.g., Herdman et al., 2000), because conventional vestibular clinical assessment has been limited to caloric or rotational testing (tests of hSCC/superior vestibular nerve function). Thus, it is unclear how dysfunction in other components of the vestibular system contributes to postural instability, and importantly, the incidence of falls. The use of tests of otolith function in addition to the tests of hSCC function provide the ability to differentiate vestibular end organ, and better explain the effect of peripheal vestibular loss on postural instability. Vestibular rehabilitation includes gaze stability exercise based on principles of adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (or semicircular canal); therefore this study has important implications for rehabilitation of patients with otolith dysfunction. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) model will provide an organizational structure for the study to examine the complex relationships between Health Condition (in the proposed study, this refers to the specific vestibular groups: canal dysfunction otolith dysfunction, canal + otolith dysfunction), the components of health, and the context. The specific domains of the ICF include: body function and structure (body level); activity (individual  level) and participation (societal level). Importantly, the ICF model considers both environmental and personal factors that impact function and disability. The specific aims are designed to determine the effect of otolith dysfunction on postural stability at the levels of impairment (Specific Aim 1), activity and participation (Specific Aim 2), and determine the interaction of age  and otolith dysfunction on postural stability (Specific Aim 3). To address these aims, 5 groups of Veterans based on vestibular site-of-lesion tests (3 vestibular groups and 2 control groups) will be enrolled in the study (n = 124). Three vestibular groups will include Veterans complaining of dizziness and/or imbalance with: (1) horizontal semicircular canal (hSCC) dysfunction only (Canal Only), (2) otolith dysfunction only (Otolith Only), and (3) hSCC and otolith dysfunction (Canal+Otolith). The control groups will include (1) Veterans complaining of dizziness and/or imbalance with normal hSCC and otolith function (Dizzy Control) and (2) age- and gender- matched Veterans with no complaints of dizziness and/or imbalance and normal hSCC and otolith function (Healthy Control). To address the specific aims, balance measures, gait and mobility measures and self-report questionnaires will be compared between vestibular groups and across a wide age range."

"9246899","PROJECT SUMMARY Although the health benefits of physical activity in prevention and mitigation of many chronic diseases have been documented for decades, the molecular mechanisms mediating these health benefits are still poorly understood. To understand the adaptive response of physical activity at the molecular level, it is essential to comprehensively characterize the dynamic changes in protein expression and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in tissues and circulating biofluids. The overall objective of the PNNL Proteomics Chemical Analysis Center for MoTrPAC (ProMoTr) is to support the consortium by providing comprehensive discovery and subsequent targeted verification analyses of circulating protein factors in blood and associated PTMs in multiple tissue types collected by the Pre-clinical Animal Study Sites and Clinical Centers of MoTrPAC. To develop a `molecular map' of transducers that provide the impacts of physical activity in humans, the ProMoTr's integrative proteomics analysis plan has two major foci. First, we will focus on the circulating secreted factors found in blood plasma and tissues based on the known cross-talk between and within tissues resulting from physical activity. Second, we will investigate the tissue- and cellular- level response to physical activity by assessing intracellular signaling as mediated by protein PTMs, including protein phosphorylation, reversible redox modifications, and lysine acetylation and acylation. The Specific Aims of ProMoTr are: 1) to provide the Proteomics Chemical Analysis Element to discover and verify circulating factors and intracellular molecular transducers; 2) to provide the Bioinformatics Element to fully support the needs of ProMoTr in statistical design, data processing, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination; 3) to provide the Administrative Element to oversee internal activities and to provide high-level collaborative interactions with MoTrPAC centers and the broader consortium. The feasibility of performing high quality reproducible discovery and verification analyses on the scale of tens of thousands of tissue samples is built upon PNNL's record of accomplishment of large-scale integrative proteomics programs. The PNNL foundation includes refined quality control, large-scale computation, and dissemination capabilities, our recognized expertise in the development and deployment of cutting-edge mass spectrometry-based technologies, and our capabilities for studying protein PTMs that are closely linked with energy metabolism."
"9258923","Project Summary Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition with significant limitations for acute evaluation of severity, complicating prompt and effective treatment strategies. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a promising magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research technique for detecting microscopic tissue injury in SCI, but requires long scan durations and lacks specificity for the important prognostic marker of cellular damage, reducing its clinical usefulness. The goal of this project is to apply a novel diffusion MRI technique to overcome these limitations and improve diagnosis and prognosis of SCI. This technique, termed double diffusion encoding (DDE), was specifically tailored to evaluate axonal integrity in the spinal cord, which has been shown to be the best predictor of functional outcome following injury, by reducing its sensitivity to edema and other processes that confound diffusion measurements. Preliminary data demonstrate that DDE measurements enable greater sensitivity to injury than DTI with a substantially reduced acquisition time. Furthermore, the automated DDE analysis requires minimal data post-processing and provides an important objective benefit over the time-consuming manual region of interest drawing commonly used with DTI. Thus, the DDE technique provides multiple benefits over DTI that increase its feasibility for potential clinical evaluation of SCI. The aims of the project are to demonstrate the cellular basis for diffusion changes measured with DDE and its use as a prognostic indicator for long-term functional recovery. This method will be evaluated using a rat contusion model of SCI with graded severities induced by weight drop injuries. Comparison of MRI measurements to gold-standard histological quantification will demonstrate the strong association between DDE parameters and axonal injury (Aim 1). The prognostic capabilities of this new method will also be tested in the ability of acute DDE measurements to predict chronic nervous system function following injury (Aim 2). The results of these studies will impact both preclinical and clinical applications of SCI evaluation where improved sensitivity to axonal damage will better inform intervention, treatment, and rehabilitation strategies. The translational nature of the project, coupled with training in fundamental principles of scientific investigation, will promote continued success in my long-term goal to become an independent physician scientist."

"9263277","Abstract Chronic lung disease (CLD) represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Although advances in neonatal care have decreased the incidence of chronic lung disease in preterm infants, a subset of these infants remain dramatically affected, developing ?severe? lung pathologies along with other organ associated complications. Currently, few clinically useful strategies have been developed to identify and treat the infants at greatest risk. We hypothesize that the severe pulmonary disease in preterm infants is a result of epigenetic changes caused by events in utero which primes them for exacerbated responses to interventions after birth. MicroRNAs (miRs) are epigenetic regulators involved in growth, development, and repair processes, however dysregulation of miRs are associated with pulmonary disease. We have identified a microRNA, miR-29b, that is suppressed at birth in preterm infants that go on to develop chronic lung disease. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that restoration of pulmonary expression of microRNA-29b will attenuate morbidites associated with newborn chronic lung disease. To test our hypothesis, we will use our extensively characterized murine model; systemic maternal LPS followed by exposure of the pups to hyperoxia for 14 days. The objective of this proposal is to test novel therapeutic strategies to reverse epigenetic changes resulting from exposure to perinatal inflammation. To accomplish this we propose three Aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that AAV9-mediated delivery of miR-29b to newborn mouse pups will rescue the phenotype caused by perinatal inflammation and neonatal hyperoxia. To test this hypothesis, we will build upon our preliminary data using an innovative delivery strategy, adeno-associated virus, to restore the pulmonary expression of miR-29b which plays an essential role in lung development and fundamental signaling pathways. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that miR-29b can be efficiently delivered to the lungs of a newborn mouse using lipid-based vehicles. We will investigate relevant alternative delivery strategies including liposomal nanoparticles and surfactant suspension that could be directly translated into therapies for infants. Aim 3 will utilize bio-banked blood specimens obtained at delivery and at 36 weeks' corrected age to define the clinical characteristics of infants with decreased miR29b expression at birth and at the time of clinical determination of BPD status. Using existing biorespositories, we will investigate cord blood and infant samples for associations between clinical variables and neonatal miR expression to optimize identification of the population of infants that would most benefit from miR therapies. In summary, these studies will provide the framework for new and novel therapeutic approaches that include delivery of miRs to prevent pulmonary morbidities in newborn infants."
"9260484","Restenosis secondary to intimal hyperplasia (IH) after balloon angioplasty to treat arterial blockages in peripheral arteries is a significant cause of disability and death. The thrombospondins (TSPs) are multifunctional matricellular proteins central to the development of intimal hyperplasia. They are not part of the arterial wall structure, but exert their physiologic effects on arterial structure by binding cytokines, cell-surface receptors, proteases and other proteins. This proposal focuses on three TSPs integral to the development of intimal hyperplasia ? TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5. We have studied the effects of TSP-1 on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration and its importance in the development of intimal hyperplasia; however, increasing evidence exists that TSP-2 and TSP-5 have separate and contributory roles in this pathology. All three TSPs are substrates of ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin Motifs) proteins. ADAMTSs digest TSPs, enhancing or inhibiting TSP function, since the fragments left after digestion have distinct effects themselves on intimal hyperplasia. Therefore, ADAMTS-1,-4, and-7 will also be studied as they are involved in PAD and were also identified to be regulated by TSPs in our prior VSMC gene study. Our long-term goal is to understand how TSPs can be manipulated therapeutically to prevent intimal hyperplasia in vivo. The objective of this proposal is to determine how TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 specifically contribute to the development of intimal hyperplasia. Our central hypothesis is that the expression, bioavailability, signaling pathways and changes in gene expression induced by TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 and their interactions with ADAMTSs have distinct effects on regulating the development of IH. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of our strong preliminary data, our publications and the literature. The rationale for the proposed project is that understanding the roles of TSPs on intimal hyperplasia will result in identification of therapeutic targets to inhibit intimal hyperplasia and restenosis after balloon angioplasty. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) determine the role that TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 each have on intimal hyperplasia; 2) determine the differential effects of TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 on protein and microRNA expression (i.e., miR-17~92 cluster), and their downstream effects on VSMC function; and 3) establish the role of ADAMTSs in TSP-1, TSP-2 and TSP-5 activity and in the development of intimal hyperplasia. The methodologies utilized to investigate these Specific Aims include: 1) modified Boyden chamber to assess chemotaxis and colorimetric assay to assess for proliferation in VSMCs; 2) western blot, ELISA and immunoPCR for cell signaling and protein expression; 3) quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction for gene expression; 4) two animal models of intimal hyperplasia ? common carotid artery balloon injury in rats and ligation in mice; 5) use of knockout mice and siRNA for knockdown of TSP and ADAMTS genes in vitro and in vivo to see effects on VSMCs and intimal hyperplasia, respectively; and 6) morphometric analysis, western blot and immunohistochemical staining for analysis of arterial specimens. The siRNA work will also involve testing our novel siRNAs directed at TSP/ADAMTS combinations that may prove to be a highly effective method of blocking intimal hyperplasia at the time of angioplasty. The significance of the proposed research is that the findings will provide a major advance toward identifying new strategies for preventing restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia. The proposed research in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because the findings will define the interactions of multiple TSPs and peptidases with TSP motifs (ADAMTSs) in vascular disease and mechanisms through which these systems can be manipulated with novel siRNAs to improve clinical outcomes. The findings from this application will advance efforts to improve quality of life and longevity by providing safer and more effective therapeutic options for patients with peripheral arterial disease."

The Specific Aims of this five-year study include:To establish an infrastructure for health promotion and disease prevention among faith-based organizations serving Asian American communities in NYC; To translate and adapt and evidence-based faith-based intervention proven effective in other racial and ethnic minority communities for the Asian American community; and To evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the adapted intervention to improve physical activity and reduce the risk for obesity and obesity-related diseases among South Asian communities. We will review faith-based intervention components found to be effective in the African American community and work with religious leaders and community partners to identify those strategies that could be replicated and are deemed acceptable and appropriate within the cultural context of Asian American communities. We will then translate and adapt these components in culturally- and linguistically-appropriate strategies and messages that fit with the goals of the participating religious institutions and for the communities they serve. Critical to the process of meaningful translation and effective adoption of the intervention is the following activities: a) conduct formative research; b) apply a CBPR approach; c) secure faith-based leadership support and guidance in intervention design; d) develop appropriate messaging and educational campaigns; e) support environmental and policy changes; and f) strengthen capacity of religious and community leaders at participating faith-based organizations to fully engage in research, as well as health promotion (including for example, effective messaging and communication). We will be able to identify successful components that can be generalized across different Asian ethnic and religious groups."
"9186469","This ARC proposal tests the hypothesis that repeated ethanol binges (REB)  persistently change neuroimmune signaling that alters neuronal activation in frontal cortical (FC), amygdala  (Amyg), ventral striatum (VS, nucleus accumbens) and hippocampus (Hip) that contributes to the  psychopathology of alcohol dependence. Progress in the previous funding cycle discovered that  neuroimmune signals are activated by REB altering behavior consistent with addiction. Breese progress  linked ethanol cycles, stressors and/or brain injection of neuroimmune agonists into Amyg with decreased  social interaction, an index of negative affect. In parallel. Crews discovered REB induces neuroimmune  genes through glial NFKB transcription of chemokines, cytokines, toll-like receptors (TLR) and the TLR  agonist HMGB1 that persist for long periods of abstinence and contribute to neurodegeneratlon and reversal  learning cognitive deficits. Increased neuroimmune protein expression was also discovered in post-mortem  human alcoholic brain. These labs partner within this renewal component. REB induced changes in  neuronal activation using cfos and Zif268 markers (Aim 1) will be related to increases in neuroimmune  signals (Aim 2) within FC, Amyg, VS and Hip during abstinenece following REB. These brain regions are  networked and associated with the persistent alcohol induced arousal that occurs in alcohol dependence.  Optogenetics will investigate changes in FC circuits. Naltrexone, minocycline and knock out mice will test  causal relationships between neuroimmune induction and altered neuronal activation (Aim 3) as well as  addiction related behaviors (Aim 4). These experiments will enhance understanding of the molecular and  cellular mechanisms of alcohol induced brain pathology. Ethanol induced neuroimmune activation could  become central to the neurobiology of addiction and translate to new treatments. The ARC broadens and  strengthens the proposed experiments with additional related studies on binge induced alterations in  neurocircuits, addiction-like behaviors and signaling mechanisms."
"9186474","The objective of the proposed research Is to make novel discoveries regarding the  functional and structural central nervous system (CNS) pathology that results from early prenatal alcohol  exposure (PAE). Extending our previous research illustrating exposure stage-dependent patterns of brain  dysmorphology in fetal mice, we propose to examine 3 distinct, but interrelated forebrain circuits that are  expected to play key roles in the behavioral or functional manifestations of alcohol neuroteratogenesis in the  postnatal animal. The proposed studies will utilize a well-established FASD mouse model, with acute, as well  as dietary maternal alcohol administration at times equivalent to 3-6 weeks of human gestation. Innovative  technologies and approaches will be employed to address 3 Aims. Aim 1 is designed to test the hypothesis  that early PAE induces hippocampal pathology (esp. altered hippocampal volume and related fiber tract  Integrity and circuitry) and deficiencies in the performance of hippocampus-mediated learning and memory  tasks in adult mice. For this work, high-resolution ex vivo diffusion tensor imaging will be utilized to define  structural deficiencies associated with PAE, while a behavioral test battery will be used to probe  hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Aim 2 is designed to test the hypothesis that early PAE  causes defects in medial hypothalamic and pituitary circuitry as well as altered HPA axis regulation in  adulthood. For this, immunohlstochemistry and in situ hybridization will be employed to characterize  hypothalamic and pituitary pathology in fetal mice. HPA axis function will be examined in adults by  measurement of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone plasma levels both prior and subsequent to  an acute alcohol challenge or an acute restraint stress. Aim 3 is designed to test the hypothesis that early  PAE results in deficient inhibitory GABAergic circuitry in corticostriatal circuits underlying reward perception  and alcohol intake. For this, intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), intermittent access drinking, and design-based  stereology will be employed. Overall, the proposed work is in keeping with the binge alcohol  pathology/neurocircuitry-directed central goal of the Alcohol Research Center (ARC) and will profit from ARC  support and interaction. The results of the proposed studies promise to fill a significant FASD research void,  inform human clinical research, and continue to highlight the first trimester as a critical period for alcohol-induced  CNS defects."
"9187988","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent discoveries across a broad range of basic science, technology and translational research have enhanced our understanding of disease processes and resulted in a multitude of potentially effective treatments for critically ill and injured children that require evaluation in the clinical environment. There is a tremendous need for a collaborative research network in pediatric critical care to facilitate the swift and effectie translation of scientific and technologic discoveries into clinical advances as well as to facilitae the flow of ideas from the bedside back to the laboratory. Access to appropriate patients and expertise in the execution of clinical trials must be linked to scientists and laboratories working within and across disciplines at the cutting edge of scientific advancement. At the University of Colorado Denver (UCD) and Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO), we have a long history of successful collaborative basic and translational science programs, focused on integrated studies of cardiovascular-pulmonary responses to injurious stimuli at the molecular, cellular, organ, whole animal, and human subject levels. We will provide several unique areas of strength to the CPCCRN, including: 1) a distinctive translational approach to cardiovascular-pulmonary diseases, 2) experience with pediatric clinical trials execution, including innovative programs to enhance research awareness and participation among patients and families, 3) an eight state catchment area with high volumes of critically ill and injured children, 4) an in-house rehabilitation program and extensive outpatient outreach program in all pediatric specialties capable of providing follow-up care to nearly all our critically ill patients, and 5) a dynamic partnership with the Colorado Clinical Translational Science Institute to provide extensive research resources. Utilizing these assets, we will augment the contributions of CPCCRN to the care of critically ill children through innovative translational and clinical trial proposals, participation in Network leadership committees, and training the next generation of pediatric critical care researchers. Our concept proposal demonstrates our capacity to design innovative and relevant studies utilizing cutting edge methodologies. Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious complication of mechanical ventilation in critically ill children, yet there is limited understanding of the microbial and host factors associated with VAP. Endogenous bacteria are likely critical regulators of both pathogen behavior and host responses in the airways, modulating the virulence of potential pathogens. Limited understanding of the microbial and host factors associated with VAP has precluded development of truly effective prevention and treatment strategies. This study will assess how viral infection, bacterial populations, and the balance between host immune activation and immune suppression interact to determine whether a given patient develops VAP. Understanding how these critical interactions are involved in the pathogenesis of VAP will improve public health by identifying targets for more effective prevention and treatment strategies that will decrease the burden of VAP. 1"
"9188571","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study will be the first demonstration of changes in connectivity following a direct ablative intervention in neurocircuitry. Interest in neurosurger for psychiatric illness is increasing dramatically. Controlled trials of stereotactic ablation and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are underway. However, knowledge of behavioral and brain mechanisms underlying these therapies remains limited. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) focuses on mechanisms of therapeutic change after thermocapsulotomy for intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The research focuses on a surgical procedure that has continued in use for decades for OCD, but whose mechanisms of action remain virtually unstudied: ventral capsulotomy. Twenty-four patients undergoing ventral capsulotomy for intractable OCD will be recruited from the longstanding psychiatric neurosurgery program at Butler Hospital. Twenty-four healthy control participants will also be recruited. Aim 1 uses probabilistic tractography-derived human neural models, informed by known macaque neuroanatomy from histological data, to delineate neuroanatomical nodes and pathways affected by ventral capsulotomy for severe OCD. This will generate regions of interest for Aim 2, and will allow for analysis of changes in structural (diffusion tensor imaging) connectivity pre- and post- ventral capsulotomy for OCD. Aim 2 will examine resting state and task-based (response inhibition) effective connectivity changes pre- and post-ventral capsulotomy for severe OCD. This study represents an unparalleled opportunity to test hypotheses of the relationship between connectivity and therapeutic improvement after a planned ablation. The applicant will obtain a virtually unique combination of skills, building on prior knowledge of neuropsychological tasks and morphometric MRI analysis. To achieve the goal of conducting independent research in this area, the K23 training plan will emphasize 1) an in-depth understanding of neuroanatomy and how it can be used to inform neuroimaging analysis; 2) analysis and application of DTI and MRI connectivity data; and 3) advancing the applicant's knowledge of mechanisms of therapeutic change after treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders. This career development award provides a rich set of collaborators, with leading researchers in this field, for both training and research. The Applicant proposes comprehensive training in neuroimaging, neuroanatomy, multivariate statistics, and responsible research conduct. She is seeking to be trained to fill a niche in an area (interventional neuroscience) that is greatly expanding. She will acquire advanced skills needed to lead independent research on behavioral and brain mechanisms of therapeutic change after neurosurgery and other neurocircuitry-based interventions for OCD and related disorders."
"9337143","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can be cured through allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Unfortunately, 25% of patients will experience relapse after SCT that is usually diagnosed by histologic evaluation of peripheral blood or bone marrow. This method is insensitive and leads to diagnosis of relapse with a high disease burden, which is more difficult to successfully treat. Multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC) can detect lower burden of disease (0.1-0.01% AML blasts from a mixed population); however, it is expensive and impractical for use in diseases that require frequent monitoring due in part to the need for analyzing bone marrow. In this R21 project, a novel processing strategy will be carried out by an inexpensive, easily manufactured, and highly automated fluidic bio-processor used to select and identify rare AML blasts directly from whole blood to allow more frequent testing to detect MRD at an earlier stage compared to MFC. The bio- processor will consist of modules poised on a fluidic motherboard. The modules and motherboard are made from thermoplastics with the prerequisite microstructures generated via replication. Three modules will be used to affinity-select AML blasts from whole blood using a capture bed comprised of surface immobilized antibodies tethered to the selection channel walls via single-stranded DNA bifunctional linkers. The antibodies will target CD33, CD34 and CD117 expressing blasts. The selection modules will consist of an array of 50-250 microchannels that can process large input volumes (2-10 mL) in <20 min. The AML blasts will be released from the capture bed by engineering a cleavable unit into an oligonucleotide bifunctional linker. Following blast release, they will be detected using an impedance sensor to direct them into a containment reservoir possessing a fabricated filter to permit immuno-staining of the blasts. The final module will consist of a micro- flow cytometer cell fabricated from an amorphous fluoropolymer, CYTOP, which has excellent optical properties and a refractive index (~1.3402 @ 546 nm) close to that of water (1.3331 @ 546 nm). This module will allow for sheath-less operation by matching the flow cell channel dimensions to near the diameter of the AML blasts and overfilling the flow cell channel with the laser excitation beams to produce a uniform intensity profile. Using a 3-color laser-induced fluorescence system, further immuno-phenotyping of the selected AML blasts will be secured. The fluidic bio-processor will be used to test the hypothesis: Detection of MRD following SCT will assist clinicians in administering proper therapies at an earlier stage of AML relapse to achieve higher cure rates. A pilot study will be performed to measure MRD status in AML patients and associate that with the onset of hematologic relapse using the designed fluidic bio-processor with results compared to MFC."
"9352924","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Naphthalene (NA) is an acute respiratory toxicant and a potential human lung carcinogen. Human exposure to NA is widespread, but human susceptibility to NA toxicity is poorly understood. The verdict on human susceptibility to NA toxicity will have a significant impact on public health, could save many lives, but involves economic costs. The overall theme of this ViCTER program is to study mechanisms of lung toxicity, including tolerance, induced by NA, in order to improve assessment of human lung cancer risks from NA and other related toxicants. Three Aims are proposed, 1) to define whether NA is a genotoxic carcinogen through a direct mechanism; 2) to test the role of inflammatory cell estrogen production in NA-induced lung toxicity and tolerance; and 3) to identify cellular stress response for NA-induced lung toxicity and tolerance. These Aims significantly expand the scope of the current project by studying molecular and cellular events downstream of the initial bio-activation step, while the parent grant is focused on the NA bio-activation step. The consortium allows extensive collaborations among the participants, in sharing of animal models, unique skills (e.g., airway dissection), instruments, and molecular, cellular, and genotoxic perspectives. Data from the Aims will provide complementary views of the complex, multi-step process of NA-induced tissue damage and repair that lead to preneoplastic changes and eventual carcinogenesis. Aim 1 will provide much needed data on whether NA induces stable DNA adducts in the lung in vivo, and will translate our studies to a more human-like model system. The results would drive risk estimation, guide future mechanistic studies, and provide methodology and approaches for testing other carcinogens. Aim 2 will produce a novel knockout mouse model and establish role of macrophage-derived estrogen in NA-induced hyper proliferative response and tolerance, which precedes development of hyperplastic/dysplastic nodules. Aim 3 will identify the specific reactive oxygen species damage driving acute lung toxicity and signaling pathways that allow for NA-induced tolerance. The results would provide insight for potential mitigating agents and biomarkers for future translational studies to identify and protect at-risk individuals."
"9380836","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cytokine-based immunotherapies have the potential to treat a wide range of diseases including cancer. Unfortunately, pro-inflammatory cytokines with potent antitumor activity are frequently toxic upon systemic exposure. The lack of effective local delivery strategies capable of controlling the distribution cytokines has prevented cytokine therapeutics from impacting cancer immunotherapy. This project proposes a novel delivery technology in which a potent recombinant cytokine, interleukin-12 (IL-12), is chemically-linked to a biodegradable polysaccharide called chitosan prior to intratumoral (i.t.) injection. This novel strategy is expected to provide sustained, high concentrations of IL-12 in the tumor microenvironment, while minimizing potentially harmful systemic dissemination.  The proposed project is comprised of three aims focusing on the development and evaluation of IL-12-chitosan bioconjugates in preclinical tumor models. In the first aim, novel IL-12-chitosan bioconjugates will be synthesized and evaluated in vitro for bioactivity. The mutation of solvent accessible amino acids will allow for site-specific conjugation of IL-12 to chitosan. Aim 2 will assess safety by documenting the spatiotemporal distribution of IL-12-chitosan bioconjugates and any potential toxicities associated with IL-12-chitosan administration. Aim 3 will evaluate antitumor efficacy of IL-12-chitosan bioconjugates as well as the elaboration of tumor-specific immunity in relevant preclinical models.  The overall goal of this project is to determine if conjugation to chitosan can maintain the potent antitumor activity of IL-12 while alleviating toxicity concerns. I the long-term, validation of this cytokine-chitosan delivery platform may pave the way for additional cytokine therapeutics in cancer immunotherapy."
"9132625","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Abstract: Symptoms due to pathology of the neck are among the most common complaints that patients bring to the attention of neurologists and physiatrists. In this Pilot study we propose to  develop two variants of a motion capable neck brace to serve these clinical situations. First, we will build and improve a neck brace for ALS patients with severe neck weakness. The inability to hold up the head not only decreases the quality of life, it can also decrease airway protection leading to the most common cause of death in ALS patients. The novel device will allow the patient to control the position of the head that is optimal for each activity. Secondly, we will develop a highly adjustable neck brace for the management of neck pain and cervical radiculopathy, two of the most common presenting symptoms in the neurology clinic. This neck brace can also be used for patients at risk for cervical cord compression but who are not surgical candidates. The novel device will provide increased stability, potential for traction, and  the ability to easily adjust neck position. This Pilot study seeks to determine safety and tolerability and to identify potential benefits. Demonstration of safety, tolerability, and potentil benefits will allow full clinical trials for each of the devices. If successful these studies will provide a much need prostheses for a relatively neglected but important area of neural rehabilitation."
"9185986","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Birth defects, such as those effecting cardiovascular (e.g. Coarctation of the Aorta), nervous system (e.g. Spina bifida) and craniofacial development (e.g. Cleft Palate) are responsible for roughly 20% of infant deaths in the United States and place an exceeding burden on the health care system amounting to billions of dollars each year. Such defects are often the result of disruptions in embryogenesis, which depends on tight regulation of key pathways including Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch, PAR, and Bone morphogenetic peptide/TGF beta. Many of the protein complexes involved in these pathways however lack detailed molecular characterization, and more still remain to be discovered. Large-scale proteomics efforts focused on embryonic tissues are beginning to systematically identify proteins in vast numbers. Using these data, I propose to develop new methods to structurally and functionally characterize protein complexes associated with embryogenesis. Specifically, I will develop novel computational tools (i) to datamine for proximal interactions (i.e. protein subcomplexes) as well as (ii) to calculate protein stoichiometry. I will then integrate this information to build structural models capable of both characterizing individual complex functions as well as identifying their role in developmental failure. These results will provide a greatly needed mechanistic understanding of the protein complexes associated with embryogenesis and potentially uncover therapeutic targets to treat developmental failures. Moreover, the methods developed here will provide the capability to analyze virtually any biological system and thus should have broad implications for the study of many diseases."
"9186546","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes and other retinal vascular diseases are a major cause of unavoidable vision loss. The retinal vasculature also has a unique role in helping to understand how systemic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension are damaging other vasculature in the body which may not be as readily accessible to noninvasive measures as the retina. Recently we have shown that adaptive optics imaging of the retinal vessels allows precise quantification of blood flow and vascular structure. We are able to image individual cells within the walls of the retinal vasculature, measure the relation between vascular lumens and vascular walls in vessels as small as 10 microns, and can measure blood flow changes in response to visual stimuli smaller than 2 degrees of visual extent. The current proposal will combine measures of both the overall structure of the microvasculature (including the wall to lumen ratio) and fine structure (cellular composition), with measurements of blood velocity, based on our ability to image individual erythrocytes as they move through the blood vessels). By providing visual stimuli we will look at the neurovascular coupling and develop techniques to look at how local regions regulate flow as well as whether impairment of neurovascular coupling is local or global. By combing measurements over space we will measure network changes in the vascular tree and how structure is related to blood velocity. We will also perform a limited longitudinal study to examine how capillary dropout and anomalous vascular structures spread, as well as how local blood flow is altered in the presence of local ischemia and vascular alterations. We will also extend our capabilities to identify capillary wall components using programmable aperture microscopy (PAM). This will extend our adaptive optics based techniques for darkfield imaging of the retina to allow us to image and quantify the cells of even the smallest retinal capillaries in vivo. This combination of measurements will allow us to look at how aging, diabetes and hypertension cause local changes to the vasculature, and in turn how vascular changes alter the delivery of blood to the retina locally. The unique advantage of this cellular imaging approach to vascular disease in humans is that it fills a much needed link between current clinical measures and animal studies. The long term goal is to provide a deeper understanding of why some patients do better than others and to provide a quantitative estimate of the prognosis for severe vascular complications based on an individual's own vasculature. Such ability would allow more specific treatments, ultimately decreasing the cost of health care. Since the vasculature of the retina has the potential to act as a biomarker for advanced microvascular disease in other parts of the body such tools would also be of help in managing the systemic complications of diabetes and hypertension."
"9187022","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes-induced changes in retinal vascular permeability (blood-retinal barrier dysfunction) are a major contributor to macular edema, the most common cause of visual loss in diabetic retinopathy. Anti-VEGF therapies have emerged as an approach to preserve or even improve visual function. However, this treatment is only partially effective and not all individuals respond. Evidence suggests that multiple other factors contribute to blood-retinal barrier dysfunction, including tumor necrosis factor and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). It is therefore essential to gain additional insights to allow the development of new therapeutic strategies. In the search for new treatments, there is increasing appreciation for the importance of protective mechanisms which could counteract key pathogenic processes, with the idea that enhancing these protective mechanisms could delay the progression of diabetic retinopathy. An additional important theme in the field is the growing understanding of the contribution of diverse cell types to diabetic retinopathy, including and in addition to vascular endothelial cells. During the previous funding period we identified Nrf2 as an important protective mechanism in diabetic retinopathy and other retinal conditions, impacting on diverse processes including blood-retinal barrier dysfunction and retinal neuronal dysfunction. An important basis for its action is that Nrf2 counteracts oxidative stress and regulates the cytokine environment in the retina. We also found that pharmacologic activation of Nrf2 is protective in retinal vascular disease processes, with multiple beneficial endpoints including neuroprotection. Taken together, this suggests to us that Nrf2 is a promising candidate for therapeutic modulation in DR, especially in light of emerging evidence that diabetes can impair Nrf2 activity in the retina. Here we propose to investigate the molecular basis for Nrf2's protective effect as well as to determine the cellular context for Nrf2 action in diabetic retinopathy. In addition, we will investigate a promising Nrf2 activator for treatment of blood-retinal barrier dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy. These studies will provide new insights into the mechanisms for Nrf2's beneficial effects as well as provide insights into the specific cell types in which Nrf2 function is particularly critical. Validation of pharmacologic targeting of Nrf for amelioration of pathologic endpoints could lead to direct clinical translation and implicate Nrf2 as a new therapeutic target for diabetic macular edema."
"9187475","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The retinal degenerative (RD) diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions that range from the Mendellian inherited orphan diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) to the genetically complex disease age-related macular degeneration (AMD). With the exception of the neovascular (wet) form of AMD, these diseases remain essentially untreatable. As one approach to both increase our understanding of these diseases and develop novel treatment strategies, we propose to perform phenotypic screens for small molecules that could serve as molecular probes and/or lead molecules for drug development. In our first aim we propose to conduct high content screens (HCS) for photoreceptor (PR) differentiation-promoting and PR neuroprotective compounds using mouse primary retinal cultures, which have significant advantages over the use of established cell lines. As proof of principle for this approach, we have successfully used this strategy in the past to identify compounds that are neuroprotective for retinal ganglion cells both in vitro and in vivo. I aim 2, we propose a variety of secondary assays to characterize, classify and prioritize the active molecules identified in our primary screens. Another PR biological pathway that is sensitive to perturbation is the clearance of PR outer segments (OS). More than a dozen different mutations in the gene for MER tyrosine kinase (MERTK), which encodes the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell receptor necessary for PR OS phagocytosis, have been shown to cause RP. In aim 3, using an assay based upon human stem cell derived MERTK -mutant RPE cells, we will screen for compounds that can increase MERTK-independent RPE phagocytosis."
"9188530","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mortality rate beyond the first year of heart transplantation has not shown a significant improvement in the last two decades. We hypothesized that the failure to improve long-term outcomes may be related to the field's reliance on animal models of rejection that do not capture preexisting or concomitant health conditions present in the human transplant population. One example of a concomitant condition that could affect transplant outcome is hyperlipidemia, a comorbidity that develops in 95% of patients within 5 years. Hyperlipidemia leads to development of atherosclerosis primarily as a result of increased serum cholesterol levels, however it is also now apparent that hyperlipidemia drives systemic inflammation in humans and mice by altering adaptive and innate immunity. We hypothesized that alterations in adaptive immunity resulting from hyperlipidemia may affect transplant outcome. To test this hypothesis we examined heart transplant rejection in hyperlipidemic mice. We observed that hyperlipidemia promotes rejection of allogeneic hearts transplants. Our data indicate that hyperlipidemia has a negative effect on regulatory T cells (Treg) function and alters the T cell subsets involved in rejection by promoting a strong Th17 component that is not observed in mice with normal lipid levels. Together these changes lead to resistance to tolerance induction using costimulatory molecule blockade. Thus, our data show that hyperlipidemia profoundly affects rejection responses and the ability to induce tolerance using clinically relevant strategies. Therefore it is critical to study rejection in the context of hyperlipidemia in order to develop novel strategies to improve outcomes. Our central goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of how hyperlipidemia affects alloreactivity and transplant rejection by testing the hypothesis that hyperlipidemia alters adaptive alloimmune responses by changing the nature of the T cell subsets involved in rejection and by altering Tregs. Our specific aims are to: 1) Determine the mechanisms by which hyperlipidemia alters Treg subsets and function; 2) Determine the role of Th17 lineage cells in mediating rejection in hyperlipidemic mice and mechanisms that shape their response; and 3) Determine how hyperlipidemia promotes resistance to tolerance induction. These studies provide novel insight that will fundamentally change how we view transplant rejection and tolerance by revealing a previously unappreciated effect of hyperlipidemia on rejection, its regulation, and the ability to induce tolerance."
"9189674","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental gap in understanding of the functional and structural reorganization of the brain that takes place as a result of therapeutic interventions. Continued existence of this gap represents an important problem in mental health research because, until it is filled, design of more effective and efficient interventions will remin largely unguided. Our long-term goal is to use non-invasive detection and monitoring of brain reorganization to guide the development and implementation of therapies. The objective in this particular application is to develop a reliable and sensitive MR imaging indicator of brain network plasticity and apply it to study the remodeling of structural brain networks in children with cognitive training. The rationale for the proposed network approach is that brain changes resulting from therapies are not confined to a specific brain region but usually involve communication pathways and this is directly addressed by diffusion MRI connectomics that treats the brain as a network of structural connections between brain regions. The central hypothesis is that diffusion MRI-based brain networks and their graph-analytic properties can serve as a reliable and sensitive indicator of plasticity in children with cognitive training. We wll study brain network changes in 10-18 year-old youths who undergo a 12-week mindfulness meditation-based training of attention and emotion regulation and correlate the results with the behavioral changes according to the computer-based Attention Network Test (ANT). The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to provide a method for monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, guide the development of new interventions, and advance our understanding of how the brain reorganizes as a function of intensive practice of specific cognitive functions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform the development of treatment for clinical populations, such as children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression and anxiety disorders."
"9197984","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Small animal PET studies are crucial in development of new pharmaceuticals and therapies as well as quantification of diverse biochemical and physiological processes in living organism. Visualized and quantified imaging of structures in small animals, however, imposes stringent requirements on the imaging system. Satisfying these requirements simultaneously necessitates expensive approaches and typically results in trading off between key performance metrics such as spatial resolution and sensitivity. The scintillators used in the majority of the modern PET systems and those under development are high density orthosilicate-based materials such as LYSO, LSO, LGSO, and GSO thanks to their high stopping power, fast decay time, non- hygroscopic nature, and relatively high light output. These scintillators are mechanically pixelated to form an array of scintillator elements to achieve high spatial resolution. However, array fabrication with pixels that have small cross-section (e.g. 1x1 mm2) and large thickness (e.g. 15 mm) is challenging and expensive which leads to a number of issues such as light collection problem, practical difficulties of accurate and consistent crystal size, and high cost associated with fine crystal cutting and surface treatment (polishing). In the mechanically pixelated arrays, a reflecting material is inserted between the pixels which leads to low packing fraction and thereby loss of sensitivity to gamma rays. Our goal is develop a PET detector using recently emerged technology called Laser-Induced Optical barriers (LIOB) in that we create optical barriers within the scintillation detector to control the light spread function and hence the spatial resolution. The significance of this research work is that using LIOB, development of high sensitivity PET detectors with sub-millimeter intrinsic spatial and DOI capability is achievable in a very cost effective manner. Our specific aims are to 1) Simulate the properties of laser induced optical barriers and correlate the results with experimental data. 2) Model a laser processed detector and optimize the optical barriers pattern, and 3) Fabricate and characterize LYSO detectors processed by LIOB technique."
"9215263","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Necroptosis (programmed necrosis) is a newly defined cell death pathway that contributes to the pathology of vascular diseases like atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, the causes of endothelial cell necroptosis and its impact on vascular integrity are unknown. The applicant's lab recently generated mice with vascular deletion of the chromatin-remodeling enzymes CHD4 or BRG1 and found that these mutants die at midgestation from endothelial cell necroptosis and vascular rupture. Importantly, transcripts of the necroptosis executor gene Ripk3 were upregulated in Chd4 and Brg1 mutant endothelial cells, and genetic reduction of Ripk3 rescued both mutants from vascular rupture. The objective of this proposal is to exploit these vascular Chd4 and Brg1 mutants to define factors that promote embryonic endothelial cell Ripk3 transcription and necroptosis. The central hypothesis is that CHD4 and BRG1 respectively maintain embryonic blood vessel and lymphatic integrity by indirectly repressing Ripk3 transcripts and endothelial cell necroptosis. This hypothesis is based on the genetic data described above and on the applicant's preliminary evidence that CHD4 and BRG1 indirectly regulate Ripk3 transcription in cultured endothelial cells. Two specific aims will be employed to test the central hypothesis and to identify factors that directly trigger endothelial cell necroptosis. First, the applicant will determine how CHD4 regulates endothelial cell necroptosis in embryonic blood vessels. Cellular, molecular, biochemical, and genetic approaches will be used to test the working hypothesis that plasmin?which is aberrantly elevated in Chd4 mutant embryos?directly triggers Ripk3 transcription and necroptosis in blood vessel endothelial cells. Secondly, the applicant will determine how BRG1 regulates endothelial cell necroptosis in embryonic lymphatic vessels. Cellular and molecular approaches will be used to test the working hypothesis that BRG1 transcriptionally regulates the Ripk3 mRNA-destabilizing complex CCR4-NOT in lymphatic endothelial cells. In addition, Brg1 mutants will be used to identify the lymphatic endothelial cells most susceptible to RIPK3-mediated necroptosis during embryonic development. The proposed research is significant because it will define mechanistic causes and effects of endothelial cell necroptosis for the first time and will fundamentally advance the understanding of how this cell death program influences developmental vascular biology. The results of this work will also set the groundwork for elucidating how endothelial cell necroptosis impacts postnatal pathologies associated with cell death and vascular fragility."
"9223317","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K08 proposal will further Carl Koschmann, MD?s training towards his long-term career goal of improving our understanding and treatment of pediatric brain tumors by investigation of the ability to target recurrent mutations in pediatric glioblastoma (GBM) through a precision medicine approach. Dr. Koschmann is a Pediatric Neuro-Oncology physician scientist at the University of Michigan who has already established a presence in his field. This proposal builds on Dr. Koschmann?s previously acquired expertise in pre-clinical animal models of glioma and cancer pharmacology with new training in DNA damage repair pathway analysis and bioinformatics. By carrying out the experiments in this proposal, Dr. Koschmann will obtain these critical new skillsets while producing data that will advance our understanding of the role of ATRX mutation/loss in pediatric GBM. This research will be conducted under the guidance of primary mentor Maria Castro, PhD and an advisory board of accomplished physician scientists with extensive mentoring success. The career development outlined in this proposal includes educational coursework, integration of Dr. Koschmann into a scientific community, and progressive scientific independence over a five-year period. Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under the age of 20, and glioblastoma represents the brain tumor with the poorest prognosis in children and adults. Treatments for pediatric GBM are ineffective and based on regimens designed for adult GBM, which harbor distinct biology and somatic mutations. Recent tumor sequencing has revealed that the histone chaperone ATRX is mutated in 30% of pediatric GBMs and at least 15 other human cancers. Previous work by Dr. Koschmann showed that loss of ATRX results in impaired non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and increased tumor somatic mutations. However, no studies have explored the ability to therapeutically target these novel findings. In two Specific Aims, this proposal will test the hypothesis that: (1) loss of NHEJ in ATRX-deficient GBM will result in increased sensitivity to agents that target homologous recombination (HR); and (2) mutational burden in ATRX-deficient GBM will generate HLA- recognized glioma neo-antigens amenable to future immunologic checkpoint inhibition. Dr. Koschmann will be ideally positioned to explore these questions through the use of: (1) a novel mouse model of ATRX-deficient GBM, (2) state-of-the-art cancer genomic/bioinformatic techniques, and (3) novel DNA-damaging therapies. This work will build to multiple future R01 proposals, including to: (1) to determine if immunologic checkpoint blockade therapy is effective in ATRX-deficient GBM, and (2) to explore the potential epigenetic mechanisms by which ATRX loss leads to a defect in NHEJ. In summary, this proposal will create highly needed translational data that will improve our understanding and treatments of pediatric GBM. Additionally, this work will provide Dr. Koschmann with the skills needed to create an independent research program that implements a precision medicine approach in the development of therapies for pediatric/young adult GBM."
"9223623","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This project proposes to utilize the multimodal characteristics of metallofullerene  nanoparticles to produce novel combination therapy nanoplatforms for brain cancer treatment  and test their efficacy with in vivo models. The two therapeutic modalities to be delivered by the  nanoplatform are the cytokine melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (MDA-  7) and a ?-emitter, 177Lu, as the radiotherapeutic agent for brachytherapy. MDA-7 has  widespread cancer-specific toxicity and radiosensitization effects, two aspects that provide a  therapeutic advantage while causing less damage to normal tissue. Thus this proposal will  couple the radiosensitizing and killing power of MDA-7 with brachytherapy delivered by a  metallofullerene based nanoplatform. The functionalized gadolinium metallofullerene (f-  Gd3N@C80) nanoparticles will be surface modified to carry both a highly stable 177Lu macrocyclic  chelate and human recombinant MDA-7 protein. Stability testing will be conducted under  biological conditions to determine the overall stability of the nanoplatform against release of  components. Biodistribution of the nanoplatform will also be assessed. This project will test the  multi-modal nanoplatform synthesized in survival studies using a murine orthotopic xenograft  brain tumor model of glioblastoma multiforme. Experiments will be designed to compare the  results versus the independent MDA-7 and brachytherapy treatments delivered via f-Gd3N@C80  nanoparticles. This project also aims to define a novel mechanism of enhanced therapeutic  efficacy through Mcl-1 RNA splicing. The expression of Mcl-1 has been linked to a better  prognosis for GBM patients as well as the sensitivity of GBM cells to radiation and  chemotherapy. Validation of this mechanistic route would allow for direct manipulation of Mcl-1  splicing to be developed as a therapeutic approach.   Along with the proposed research, mentoring and training activities will be undertaken to  prepare the applicant as an independent investigator in the biomedical research.

However, the phenotypic and functional characteristics of these cells remains poorly characterized relative to their CD4 regulatory T cell counterparts, even though some evidence suggests CD8 regulators can be more important than CD4 T regulatory cells. We have been investigating the cellular determinants limiting autoimmune attack in mice against otherwise healthy tissue by introducing and activating self-reactive T cells into a normally tolerant and regulated environment. A key finding is that inflammation in the tissue is quickly extinguished limiting cellular damage to vital structures. Early in the inflammatory process immune cells from the tolerant repertoire are recruited into the tissues harboring autoimmune CTL. Using genetic depletion strategies, we learned that CD8+ regulators are more critical to limiting autoimmune attack in this setting than are CD4+ regulators. Importantly, regulation can be restored in our model by adoptive transfer of CD8+ spleen cells from otherwise unmanipulated animals. This approach identified IL10 and perforin as critical factors determining the ability to limit the damage by autoimmune attack. However, we failed to find evidence of IL10 gene expression the CD8 ?regulatory? cell population in inflamed tissue using an IL10 reporter suggesting that IL10 may act earlier in the process. Furthermore, we found that fixing the T cell receptor specificity of the regulatory population did not ablate their ability to limit autoimmune attack. Accordingly, we have developed the overarching hypothesis that IL10 is essential for the generation of CD8+ suppressor cells and that the mechanism of suppression is through a perforin-dependent killing or inactivation of antigen specific effector T- cells mediated through a TcR independent recognition process. In this study, we seek to acquire needed fundamental information about the role IL10 in the generation and function of CD8 regulatory T cells. Our approach will be to (1) identify the cellular surface phenotypic markers associated with the regulatory cells, (2) identify important sources of IL10 in the generation and function of these CD8 regulatory T cells, and (3) learn where and when these regulatory cells are formed. Along the way we will examine alternative in vitro models to enable efficient definition of the molecular mechanisms giving rise to CD8 regulators and to their ability to limit the functions of activated CTL. Understanding the basis of this strong immune regulatory function could provide insights into how to augment or limit CTL attack for the benefit of cancer or autoimmune disease patients, respectively."

"9242625","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Tissue Engineering and Cell Models Core (TECM) enables DDRCC investigators to address key questions relating to causality and mechanisms by providing novel and vetted experimental models that can be customized to their needs. It was established 21 months ago, replacing the Genomics and Molecular Engineering (GME) Core of the DDRCC. The reorganization of the Core was a direct result of two sequential annual needs assessments indicating strong interest by the membership for more physiologically-relevant experimental models to study digestive health and diseases. The TECM has three major components: (1) A centralized repository and facility for established and primary gut-relevant cell lines, which was originally part of the host-microbe core, but moved to the TECM to centralize all cell and tissue experimental systems, (2) A tissue engineering component that includes customizing and developing intestinal organoid technologies for specific applications needed by DDRCC users, and (3) an experimental systems component that includes in vivo models (rodent microsurgery and C. elegans), ex vivo models, and live functional assays. Inherent to these services, the TECM provides training and education, opportunities for cost-savings through bulk purchases (serum, disposables, etc), and technical expertise that saves investigators time and insure high quality of services. The TECM is inextricably tied to the other DDRCC cores. The integrated Translational Research (ITR) and the Host-Microbe (HM) cores are essential for providing cells, tissues, and patient samples for establishing the experimental models. The Tissue and Cell Analysis (TCA) core provides investigators with the means to analyze data derived from the model systems. Thus, the TECM Core has had great impact in enabling DDRCC members to advance knowledge in the thematic areas fostered by the DDRCC which focus on the study of IBD, host-microbe interactions, mucosal immunology and inflammation. In the past year, it was used by 86% of the DDRCC membership and was used in 195 peer-reviewed publications or 65% of the total (306) DDRCC-acknowledged publications during this period. The TECM has promoted interaction, collaboration, cost-sharing, and efficient resources utilization, and, at the same time, has enhanced the capabilities of our investigators."
"9242632","The Pilot and Feasibility grant program at the University of Chicago's NIDDK Digestive Diseases Research Core Center (DDRCC) is designed to provide a mechanism to promote new initiatives in digestive diseases (DD)-related research. The overall objectives of this program are to support investigations which would allow the development of preliminary data sufficient for funding of a research grant by conventional mechanisms (pilot studies) or testing of an innovative hypothesis which might have important implications or yield significant results for digestive diseases-related research (feasibility studies). Both of these broad aims have been pursued in the context of research focused on maintenance of homeostasis and an understanding of the pathobiology that accompanies intestinal inflammation. In the previous renewal (2005-10), 25 P & F projects were awarded, and in the current period (2010-14), 26 were awarded. The return on investment (ROI) over the past 10 years has exceeded 25:1, in comparison to the previous period from 1995-2004 where the ROI was 20:1. The P & F program remains an important vehicle for promoting multidisciplinary collaboration and a strong supportive scientific network for the young investigators funded by this program. Track I (new) investigators are given highest priority, followed by Tract II (non-DD) and Tract III (DD, new direction) investigators. We are requesting continuing support at the level of $110,000 per year. The funds will be combined with the $50,000 per year in supplemental funding committed by the GI section, bringing the total award amount to $160,000 or $30,000-37,500 for each award depending on the number of awards selected by the External Advisory Board. With the increased award size, the P & F awards are far more attractive to potential applicants and substantial enough to improve the odds that they will be successful in obtaining independent federal and extramural funding. A key feature of the program is the multi-disciplinary nature of the submitted proposals, coming from numerous departments, programs, and institutional affiliate within the University of Chicago network including the two of the University of Chicago affiliates, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL). This large catchment of investigator talent reflects the overall scientific diversity of the research base of the DDRCC. The P & F program has therefore made a difference for many investigators, fostered collaboration and interaction, pushed the envelope of scholarship and discovery, and is one of the jewels of our DDRCC program."
"9173424","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity among both military personnel and the civilian population. It is also reported to be the leading cause of death and disability in the under-45 age group in industrialized countries. Among the soldiers who survive conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, traumatic brain injuries account for a larger proportion of thei casualties than in any other war in recent US history. Furthermore, among patients evaluated at the Walter Reed Hospital, closed head injuries significantly outnumber other penetrating injuries. Most individuals with a mild TBI (mTBI) return to normal performance within a year, but moderate and severe brain injuries are more complex and have long-lasting consequences. mTBI is now recognized to be a major health concern for both civilian and military populations. Repetitive injuries may result in dementia like symptoms where the patient may experience memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression. There are very few current clinical trials in the US or even worldwide which are specifically addressing mTBI, and typically the drugs under investigation were developed for other conditions and have shown very little efficacy thus far, presumably due to the lack of knowledge of the molecular mechanisms which constitute the brains' secondary response to mTBI. These numerous and complex mechanisms may persist for months and even years after the event, and the outcome for the patient depends on these, as well as the type, severity and location of the original injury. For effective acute and long-ter treatment of mTBI, the biological events that govern neuronal repair and neuronal damage and death need to be fully understood at the molecular and cellular level. The tau protein which is associated with neuronal stability in the brain, is involved in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, and is now recognized to be important in the brain's response to"
"9178068","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growth hormone (GH) regulates growth and metabolism by binding GH receptor (GHR), a cytokine receptor superfamily member, in target tissues. This activates the GHR-associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, JAK2, and several signaling systems including STAT5. An important GH-induced outcome in some cell types is STAT5-mediated expression of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 gene and IGF-1 secretion. For six decades, our appreciation of GH physiology has been influenced by the somatomedin hypothesis, which held that GH-induced hepatically-derived circulating endocrine IGF-1 (aka somatomedin-C) mediates GH's somatogenic actions. Indeed, IGF-1 acts via the type 1 IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) to transmit tyrosine-kinase-mediated anabolic signals. However, our novel findings suggest IGF-1R also functions in relevant cell types (preadipocytes, islet ?-cells, osteoblasts, prostate cancer cells) as a proximal GHR-interacting element to augment GH sensitivity, even absent IGF-1 binding. Specifically, we find GH acutely promotes IGF-1R association with GHR and that IGF-1R deletion reduces acute GH signaling and consequent IGF-1 gene expression. IGF-1R reconstitution in IGF-1R-deleted cells rescues GH responsiveness in a fashion that depends on IGF-1R extracellular domain (ECD) elements. Further, a recombinantly-produced soluble IGF-1R ECD fragment containing these elements binds GHR in response to GH and blunts GH-induced signaling and gene expression in a dominant-negative fashion. Supporting our findings, recent reports indicate overlap in the metabolic phenotypes of mice with islet ?-cell-specific deletion of either GHR or IGF-1R, suggesting GHR-IGF-1R interaction is physiologically relevant in cell types that coexpress the receptors, unlike liver that is heavily endowed with GHR, but nearly devoid of IGF-1R. We hypothesize: 1) IGF-1R, by virtue of specific interaction with GHR, augments GH-induced somatogenic and metabolic signaling in a physiologically-relevant fashion. 2) Modulation of GHR-IGF-1R interaction could be a therapeutically-relevant target to promote or inhibit GH actions, particularly in non-hepatic tissues that express IGF-1R and when IGF-1R is aberrantly expressed in liver. Specific aims: 1) Define elements in IGF-1R that allow transmembrane-anchored IGF-1R to augment GH signaling; 2) Uncover specific modulators of GH action based on dominant-negative effects of soluble IGF-1R on GH signaling; 3) Examine functional effects of IGF-1R on GHR action in liver and pancreatic ?-cells in in vivo systems. Proposed studies address a fundamentally novel hypothesis about how GH-induced GHR action is influenced by physical and functional coupling of GHR with IGF-1R and IGF-1R-associated molecules. Our discoveries will enrich the linear GH?GHR?IGF-1?IGF-1R pathway (somatomedin hypothesis), suggesting parallel GHR/IGF-1R-mediated effects, especially in extrahepatic GH action. Relationships of this work with aspects of metabolic regulation and other areas, including growth disorders and cancer biology, could be many and our results may suggest novel strategies to modulate GH action."
"9184051","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed four-year K01 Population Research Scientist Development Award supports the development of Dr. Kari White as an independent social scientist and public health researcher conducting studies of the impact of health service delivery models and policies on access to and use of highly effective contraception, with the aim of reducing disparities in unintended pregnancy. This is relevant to the NICHD mission and stated interest in research relevant to ensuring that women and men have access to safe, effective and acceptable contraceptive methods. Dr. White brings her solid training in the demography of fertility and use of qualitative and quantitative research methods to the study of contraceptive use. Her career development plan has three main goals: 1) develop expertise in methods to evaluate health services and policy from the individual perspective; 2) gain in-depth knowledge of contraceptive methods and exposure to how contraceptive services are provided; and 3) acquire advanced statistical skills and proficiency working with new data sources to analyze policies and health outcomes. These goals will be met through formal coursework, mentoring from sponsors, directed study with expert advisors, clinical observation, and conferences. She will integrate her current knowledge and skill set with those gained through the career development activities by conducting a study of the individual-, provider- and health systems-level factors contributing to the underutilization of vasectomy among low-income men in the United States. Greater use of vasectomy has the potential to reduce income-based disparities in unintended pregnancy, but there has been limited study of why this method is so little used among low-income men. To comprehensively examine the factors shaping both the demand (individual-level) and supply (provider- and health systems-level) of vasectomy, the research project aims to: 1) assess knowledge, attitudes and interest in vasectomy among low-income men who do not want more children; 2) identify barriers to providing vasectomy services to low-income men among providers at publicly funded family planning organizations and health centers; and 3) evaluate whether expanded Medicaid family planning coverage for low-income men increases vasectomy use and identify the characteristics of men getting vasectomies through the program. In sum, this career development award will provide Dr. White the structured mentoring, advanced multi-disciplinary training, and experience conducting original research that will facilitate her transition to an independent investigator leading studies on contraception. These studies will allow her to make significant contributions to understanding one of the key determinants of unintended pregnancy and that can be used to inform clinical practice and health policy."
"9185239","Background: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common among military service members returning from OEF/OIF deployments. While a history of military mTBI has been demonstrated to be associated with increased risk of negative psychological outcomes (e.g., PTSD, depression, alcohol dependence), as well as disrupted brain connectivity, it is unknown how these conditions relate to neurodegenerative conditions, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Therefore, it would be of high clinical utility to identify markers, especially in vivo biological markers, that are present early in the neurodegenerative course, reliably predict further decline, and can be distinguished from confounding factors. Objective/Hypothesis: The overall goal of the proposed research is to better understand biological and psychological factors contributing to progressive functional deterioration among veterans with a history of military concussion. In particular, the methods described are intended to identify veterans demonstrating evidence of worsening cognitive disruption and/or neural degeneration. Improved characterization of long-term, ongoing damage associated with mTBI among active duty service members and veterans may improve the diagnostic and monitoring procedures used in these populations, reduce clinical costs, and improve long-term veteran health outcomes. Specific Aims: The proposed research will address two critical elements: Aim 1: Test several psychological and biological measures for utility as markers of mTBI-related neurodegeneration. (Specific Aims 1-4) Aim 2: Characterize the utility and limitations of self-report measures in the context of mTBI and comorbid psychopathology. (Specific Aims 5-6) Study Design: Participants will be 180 of the 276 OEF/OIF military service members who provided a blood sample as well as complete clinical, cognitive, self-report, and neuroimaging data during participation in one of two prior studies. All participants completed combat deployments as part of OEF or OIF, and the majority endorsed a history of mTBI and/or PTSD. Longitudinal data will be collected on the measures acquired in the prior (i.e., baseline) studies, including clinical interviews of psychopathology (SCID, CAPS) and mTBI, self- report measures of psychopathology (BDI, PCL-M) and personality (MPQ, MMPI-2), neuroimaging (MRI, EEG), and blood-based protein expression. Additional data from these instruments will be collected to specifically inform characterization of reliability. Impact: Given the high rates of mTBI during OEF/OIF deployments, along with high rates of civilian mTBI (e.g., contact sports, high risk recreational activities) among members of the military, better understanding of the long-term effects of mTBI, especially progressive neurodegenerative effects, would be of utility to the identification of soldiers at increased risk, diagnosis and intervention in early stages, and ultimately prevention efforts. The results of the proposed research may have implications for the assessment and documentation of mTBI during deployment, education of soldiers and military medical providers, long-term monitoring of service members who sustain mTBI, and enable more efficient provision of long-term care. Therefore, there are clear potential benefits for active duty military as well as for veteran care."
"9186511","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Addiction is a devastating disorder that affects over 20 million Americans. This disorder has recently been conceptualized as a pattern of maladaptive choice of drug rewards over non-drug alternative rewards. The factors that cause individuals to make such seemingly poor choices are not well understood. The goal of the research proposed here is to fill this critical gap in knowledge, in an effort to potentially help solve the problem of addiction. This will be accomplished by applying recent advances in the field of behavioral economics to an increasingly used choice-based animal model of addiction. Aim 1 is to investigate how the essential values of drugs (cocaine or heroin) and non-drug rewards (food or saccharin) determine the behavior of rats choosing between these rewards. Aim 2 is to investigate how the availability of each type of reward outside of the choice situation alters the essential values of drug and non-drug rewards and affects choice between them. Aim 3 is to determine how the frequency of choice opportunity influences the likelihood of the drug reward being chosen over the non-drug reward in different contexts of overall reward availability. Special focus will be placed throughout the proposed research on those situations hypothesized to promote excessive and maladaptive choice of the drug reward. Answering these questions will provide important information about the major factors that control the choice to use drugs, even when such drug use is detrimental to the long- term interests of the user. This information will be significant for the development of new strategies designed to prevent and treat drug addiction, a major public health problem."
"9187408","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. Despite efforts to improve detection and limit transmission of the bacteria, incidence rates continue to rise. This rise is primarily due to the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which disrupt the normal, healthy gut microbiota and the natural colonization resistance that it provides. Current C. difficile infection (CDI) therapies are effective at reducig pathogen shedding and elimination of symptoms associated with acute C. difficile associated disease (CDAD); however, rates of relapse and recurrence after an initial CDI are still high, possibly due to the collateral damage induced to the otherwise protective healthy microbiota. Therefore, there is a clear, unmet medical need for a safe and effective anti-bacterial agent that can prevent or treat CDI relapse and reinfection after a cured initial episode.?     AvidBiotics has developed specific protein platforms capable of producing potent, highly-targeted bactericidal protein complexes that are well-suited for prophylaxis and preventing bacterial infections. Each platform employs a bacteriocin protein assembly analogous to the contractile tail structures of Myoviridae bacteriophages. They rapidly and specifically kill target cells by binding to a surface molecule via receptor binding proteins (RBP) on their tail fibers, followed by bactericidal puncture of the cell envelope. We have demonstrated the tailorability of this platform by fusing the bacteriocin tail fibers to the RBP containing tail fibers of bacteriophages, thus engineering novel bacteriocins (Avidocins(tm)) against a wide variety of bacteria.     This strategy has produced more than 15 highly specific Avidocin-CD products. Just 6 are needed to target strains expressing 10 of the 12 known allelic variants of slpA present in the C. difficile population. In pre-clinical mouse studies Av-CD291.2, a potent Avidocin-CD targeting allelic variant 4, did not disrupt healthy gut microbiota or the colonization resistance it provide and demonstrated efficacy in preventing antibiotic-induced colonization by spores from a hypervirulent, riboptype 027 strain. While a cocktail of 6-7 Avidocin-CDs that covers >90% of the clinically relevant N. America strain types is possible, it would not be practical. Therefore, e are proposing to identify new phage RBPs, or modify existing ones, to construct individual Avidocin-CDs (or a cocktail of 2-3) with coverage of ?80% of relevant C. difficile strains.     The R21 Phase will be devoted to the construction and pre-clinical testing of a new generation of Avidocin- CD(s) with ?broader C. difficile coverage than the products currently constructed. ?After optimizing Avidocin-CD delivery formulation for mice, we will determine the pre-clincial impact treatment has on ?colonization resistance as well as their efficacy in preventing C. difficile ?reinfection after vancomycin treatment of a CDI episode.?The purpose o the R33 Phase is to develop a manufacturing process suitable for large-scale Avidocin-CD production and to generate preliminary safety data in an animal model. Data from both activities are expected by the FDA in a pre-IND meeting package."
"9187496","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetics of schizophrenia (SCZ) is advancing at rapid pace. An increasing number of risk-associated polymorphisms and variants are found in intergenic, intronic and other non-coding sequence. However, it has been a major challenge to design testable hypotheses to elucidate the potential function of such types of disease-associated non-coding DNA. Many of these sequences are thought to exert regulatory functions, including long range enhancer and repressor elements physically interacting with transcription start sites (TSS) separated on the linear genome by many kilobases of interspersed DNA. We will first construct high-resolution Expression Quantitative Loci (eQTL) maps by analyzing jointly gene expression, and genotyping and epigenomic profiles from publicly available as well as in-house generated datasets and then integrate the eQTL maps with the most updated dataset from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) that provides with genome-wide SNP coverage for more than 35,000 SCZ cases and 47,000 controls, with replication look-up into 70,000 subjects. We will thereby identify SCZ associated non- coding regions that are positioned within regulatory regions tagged with combinatorial histone modification signatures indicative of poised or active enhancers and statistical (eQTL) evidence for long range TSS interactions. We then will employ innovative approaches in neuroepigenetics, including chromosome conformation capture (3C) to map long range enhancer-promoter interactions in human brain collected postmortem, complemented by functional assays with gene expression reporter systems and activity-induced paradigms in cultured neurons derived from reprogrammed skin cells. The multidimensional approach presented here provides a roadmap to unravel the neurological functions of the vast but in brain largely unexplored non-coding sequences of the human genome."
"9188541","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Telomerase is critical for health and longevity, but there is a fundamental lack of understanding of how it is regulated in human cells. This knowledge gap impedes the ability to develop therapies for a growing spectrum of disorders in which telomerase dysfunction is implicated. The long-term goal of this project is to be able to manipulate telomerase in human cells for therapeutic benefit, with a key target being the hematopoietic system. The level of the noncoding telomerase RNA component TERC is a critical determinant of telomerase function in cells. Low TERC levels resulting from genetic mutations cause a wide spectrum of degenerative disorders, including dyskeratosis congenita (DC), aplastic anemia, MDS/leukemia, solid tumors, pulmonary fibrosis, and cirrhosis. What is not known is how TERC levels are regulated in cells, which is an important barrier to developing therapeutic strategies to manipulate telomerase. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand how TERC is regulated in human stem cells including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The central hypothesis is that cis-acting elements at the TERC locus and other factors that function post-transcriptionally act in concert to determine the steady-state level of TERC in cells. The rationale for this work is that deciphering how patient mutations impact TERC biogenesis will yield a new understanding of how TERC levels are normally regulated, which will in turn reveal novel approaches to manipulate telomerase activity. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two Specific Aims: (1) Identify transcriptional mechanisms regulating human TERC expression, and (2) Identify post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating human TERC levels. Under the first aim, ?scarless? genome-editing in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from DC patients will be used to define the function of newly identified cis-acting elements in the human TERC locus, and to reveal trans-acting factors that modulate TERC transcription. Tools and techniques that have been developed and demonstrated to be feasible in the applicants' hands will be used. Under the second aim, the role of an RNA processing factor recently found to be disrupted in DC patients who have low TERC levels will be investigated. Using patient iPS cells, which have been created by the applicant and carry mutations in this gene, the post-transcriptional processing and maturation of TERC will be investigated. The approach is innovative because the new tools and insights now available allow a critical shift in focus from the regulation of the catalytic component of telomerase (TERT), which has been the subject of intense investigation, to the equally important but less well studied RNA component of telomerase, TERC. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to yield new strategies to manipulate telomerase activity in a growing number of hematopoietic and degenerative disorders including aplastic anemia, MDS/leukemia, pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, in which telomerase dysfunction is implicated but for which there are few if any curative therapies.  "

"9192947","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests the next stage in NICHD support for population research at UC Berkeley. The Berkeley Population Center (BPC) capitalized on R21 developmental infrastructure funding to create an awareness of the plentiful population research being conducted on campus among faculty, including junior faculty, who have been historically isolated by academic department. This awareness (and support) led to research and grant application activity. With a foundation firmly set, BPC now seeks to leverage the core strengths of the UC Berkeley campus, beginning with the teaching and research in the Demography Department, as well as population research conducted in the School of Public Health, Graduate School of Public Policy, Dept. of Economics, and other schools and departments. Synergistic ties with several research centers on campus further promote population research on campus, notably with the Center of Economics and Demography of Aging (CEDA), Institute for the Study of Social Issues (ISSI), the Robert Wood Johnson Scholars Program, and other centers. BPC has attracted and connected with over 60 faculty members and other researchers on campus, as well as researchers in neighboring institutions such as UCSF, UC Davis and Stanford University. As a result, the thematic areas in population research emerged from the unique strengths of the UC Berkeley campus: Reproduction and HIV, Mortality, Health Disparities, Inequalities and Opportunities, Behavioral Economics, and Formal Demography. BPC research questions and methods utilized are cross-cutting and innovative. To foster our mission of population research, we propose 3 Research Infrastructure Cores. The Research Support Core consists of two subcores: (1) Administrative and (2) Data and Computing. Research Development is the third core. Implicit in all cores is public outreach. These cores will provide support for BPC affiliates by assisting with the identification of relevan grants, assistance with grant application preparation and administration, providing hardware and software for data analysis, and awarding pilot grants for projects with solid potential for externa funding.         RELEVANCE: The Berkeley Population Center exists to foster and enhance the innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration in population research. BPC's strengths are reflected in the research themes of Reproduction and HIV; Mortality; Health Disparities; Inequalities and Opportunities; Behavioral Economics; and Formal Demography. The goal of BPC research is to optimize population health at the individual and societal level."
"9222419","An estimated 1.5 million people die each year from invasive fungal infections, and many millions more are afflicted by debilitating mucosal and subcutaneous mycoses. Current antifungal therapies have serious deficiencies including poor efficacy, limited spectrum of activity, patient toxicity and the emergence of resistant fungi. Consequently, mortality rates have remained disturbingly high. New and improved therapeutic options are desperately needed to improve patient outcomes and redress the rise of resistance. Yet the discovery and development of new pharmocotherapies remains a frustratingly inefficient process. The objective of phase 1 (R21) of this proposal is to apply an unconventional chemical screening strategy to identify physiologically active, and fungal selective inhibitors of fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis. Our approach will focus upon fatty acid synthase (FAS) and the Ole1p FA desaturase, both of which have a fundamentally different structural organization and functional constitution compared to their mammalian counterparts. FAS and Ole1p are both essential for the viability of infectious fungi in vivo, including the prevalent human pathogens Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. We propose to exploit these targets to develop a new class of efficacious and broad spectrum antifungal therapy. A new whole-cell based approach developed within our lab termed Target Abundance based Fitness Screening (TAFiS), will be applied to identify specific inhibitors of C. albicans FAS and Ole1p. This method facilitates the selection of chemical probes that interact with a specific target protein within intact cells, thereby combining the advantages of traditional target- and cell- based screens into a single high-throughput assay. Inhibition of FA synthesis will be confirmed through biochemical analysis of treated fungal and mammalian cells, and those with fungal selective activity identified. In phase 2 (R33), the antifungal potency, selectivity and ADME properties of lead compounds will be optimized, and structure-activity relationships established. The spectrum of activity of selected leads will also be tested against important human fungal pathogens, and to isolates resistant to current antifungal drugs. Finally, the biopharmaceutic, pharmacokinetic and toxicologic properties of selected leads will be assessed before antifungal efficacy is tested in a mouse model of disseminated fungal infection. Completion of this study will facilitate the development of a new generation of antifungal drugs that can cure invasive fungal infections that are refractory to current treatment options."
"9226543","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Autoimmune diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology that results from the combination of genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and immune dysregulation. There are more than 80 human diseases currently classified as autoimmune, including multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Since they affect up to 8% of the US population and often attack young adults, especially women, their social and economic impact is enormous.  Immunosuppressive drugs are classical therapies to treat a wide range of autoimmune diseases. However, the treatment of autoimmune diseases has been based on non-selective immunosuppressants or cytotoxic drugs that in general offer a limited clinical efficacy. Even more selective immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine A and FK506 possess serious side effects, including acute neurological toxicity and chronic nephrotoxicity. Biologicals are expensive and some patients do not respond to them adequately. Thus, efforts must be made to identify new immunomodulatory agents that are effective through a novel mechanism to circumvent existing side effects and more selective to reduce off-target effects.  Subglutinols A and B are ?-pyrone diterpenoid natural products with a novel chemical scaffold. They showed potent immunosuppressive activity comparable to that of cyclosporine A. We reported the first total synthesis of subglutinols A and B and demonstrated that they show multimodal immune-suppressive effects on activated T cells and possess a significant therapeutic window. We further revealed that subglutinols might exert their anti-inflammatory effects by affecting T cell metabolism which has been yet to be explored as an autoimmune disease target. All together, our data suggests that subglutinols A and B may have great potential for safe immunosuppressive therapeutics for autoimmune diseases with a novel and unique mode of action.  The objective of this proposal is to identify the molecular target(s) of subglutinols to establish their mode of action and to develop subglutinol-derived chemical probes to study the regulation mechanism of immune responses through the following specific aims: (1) Identify the molecular target(s) and mode of action of sublutinols and (2) Determine the key pharmacophores of subglutinols. If successful, such therapeutics and drug targets are expected to be useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and for post-transplantation care, thus resulting in a sustained remission of the disease and better patient outcome."

Data from human and mouse studies suggests that the immunomodulatory cytokine type I IFN and its signaling is associated with malaria disease outcome. Type I IFN exhibits very broad immunomodulatory properties and profound effects on innate and adaptive immune cell activation and programming. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the most specialized cell subset in producing type IFN, and can secrete up to a 1,000 times more abundant levels of type I IFN than any other cell type. Using the Plasmodium yoelii surrogate mouse model of lethal malaria infection that recapitulates many features of human severe malaria, we have established type I IFN as an essential early mediator of immune cell activation that can modulate disease outcomes. We discovered that BM macrophages through functional and physical interactions control pDC activation. In this proposal, we seek to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction."
"9236367","Whiles significant progress has been made in the development of new therapeutics to control malignant melanoma, the overall 5-year survival of patients with metastatic disease remains low in the majority of treated subjects. Thus, there is an urgent need for a more detailed understanding of how immune and inflammatory mechanisms govern melanoma progression in order to enhance long-term durable responses in a larger percentage of patients. Evidence indicates that immune infiltrates within the tumor microenvironment such as macrophages play critical roles in angiogenesis, tumor growth and escape from immune control. Melanomas often use an adaptive strategy of actively reprogramming stromal elements towards an immunosuppressive phenotype. Tumor associated macrophages (TAM) can modify both endothelial and T-cell behavior, thereby regulating angiogenesis, tumor growth and the efficacy of many cancer therapies. Identifying novel pro- angiogenic and immune suppressive factors generated by TAMs may provide new therapeutic opportunities and contribute to a more in depth understanding of how the tumor microenvironment controls melanoma growth. To this end, we made the surprising observation that an evolutionarily conserved RGDKGE containing collagen epitope can be generated by M2-like macrophages, and its expression was elevated over 3-fold within the circulation of a cohort of melanoma patients. Remarkably, this RGDKGE collagen epitope, but not other RGD collagen peptides, enhanced endothelial cell growth, stress fiber formation, nuclear translocation of the Yes-associated protein YAP, and induced a dose-dependent angiogenic and pro-inflammatory response in vivo. Based on these and other data, we will test the hypothesis that the RGDKGE epitope regulates angiogenesis and tumor growth by a novel integrin-YAP-dependent mechano-transduction pathway leading to the initiation of a pro-angiogenic signaling program."
"9236723","7. Project Summary Soon after birth, most infants develop the optimal refractive error (i.e., ?clinical? emmetropia) in both eyes that is then maintained throughout childhood and into early adult life. However, for reasons not currently understood, a significant and rapidly increasing proportion of the population develop myopia or nearsightedness. Because of structural changes that take place as the eye becomes myopic, myopia, even low degrees of myopia, pose a significant risk for multiple blinding conditions. As a consequence, myopia is now one of the leading causes of permanent visual impairment in the world. The long-term goal of our research program is to provide a better understanding of the etiology of common forms of myopia (e.g., juvenile onset myopia) and ultimately to develop effective treatment strategies the reduce the burden of myopia. The specific aims of our proposed research are to determine how visual experience affects refractive development, to characterize the operational properties of the vision-dependent mechanisms that regulate eye growth, and to explore new pharmaceutical approaches to eliminate myopia. Since many of the required experiments can not be conducted in humans, but our purpose is to generate knowledge that can be applied to human development, these experiments will be conducted using rhesus monkeys. Controlled rearing strategies and optical and biometric measurement techniques will be used to determine: 1) the effects of low ambient light levels on emmetropization and vision-dependent changes in eye growth, 2) the influence of the spectral composition of ambient lighting on axial growth and refractive development, and 3) whether adenosine receptor antagonists can retard the development of myopia. The proposed experiments focus on fundamental issues concerning the manner in which visual experience influences refractive development and are an important step in determining how and to what extent visual experience contributes to the genesis of common human refractive errors. More importantly, the results of these studies will potentially provide the scientific foundation for qualitatively new treatment and management strategies for the most common forms of myopia."
"9238851","PROJECT SUMMARY Gammaherpesviruses establish life-long infection in a majority of humans worldwide and are associated with the development of cancer, including B cell lymphomas. The intimate relationship between gammaherpesviruses and B cell differentiation is directly linked to the lymphomagenic capacity of these viruses. To ensure the establishment of long-term latency in memory B cells, gammaherpesviruses drive a unique polyclonal germinal center reaction during early infection. Germinal center reaction represents a stage of B cell differentiation that is characterized by rapid division of activated B cells along with genetic instability driven by enzymes that either induce DNA breaks or mutagenize DNA. It is not surprising that most Epstein-Barr virus-driven B cell lymphomas originate from germinal center or post germinal center B cells. This robust, gammaherpesvirus-stimulated germinal center reaction is transient and returns to near-baseline levels in long-term infected hosts. Importantly, it is not clear what attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. We have identified Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 (IRF-1) as the first host factor that specifically attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center reaction. Studies proposed here test the hypothesis that IRF-1 is the critical host factor that attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion and transformation of germinal center B cells throughout life-long infection. The proposed studies will define IRF-1-mediated signaling changes that attenuate gammaherpesvirus-driven expansion of germinal center response and the relative contributions of B- and T cell-intrinsic functions of IRF-1 to this process. Further, proposed studies will develop a novel animal model of gammaherpesvirus lymphomagenesis. Successful completion of the proposed studies will offer insights into the tumor suppressor mechanisms of IRF-1 and generate novel animal models that will be of value to infectious disease, immunology, and cancer fields."
"9238907","Project Summary Metabolites are sensitive to genetic and environmental factors, and as a result are good indicators of disease or phenotype. The overall goal of metabolomics is the measurement of all metabolites associated with a specific disease, treatment, genotype, etc. Combined with other `omics, metabolomics is becoming indispensable in systems biology studies, precision medicine, food and agricultural industry, and cell-based pharmaceuticals. The major difficulty in metabolomics is the reliable and reproducible identification and quantification of metabolites. Analytical technologies such as NMR and LC-MS can provide hundreds to tens of thousands of peaks from metabolomics samples, but efficiently quantifying these peaks and confidently assigning them to real metabolites remains a significant challenge. The standard approach to NMR metabolomics is to detect 1H, because it is both abundant and sensitive. The problem with 1H NMR is that peaks are often overlapped, making reliable identification and quantification difficult. We have developed new approaches to metabolomics using 13C detection by NMR, both at natural abundance and with isotopic enrichment, to exploit the advantages of reduced peak overlap due to large spectral dispersion of 13C and more robust database matching of chemical shifts to metabolites. The primary limitation of 13C-based NMR metabolomics is sensitivity. We propose to develop a 5-mm 13C-optimized 800 MHz NMR probe made from high-temperature superconductors (HTS) that will improve the sensitivity for metabolomics samples by at least a factor of 3 beyond what is currently available. This sensitivity increase will reduce measurement times by at least a factor of 9x or it will allow us to detect metabolites at 3-fold lower concentrations. These improvements will be coupled with new acquisition methods using 2 NMR receivers and will be implemented on a new 800 MHz NMR spectrometer for enhanced sensitivity and throughput. Based on the target value for 13C signal-to- noise of 9000:1 for the ASTM standard, we expect to be able to fully quantify and identify up to around 130 metabolites in a biofluid like human serum in about 2 hours. We are also developing methods to fractionate and concentrate samples using HPLC and solid phase extraction (SPE), and this technology will allow us to also measure mass spectrometry data on the same samples. We should be able to characterize over 300 metabolites with a 5x SPE concentration, or 450 metabolites with a 10x SPE. This project will greatly improve the reproducibility, reliability, and biological information content of metabolomics. We will disseminate the technology through commercialization or by making the drawings available to interested investigators. Aim 1) Develop an 18.8 T 5-mm 13C-optimized HTS probe that will be installed on a Bruker Avance III HD NMR spectrometer in the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC) at the University of Georgia. Aim 2) Develop new metabolomics applications using 2 receivers with quantitative 13C 1D and simultaneous 1H 2D NMR experiments. LC-SPE will allow concentration and coupling with MS.    "
"9242504","Project Summary  Therapeutic irradiation is commonly used to treat both primary and metastatic brain tumors and can cause a number of late effects including progressive cognitive dysfunction. There is no treatment currently available that can even partially reverse cognitive changes observed after radiation injury. Specifically, irradiation of the temporal lobe can profoundly affect the cellular structures mediating learning and memory. Ionizing radiation has also been consistently shown to activate several neuroinflammatory signaling cascades that can impact multiple neural processes and synaptic transmission ultimately causing disruptions in hippocampal function. Notably, resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes, the key cellular player in neuroinflammatory processes, have distinct embryological origins and also fulfill different functions. The mechanism/s by which activation of the inflammatory response affect cognitive functions after brain irradiation and the specific role of different myeloid cells remain elusive. Thus, there is a clear need to understand the mechanisms of radiation injury and inflammation to develop strategies for preventing cognitive decline following cranial irradiation.  Recent work from our group during the previous funding period has shed light in these questions and revealed specific problems in the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying radiation-induced memory deficits. Specifically our data demonstrates a direct link between CCL2/CCR2 and cognition. These results provide a mechanistic link between peripheral innate immune system and cognition after brain irradiation. In the current proposal we will evaluate the central hypothesis that therapeutic doses of cranial irradiation induce infiltration of peripheral monocytes that modifies the resident inflammatory response and promotes synaptic dysfunction and long term cognitive deficits.  Aim 1: Determine the kinetics and inflammatory phenotype of radiation-induced myeloid cell alterations after single and hypofractionated therapeutic doses of irradiation.  Aim 2: Evaluate the role of peripheral monocyte recruitment into the brain as a mechanistic driver of radiation-induced altered synaptic and cognitive functions.  Aim 3: Determine if temporary depletion of myeloid cells prevent the loss of synaptic function and cognition after single and hypofractionated doses of radiation.  Very little is known in regard to the evolution of radiation induced pathophysiology in the context of peripherally derived macrophage accumulation or inflammation, and how this relates to altered synaptic and cognitive function. Our final therapeutic goal is to modify the cognitive changes observed after radiation injury.  "
"9246663","Project Summary: Antitumor B (ATB), also known as Zeng Sheng Ping, is a tablet made according to modern GMP standards. It contains the extracts of following six Chinese medicinal herbs: Sophora tonkinensis, Polygonum bistorta, Prunella vulgaris, Sonchus brachyotus, Dictamnus dasycarpus, and Dioscorea bulbifera. Previously, clinical studies have shown significant chemopreventive efficacy of ATB against human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and oral cancers. In a randomized clinical trial in patients with oral leukoplakia, treatment with ATB (4 tablets, 3 times per day for 8?12 months) reduced the size of oral lesions in 68% of the patients versus 17% of the patients in the placebo control group (P < 0.01), indicating that ATB may be a potent preventive agent against the development of oral cancer in humans. We found that ATB inhibited chemically induced oral squamous cell carcinomas (by ~60%) in mice and identified several key active compounds that are capable of inhibiting oral cancer cell proliferation. Our published study also showed that several key active compounds were found in the oral tissues and likely contributed to the chemoprevention effects of ATB. However, it is unknown if a key active component (KAC), called ATB-KAC? which is enriched with 50% or more of three active compounds (i.e., dictamine, fraxinellone and maackiain) and therefore better chemically defined for QA/QC purposes, will have a stronger efficacy against oral carcinogenesis than ATB. We will use both the 4NQO-induced oral carcinogenesis mouse model and a ?window of opportunity (WOO)? trial approach to determine the efficacy of ATB-KAC? along with its pharmacodynamic (PD) responses and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and biomarkers of efficacy. We hypothesize that oral administration of a better chemically defined ATB-KAC? can significantly increase efficacy in preventing oral carcinogenesis in mouse models and will have the desirable PK properties and biomarker responses in both mice and humans. Aim 1 will perform phytochemical and pharmacokinetic characterizations of ATB-KAC? and develop a PD/PK model to describe their efficacy and biomarker responses. Aim 2 will conduct mouse oral cancer chemoprevention studies to determine the efficacy of ATB-KAC? on oral carcinogenesis and to identify novel biomarkers. Aim 3 will perform a WOO trial of ATB, ATB-KAC?, or placebo in patients with newly diagnosed oral cancer. This proposal is timely and significant because the proposed WOO trial is important step for the development of ATB-KAC? for future human phase II studies by filling the knowledge gap between biomarkers in humans and those in the matched mouse models. In addition, we will measure the PD and PK responses of ATB-KAC? in the WOO trial and develop a PK/PD model to further enhance our understanding the necessary dose needed for future phase II human studies."
"9246830","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT A considerable body of evidence shows that exercise training induces multiple beneficial changes in cardiometabolic risk factors and that physically active individuals have lower mortality and morbidity rates than their sedentary counterparts. However, there are marked inter-individual differences in the responsiveness to regular physical activity with some individuals showing great benefits while others do not. While the response heterogeneity is clearly genetically determined, little is known about the molecular pathways and mechanisms that contribute to the adaptation to acute exercise and exercise training. The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to ?understand the molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity?. We therefore propose to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which we will collect biological samples (blood, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) before and after a 12-week aerobic or resistance training program in healthy, sedentary individuals. In addition, we will collect samples before, during and after a single bout of exercise at baseline and after training. We will also collect biosamples in highly trained athletes involved in endurance or strength sports. The overarching goal of the program is to contribute to the development of a molecular map of transducers that underlie the effects of physical activity. To achieve this goal, investigators at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center propose to: 1) Enroll and randomize 518 healthy, but sedentary volunteers (50% Caucasians, 47.5% African Americans, 2.5% others; aged 21-75 y; BMI 20-40 kg/m2) in a 3/3/1 scheme to a 12-week intervention trial comprised of two exercise groups, aerobic (AER) and resistance (RES) training, and a control group (CON). The goal is to have 178 completers in each training group and 60 in the CON group (20% attrition). 2) Recruit and enroll 50 athletes (ATH) competing in endurance (n=25) and strength (n=25) sports to serve as an active control group. The ATH group will undergo baseline testing and an acute bout of exercise consistent with their normal training regimen with similar pre- and post-acute exercise samples collection. The AER program will start at 3 days per week of treadmill walking/running progressing to 4 days per week by week 2 with an initial moderate intensity (heart rate associated with 50% VO2peak), then increasing to a more vigorous intensity (HR 75% VO2peak) by week 6. The RES program will be performed 3 days per week and consist of 9 exercises on Universal Gym Equipment, including four upper body lifts, three lower body lifts, abdominal crunch, and back extensions. The RES program will progress from 2 sets of 10-20 repetitions to 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions after week 2. All AER and RES exercise sessions will be conducted under strict supervision by trained staff. Because of the expertise in training studies and translational research as well as the availability of state-of-the-art facilities, Pennington investigators are well positioned to recruit/retain a diverse population, conduct the proposed trial and collect/store the necessary biosamples."
"9225735","Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) regulate exocytosis in cells ranging from sperm to pancreatic beta cells and neurons. There is growing recognition that sterols and the ganglioside GM1 modulate the activity of VGCCs with significant physiological and pathological consequences. However, determining the mechanisms by which lipids regulate these channels, and thereby exocytosis, remains a major challenge in the field. These questions are critical to our understanding of medical issues ranging from diabetes and pain management to infertility. In the field of reproduction, several recent findings have attacked long-held beliefs. Patch clamping data have been interpreted to suggest that CatSper is the only calcium (Ca2+) channel in sperm, as opposed to a model in which multiple channels contribute to Ca2+ transients and waves that culminate in release from internal stores and activation of store-operated channels. The model of the acrosome reaction, in which physical contact between receptors on the sperm membrane are triggered by ligands on the zona pellucida to induce exocytosis, is challenged by new data showing that regulated exocytosis is a process beginning much earlier, as sperm penetrate the cumulus cells. Until recently, it remained unclear how Ca2+ flux and exocytosis are triggered in the absence of contact with the zona. Relevant to both of these controversies, we showed that removal of sperm sterols spurs a functional interaction between GM1 and CaV2.3, an R-type VGCC. These interactions result in transient influx of Ca2+ that promotes acrosome exocytosis in response to a subsequent Ca2+ wave. Mechanistically, we showed that this interaction relies on both the pore forming ?1E and auxiliary ?2? subunits of CaV2.3, and both the lipid and sugar components of GM1. Based on these published data, we now propose to utilize state-of-the-art genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECI) in generating novel research resources to resolve these controversies and further our understanding of how lipids regulate Ca2+ signaling in sperm. Specifically, we will generate 2 lines of mice that express new generation GECIs (i.e. GCaMPs) in fusion with mCherry (a Ca2+ insensitive, red-shifted fluorescent protein), to be targeted to the sperm acrosome (Aim 1) or the cytosol (Aim 2). The advantages of the new-generation GECIs over synthetic dyes and the use of GCaMP-mCherry fusion sensors that enable ratiometric Ca2+ measurements will greatly advance our efforts to investigate lipid modulation of sperm signaling and function. Specifically, these new tools will allow us to explore major questions through future R01s, including the relative roles of Ca2+ influx and intra-acrosomal Ca2+ stores during the signaling processes that lead to exocytosis, and the properties and signaling pathways associated with the CaV2.3 mediated Ca2+ transients. Importantly, these novel transgenic mouse models will enable investigation of these questions in live sperm under physiological conditions utilizing state-of-the-art imaging. Looking forward, we can cross these lines with other genetic models to investigate the activities and mechanisms of function of various channels, resolving major questions about sperm function and fertilization."
"9231853","Project Summary  The project goal is to continue exploring the relationship between experience, expertise, and modular organization in the temporal lobe. There are distinct regions of the brain, reproducible from one person to the next, specialized for processing the most universal forms of human expertise; such as face recognition, speech processing, and reading. Face-selective regions in the temporal lobe have been identified using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in both humans and macaques, and in humans visual recognition of letters and words is also localized, to the same part of the temporal lobe, but more lateral and posterior and in the opposite hemisphere. Because of the importance of social interactions in primates, one could imagine a face-specific region being generated by natural selection, but it is unlikely that a cortical region specific for written words could have evolved, given that humans have been using written language for only a few thousand years, and literacy has been widespread for at most a few hundred years. The fact that most people have intensive early experience with both faces and symbols prompted the question of whether intensive early experience could cause monkeys to develop anatomical specializations for stimuli they never naturally use. The project revealed that intensive symbol training can induce the formation of artificial domains in macaque inferotemporal cortex (IT), but only when they were trained as juveniles, not as adults. Furthermore these artificial domains are localized within IT according to a pre-existing proto-architecture. The proposed project is to probe and explore this proto architecture to characterize the constraints on the modifiability of IT. Previous results indicated that this proto-architecture could be a retinotopic-map based shape organization. Therefore the one goal is to find out whether the proto-architecture is more constrained by shape or by retinotopy, by pitting the two features against each other during the training regimen, and using fMRI after training to find out whether novel domains localize according to viewing eccentricity or shape. The major goal is to use chronic multi-electrode arrays to explore the constraints on the modifiability of response properties of individual neurons in IT, and to look for differences in the modifiability of neuronal response properties as a function of the age of the animal and as a function of anteroposterior location along IT. Chronic arrays will be implanted in different regions along the anterior/posterior extent of IT in animals of different ages. Response tuning across the array will be assessed using a large image set. Then the animals will be intensively trained on a subset of those shapes, and, as they are trained, response tuning across the arrays will be monitored. Chronic array electrophysiology and fMRI will be used in parallel and in conjunction to explore the constraints on the formation of training-induced domains and training-induced expertise, and to ask how these constraints change over normal development. The results should lead to a deeper understanding of how early social and educational experience or deprivation affects the developing brain."
"9233041","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The public health burden of osteoarthritis (OA) is substantial. It is the most common form of arthritis, increasing in prevalence over time. The disability and cost related to the disease are high, and effective treatments for the condition are few, limited to physical therapy, analgesia, and then total joint replacement. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the underlying etiology of this disease and to identify effective treatments for the condition. To date, no credible combined structure and symptom modifying intervention has been identified, perhaps because efforts have been focused on the wrong timeframe of disease. The window of opportunity to provide an effective intervention may only exist prior to the development of OA or early in the development of OA. Studying patients with early disease is challenging, however, because there is no consensus on case definition and symptom assessment in this group. An innovative approach to this problem, capitalizes on the substantial genetic component of knee OA. We will use the parental phenotype for case definition, where the disease is well-established, but our focus will be on risk factors in their offspring, where disease has either not yet occurred or is less well-established. Differences in modifiable risk factors of case versus control offspring could inform interventions that may prevent incident disease or progression of early disease. The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) is an observational study where 4796 participants have been followed for 8 years and knee OA status will be available. Leveraging data already obtained about disease status and the existing OAI infrastructure to access parents of potential participants, provides a unique opportunity to deploy this proposed study. Although studying offspring of participants has the appeal of studying an earlier timeframe of disease, it also has its attendant challenges, including contacting and recruiting potential offspring participants within the framework of the OAI, while respecting their privacy and confidentiality. Therefore, in this grant application, we propose a pilot study to comprehensively assess feasibility of deploying a large scale offspring study and to obtain preliminary data to inform an R01 application to fund such a study. The two aims of this study are (1) to assess feasibility of deploying an offspring study within the OAI and (2) to assess whether it is possible to use known and exploratory offspring risk factors to predict the parental OA phenotype. Obtain preliminary data that would inform an R01 application to fund a larger scale study of the OAI Offspring. This study would break new ground by implementing a novel exploratory study design in a disease that is a major public health problem for which few effective treatments currently exist."
"9240237","Project Summary S. aureus is a potent, opportunistic human pathogen that has evolved in a symbiotic relationship with its hosts and is notorious for its ability to cause life-threatening diseases such as sepsis, pneumonia and endocarditis. In 2005 S. aureus was responsible for more death in the US than any other microbial pathogen. S. aureus is unique in that the organism produces over a dozen fibrinogen (Fg) binding cell wall anchored proteins (MSCRAMMs) or small secreted proteins. Many of these proteins act as potent virulence factors and can recruit Fg and assemble a Fg containing coat surrounding and protecting the bacteria from phagocytosis and clearance. We believe that this Fg containing shield represents a key to understand the unique features of S. aureus virulence including the organism?s demonstrated resistance in several active and passive vaccination trials. Consequently, we propose to characterize the staphylococcal Fg binding proteins, their interactions with Fg and the conformational changes leading to the formation of the shield. We will use X-ray crystallography of complexes formed between the bacterial proteins/peptides and Fg fragments/peptides complemented by extensive biochemical studies to characterize the Fg interactions and determining interactive sites. Preliminary results show that the MSCRAMMs use a combination of a primary and a secondary synergistic site to bind Fg with high affinity whereas a common linear Fg binding motif present in two of the secreted proteins exhibits an amazingly high affinity for Fg. The conformational changes induced in Fg upon binding to different staphylococcal proteins will be identified by crystallographic analysis of intact Fg in complex with staphylococcal proteins/peptides and further analyzed in a mouse septicemia model. Based on the detailed information of staphylococcal protein/Fg interactions, we will identify MSCRAMM variants with altered affinity for Fg and explore the possibility that these exhibit altered virulence potentials. Finally, with comprehensive knowledge of staphylococcal Fg interactions, we will generate mAbs that can inhibit Fg binding to staphylococcal proteins. In the future, these mAbs could be developed to useful therapeutic agents."
"9244451","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  We propose to discover the mode of action of anti-fungal drugs that require group III hybrid histidine kinases (HHKs). HHKs regulate the HOG (high-osmolarity glycerol) pathway and are conserved in fungi and absent in mammals, making them an ideal drug target. Fungicides that require the HOG pathway to kill pathogens are used in agriculture, but are too toxic for use in human patients. The drug target of these agricultural fungicides is unclear and represents a gap in our knowledge with significant implications. An understanding of the actual drug target will unveil a new path to antifungal drug development for patients.  We propose a new, unrecognized mode of action among fungicides. We will test the hypothesis that antifungal agents in the phenylpyrrole and dicarboximide classes, such as fludioxonil, do not act directly on the putative target ? HHKs ? to trigger the HOG pathway, but rather act upstream. In preliminary work, we find that fungicides inhibit nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR); the downstream HHK responds indirectly to elevated nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) levels and converts from a kinase into a phosphatase upon nitrosylation of cysteine 1062 near the HHK receiver domain. Excess nitrosative stress promotes mammalian cell toxicity, an unwanted aspect of exposure to fungicides in the food chain. However, understanding this mode of action will catalyze an unprecedented strategy for developing new antifungal drugs for patients that directly target HHKs, based on the novel pharmacophore at Cys1062 to be studied here.  We propose 2 aims: 1) Investigate fludioxonil's action on GSNOR and the action of structurally related fungicides on this upstream target; and 2) Analyze the impact of GSNO on HHK function as a phosphatase, and the ability to harness this action by screening, identifying and chemically modifying nitrosylation mimetics that induce the conversion of HHKs from a kinase into phosphatase. While the action of fungicides on GSNOR reveals risk, their potency offers new drug development potential in targeting the HOG pathway and specifically HHK. Our work will thus reveal the unrecognized target of fungicides, clarify a new pharmacophore directly on fungal HHKs, and pave the way to new anti-fungal drugs based on fresh knowledge.  The work is significant because anti-fungal drugs with new modes of action are badly needed. Systemic fungal infections are rapidly increasing and only one new class of drug for patients has come to market over the last 15 years. Our work will impact this field by validating a drug target that is unique to fungi for potential development of a new class of compounds that directly target HHKs by converting them from exhibiting kinase activity into exerting phosphatase activity."
"9254979","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Image-guided surgery using invisible near-infrared (NIR) light is in the midst of a renaissance. Multiple commercial imaging systems, including Curadel's state-of-the-art FLARE® system, are available for pre- clinical, veterinary, and human surgery. However, the ultimate success of the field will depend on innovative NIR fluorophores that solve important clinical problems.  Curadel has invented a novel family of NIR fluorophores termed ?zwitterionic.? More precisely, they are geometrically balanced, electrically-neutral, polyionic polymethine indocyanines. Zwitterionic NIR fluorophores exhibit extremely low non-specific binding and uptake in normal tissues and organs after a single intravenous injection, yet have extremely high extinction coefficient, quantum yield, and signal strength. Because of these properties, zwitterionic NIR fluorophores create the highest possible signal-to-background ratio (SBR).  There are two immediate clinical uses for zwitterionic NIR fluorophores that make them so attractive commercially. First, they can be conjugated in one chemical step, through either N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters, tetrafluorophenyl (TFP) esters, or maleimide to any cancer-targeted small molecule, peptidomimetic, antibody, protein, or nanoparticle thus creating a targeted NIR fluorescent contrast agent for cancer surgery. Second, when injected in their simplest carboxylic acid form, zwitterionic NIR fluorophores exhibit 100% renal clearance and elimination into urine. This causes the ureters to become NIR fluorescent for several hours after a single intravenous injection, thus providing surgeons with the ability to avoid the ureters during cancer surgeries of the abdomen and pelvis. Ureter damage, while uncommon, leads to extraordinarily high cost and patient morbidity.  Because of its clinical potential, ZW800-1 was deemed a high value asset by the NCI's Experimental Therapeutics (NExT) Program and was accepted into the first-in-human tract. In consultation with the FDA, the NExT Program paid for a complete two-species toxicology package, a genotoxicity package, and mutagenicity package, all of which were negative (see Appendix). Because of ZW800-1, and Curadel's drug portfolio of over 315 unique chemical entities, the most important companies in the field of surgery have visited us, and most are interested in investment and/or distribution. The message we have received, though, is consistent ? investment will only come after first-in-human clinical trials of ZW800-1 are completed.  In this direct-to-Phase 2 (D2P2) SBIR application, our approach to solve our current dilemma is systematic. cGMP manufacturing of ZW800-1 under ISO-7, aseptic fill-finish including lyophilization under ISO 5/4.8, then a Phase 1A/1B clinical study at our major academic collaboration site, the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands. Completion of the aims will position Curadel to execute a sizeable distribution/investment deal with a major player in the surgical space, and thus cross the ?valley of death.?"
"9392321","ABSTRACT  Infants are more susceptible to noise than adults, and learn speech and language in noisy environments. Visual speech could be one of the most important cues available to infants to compensate for noisy listening environments, but a coherent picture of audiovisual (AV) speech perception development has yet to emerge. Multiple mechanisms underlie AV benefit to speech perception in adults: common AV onsets and offsets provide information about when to listen, correlations between the amplitude envelopes of auditory and visual signals help to distinguish between different consonants, and experienced listeners can use visual/multimodal phonetic representations. Differences in the mechanisms underlying AV speech perception benefit across tasks and age groups have lead to inconsistencies in the developmental literature. In order to form a unified account of AV speech perception development, this research focuses on the development of the mechanisms underlying AV speech benefits. The proposed research will use a hierarchical framework to investigate AV speech perception. Specifically, the proposed research will compare performance across a hierarchy of perceptual tasks and use stimulus manipulations to limit the AV benefit mechanisms available to participants. The aims are to determine whether typically developing, 7-month-old infants use visual speech cues to improve detection, discrimination, and identification of auditory speech in noise and to investigate the mechanisms by which infants and adults benefit from visual speech. To that end adults and infants will complete auditory-only, visual-only, and AV speech detection, discrimination, and identification tasks, matched on procedural details, but varying in the level of perceptual processing required to perform them. An additional condition uses a visual speech signal that only provides information about the onset/offset of the auditory stimulus. The research uses an established, developmentally appropriate, and psychometrically rigorous behavioral testing method, the observer-based psychoacoustics procedure (Werner, 1995). We expect that (1) infants will detect, discriminate, and identify auditory speech in noise better when they can also see the talker compared to when they can only hear the talker, (2) infants' benefit will primarily result from the visual signal providing information about when to listen, and (3) infants will benefit less than adults on higher-level tasks because adults will use the crossmodal correlations and visual phonetic information to gain additional benefits on higher-level tasks. The proposed research will improve our understanding of how speech sound detection, discrimination, and identification interact with vision in infants and adults, and lead to a better understanding of the development of auditory perception in real-world listening environments. It will provide researchers with a context in which to study development in older children with normal hearing and infants and children with hearing loss. It will also provide the evidence-base for recommendations that parents promote and make use of AV skills in support of a hearing-impaired infant's or child's language acquisition."
"9258409","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug and alcohol abuse pose an enormous public health burden on society, with high rates of mortality, great human suffering and incalculable economic costs. Yet, substance abuse is preventable, especially with a deeper understanding of the etiology and sources of individual risk. People vary in their susceptibility to use and abuse drugs, for reasons that are not fully understood. Translational studies in animal models and humans offer several promising leads for identifying high-risk individuals, including those who experience greater reward from drugs. In this project we examine two predictors of drug reward in humans, the personality trait of extraversion, and the sensitivity of the brain reward circuit t monetary gains. The brain reward circuit, known as the Fronto-Limbic Accumbens REward Seeking (FLARES) circuit, has been well characterized in human imaging studies and in studies with laboratory animals. It is comprised of the ventral striatum including the nucleus accumbens, with dynamic interactions with the frontal cortex, limbic and ventral tegmental areas. Using healthy volunteers as subjects, we will extend previous findings that extraversion is related to both brain responses to monetary reward and behavioral responses to drug reward. Then, addressing an as-yet unstudied relationship, we will determine whether the activity of the FLARES circuit predicts behavioral preference and subjective reward (euphoria) with two drugs of abuse, amphetamine and alcohol. Finally, we will test the novel hypothesis that the relationship between extraversion and drug euphoria is mediated by the brain reward circuit. Our long-term goal is to identify the neurobiological and psychological processes that underlie risk for drug abuse. We hypothesize that the trait measure of risk (extraversion), the measure of brain reward and the measure of drug-induced euphoria are closely inter-related, and together represent a bio- behavioral risk factor for drug use. The project involves a unique collaboration combining the behavioral expertise of Dr. de Wit with the brain imaging expertise of Dr. Phan. Our central hypothesis is that sensitivity of the brain reward circuit mediates the relationship between personality and the rewarding effects of drugs. We will use an innovative design that links brain to behavior by coupling functional magnetic resonance imaging with psychopharmacology."
"9270728","Project Summary/Abstract  In the classical approach to immunization against viral diseases, viral proteins are delivered or expressed in the vaccine recipient and it is hoped that the resultant immune responses are protective. For a variety of reasons, such a classic approach faces severe obstacles to success against HIV-1. The Desrosiers laboratory has been investigating a nonclassical approach by which a viral vector, adeno-associated virus (AAV), is used to achieve very long-term delivery of anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with potent neutralizing activity against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 isolates. AAV vectors have proven safe in human testing and are currently the vector of choice for correction of hereditary enzyme/metabolism deficiencies. When delivered intramuscularly, transgene expression can continue for years, decades, probably for life, as long as the transgene product is not viewed as foreign. The vision is that a single inoculation of AAV vector making a cocktail of potent broadly-neutralizing antibodies will provide sterilizing immunity for the rest of the individual's life. Although an antibody may be viewed as a ?self? protein, studies in monkeys have revealed that a host antibody response may occur to the delivered mAb and this may severely limit the concentration of mAb that can be achieved. The Desrosiers laboratory will continue its progress toward minimizing the anti-anti problem and achieving consistent delivery of desirable antibodies using rhesus monkey models. These studies are directly targeted to facilitating development of this concept for use in humans."
