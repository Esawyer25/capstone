"9143362","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are critical health problems in the Veteran community. In the absence of sufficient tubule repair after injury and despite the best medical therapy, decreasing kidney function often leads to dialysis and significant morbidity and mortality. The growing gap between the increasing demand and limited supply of transplantable organs is now the chief limiting obstacle preventing extension of kidney transplantation to all patients and veterans with end-stage renal disease. Stem cell biology, and in particular induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, provides new strategies via innovative advances in genomic and personalized medicine to decode the mechanisms of renal repair and pathways influencing tissue regeneration, to offer an opportunity for future clinical intervention to repair  injured renal tubules or replace failed renal tissue. We address the current limitation in stem cel technology-to delineate and target mechanisms of stem cell maturation in three-dimensional (3D) tissue. To define these fundamental parameters we developed and characterized acellular 3D scaffolds from decellularized rodent kidneys, which allow study of growth and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells toward metanephric mesenchyme, and ultimately a mature renal lineage. Evidence from our group, as well as others, indicate that signals from 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds induce stem cell maturation. Our findings show stem cell differentiation in a geographically-specific manner with maturation and expression of E-cadherin centered around matrix-lined tubules. Our 3D scaffolds are bioactive, consisting of natural tissue- specific  ECM with structural proteins (e.g. collagens, laminins) and growth factors (e.g. VEGF, bFGF) known to mediate renal organogenesis. We will test the hypothesis that signals from 3D renal ECM tissue are a prerequisite to direct proper stem and renal progenitor cell differentiation to form nephron segments. The cellular complexity of the kidney prompts us to specifically focus on tubulogenesis within acellular matrix scaffolds and determine the requirements for regeneration and tissue formation in vitro. We will use two renal stem/progenitor populations: an early kidney-derived, adult renal progenitor cell capable of intercalating into developing nephrons, and a population of pluripotent reprogrammed human iPSCs and embryonic stem cells that differentiate to form early metanephric tissue. Our overall goal using 3D scaffolds and stem cells is to elucidate the elements of stem cell-matrix interactions that drive differentiation Aim 1 will investigate stem/progenitor cell response to modification of the renal ECM in a high-throughput system using small ECM scaffolds to rapidly screen conditions favoring differentiation. In this process we identify the requisite matrix-bound growth factors and test the  role of ECM remodeling by renal stroma fibroblasts. Aim 2 will assess scalability by analyzing the requirements for stem/progenitor growth in larger-scale organ-sized scaffolds and explore tubule formation within a perfusion bioreactor. This system serves as a model for nephron development within a full-scale kidney scaffold and establishes the requirements for stem cell differentiation and scaffold repopulation within normal and diseased ECM. This investigative strategy uses innovative matrix technology to modify tissue scaffolds with fibroblasts and bioactive ligands to delineate mechanisms of differentiation in 3D. Our systematic investigation is highly significant because it will decode the critical factors involved in nephron reconstitutio, which are critical next steps in tubule repair and renal tissue regeneration."
"9126883","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a newly recognized member of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus. The virus was isolated from patients presenting with hemorrhagic manifestations and an initial case fatality rate of 12-30% was reported. Knowledge concerning exploitation of cellular processes by SFTSV is currently limited. Additionally, no vaccines or therapeutics are available against SFTSV. Recently, we reported that the nonstructural NSs protein of SFTSV is a potent inhibitor of interferon (IFN) responses. We also found that SFTSV NSs relocalizes key components of the IFN pathway into SFTSV NSs-positive cytoplasmic structures and that these structures co-localize with the early endosomal marker Rab5 but not with Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum markers. Furthermore, we have found that the viral RNP complex and nascent viral RNA are harbored within these structures. In this study, we will use electron and confocal microscopy, protein interaction assays, and live cell imaging to investigate the source (Aim 1) and role (Aim 2) these structures play during SFTSV infection, and determine the mechanism by which components of the innate immune response are targeted into these structures (Aim 3). The outcome of this research will provide valuable insights into two novel and distinct mechanisms used for viral replication and innate immune evasion by SFTSV. This knowledge will be vital to the rational development of effective countermeasures against SFTSV and other newly emergent bunyaviruses."
"9237328","Osteoporosis is an aging related condition characterized by progressive loss of bone mass and increasing bone fragility that affects many Veteran men and women. Given the tremendous morbidity and excess mortality associated with osteoporosis-related fracture, it is vital to the VA healthcare mission to explore novel strategies to reduce fracture risk. The only current FDA-approved anabolic therapy for severe osteoporosis is teriparatide [hPTH(1-34)], a conventional agonist of the type 1 parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R). While effective at stimulating osteoblastic bone formation, its clinical utility is limited by unfavorable pharmacokinetics necessitating daily injection, its propensity to promote hypercalcemia, a lack of efficacy in states where endogenous PTH is elevated, and the rapid loss of accrued bone mass upon discontinuation of treatment. The ?ideal? anabolic agent for osteoporosis would circumvent these limitations, i.e. it would be capable of stimulating osteoblastic bone formation with prolonged exposure, and would ?uncouple? increased bone formation rates from accelerated bone resorption and renal calcium retention. One approach that has shown early promise is the use of ?biased? PTH1R agonists that stimulate receptor signaling through non-G protein effectors, e.g. arrestins, while antagonizing receptor coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins. ?Biased? ligands are novel pharmacological entities that possess the unique ability to engender ?mixed? agonist-antagonist effects in vivo that cannot be attained through conventional agonism or antagonism. In preliminary work, we have demonstrated that a modified bovine PTH derivative, [D-Trp12,Tyr34]-bPTH(7-34), can bias PTH1R in a manner that dissociates heterotrimeric G protein-dependent signaling from non-canonical arrestin-dependent signaling. In vivo, [D-Trp12,Tyr34]-bPTH(7-34) promotes osteoblast differentiation and survival leading to increased bone formation in eugonadal male and female mice, while antagonizing the G protein-mediated signals that lead to osteoclast activation and calcium retention. Functional genomic analysis of bone from mice treated with conventional and biased PTH1R agonists indicates that despite targeting the same receptor, [D-Trp12,Tyr34]- bPTH(7-34) and hPTH(1-34) have distinct mechanisms of action. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine whether an arrestin pathway-selective ?biased? PTH1R ligand affords specific advantages over teriparatide in terms of reduced side effects and retained efficacy in settings where a conventional PTH1R agonist is ineffective or contraindicated. Our central hypothesis is that a ?biased? ligand that uncouples arrestin-dependent PTH1R signals that increase osteoblast number/activity from G protein-mediated signals that stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption, will likewise uncouple the beneficial effects of PTH1R activation on bone formation from its adverse effects on bone resorption and renal calcium retention in vivo. The project consists of three specific aims, each of which compares conventional and ?biased? PTH1R agonists in a different pre-clinical rodent model of metabolic bone disease. Aim 1 tests whether an arrestin pathway- selective PTH1R agonist will promote net accrual of bone mass when administered by continuous infusion, a dosing regimen under which conventional PTH1R agonists may cause net bone loss through overstimulation of osteoclast activity. Aim 2 tests whether an arrestin pathway-selective PTH1R agonist, like a conventional agonist, will promote accrual of bone mass under conditions of sex steroid withdrawal, but do so without accelerating bone turnover or causing hypercalcemia/hypercalcuria. Aim 3 tests whether an arrestin pathway- selective PTH1R agonist will promote accrual of bone mass in the setting of secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by renal failure, a setting in which conventional PTH1R agonists are contraindicated due to already high circulating levels of endogenous PTH. Completion of this project will provide key pre-clinical tests of arrestin pathway-selective biased agonism as a novel anabolic approach to osteoporosis treatment, potentially leading to the development of novel therapeutics that will benefit many Veteran men and women."
"9223642","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This project will seek to characterize attentional and inhibitory dysfunction in PTSD using innovative psychological and neuroimaging methods, and will focus on a central unanswered question: are increased attentional/inhibitory failures in PTSD driven by an inability to consistently engage task-positive cognitive control networks of the brain, or rather are they due to inappropriate engagement of task-negative brain networks associated with distraction? Thus, this project will identify the neural networks responsible for attentional disruption in PTSD, by using spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity to predict attentional lapses in real time, as well as to predict clinical diagnosis and severity. The proposal systematically explores sustained attention and inhibitory control in the context of fearful stimuli, as well as in more neutral, everyday contexts, using novel behavioral and fMRI methods developed by the principal investigator. This characterization of attentional and inhibitory control in PTSD will help explain difficulties that these individuals have in everyday life, and will be translatable to therapeutic augmentation and improved neurocognitive-based interventions.  The project will also provide training in neuropsychological, psychiatric, and neuroimaging aspects of PTSD. This will facilitate the applicant's career goal to become a full-time, fully-funded independent investigator researching the neurocognitive injuries facing veterans, and allow the applicant to assume a leadership role as a VA scientist and to help train the next generation of researchers. The applicant is wholly committed to expanding his skills to better the lives of veterans. He intends t continue his career within the VA indefinitely. DESIGN: First, the project consists of a task-based fMRI experiment, which investigates the neural signature of sustained attention and inhibitory control deficits in individuals with PTSD. Participants (n=96) will be drawn from a RR&D TBI Center of Excellence at VA Boston- a large, extremely well-behaviorally characterized sample of OEF/OIF veterans with varying degrees of PTSD. Second, the project includes functional connectivity analyses of resting fMRI data, including multivariate pattern analyses, in an expanded set of individuals from the TBI Center. METHODS: The first set of experiments uses a novel continuous performance task and concurrent fMRI, in order to assess sustained attention and inhibitory control, and the effects of both affective and non-affective distractions. Second, an expanded cohort of participants will undergo MRI scans to examine resting state functional connectivity in core attentional and inhibitory control networks of the brain. Pattern classification (decoding) models of functional connectivity will potentially reveal neurobiological markers of PTSD. OBJECTIVES: Aim 1. Neurally and behaviorally characterize sustained attention and inhibitory deficits in PTSD. Hypothesis 1A. Sustained attention deficits in PTSD+ vs. PTSD- will be exacerbated by distraction, and emotional distraction in particular (neutral and fearful faces). Hypothesis 1B. Sustained attention deficits in PTSD+ vs. PTSD- will be characterized by increased distraction (distraction model) as reflected by inappropriate engagement of the default mode network (mind-wandering) and face-specific brain regions associated with neutral face distractors, and in particular, fearful face distractors. Hypothesis 1C. Independent of distraction, sustained attention deficits in PTSD+ vs. PTSD- will be characterized by failure to consistently engage task- positive brain networks, including the salience and dorsal attention networks (depletion model). Aim 2. Examine PTSD-related alterations in intrinsic functional brain connectivity, using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA). Hypothesis 2. PTSD will be associated with abnormal connectivity in the 1) Salience network and 2) Dorsal attention network, associated with attentional, inhibitory and emotional control and 3) Default mode network, associated with mind-wandering and task-unrelated thoughts. These connectivity patterns will reliably predict the presence and severity of PTSD."
"9190214","Abstract  Strategies to restore function in damaged hearts often focus on the replacement of lost cardiomyocytes (CMs). Depending on the approach, the new CMs may be derived through the differentiation of exogenous pluripotent stem cells, the differentiation of resident progenitors, the proliferation of endogenous CMs, or reprogramming of non-CMs to CMs. Unfortunately, CMs generated by these approaches have thus far made poor substitutes for mature myocardium, with deficiencies in both electrical and mechanical function. Studies indicate that CMs from regenerative strategies often resemble CMs of the fetal or neonatal heart, rather than the adult, making CM maturation a major roadblock in the field. This obstacle has been difficult to overcome due to insufficient knowledge of how CM maturation is transcriptionally regulated. Here we propose addressing this deficiency by first utilizing an established genetic model of a CM growth defect to identify and analyze factors that regulate CM maturation. Second, we will combine insights gained from this model with a novel technical approach to screen for novel transcriptional regulators of CM maturation in vivo.  GATA4 and GATA6 are zinc finger transcription factors that play key roles in cardiac function and development. Mosaic double knockout of myocardial GATA4/6 via low dose administration of AAV9-TNT-Cre to neonatal mice intriguingly appears to result in stalled CM maturation. By adulthood, GATA4/6 mutant cells are dramatically smaller than their Cre- counterparts, resembling neonatal CMs. As GATA4/6 proved to be crucial and redundant regulators of CM growth, we reasoned that analysis of GATA4 targets is likely to reveal factors that mediate CM maturation. Therefore, we conducted neonatal GATA4 ChIP-seq to identify likely regulators of CM maturation. In Aim 1 we outline a strategy to functionally analyze the role of two promising candidates in vivo during neonatal CM maturation. These factors, Fhod3 and Daam1, belong to the Formin family of actin binding proteins, which have previously been linked to sarcomere assembly and maintenance.  The striking phenotype of GATA4/6 mutant CMs indicated that transcriptional regulators of CM maturation can be identified by assessing cell size in a mosaic loss-of-function model. However screening factors in vivo one at a time is prohibitively costly. In Aim 2 we propose an in vivo screen that will utilize cutting edge CRISPR technologies to allow many genes to be tested in a single animal. This screen will use the cell autonomous effect of gene knockout on individual CM growth as the readout. This unbiased approach will be used to discover new transcriptional regulators of neonatal CM growth, which is a hallmark of CM maturation. Successful completion of this Aim will allow us to use candidates as new genetic entry points, which can be exploited by ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to rapidly dissect the transcriptional network that governs neonatal CM growth and maturation. Collectively, the complementary approaches of Aims 1 and 2 will greatly increase our knowledge of this maturation network, and will have the potential to enhance regenerative therapeutic strategies."
"9256144","Project Summary Abstract Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care unit is common and highly associated with morbidity and mortality. AKI is an abrupt decline in renal function due to glomerular or tubular dysfunction. The current, most widely accepted definition of AKI from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group, classifies patients based on a maximum creatinine or a minimum urine output throughout their hospital stay from stage 0 (no AKI) to stage 3 AKI. However AKI is a heterogeneous disease with differing risk factors, pathophysiology and clinical outcomes. This heterogeneity may reflect our incomplete understanding of the biology of AKI and likely contributes to the poor track record of novel therapies for patients with AKI. In other heterogeneous diseases, such as lung cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or asthma, identification of sub-phenotypes has led to improved understanding of pathogenesis and has had implications for individualized care. Unlike other diseases in AKI there has been few studies identifying sub-phenotypes. The overall study objective is to categorize novel sub-phenotypes of AKI in the ICU, determine the association of sub-phenotypes with short and long-term clinical outcomes and identify molecular pathways associated with AKI sub-phenotypes. This project accomplishes the overall study objective by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1) Compare sub-phenotypes of AKI either defined by the latent class analysis (LCA) or by a trajectory based approach in terms of their relation to short and long-term outcomes; 2) Identify plasma biomarkers that differentiate AKI sub-phenotypes from a panel of biomarkers reflecting endothelial dysfunction (angiopoietin 1, 2 and vascular endothelial growth factor) and inflammation (interleukin 6, 8 and TNF alpha, TNFR-1). Refining the classification of patients with AKI in the ICU is foundationally essential to further research in this heterogeneous disease. Expected results will allow identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes, allow for inclusion of homogeneous populations in future clinical trials, characterize biological pathways to target with novel therapies and support future research to evaluate genetic risk factors associated with the development of AKI."
"9242322","Microglia are resident macrophages in brain and spinal cord that function at the frontline of innate immunity to respond and repair injuries and diseases. Despite the increasing attention to microglia, however, there are many critical barriers in our knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms that activate microglia and the exact roles of microglial activation in neurodegenerative diseases. This new BLR&D Merit proposal focuses on the role of frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) gene Progranulin (Grn [gene], PGRN [protein]) in microglial activation and neurodegeneration in mouse models of PGRN deficiency and in FTLD patients with Grn mutations. Progranulin is a haploinsufficient gene frequently mutated in FTLD patients. Using global and microglia-specific Progranulin knockout (Grn-/-) mice, we have recently shown that loss of PGRN promotes microglial activation and neuronal degeneration in toxin-induced injury conditions. In our current work, we show that PGRN deficiency leads to an age-dependent increase in microgliosis. In addition, large scale microarray analyses in control and Grn-/- aging cohorts show progressive up-regulation of lysosomal and innate immune response genes, including many key components in the classical complement activation pathway. Interestingly, the persistent neuroinflammation in PGRN mutants most prominently affects the ventral posterior medial (VPM) and ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nuclei of thalamus, which show features of neurodegeneration, including severe synaptic loss and progressive loss of neuronal cell body, Consistent with the critical role of these thalamic nuclei in connection with the barrel cortex and in habitual learning, aging Grn-/- mutants exhibit obssessive compulsive behavioral deficits (OCD). These results raise the hypothesis that PGRN deficiency leads to abnormal activation of microglia and facilitates neurodegeneration in a neural circuit critical for sensorimotor functions. Our overall objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which PGRN deficiency lead to progressive microglial activation, pro-inflammatory gene expression, and contributions to neurodegeneration in a neural circuit that is critical for sensoimotor integration and highly relevant to human disease. We propose three specific aims to achieve this goal. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that PGRN deficiency in microglia cell autonomously activates pro-inflammatory molecular signatures and functional characteristics. Aim 2 will generate inducible microglia-specific Grn (CX3CR1-CreER;Grnfl/fl) to test the hypothesis that PGRN deficient microglia cell autonomously promote circuit-specific neurodegeneration. In Aim 3, we will use pharmacological and genetic approaches to inhibit complement activation, and to test the hypothesis that aberrant complement activation contributes to the synaptic degeneration in the thalamocortical ciruits in Grn-/- mutants. Our results will provide clear mechanistic insights on the role of PGRN in microglia activation, complement-mediated neurodegeneration, and the role of microglial activation in the progression of neurodegeneration in Grn-/- mouse brains and in FTLD."
"9241041","Insomnia and disturbed sleep are common symptoms in mood and anxiety disorders. Depression and PTSD are associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Brain levels of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), a critical neuropeptide regulator of the HPA axis, are chronically elevated in these disorders. CRF has well characterized wake-promoting/sleep-disruptive effects. Previous work from our laboratory and others has identified GABAergic neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus as critical regulators of sleep onset, sleep maintenance and sleep homeostasis. During the previous funding period, we demonstrated that acute elevations of CRF has sleep disruptive effects mediated, in part, by actions on preoptic neurons. We provide preliminary data that the disruption of sleep homeostasis that accompanies chronic partial sleep restriction can be reversed by administration of CRF receptor antagonists. We hypothesize that activation of CRF neurons occurring in response to the stress of chronic sleep restriction disrupts sleep homeostasis. We further hypothesize that CRF effects on sleep homeostasis are mediated through suppression of the activity of sleep-regulatory GABAergic neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus and in the rostral medulla. We propose four specific aims to address these hypotheses. Aim 1 will determine if CRF disrupts preoptic and medullary sleep-regulatory neuronal activity during chronic sleep restriction in rats. Aim 2 will determine the nuclei of origin of CRF neuronal afferents to GABAergic sleep regulatory neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus and the rostral medulla through targeted microinjections in the hypothalamus and extended amygdala of AAV-DIO-mcherry in CRF-ires- CRE knock-in mice. Aim 3 will identify CRF neuronal populations responsible for the negative modulation of sleep homeostasis by expressing channel rhodopsin-2 and hM3Dq excitatory designer receptor in hypothalamic and extended amygdala nuclei that contain CRH neurons and determining the effects of light-induced and chemogenetic excitation of different CRF neuronal populations on sleep homeostasis. Aim 4 will determine if chemogenetic silencing of CRF neurons restores homeostatic responses to sleep loss during chronic sleep restriction. Insomnia and insufficient sleep are common in psychiatric disorders that are associated with and/or exacerbated by physiological or psychological stress. We propose to examine fundamental mechanisms and circuits that might underlie the negative impact of chronic mild stressors on the homeostatic regulation of sleep, with the goal of identifying critical regulatory nodes that can be targeted for therapy. Chronic sleep disturbance can contribute to maladaptive stress and may be a modifiable risk factor for poor psychiatric and health outcomes in PTSD, depression and other disorders."
"9241529","The most common form of prostate cancer, adenocarcinoma, is a major healthcare problem facing Veterans. Prostate cancer is a hormonally driven disease in that it is primarily dependent on androgens for survival and propagation. Androgens provide such survival signals by interacting with androgen receptors (AR) within the prostate cancer cells. Since the testes are the primary source of androgenic steroids, the standard approach to treating advanced prostate cancer is to minimize gonadal production of androgens so as to disrupt androgen/AR signaling. Thus, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay of treating metastatic disease, and in conjunction with radiation, is also an integral part of treating locally advanced/high risk prostate cancer. Although initially effective, ADT is not curative, and the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer progress on ADT within a couple of years. Patients who fail ADT are deemed to have castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Such patients may, at least initially, respond to further manipulation of the androgen/AR axis since this signaling pathway is often restored in ADT-failing patients. Hence, considerable efforts have been made to further target this pathway by developing newer generation of androgen biosynthesis and AR inhibitors. This strategy has proven to be beneficial, but again for a limited period of time. The other major treatment for advanced PC is docetaxel- based chemotherapy, which is generally used in men with progressive CRPC. Remarkably, to date, no other agent added to docetaxel has shown to provide better outcomes than single agent docetaxel, which again provides disease control for a limited period of time. Given these challenges, our goal is to use well-defined cell culture models of prostate cancer that encompass a range of disease states to study and interrogate certain ?nodes? that integrate specific components of the prostate cancer metabolome. We will target key mediators that regulate and interact with proliferative/anabolic and anti-proliferative/catabolic signals in prostate cancer cells. More specifically, we will study and define interactions between the proliferative erbB-PI3K-Akt-mediated anabolic and the anti-proliferative AMPK- mediated catabolic pathways in AR-expressing and non-AR-expressing prostate cancer cells. For these studies, we will utilize agents that are already in clinical use or in active clinical development, which will facilitate the translation of this work to the clinic if the pre-clinical studies are successful. In other studies, knock down via siRNA or shRNA of some of these key regulatory mediators will provide additional mechanistic insights into the interacting and feedback signals of the prostate cancer metabolome in treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant prostate cancer cells. We will determine the effects of specific treatments or treatment combinations on the sensitive and resistant prostate cancer cells via metrics that assess drug-drug interactions (synergistic, additive, antagonistic), cell proliferation/growth inhibition, cell cycling and/or cell apoptosis. We will extend some of the studies to SCID-mouse based xenografts to help further define anti-tumor activity and potential treatment-related toxicities in the vivo setting. We believe these combinations of studies, taken together, will have direct clinical relevance, and may help in the development of multi-modal treatments for prostate cancer."
"8970692","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Obesity is not only highly prevalent among Americans, but even more so among veterans using VA medical facilities. Failure to assist veterans in managing weight and sedentary lifestyle affects current treatment and increases future demand for VA health care services. Decreased muscle mass with aging and the need to carry extra mass due to obesity make it particularly difficult for obese older veterans to function independently and results in frailty leading to increased nursing home admissions and increased morbidity and mortality. Data from preliminary studies showed that lifestyle therapy resulting in weight loss in this understudied population improves physical function and ameliorates frailty. However, this improvement in physical function is modest at best and most obese older adults remain physically frail. More importantly, there are concerns that lifestyle therapy may exacerbate underlying sarcopenia and osteopenia from weight loss- induced loss of lean body mass and bone mineral density (BMD). As a result, most geriatricians are reluctant to recommend lifestyle therapy that includes weight loss in obese frail elderly patients although the combination of weight loss and exercise is recommended as part of standard care for obese patients in general. Thus, it is not surprising that among veterans, the MOVE (Managing Overweight/Obese Veterans) program does not have any guidelines for eligible veterans if they are 70 or older.  In addition to overeating and lack of exercise, age-related decline in anabolic hormone (i.e. testosterone) may contribute to sarcopenia and osteopenia, which in turn is exacerbated by obesity. Indeed, our preliminary studies discovered that obese older men had markedly low levels of serum testosterone at baseline which remained low throughout the duration of lifestyle therapy. Because testosterone replacement therapy has been shown to increase muscle mass and BMD, it is therefore likely that concomitant testosterone replacement during lifestyle therapy in obese older adults would preserve lean body mass and BMD, and reverse frailty. Accordingly, the optimal management to the problem of sarcopenic obesity and frailty might require a comprehensive approach of a combination of lifestyle intervention and the correction of anabolic hormone deficiency. Therefore, the primary goal of this proposal is to conduct a randomized, comparative efficacy, double-blind, placebo-controlled (for testosterone) trial of the effects of 1) lifestyle therapy (1% diet-induced weight loss and exercise training) + testosterone replacement therapy versus 2) lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement (testosterone placebo) in obese (BMI e 30 kg/m2) older (age e 65 yrs) male veterans. We hypothesize that 1) lifestyle therapy + testosterone replacement will cause a greater improvement in physical function than lifestyle therapy without concomitant testosterone replacement; 2) lifestyle therapy + testosterone replacement will cause a greater preservation of fat-free mass and thigh muscle volume than lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement, 3) lifestyle therapy + testosterone replacement will cause a greater preservation in BMD and bone quality than lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement, and 4) lifestyle therapy + testosterone replacement will cause a greater reduction in intramuscular proinflammatory cytokines than lifestyle therapy without testosterone replacement. Our overarching hypothesis across aims is that a multifactorial intervention by means of lifestyle therapy plus testosterone replacement will be the most effective approach for reversing sarcopenic obesity and frailty in obese older male adults, as mediated by their additive effects in suppressing chronic inflammation, and stimulating muscle and bone anabolism.  Obesity in older adults, including many aging veterans, is a major public health problem. In fact, the public health success that has occurred in recent years could be in danger if lifestyles of older adults are neglected. The novel health outcomes and mechanistic-based data generated from this proposed RCT will have important ramifications for the standard of care for this rapidly increasing segment of the aging veteran population."
"9239811","Cardiovascular disease increases markedly with advancing age in our Veteran population. In aging, myocardial injury is increased during ischemia (ISC)-reperfusion (REP) and leads to heart failure. Mitochondrial-driven injury during ISC-REP in aged hearts is mediated by the electron transport chain (ETC) due to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damage to the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). Most therapeutic strategies that effectively decrease cardiac injury in younger hearts fail in aged hearts. In contrast, we found that a transient, reversible inhibition of ETC complex I during early REP decreased injury in the aged heart. The key mechanism and target of protection at the cellular level that mediates ETC-driven protection remains a critical unanswered question.  In addition to mitochondria (MITO) damage, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to cardiac injury. MITO and ER are juxtaposed through shared structures of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM). MAM contribute a critical role in calcium regulation and lipid metabolism between MITO and ER. Disruption of MAM integrity likely mediates pathologic ?cross talk? between ER and MITO and increases cardiac injury. We found that CL exists in MAM and the ER with a composition distinct from MITO. Our previous work showed that CL content in MITO is decreased and exhibits an increase in oxidized CL content following ISC-REP in the aged heart. ER is a key site for the remodeling/repair of damaged CL. We hypothesize that CL is a key mediator of the ?cross talk? between MITO and ER via the MAM, and that trafficking of damaged CL to ER via the MAM is a mediator of MAM disruption in the aged heart during ISC-REP.  Age-induced ETC defects increase ROS production. MITO ROS can damage MAM and activate ER stress responses. We found that aging augments cardiac ER stress. MAM are uniquely positioned to sustain damage from both MITO and ER. The increased ROS from aged heart MITO may damage CL in the MAM and activate ER stress. We will evaluate the role of primary MITO dysfunction at baseline and then following ISC and early REP to MAM damage and CL modification in Aim 1. The role of ETC inhibition to protect MAM during ISC-REP is studied (Aim 1).  The response of MAM and ER to ISC-REP in the aged heart is unknown (Aim 2). Acute, transient complex I blockade with a reversible inhibitor decreases injury in aged hearts. We found that metformin inhibits complex I in a dose-dependent manner, especially in ISC-damaged heart MITO. Next, we showed that metformin treatment only at REP in doses that inhibit complex I decreases infarct size in vivo following 24 hrs. REP. We hypothesize that modulation of complex I at REP in aged hearts will attenuate damage to the MAM with a subsequent decrease in ER stress that, in turn, minimizes the generation of dysfunctional MITO and cardiac injury. The partial inhibition of complex I is studied as a new upstream therapeutic intervention to attenuate cardiac injury and minimize post-infarction heart failure development in aged hearts (Aim 3)."
"9138377","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          White matter (WM) injury, characterized by demyelination and loss of axonal integrity, is an important cause of long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury (TBI). A persistent pro-inflammatory microenvironment after TBI is considered one underlying mechanism that hinders oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPCs) differentiation and maturation into myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). Accumulating evidence suggests that the different functional phenotypes of microglia/macrophages contribute considerably to the regulation of inflammatory status of injured WM and ultimately impact the WM integrity. Specifically, alternatively activated M2 microglia are essential for remyelination and WM repair because they resolve local inflammation, clear broken myelin sheath or cellular debris, and provide trophic factors that promote OPC differentiation.  Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is thus far the best characterized inducer for M2 polarization of microglia/macrophages; however, its role in microglia regulation in WM and long term outcomes after TBI is not known. Our preliminary results show that post-treatment with IL-4 nanoparticle through intranasal delivery increased IL-4 levels in the brain and improved long-term neurological functions after controlled cortical impact (CCI). Remarkably, IL-4 treatment enhanced post-CCI WM functional integrity, as shown by increased amplitude of action potential conduction in myelinated fibers. We have found in vitro that in addition to promoting M2 polarization, IL-4 directly induces the differentiation of primary OPCs into mature OLs at nanomolar concentrations and that this effect of IL-4 on OPCs is mediated through the activation of PPAR?.  In this proposal, we will focus on the novel action  of IL-4 on WM integrity and explore the underlying mechanisms. We will test the overarching hypothesis that IL-4 promotes WM integrity and long-term neurological recovery after TBI by dual mechanisms, in that it 1) promotes OPC differentiation/ maturation via PPAR? activation and 2) potentiates microglia/macrophage polarization toward the beneficial M2 phenotype, which is essential for remyelination and WM repair in demyelinating brains. The Specific Aims to be tested are: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that IL-4 post-treatment enhances WM integrity and long-term neurological recovery after TBI. IL-4 will be delivered into the brain by repeated intranasal administrations after CCI. The endpoints for assessment include neurological outcomes and various markers for WM integrity. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that IL-4 induces OPC differentiation into mature OLs and promotes axonal remyelination via PPAR? activation. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that IL-4 potentiates microglia/macrophage polarization into the inflammation-resolving, tissue repair-enhancing M2 phenotype and restores a healthy microenvironment for efficient WM repair. The success of this study will identify a novel immunotherapy to enhance rehabilitation and therefore improve quality of life for veterans suffering TBI."
"9223635","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Genomic DNA is the predominant target of many chemo- and radio- therapies, however these therapies are genotoxic and non-specific. Small molecules that interact with DNA without genotoxicity and with sequence specificity could be a significant advance over conventional DNA-targeted therapeutics. Pyrrole-Imidazole (Py- Im) polyamides are a class of non-covalent DNA-binding small molecules with programmable sequence recognition and high affinity. Sequence preference is directed by side-by-side pairings of aromatic amino acids in the minor groove that can distinguish the four Watson-Crick base pairs. Polyamide-DNA binding does not result in genotoxicity and sequence specificity is programmable. This distinguishes these molecules from conventional DNA-targeted therapeutics. As a research-track resident and visiting postdoctoral researcher in Peter Dervan's laboratory, I used this technology platform to target transcription in prostate cancer. He developed eight-ring hairpin-polyamides that target the Androgen Receptor (AR) AR response element (ARE) sequence 5'-WGWWCW-3' (W=A or T). These polyamides reduce occupancy of AR in nuclear chromatin, transcription by RNA Polymerase II (RNAP2), and strongly suppress castrate-sensitive prostate cancer xenografts with minimal systemic toxicity in mice. This work has given rise to three related hypotheses that form the basis for the research strategy of this CDA-2 proposal: (1) Because ARE-targeted polyamides interfere with AR-ARE binding by targeting the DNA rather than the ligand binding domain of AR, these molecules should retain efficacy against castrate-resistant prostate tumors that over-express AR, and castrate resistant prostate tumors with AR splice variants which lack the ligand binding domain and are resistant to all clinically used anti-androgens (including second- generation anti-androgens like enzalutamide). (2) Because polyamide-DNA binding interferes with AR-ARE binding, we hypothesize that polyamides can be used to modulate AR-directed chromatin structure in prostate cancer cells. This is important because AR-directed chromatin structure, in concert with ionizing radiation, influences the formation of additional genetic changes (such as formation of the TMPRSS2-ERG translocation) that are drivers of prostate cancer progression. (3) Because RNAP2 is required for DNA damage repair, and polyamide-treatment transiently decreases levels of this protein, we hypothesize that polyamides may sensitize cells to ionizing radiation. These hypotheses are explored Aims 1, 2, and 3, respectively. My mentors are all investigators with proven track records in the mentorship of academicians. My primary mentor, Matthew Rettig MD, is chief of hematology-oncology at the West LA VA and leads a productive, well- funded basic and translational research lab focused on prostate cancer. His co-mentors Peter Dervan (chemical biology) and William McBride (radiobiology) are renown in their respective fields. The proposal builds upon the applicants' prior work with co-mentor Peter Dervan PhD but expands into new areas - clinically relevant applications in advanced prostate cancer, justifying primary mentorship with Matthew Rettig MD, and in radiobiology, justifying co-mentorship with William McBride PhD. I have explicit support by his mentors in carrying forth these research topics into his independent career. The overall goal for the field of Py-Im polyamides is clinical application for advanced prostate cancer, which is a highly relevant goal for the health of American Veterans."
"9050229","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a severe disease characterized by a rapid loss in renal function leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Frequent causes of AKI include ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and acute drug or toxicant exposure. Despite attempts to develop new therapeutic strategies to treat AKI, few have been successful, and mortality has remained unchanged for several decades. Therefore, novel pathways and novel targets must be examined for the development of beneficial therapies for AKI. It has been shown that renal proximal tubule cells (RPTC) exhibit severe mitochondrial dysfunction following toxicant exposure or I/R injury. Mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbates cell injury, impairs energy-dependent repair, and leads to end organ kidney damage and failure in a variety of tissues. Our laboratory has demonstrated persistent mitochondrial dysfunction and depletion of mitochondrial proteins following renal I/R injury that correlates with sustained renal  dysfunction in mice. We have also demonstrated that injured renal proximal tubules can recover if they are induced to generate new mitochondria through mitochondrial biogenesis (MB). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1? (PGC-1?) is thought to be the master regulator of MB, and is enriched in tissues with high metabolic demand, such as the kidney. Recently, we determined that during I/R-induced AKI the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is activated (phosphorylated) early and sustained over time. ERK1/2 has been shown to become phosphorylated due to ischemia in various tissues with ROS being a main instigator of activation. We have shown in RPTC that inhibition of ERK1/2, with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib, PGC- 1? mRNA is increased under control conditions, in addition to showing trametinib inhibits ERK1/2 in mouse renal cortex after intraperitoneal injections. The role of ERK1/2 in PGC-1? and mitochondrial function has received little attention, despite being the most studied MAPK. We hypothesize that ERK1/2 regulates renal PGC-1?, MB, and mitochondrial homeostasis under control conditions and that ERK1/2 activation following renal I/R suppresses PGC-1? transcription and MB, and contributes to both mitochondrial and renal dysfunction. This hypothesis will be addressed through the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will address the role of ERK1/2 signaling on PGC-1?, MB and mitochondrial homeostasis under control conditions and following oxidant injury in primary cultures of RPTC. Pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA technology will confirm the relevant signaling pathways for ERK1/2 activation and ERK1/2 actions on PGC-1?, MB and mitochondrial homeostasis. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of ERK1/2 signaling in PGC-1?, MB and mitochondrial homeostasis in the renal cortex of naïve mice. Aim 3 will investigate the role of ERK1/2 signaling on mitochondrial and renal dysfunction in I/R- induced AKI in mice."
"9189982","Summary  Hepatitis B is a global health problem with ~360-400 million chronically infected patients. These individuals can develop fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma resulting frequently in death. A prophylactic vaccine is available and there are anti-HBV drugs that can suppress viremia but there is no cure. The causative agent of hepatitis B is the hepatitis B virus (HBV), a small double stranded DNA virus (3.2 kb genome) with four overlapping open reading frames (ORF's), which produces 4 gene products. The lack of a small animal model for HBV has hampered the study of HBV and the development of more effective therapies. HBV has a narrow host range infecting only humans and chimpanzees. The basis for this highly restricted species tropism is not understood and is the focus of my studies.  Previous data demonstrate that while infectious HBV virions assemble and are released from mouse cells, viral entry and genome replication are not supported in this species. It is my goal to systematically dissect blocks in the HBV life-cycle focusing here on HBV uptake in rodent cells. Recently, the human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (hNTCP) has been identified as a receptor for HBV and HDV entry. Expression of hNTCP in murine cells will facilitate the uptake of hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a satellite virus that uses the HBV envelope proteins to produce infectious virions, but not HBV. This suggests that there are either additional human host factors besides hNTCP necessary for HBV entry or that there are murine dominant negative factors that restrict HBV uptake.   The purpose of this study is to understand the restrictive tropism of HBV and to identify factors that are necessary for entry and to understand their function. The proposed study will result in several significant advancements. First, the development of a novel HBV reporter systems will be created to demonstrate two important principles, 1) their utility as a reporter for HBV entry, and 2) the ability to express heterologous proteins within a HBV virion. Secondly, a genetic screen will be performed to identify additional human host factors besides hNTCP that are necessary for HBV uptake. Collectively, the successful completion of this project will result in novel tools to investigate HBV entry and the identification of human host factors necessary for HBV entry. The identification and characterization of additional human host factors that are important for HBV uptake will form the blue-print to create a mouse model with inheritable susceptibility to HBV infection. This model could be used for testing of novel therapies.  "
"9174071","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a prevalent and debilitating disease without therapies that alter disease progress and is currently managed with symptom-modifying therapies that are only modestly effective. We propose a randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial of pulsed low-intensity ultrasound (PLIUS) as a novel yet well-justified treatment that could fundamentally alter OA management.  OA affects almost 27 million Americans with an estimated annual cost of over $80 billion. The prevalence of OA is increasing rapidly. Estimates suggest that about 60 million Americans will be affected by 2030. Still greater prevalence is seen in members of the armed services, making it a disease of special importance to the Department of Veterans Affairs. OA is the leading cause of lower extremity pain and disability in older age and is the leading indication for total knee replacement (TKR), with the number of TKR procedures having more than doubled over the last decade. The increasing burden of OA is largely because available medical management addresses only pain with long-term efficacy that is marginal at best. In spite of substantial progress in understanding the pathogenesis of OA, no effective disease modifying interventions have been established.  Degenerative articular cartilage is central to the pathogenesis of OA, however, articular cartilage has limited capacity for repair. Thus, the development of OA therapeutics that focus on cartilage regeneration and repair strategies are of great importance. A large body of pre-clinical work has demonstrated the anabolic effect of mechanical stimulation on chondrocyte metabolism. Published literature from pre-clinical and clinical bone fracture and pre-clinical cartilage research indicate that effective mechanical stimulation can be delivered via PLIUS. These consistently positive data affirm the need to investigate the potential of PLIUS as an important intervention for treatment of OA.  We propose a Phase IIa, multi-center, randomized, sham-controlled, parallel, double-blind trial with a prerandomization sham run-in period to determine if PLIUS is potentially more effective than sham as a symptom- and structure-modifying intervention in patients with early OA of the knee. PLIUS will be applied using an FDA-approved device already in clinical use for bone fracture healing. The study consists of three periods: a 28-day Screening Period, a four week Prerandomization Sham Run-in Period and a 48-Week Sham-controlled Treatment Period. The three recruiting centers, the Salt Lake City, Pittsburgh, and San Diego Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, have extensive experience in successfully conducting OA trials. Over a 23-month recruitment period, 178 patients with clinical and relatively early stage radiographic knee OA meeting entry criteria will be enrolled into the pre-randomization sham run- in period. A total of 160 patients who successfully completed the run-in period and continue to meet entry criteria will be randomized into the sham-controlled treatment period. All patients will be followed in the treatment period for 48 weeks, which is the time point for assessment of the co-primary outcomes of symptom relief, as assessed by the OMERACT-OARSI Responder Criteria, and structural modification, as assessed by MRI-determined medial femoral condyle cartilage thickness. Emerging data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) suggests that this is a sensitive and specific measure for structural progression of OA. Innovative and exploratory disease markers, including subchondral bone marrow lesions and soluble serum and urine biomarkers for OA will also be evaluated, along with more traditional outcomes such as the WOMAC OA Index and radiographic joint space narrowing.  The pre-clinical data supporting this study are described in the Research Plan. This project is a translational bench-to-bedside proposal targeting a highly debilitating, prevalent, and costly disease for which current treatment options are exceedingly limited. We have assembled an outstanding collaborative team of clinical scientists in leading OA centers within the Department of Veterans Affairs. If this intervention is successful and subsequently confirmed as an effective treatment for OA in a pivotal trial, it could fundamentally change the standard of care for this highly prevalent and debilitating disease, potentially improving the quality of life for tens of millions of veterans and other Americans."
"9191888","Project Summary/ Abstract  Rape and sexual assault are common experiences on the university campus in the United States; approximately 20% of women experience attempted or completed rape or sexual assault while in college1,2 and approximately 18% of first-year undergraduate women report having experienced attempted or completed rape or sexual assault since age 14.3,4 The field currently lacks experimental studies that investigate how different methodological approaches affect sexual violence (SV) disclosure. Testing theoretically-based hypotheses via experimental design will advance the field of SV measurement by establishing an evidence base founded upon causal inference.  Using the conceptual model for the relationship of social support to health,5 we propose to investigate the measurement issues that affect disclosure of SV via survey among first-year undergraduate women to achieve the following aims: Aim 1. Conduct a randomized 2x2 factorial survey experiment, varying mode of administration (face-to-face interview vs. computer-assisted self-interview) and introductory language (supportive vs. neutral) to understand factors associated with disclosure. Aim 2. Examine how social support affects satisfaction with survey participation. Aim 3. Explore how social support in everyday life influences the disclosure of SV and reactions to participation in the survey using structural equation modeling.  In order to achieve these aims, we will enroll 400 first-year undergraduate women at Emory University, who are at least 18 years old, using a census approach. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups as outlined in Aim 1. Participants will complete a survey on topics that include: demographic background, perceived social support, experiences of SV, social reactions to disclosure of SV, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, social desirability, and reactions to research participation. We will use logistic and linear regression, as well as structural equation modeling to analyze the data.  To our knowledge, this study is the first to operationalize and systematically test the provision of social support within a measurement environment. The factorial design tests two forms of social support, either or both of which could be implemented if proven to facilitate disclosure and/or reduce survivors' negative reactions to survey participation. Given the immediate and long-term mental health benefits associated with a SV disclosure that is met with social support, this proposal offers a significant innovation to SV measurement. Conceptually, this study unites the literature on best practice methodology from research within the United States and in low- and middle-income countries6-13 by testing face to face interviewing, as ethical best practice. This proposal would make a timely and novel contribution to the field of SV measurement, informing best practice for data collection in the White House Task Force Campus Climate Surveys, and its findings could be applied to efforts related to SV surveillance and screening.  "
"9205179","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           As a new addition to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5), Hoarding Disorder (HD) is defined by persistent difficulty parting with possessions due to distress associated with discarding, urges to save, and/or difficulty making decisions about what to keep or dispose of. Clutter accumulates and fills living areas to prevent normal use of space, resulting in distress and/or disability. Hoarding symptoms cause significant impairment, increased medical problems, and poor quality of life for our Veterans, particularly our older Veterans. Providers treat Veterans for other medical or psychiatric complaints yet frequently miss an important source of disability and burden on our system. This insidious condition is costly to the VA system as patients continue to decompensate and need greater amounts of care over the lifespan. Given that over 6% of the population has HD, a higher proportion than are diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, further research on the mechanism and efficacy of an appropriate treatment is desperately needed.  Current behavioral intervention methods for HD range from ineffective to relatively small gains. Case management is typically used to treat HD, which produces inadequate outcomes and clients resurface in systems of care. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for HD includes multiple components (assessment: 2-3 sessions, case formulation: 2 sessions, skills training: 2-3 sessions, combined exposure and cognitive therapy: 15-20 sessions, and motivational interviewing: throughout) and yields poor responses rates (i.e. <20% symptom reduction) in older adults. Outcomes in midlife HD patients are not much better, with symptom reduction rates ranging from 14-29% in HD symptoms following a lengthy course (4-9 months) of CBT for HD.  Executive dysfunction (ED) is linked to both HD symptom severity and poor outcomes of CBT for HD. Decision making, categorization, problem solving, inhibition, planning, organization, and cognitive flexibility difficulties are evident in HD patients across th lifespan, particularly in older patients. The VA has funded the development of an integrated behavioral treatment (Cognitive Rehabilitation and Exposure/Sorting Therapy; CREST) that targets both neurocognitive functioning and the core symptoms of HD (VA Career Development Award; Ayers PI). This treatment includes Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) to improve executive functioning and is combined with exposure therapy (ET) that targets avoidance of discarding/not acquiring. Preliminary results suggest that CREST is a highly feasible and acceptable treatment that doubles outcome rates compared to CBT for HD. Our proposed study will further develop this innovative intervention while testing whether it works through the mechanisms it targets and examining outcome moderators that may identify which patients are more likely to benefit.  We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing six months (26 sessions) of CREST to six months of ET alone, in 136 participants with HD. Assessments will be administered at baseline, during treatment (sessions 7, 13, 21), post-treatment, and 3 and 6-month follow-up. The primary objective is to evaluate whether CREST significantly reduces hoarding symptoms and improves functional capacity and quality of life when compared to exposure therapy alone. We will also examine the impact of treatment mediators; treatment adherence, changes in executive functioning, avoidance, and symptom severity on outcomes. Age and executive functioning will also be explored as potential moderators. Finally, by repeatedly measuring treatment targets, we will examine time to maximum treatment effect. By providing a treatment for many Veterans with HD, we can alter the course of their symptom trajectory and negative consequences, resulting in both reduced burden on the healthcare system and improved quality of life for Veterans."
"9233565","Diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of visual loss in adults in the US, and it is increasing throughout the US and the world as diabetes rapidly affects more people. Although prolonged good glycemic control has been demonstrated to inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy in patients, this goal is essentially impossible for most diabetics to maintain, so additional means are needed to inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy. The Kern laboratory focuses on how diabetic retinopathy develops and thus can be inhibited. This research currently focuses on 4 research areas related to the development of diabetic retinopathy, most of which initially were reported by or championed by Dr. Kern and his collaborators: (1) the role of leukocytes and inflammation as a cause of diabetic retinopathy, and the regulation of those pro-inflammatory changes by epigenetic acetylation, (2) the role of retinal photoreceptor cells and vision itself in the development of the retinal vascular leakage and degeneration of diabetic retinopathy, (3) the use of low intensity light to inhibit and reverse diabetic retinopathy, and (4) the use of systems pharmacology of G-Protein Coupled Receptors to inhibit the retinopathy. Discussions are now underway to translate these findings into patients with diabetes."
"9239724","Several different, seemingly unrelated processes can cause Parkinson?s disease (PD). For examples, genetic mutations that affect ?-synuclein expression, proteasome function, and mitochondrial quality control each produce a disease phenotype indistinguishable from toxin-induced and ?idiopathic? PD. A fundamental question is whether these disparate processes act through independent mechanisms to produce the same disease phenotype, or whether instead these processes converge to a shared pathogenic process. The question is important because identification of a shared pathogenic process could provide an approach for slowing the progression of idiopathic PD. Here we propose that neuronal glutathione is a critical nexus linking these processes, by virtue of its roles in both protein folding / repair and rapid scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We will test the hypothesis that ?-synuclein overexpression (or aggregation) causes neuronal glutathione depletion and resultant neurodegeneration by facilitating metal-catalyzed ROS production. The studies will use genetic and pharmacological approaches in mouse and cell culture models of PD. The Thy-1 ?-synuclein mouse, which exhibits several features of PD, will be crossed with mice having genetically reduced neuronal glutathione levels. The progeny and founder stains will be evaluated at serial time points with measures of motor function, neuronal glutathione content, oxidative stress, and ?-synuclein aggregation. We will also use these mice stains to evaluate a pharmacological approach for augmenting neuronal glutathione levels and slowing disease progression. The pharmacological studies will provide a complementary test of the underlying hypotheses, and will additionally provide preclinical efficacy data. Cerebrospinal fluid from the treated mice will be collected for a metabolomics assessment of potential treatment biomarkers. In parallel with these in vivo studies, we will use a cell culture system to more directly evaluate processes by which ?- synuclein overexpression or aggregation may promote ROS production and glutathione consumption. These processes include ?-synuclein interactions with dopamine, pre-formed ?-synuclein fibrils, and protein chaperones. Central to these studies is the concept that ?-synuclein or ?-synuclein aggregates can promote ROS production through association with transition metals. The studies will employ a dopaminergic SH-SY5 neuroblastoma line in which ?-synuclein expression can be titrated in response to a chemical signal (doxycycline)and, where feasible, cultured midbrain neurons from wild-type and ?- synuclein overexpressing mice."
"9205180","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Project Summary/Abstract:  More than eleven million (45.7%) U.S. Veterans are at least 65 years of age with up to 20% suffering from depression. Late-life depression is a common disorder which is often under-diagnosed and under-treated and has been associated with increased functional impairment regardless of symptom severity. Real-world effectiveness of antidepressants is sub-optimal or incomplete in up to two-thirds of patients with treatment resistant depression (Trivedi, 2006; Rush, 2006). Furthermore, common approaches for treatment resistant depression, such as electroconvulsive therapy and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are not well accepted by elderly patients or risk significant side effects. Most alarmig, however, is the association between untreated depression and risk of suicide among the Veteran population with 69% of Veteran suicides are among those age 50 years and older. Faced with an aging demographic profile towards a higher proportion of elderly Veterans, evidence-based, effective, safe, and efficient interventions for Veterans with late-life treatment resistant depression (LL-TRD) are critically needed.  In collaboration with investigators at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (MSSM), the study team recently completed a NIMH-sponsored randomized trial in patients with treatment resistant depression, comparing the immediate antidepressant properties of a single infusion of ketamine (KET), an open-channel nonselective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist; to midazolam (MID), a benzodiazepine anesthetic. The results of this trial definitively affirmed the rapid antidepressant efficacy of KE. A data sub- analysis showed that older participant's response and remission rates were comparable to those of the younger cohort. However, the study was not powered to answer questions unique to the elderly population of a fixed KET dose. These findings provide the rationale for the current proposal of a single-site, randomized, triple- blind (patient, rater, and  anesthesiologist) study. This novel strategy has not been adequately tested.  Seventy two Veterans age 55 or older will be randomized to receive a single infusion of KET (0.10 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, or 0.5 mg/kg) or MID (0.03mg/Kg), following an adaptive randomization design. The primary aim is to identify and evaluate the durability of benefit of the best performing of the thre sub- anesthetic doses KET and midazolam Veterans with LL-TRD over a 4-week period. Innovative exploratory aims measure the effects of KET infusion on neurocognition, peripheral biomarkers of cellular plasticity and inflammation, and Pharmaco-electroencephalography. As the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine infusion therapy for elderly Veterans with LL-TRD, this proposal has the potential for a transformative impact on clinical practice. Irrespective  of outcome, this project will generate valuable data supporting discovery research on NMDA receptor modulators for serious mood disorders."
"9141195","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Lung cancer is a smoking-related disease and the No. 1 cancer killer in Veterans. The early detection of lung cancer by CT scan significantly reduces the mortality. CT scan is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, CT scan dramatically increases the number of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs) in asymptomatic Veterans, whereas only a small fraction of PNs are lung tumors. Given the large number of referrals to unnecessary and harmful procedures for smokers with indeterminate PNs, there is an urgent need for biomarkers that can rule out lung cancer in Veterans with PNs by specifically diagnosing the disease. We have previously developed sputum-based small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) biomarkers for diagnosis of lung cancer. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the sputum assay with only 2-3 biomarkers are not sufficient, and need to be improved by identifying and including new biomarkers. The objective of this application is to identify new lung cancer-associated small ncRNAs and develop them as sputum biomarkers that can sufficiently exclude lung cancer in Veterans with PNs. To achieve the objective, we will define a small ncRNA profile of bronchial epithelial cells of lung cancer patients, and then optimize a panel of sputum biomarkers for lung cancer using our existing sputum samples. We will also validate the performance of the new biomarker panel in newly and prospectively collected sputum specimens. The success of the project will produce a useful tool that can complement CT screening for lung cancer by ruling out lung cancer in a CT screening positive setting, and hence reduce lung cancer-related mortality in Veterans."
"9189092","Summary Current globally used rotavirus vaccines are less effective in low-income settings (Vaccine Efficacy (VE)=40- 60%) compared to high-income settings (98%). Previously-studied risk factors for rotavirus vaccine failure, that is developing rotavirus diarrhea after a full course of immunizations, include high maternal rotavirus antibodies during pregnancy and breastfeeding, concomitant oral polio vaccine administration, and the high burden of co- enteric pathogens. These factors alone do not fully explain the reduced VE in low-income settings. One unexplored mechanism is the potential role of genetically determined susceptibility to rotavirus in rotavirus vaccine failure. Current vaccines exert their effect when the attenuated P[8] vaccine virus surface protein binds to histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) receptors in the gut, mimicking natural rotavirus infection. Rotavirus vaccines may be ineffective among individuals with no HBGA receptors. Mutations in FUT2 and FUT3 genes, which regulate expression of HBGAs, lead to null HBGA phenotypes (non-secretor and Lewis-negative). Production of HBGAs, and thus HBGA receptors, is prevented in these individuals. Recently, null HBGA phenotypes have demonstrated complete resistance to rotavirus serotype P[8], the sole P-component of current rotavirus vaccines. In high-income settings, individuals with null HBGA phenotypes are at low risk of vaccine failure because P[8] is the prevalent circulating serotype and these individuals are innately protected to P[8]. However, in low-income settings, such as sub-Saharan Africa, there is a greater prevalence of both non- P[8] serotypes and null HBGA phenotypes, compared to high-income settings. In these regions, individuals with null HBGA phenotypes may be at increased risk of rotavirus vaccine failure. The proposed study will be nested within the ongoing Vaccine Impact on Diarrhea in Africa (VIDA) study. We will collect saliva specimens in a subset of VIDA enrolled participants to determine Secretor and Lewis phenotypes. Existing comprehensive VIDA diarrheal surveillance, study infrastructure, and laboratory capabilities will be utilized. Building on our established collaboration, we will conduct a case-control study among children with a full course of rotavirus vaccinations in order to test whether Secretor or Lewis phenotype is associated with an increased risk of rotavirus diarrhea and serotype-specific rotavirus diarrhea. This will be the first study to examine host genetic risk factors as a mechanism for rotavirus vaccine failure. If we find that HBGA null phenotypes increase rotavirus vaccine failure we can answer vital remaining scientific questions related to low VE in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, accounting for innate susceptibility to rotavirus would be necessary in the development of future global rotavirus vaccines. If HBGA null phenotypes do not influence rotavirus vaccine failure, we can focus future research efforts on other risk factors which may contribute to rotavirus vaccine failure."
"9234621","I am a pulmonary immunologist with over 20 years of experience in studies of inflammatory/infectious diseases in the lungs and at the systemic level. Sixteen of those years, I have worked at the Ann Arbor VAHS. My overall career goal is to expand the understanding of host pathogen interactions, specifically the effect of microbe- and host-derived signals on the fate of the immune response. I deeply believe that an understanding of these interactions will create a foundation for the development of safe and effective immunomodulatory therapies that will greatly enhance the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapeutics in persistent infections. Our lab has specialized in animal modeling and translational studies applying these principles, which are highly relevant to broader range of diseases as shown by more recent clinical data. Over the last 15 years, my studies have mostly focused on host pathogen interactions between invasive fungus C. neoformans and the mammalian immune system. The studies of invasive fungal infections are of specific interest to the VA, because of the higher than average rate of immunocompromised patients among veterans and increased risk of exposure to various endemic and environmental fungi due to locations and conditions of military service that favor fungal exposures. Unfortunately, the invasive fungal infections have unacceptably high mortality rates, due to limited effectiveness of antifungal drugs, toxicity, and the high potential of fungal organisms to develop resistance to these drugs. Thus, it is crucial to understand the effects of immunomodulation on fungal disease from the perspective of the natural mechanisms of host defenses, mechanisms of immune evasion exhibited by fungi, and to explore pre-clinical approaches of immuno-modulatory therapies. The long-standing support of VA BLR&D was one of the crucial factors that allowed our group to establish itself among leaders in cryptococcal and fungal immunology. While this support has led to many important findings, there is still a lot more that we need to learn before we can safely and efficiently apply immunomodulatory therapies in persistent infections. The VA RCS Award will allow our group to continue this great work and create stability supportive of exploration of very novel but more risky directions of research. This award will also allow to further broaden PI?s collaborative interactions with physician scientists, enhance training efforts, and to continue PI?s service to the scientific community at the VA and beyond."
"9044607","As of 2003 there were 4.4 million AIAN in the U.S., constituting 1.5% of the total U.S. population, with 2.8 million or 1% self-identifying exclusively as AIAN. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that by 2050 the AIAN population will grow to 3.2 million with a projected rate of increase of 55%, exceeding the projected rate of increase for Whites and comparable to the rate for African Americans. Despite their wealth in cultural and tribal diversity. Natives in the U.S. experience considerable socio-economic disparities. For example, in 2003, AIAN compared to the U.S. population, reported a greater likelihood of living below the poverty level (27% vs. 15%) and lower overall median household incomes ($34,700 vs. $43,500); and reported higher unemployment (15.1% vs. 5.9%). Moreover, 30% of the AIAN population lacks health insurance coverage. Indigenous populations suffer from pervasive patterns of health disparities, unequal burden of chronic illnesses, as well as disproportionate levels of morbidity (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease) and injury-related mortality (e.g., suicide, motor vehicle collisions). Natives also experience high rates of trauma (e.g., injury, motor vehicle accidents, homicide) and violence exposure (e.g., rape, sexual assault, combat exposure) with co-occurring disproportionate rates of psychopathology (i.e., PTSD, depression, anxiety, suicide, AOD disorders). In the U.S., Natives have escalating rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI), respiratory and reproductive health problems, as well as premature mortality related to chronic disease states.  HIV/AIDS and STI have become major sources of concern for Natives. In a  comprehensive review of STI and HIV among AIAN, Kaufmann and colleagues (2007) noted that the epidemiologic evidence points to excessively high case rates of STI among AIAN compared to the general population; with a greater burden borne by Native populations living in closer proximity to one another. For example, in the U.S., AIAN have the second highest rates of Chlamydia and gonorrhea. The potential for exposure to and transmission of HIV is greatly enhanced by these elevated STI rates. Indeed, elevated rates of STI may provide a 2-5 fold increased risk for HIV infection among AIAN in the U.S. According to data from the National HIV/AIDS Surveillance System through December 2008, a cumulative total of 3,741 AIDS cases among AI/AN have been reported to the CDC. In terms of the major modes of transmission, percentages for AIAN men were: MSM (64%), IDU (14%), and MSM/IDU (14%). Note that this last category is higher for AIAN men than any other ethnic group. For AIAN women, the percentages were IDU (37%) and heterosexual contact (50%). Note that the IDU transmission category for Native women is higher than for any other ethnic group. Since 1995, the rate of AIDS diagnosis for AIAN has been consistently higher than the rate for Whites or Asian/Pacific Islanders in the U.S. Additionally, when one takes the relative population size into account, a more disturbing picture emerges. The AIDS case rates for AIAN per 100,000 were 8.5 (11.9 for HIV rates), ranking them just behind Blacks (49.3; 73.7 for HIV rates) and Hispanics/Latinos (15.0; 25.0 for HIV rates). In our research (N=447; HONOR Project, R01MH65871), 30% of Native two-spirit (i.e., AIAN sexual and/or gender minority) men reported that they were HIV+ (19% reported they did not know their status). These numbers are unprecedented and suggest that the HIV/AIDS epidemic for Native MSM may be similar to Black MSM.  Natives suffer disproportionate exposure to trauma and mental health disparities.  Recent reports demonstrate that Native communities experience higher rates of sexual and physical violence than any other ethnic or racial group in the U.S. Among MSM in our HONOR project, 31% had experienced extreme sexual abuse in childhood. Our previous research with two spirit populations, particulariy MSM, suggest that a history of sexual abuse, substance abuse,  poverty, and involvement in sex trade are all related to risky sexual behaviors. Mental health is an important factor in Native HIV risk. Not surprisingly, given the high rates of trauma exposure, it is well documented that Natives have high lifetime rates of both depression and PTSD (15% and 8% respectively; higher than in non-Native groups.^® Mental health issues such as depression,  anxiety, PTSD are common mental health outcomes to high rates of trauma exposure and have also  been linked to risky sexual behaviors among Natives and two-spirits.  Over the past three decades, studies have indicated that there are also high rates of  substance use and alcohol misuse among AIAN, although there is tremendous variation over  time, by tribe, and by reservation/ Results of the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health  indicate that the rate of current illicit drug use was higher among American Indians and Alaska  Natives (12.8%) than among persons of other races or ethnicities. The relationship between drug use  with precocious sexual activity and potential HIV sexual-risk behavior has been well documented.  Moreover, research indicates that substance use may mediate the relationship between traumatic  event exposure and sexual risk. Findings in our HONOR study indicated that over 40% of the sample  reported lifetime use of narcotics, stimulants, inhalants, and methamphetamine (60% reported lifetime  cocaine use). Over 35-40% reported having used stimulants, cocaine, narcotics, methamphetamine,  inhalants, and club drugs in the past year. Additionally, over 25% ofthe Native MSM had injected  illicit drugs and had traded sex in their lifetime.  Native HIV/AIDS risk is both structurally and behaviorally determined and interventions  research needs to investigate multiple levels for the highest impact. Concurrent with structural  interventions, individual level STI-specific knowledge and skills directly impact choices that influence  risk and are also important intervention targets, particulariy for Native MSM and IDUs. At this  moment, there is a window of opportunity to intervene with respect to HIV preventive  interventions among Native MSM, particularly substance using MSM. This study could provide a  body of data upon which to make recommendations for national HIV treatment strategies planning for  Native MSM.  Our preliminary work among AIAN MSM has been very successful and points to gaps in  care and areas for new patient oriented research. Based on our research, reports from individuals  we spoke with over the past 7 years and our community forums in the two-spirit communities- the  need for HIV preventive intervention development-particularly among substance using twospirit  MSM~has become a community imperative. Community members note that rural and  reservation-based two-spirit men should also be included in future prevention efforts. The difficulty in  accessing or unintentionally outing rural and reservation-based Native MSM requires innovative  intervention development and sampling strategies. Moreover, Native MSM who are faced with newly  diagnosed HIV are often in psychological crisis. They report depression and anxiety, social isolation,  stigma, demoralization, anger, and, in the extreme, suicidal ideation. Their emotional distress is  compounded by fears about transmitting the virus to family members and partners. Despite their  urgent need for psychological and substance abuse intervention, most newly diagnosed two-spirit  men do not receive any culturally tailored mental health or substance abuse treatment, even  rudimentary counseling. Urban Native health clinics as well as tribal health clinics lack the  mental health and HIV prevention infrastructure to address these needs in the general Native  population already, and few professionals are available to provide education to providers or care to  two-spirit patients.  We propose to develop an online HIV preventive intervention for two-spirit MSM. The  project has the potential to fill an enormous gap in HIV prevention needs among two-spirit men and,  because of its online delivery format, could be widely disseminated throughout the country. Two-spirit  men in rural areas, particularly isolated, would be ideally suited to benefit from such a program. Our  plans are to incorporate a social networking peer component in the online intervention to provide  a culturally grounded two-spirit intervention that facilitates positive sexual health behaviors,  decreases substance use and HIV risk behaviors, and provides the peer support that may best  address their needs."
"9241035","Objectives: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is strongly associated with many aspects of military service including blast injury. The overall objectives of this proposal are to improve the prevention and treatment of SNHL in veterans. Research Design: During the previous period of funding, using medium-throughput screening of hair cells (HCs) from the mammalian cochlea, we identified a number of novel antioxidants and cell signaling inhibitors that are capable of protecting cochlear HCs from high-dose ototoxic damage. Some of these protectants provided better protection than several previously described oto- protectants. We now propose to evaluate the most effective of these compounds in vivo, using a single, invariant model of noise-induced hearing loss in animals, so that the interventions can be strictly compared. We will also evaluate known HC protectants to provide benchmarks. This will allow us to identify optimal compounds for further development as pharmacological interventions in humans. Methodology: Studies will be performed using in vivo studies of noise damage to the cochlea, with intracochlear delivery of HC protectants beginning immediately after exposure. We will use a well- established mouse model of noise damage, delivery of compounds to cochlear perilymph with osmotic minipumps, serial auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) audiometry, and morphological evaluation of cochlear HCs and afferent nerve endings. Progress over the past period of funding: During the past period of funding, we developed a medium-throughput method for screening libraries of potential oto-protectants using the mammalian organ of Corti, the only tissue containing the damage-sensitive mammalian outer HCs. We identified several antioxidants and several cell-signaling pathway inhibitors that were highly effective, and had not previously been evaluated for HC protection. Using an electroporation model of organ of Corti transfection, we also screened more than 200 transcription factors for the ability to enhance HC regeneration caused by ATOH1 expression in nonsensory cells, discovering several novel factors with this ability. We discovered that gene therapy with espin1 dramatically enhanced stereocilia formation on regenerating HCs. Finally, we discovered a novel protective HC pathway mediated by ATP receptors that reduce activity in HCs at high stimulus levels, protecting them from noise damage. These studies resulted in 20 peer-reviewed publications to date. Clinical Relationship: The prevention and treatment of SNHL is of great importance to veterans and the VA. The effects of SNHL on veterans' quality of life are substantial. SNHL and tinnitus also account for more disability compensation in the VA than any other disorder, and rehabilitation costs are high. The proposed research is targeted at developing new and improved therapies for prevention and treatment of this important health problem."
"9033542","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Suicide prevention is a top VHA priority. Suicide prevention in every health system is hampered by difficulties with predicting the risk of suicidal behavior, due to low base rates leading to very low positive predictive values. Very recently, machine learning regression tree methods have succeeded in better identifying a group at particularly high risk of suicide post-discharge from military hospitals. This advance is greatly needed, since the first months to year post-discharge has been repeatedly shown to be one of the very highest-risk periods for suicide that is known. Nevertheless, suicide and suicidal behavior risk prediction post-discharge (and at any other time) is still extremely challenging. For instance, this study's Principal Investigator has found that, in the relatively recent past, a large majority (73%) of VHA  patients with depression denied suicidal ideation even when asked within 7 days of their suicide death. A clear need exists to develop measures of suicidal behavior risk that are not heavily dependent on patient self-report. Recently, our Co-Investigators conducted nonlinear dynamic analysis of movement data from non-Veteran inpatients and identified a signal that was correlated more strongly to suicidal ideation than any other characteristic tested. RESEARCH DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of 115-300 Veterans will be conducted to determine if the previously-identified specific actigraphy-based measurements highly associated with suicidal ideation in non- Veterans will predict suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and/or rehospitalizatin in Veterans. METHODS: An analysis of 115-300 Veterans admitted to the Bedford, Massachusetts VAMC acute psychiatry unit will be conducted. The primary analysis will focus upon 75-200 Veterans with current suicidal ideation or recent suicidal behavior (SI/SB) who do not have a primary psychotic disorder, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's disease, and who are not undergoing alcohol detoxification. A separate analysis will be conducted of 40-100 patients undergoing alcohol detoxification, half with SI/SB and half without SI/SB. Participants will wear a  small, unobtrusive, wristwatch-like actigraph on their nondominant wrist, and complete self-rated and clinician- rated assessments of suicidal ideation, as well as self-rated assessments of the severity of other psychiatric symptoms. A Resiliency Index (RI) will be calculated using nonlinear dynamic analysis of the amplitude of movements over time frames from 6 minutes - 2 hours. These time frames are the periods for which a clear structure to the movement data is evident, with patients with suicidal ideation showing less variation in amplitude than patients without suicidal ideation. If medications given for alcohol detoxification are determined to not interfere with the RI, then a secondary analysis will examine the entire sample of 115-300 Veterans. One Aim will focus upon determining whether the original Resiliency Index or alternative movement data indices, such as one based on the change in the movement data over the hospitalization, predicts the presence and severity of suicidal ideation among Veteran inpatients. This aim will also examine the sensitivity and specificity of the RI for detecting the presence of any suicidal ideation, and of substantial suicidal ideation. (In non- Veterans, the RI showed a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 100% for detecting any suicidal ideation, and 86% and 88%, respectively, for detecting substantial ideation). The second Aim will determine whether the RI predicts subsequent suicidal behavior or rehospitalization over the next 1 month, 4 months, or 1 year after discharge, alone or combined with data about symptom severity, past history, and the present hospitalization. IMPACT: This study will contribute substantially to the VHA's high priority efforts to reduce suicide and suicidal behavior among Veterans. The approach studied here potentially likely particular value for suicidal behavior risk assessment in that it is not dependent on patient self-report of symptoms. This study is strongly supported by the VHA Suicide Prevention Program as a novel and potentially highly beneficial approach to suicidal behavior risk assessment, alone or combined with other readily available information."
"9258008","Project Summary: Regulation of adipogenesis in obesity by hydroxymethylation More than two thirds of adults, and almost one third of adolescents in America are overweight or obese, with combined medical costs amounting to over $147 billion annually. In obesity, white adipose tissue expands due to the growth of existing adipocytes and the differentiation of new adipocytes from adipose stem cell progenitors (APs). It has been suggested that adipogenesis is regulated by hydroxymethylation, a form of epigenetic regulation. Epigenetics refers to heritable gene function changes that occur without nucleotide sequence changes. The Ten-eleven-translocation family of dioxygenases (TET1-3) regulates cell fate decisions by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC), a marker of gene silencing, to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a stable marker of gene activation. Understanding the role of hydroxymethylation in regulating adipose differentiation is critical for understanding the mechanisms governing its expansion and may provide insight into novel targets for anti-obesity therapies. I will test the hypothesis that Tet1 catalyzes the hydroxymethylation required to upregulate adipogenic genes necessary for adipocyte progenitor differentiation. My first aim is to characterize the spatiotemporal changes in hydroxymethylation during diet-induced obesity (DIO) and identify the cell types in which these changes occur. Preliminary experiments using murine models of DIO indicate that hydroxymethylation patterns in visceral and subcutaneous adipose change dramatically over the course of obesity. Spatiotemporally mapping these changes will identify when epigenetic changes occur, and which cell types are affected. My second aim is to determine which genes are regulated by hydroxymethylation in adipose progenitor stem cells. In obesity, APs divide and differentiate, causing fat pad growth. This important population of cells can be isolated for study using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Characterizing how changes in methylation patterns alter gene expression in APs may uncover novel insights into the regulation of adipogenesis. Antibodies that detect epigenetic modifications (5mC or 5hmC) can selectively enrich regions of DNA that have been modified, and combined with next-generation sequencing, this approach will identify genes that are being silenced or activated. These experiments may identify novel regulators of adipogenesis. My third aim is to determine if Tet1 is the enzyme that catalyzes hydroxymethylation to regulate adipogenesis. Preliminary studies in mouse visceral adipose tissue show that Tet1 mRNA increases after high-fat diet feeding and that 5hmC accumulates, but it is currently not known which Tet isoform is responsible. Transgenic mice lacking Tet1 have been generated, but the phenotype of their adipose tissue and their response to high-fat diet have not been explored. These experiments will help determine if Tet1 is required for adipogenesis."
"9237700","Although metformin is first line treatment for patients with diabetes (DM), many patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) do not receive metformin due to concerns about the risk of lactic acidosis. Within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 30-40% of incident DM medications are sulfonylureas, rather than metformin, due in part to underlying CKD. Our group and others have demonstrated that among patients with preserved kidney function, metformin use is associated with better cardiovascular, kidney, and survival outcomes compared with sulfonylureas.1-4 The rapidly increasing number of patients with DM and moderate CKD may also derive cardiovascular and renal benefits from metformin, but do not receive this recommended first line therapy due to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning (contraindication at serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL for men; >1.4mg/dL for women). Guidelines in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia emphasize metformin use based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) criteria rather than creatinine. Patients with reduced eGFR may use metformin with frequent monitoring and dose reduction, and an eGFR <30 mL/min is considered an absolute contraindication to metformin. Formal petitions to revise the FDA warning to consider eGFR based prescribing have been filed but additional evidence is needed to inform these policy decisions.6, 7 Randomized trials would be ideal, but the large number of patients needed and existing warning make such studies prohibitive. Methodologically-strong comparative effectiveness observational studies are necessary to determine the relative benefits and risks of metformin versus sulfonylureas use among patients with CKD. This proposal will answer the question: Among patients with Stage 3 CKD, what are the absolute risks of lactic acidosis and cardiovascular and renal events for those initially treated with metformin compared to those treated with a sulfonylurea? We will rebuild an inception diabetes cohort utilizing national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data (corporate data warehouse-vital signs; pharmacy, medical datasets, Medicare/ Medicaid data and vital status files), national death index and data on echocardiograms. Eligible veterans will have a baseline creatinine >1.5 mg/dL or an eGFR between 30 and 59 ml/min and initially treated with metformin (current N=16,891 through FY2008; anticipated rebuilt cohort N~86,924) or sulfonylurea (current N=41,952; anticipated rebuilt cohort N~149,869). The proposed study follows this inception cohort from monotherapy initiation until an outcome or censoring event (leave VHA, change therapy or death). The comparisons of interest will be: metformin vs. sulfonylurea. Persons included are aged >18 years, utilize VHA from 10/1/2000 through 09/30/2014. In this national cohort of veterans with diabetes and impaired renal function: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the risk of hospitalization for laboratory-confirmed lactic acidosis in patients treated with metformin is similar to the risk in patients treated with sulfonylureas. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events is lower among patients treated with metformin versus sulfonylureas. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that heart failure hospitalizations or emergency visits is lower among patients treated with metformin versus sulfonylureas. Aim 4 will test the hypothesis that CKD progression and all-cause mortality is lower among patients treated with metformin versus sulfonylureas. Propensity score matching will be used to achieve similar groups. We will compare event rates accounting for baseline and time-varying covariates with marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models (MSM) with ?stabilized? inverse probability treatment weights (IPTW). Our team has been extremely productive over the last 3 years and is poised to conduct a rigorous and necessary evaluation of the effectiveness of DM regimens among patients with CKD. Our publication record attests to our ability to use VHA data for accurate measurement of exposures, outcomes and covariates."
"9223646","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are high among combat Veterans. Estimates of PTSD within Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans suggest that nearly 17% of active duty and over 24% of reserve service members screen positive for PTSD. Among individuals diagnosed with PTSD, the incidence of drug abuse and addiction is markedly elevated, with the highest comorbidity observed for alcohol use disorders, estimated to be as high as 85% in individuals seeking PTSD treatment. When these comorbidities manifest they result in poorer psychological, functional, and treatment outcomes than either disorder alone. Evidence suggests that neurobiological mechanisms, such as dysregulation of specific brain structures (e.g., amygdala, insula, prefrontal cortex, and striatum) appear to play crucial roles in the maintenance and remission of concurrent AD/PTSD.  Currently there are no translational imaging studies that have examined whether patterns of brain activation can predict differences in treatment response in this population, and no attempts have been made to link psychotherapeutic interventions to neurobiological targets in AD/PTSD individuals. Therefore, the long- term goal of this line of research is to use neuroimaging tools to advance our ability to provide optimized, targeted interventions that support improved outcomes for Veterans with AD/PTSD. The objective of this proposal, which is a first step in pursuit of this goal, is to measure the brain response to an anticipatory task and an alcohol cue reactivity task before and after treatment for AD/PTSD in order to 1) delineate a neural profile of treatment responsiveness to empirically supported interventions, and 2) to compare the relative effects of an exposure based to a non-exposure based treatment on the neural substrates thought to maintain these disorders. Participants will receive one of two, 8-week-long, treatments within an ongoing, VA-funded, randomized controlled trial designed to compare the effectiveness of an exposure-based psychotherapy (i.e., Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorders Using Prolonged Exposure (COPE)) against the widely used psychotherapy, Seeking Safety (SS), that does not include exposure for the treatment of AD/PTSD. We hypothesize that baseline patterns of brain response will relate to the capacity to improve in the context of therapy, and that the sub-components of COPE and SS will differentially affect change in those neural circuits maintaining AD/PTSD."
"9241135","The prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the Veteran population is estimated to be a third higher than in the general population and the Veterans Health Administration currently cares for over 200,000 Veterans with moderate to severe kidney disease. The leading cause of death in patients with CKD is cardiovascular disease. Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Work done during our previous VA Merit Awards in vitro and in vivo in our CKD animal model, have demonstrated that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) can de-differentiate to a more synthetic, osteo-chondrocytic cell with upregulation of RUNX2. This renders cells that can calcify in a manner similar to bone. Calcifying VSMC release matrix vesicles, small exosomes filled with calcium, phosphorus, protein and micro RNA (miRNA). Our bioinformatic analyses of miRNA arrays comparing VSMC and matrix vesicles have identified altered expression of multiple miRNA that regulate genes involved in VSMC phenotypic change/calcification, intracellular calcium (iCa) homeostasis, and oxidative stress pathways. Consistent with these findings, in vivo in our animal model of slowly progressive CKD there is also progressive increases in oxidative stress and iCa in VSMC. We hypothesize that Increased intracellular calcium (iCa) and oxidative stress are additive in inducing arterial calcification in CKD. To test this hypothesis in Aim 1, we propose to determine the relationship between increased intracellular calcium (iCa) and oxidative stress in calcifying VSMC from CKD versus NL animals. We will alter the iCa and determine the effect on oxidative stress, and conversely, decrease oxidative stress and determine if this alters iCa and if calcium channels/transporters are oxidized leading to altered function. In Aim 2, we will determine if the combination of decreased iCa and decreased oxidative stress alters CKD VSMC matrix vesicle protein content, miRNA profile, and modulation of the recipient VSMC osteogenic phenotype. In Aim 3, we will determine if the administration of the combination of agents to reduce both iCa and oxidative stress can prevent and/or treat arterial calcification in vivo in our rat model of progressive CKD. These studies will determine if the vicious cycle of increased iCa and increased oxidative stress accelerate vascular calcification in CKD, the mechanisms by which this happens, the role of matrix vesicle miRNA, and if dual blockade can prevent and/or stop arterial calcification that plaques patients with CKD. Our long term goal is to improve the cardiovascular health of Veterans with CKD."
"9044344","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of studies have documented that energy balance can be enduringly affected by nutritional changes taking place during the essential period of developmental programming, which in humans occurs during late gestation and in rodents during the course of their early post-natal life. These alterations have been shown to severely affect female neuroendocrine reproductive development. An excess of nutrients availability advances the timing of puberty; nutritional deficiency delays it. Possibly due to the complexity of the systems involved and absence of precise candidates, neither the molecules linking nutritional programming to pubertal development nor the puberty-related genes they may regulate have been identified. Recently studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that female puberty is regulated by an epigenetic mechanism, of transcriptional repression that involves the Polycomb group (PcG) of transcriptional silencers. Our studies showed that this repression is imposed on downstream genes implicated in the stimulatory control of GnRH secretion (epitomized by Kiss gene). By discovering a novel epigenetic mechanism controlling the timing of puberty and identifying its basic components, we have now unveiled the existence of a regulatory system that may not only fulfill the long-sought out role of linking nutrition to neuroendocrine reproductive development, but is also amenable to experimental analysis. Accordingly, this proposal will test the hypothesis that alterations in the developmental programing of energy balance affect the timing of puberty by regulating the mechanism of epigenetic silencing that keeps GnRH secretion in check during prepubertal maturation. To this end, two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) Altering nutrient availability during early postnatal life affects puberty by regulating an epigenetic repressive tone imposed by the PcG complex on puberty-activating (PA) genes; and 2) Additional PcG target genes potentially relevant to the timing of puberty and to the nutritional regulation of this process can be identified by epigenome-wide anlaysis using RNA-and ChIP- massively parallel sequencing technology. I anticipate that a successful outcome of the proposed studies will provide major insights into the integrative mechanisms linking energy homeostasis, the neuroendocrine brain and the control of puberty. I also foresee that these studies will substantially contribute to our understanding on how disorders in energy balance influence the timing and progression of puberty, and will make researchers and clinicians aware of the epigenetics contribution to these disorders."
"9235965","We propose to evaluate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune responses following stimulation with therapeutic vaccination and immune checkpoint blockade to establish effective immune responses in lung cancer. We will target the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway that has shown benefit in patients with lung cancer. Patients do not benefit from PD-1 blockade therapy if they lack lymphocytic infiltration of the tumors. We have a novel means to cause tumor T cell infiltration with CCL21 chemokine to make the PD-1 pathway therapy even more effective. To induce enhanced T cell infiltration in the tumors, we will administer CCL21 gene modified dendritic cells (DC-AdCCL21) pulsed with autologous tumor antigens. We have found that although administration of tumor antigen pulsed DC-CCL21 inhibits tumor growth, PD-1 expression is upregulated on T cells in the TME. We anticipate that this limitation can be overcome by PD-1 blockade combined with therapeutic vaccination. We have found that IFN? and TNF? are induced specifically in the tumor and systemically following therapy. [The IFN? induced chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 are induced in the tumor following therapeutic vaccination]. Our central hypothesis is that the CCL21 based therapeutic vaccination will augment immune recognition in lung cancer and modulate PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy. [We hypothesize that CXCL9 or CXCL10 induced in the TME following therapeutic vaccination will recruit activated T cell infiltrates in the tumor]. We hypothesize that the individual or combined therapy will enhance DC maturation and functional activity]. We hypothesize that that the CTL activities following combined therapy will be greater than the therapies administered individually. Utilizing preclinical murine lung cancer models, we will address the following aims. Aim 1A will determine the therapeutic value of anti-PD-1 and tumor antigen (lysate or peptide) pulsed DC- CCL21 vaccination on the modulation of anti-tumor immune efficacy in vivo. [Aim 1B will determine the role CXCL9 or CXCL10 on CTL infiltration in the tumors following therapeutic vaccination or combined therapy]. Aim 2 will determine the effects of [individual or combined therapy] on DC maturation, DC functional activity in the TME and systemically. These aims are innovative and have not been addressed previously. These aims will improve our understanding of combined therapeutic vaccination and PD-1 blockade in lung cancer and aid in the development of ef fective treatment options for this disease. As a measure of anti-tumor efficacy in both aims, tumor burden, survival and changes in the frequency and functional activities of immune effectors [T (CD4, CD8), NK, NKT and DC] and immune suppressors [tumor associated macrophage (TAM), myeloid suppressor cells (MDSC) and T regulatory (Treg)] will be quantified."
"9134973","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Project Summary Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the common cause of kidney failure. Elucidating mechanisms that mediate the early stage of DKD may help to identify novel preventive and therapeutic measures for patients with DKD. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated a critical role of NF-?B and STAT3 acetylation in DKD through the regulation of inflammatory gene expression (see progress report). To further understand the mechanism of early DKD injury, we performed proteomic studies in the glomeruli of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and identified protein S (PS) as one of the proteins which were highly regulated in early DKD. PS, coded by Pros1, is a cofactor for the formation of activated protein C (APC). APC formation has been shown to protect glomerular cells from apoptosis in DKD. In addition, PS shares structural similarities with GAS6, which is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of kidney disease. Both PS and GAS6 bind to TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl, and Mer), which belong to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that mediates regulation of inflammation as well as cell survival and migration. However, PS and GAS6 have different binding affinity to individual TAM receptors and appear to have different functions. The role of PS and TAM receptors in kidney disease is not known. Our preliminary data suggest that PS expression increased in the glomeruli of diabetic rats and in human kidneys with early DKD, but decreased in those with advanced DKD. Plasma concentrations of PS were not different between diabetic and non-diabetic rats or humans, suggesting a local regulation of PS expression. We found that knockdown of PS in podocytes enhanced high glucose-induced apoptosis while overexpression of PS inhibited TNF-?-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression, suggesting a protective role of PS against diabetes-induced podocyte injury. We found that Tyro3, one of the TMA receptors, was upregulated by high glucose and knockdown of Tyro3 expression abolished the protective effects of PS in podocytes. Tyro3 expression is also upregulated in human glomeruli at early DKD but downregulated at late DKD. We developed podocyte-specific Pros1 knockout mice (KO) and found that diabetic KO mice developed more proteinuria, mesangial expansion, and foot process effacement than diabetic wild-type mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PS may protect glomerular cell injury in early DKD through the formation of APC and/or effects mediated by Tyro3. We will test our hypothesis by two aims: In the aim 1, we will determine the factors which upregulate PS and Tyro3 at early DKD and those suppress PS and Tyro3 at late DKD and the effects of PS and Tyro3 in podocytes cultured in diabetic condition. In the aim 2 we will determine the role of PS and Tyro3 in DKD progression in vivo using both conditional overexpression and knockout mouse models for PS and Tyro3. We believe that the proposed studies could help us to elucidate the mechanism of glomerular cell injury in early DKD and therefore we could develop more effective drugs to prevent the progression of DKD."
"9233244","The main focus of our research is to investigate the mechanism of development and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Diabetes is prevalent in the people aged 20 years and older. The demographic of veterans population falls in this age group. In the US, diabetes represents the 6th leading cause of death; however, diabetes as a cause of death is underreported. Nearly 50% of the patients with diabetes develop nephropathy. A recent study demonstrated that diabetic patients with kidney disease had 87% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality when compared with those without kidney disease. The early pathologic changes in DN involve renal especially glomerular hypertrophy and expansion of matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin and laminin. My laboratory studies the signal transduction mechanisms that lead to the progression of DN. To test our concepts, we use both renal cells (glomerular mesangial and proximal tubular epithelial cells) in culture and mouse and rat models of diabetes. Since many pathologic effects of hyperglycemia are mediated by transforming growth factor-? (TGF?), we investigate the signaling mechanisms of this cytokine in mesangial and proximal tubular epithelial cells. We discovered that the expression of tumor suppressor protein PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10) is reduced in the diabetic kidney and in renal cells cultured in the presence of high glucose or TGF?. In recent years, we have extensively investigated the mechanism of PTEN downregulation in renal cells and in kidneys of diabetic rodents. The results showed the involvement of TGF? in high glucose-induced suppression of PTEN levels in renal cells. Our results for the first time demonstrated the role of microRNA (miR)-21, miR-26 and miR-214 in the inhibition of PTEN expression in the diabetic milieu. These studies opened the door to the novel application of anti-microRNA therapy for DN. More recently, we extended these studies to include the role of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) complexes 1 and 2 in diabetic kidney disease. We provided the first evidence for the requirement of inactivation of the exclusive PRAS40 subunit of mTOR complex 1 for glomerular mesangial cell hypertrophy, a pathologic feature of DN. Together with other VA investigators, we showed that rapamycin ameliorated the renal pathologies in diabetic mice. However, rapamycin-mediated complete inhibition of mTOR activity may cause deleterious clinical outcome. In fact, loss of mTORC1 in proximal tubular epithelial cells of mice induces progressive fibrosis. Therefore, more recently we have focused on a novel protein, called deptor, which is a component of both mTOR complexes 1 and 2. In fact, deptor is an endogenous inhibitor of mTOR activity. For the first time, we showed that the renal expression of deptor was significantly reduced in humans with diabetes and in diabetic rodents and that this reduction contributed to the increased mTOR activity. In cultured mesangial and proximal tubular epithelial cells incubated with high glucose, the expression of deptor was significantly reduced, which resulted in sustained activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Thus, it is important to study the mechanisms of deptor downregulation by hyperglycemia. We are currently investigating the epigenetic, post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms of deptor reduction in diabetic kidney disease. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between diabetes and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Also, the incidence of RCC increases after 30 years of age and peaks at the 6th decades, which fall in the demographic of veterans population. We showed that downregulation of PTEN by increased expression of specific microRNAs contributes to the proliferation and invasion of renal carcinoma cells.  Thus, the goal of our studies is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the progression of diabetic nephropathy and RCC, and identify signaling molecules that can be targeted by small molecular drugs and anti-microRNA based therapies."
"9138485","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Suicide is a leading cause of death among U.S. Veterans. Therefore, understanding the etiological basis for the risk of suicide is of dire importance to our Veteran population. Stress i a crucial factor in risk of suicide. Specifically for Veterans, exposure to traumatic environmental events during combat, military service, or post- deployment stressful situations related to readjustment to civilian life are key contributors to the increase risk of suicide. These stressors  can affect the diathesis for suicidal acts and can serve as triggers or precipitants of suicidal acts. Biological markers or stable behavioral traits for suicide risk factors likely interact in a complex manner that might benefit from approaches that can examine gene by environment interactions. Epigenetics is the bridge, connecting environment with genetics, by mediating the influence of environmental factors such as stress in altered regulation of gene expression related to suicide. We will investigate DNA methylation patterns associated with suicide risk in Veterans undergoing psychiatric treatment at the JJP VAMC using a genome- scale approach. Additionally, through subsequent follow-up studies, we will assess how DNA methylation patterns are altered following treatment. Such a longitudinal study is unprecedented and provides an opportunity to identify biological markers of suicide risk and treatment response. Moreover, the role of the inflammatory response in the stress diathesis in suicide risk will also be investigated in these studies. Together the epigenetic and inflammatory markers of suicide risk and treatment will identify objective measures that we can use in clinical settings to identif Veterans at risk of suicide and to determine the efficacy of treatment course and response."

Pain issues among active-duty military and Veterans have many unique features. In addition to battlefield injuries, greater exposure to trauma and psychological stress than the general public compounds the likelihood of developing chronic pain. Management of injury-related chronic pain may require a combination of approaches including local and systemic analgesic drugs, pain-directed physical therapy, behavior modification, biofeedback, and other interventions. An increasingly employed therapy in the management of Veterans with chronic pain is spinal cord stimulation (SCS). It has been shown in clinical studies to be safe and effective for properly selected patients and approved by the FDA to treat chronic pain of the trunk and limbs. SCS remains significantly under-utilized compared to either chronic opiates or surgical re- operation. The VHA has adopted routine screening and assessment of pain as well as planning for pain reduction as a national policy throughout the VHA health care system. SCS involves epidural implantation of a stimulation electrode connected to a small internal pacemaker. Activation of dorsal column (DC) fibers in the dermatomes associated with pain is often limited by the onset of discomfort associated with activation of nearby dorsal roots (DR). Successful SCS is thought to depend on activation of DC fibers without activation of DR fibers, which is termed selectivity. Predicting selectivity, and which patients will respond to the therapy, is currently only possible by doing an  invasive trial procedure, where an electrode is temporarily inserted and the patient is allowed to experience the neurostimulation and state whether it is helpful. Furthermore, due to the millions of possible stimulation parameters and varying patient anatomy, SCS programming can be time consuming, expensive, and result in aberrant stimulation. The objective of this proposal is to validate a patient-specific model that reliably predicts %DC/DR selective activation, by tailoring the dynamic range based on patient anatomy. This project is a collaboration with experts from VA Neurosurgery and the Bioengineering and Neurosurgery Departments at Duke University. It will focus on validating a patient-specific SCS model that reliably predicts activaton of neural elements responsible for pain relief, utilizing settings tailored to patient anatomy. A pilot clinical study demonstrating proof of concept has already been completed. This CSR&D Merit Award will expand upon this in a larger, mechanistic study in Veterans with existing SCS therapy. In Aim 1, each patient's existing preoperative MRI and postoperative X-ray images will be combined to construct a personalized, computational model based on patient-specific anatomy. Aim 2 will further demonstrate feasibility of models in maximizing selectivity, while reducing SCS programming times and improving clinical outcomes, by providing >50% reduction in pain from baseline. Successful completion of this proposal is expected based on the strength of the team and extensive preliminary data. This project will provide the data to justify broader clinical studies and development of a customized SCS software platform for the evaluation and treatment of chronic pain. The long-term goal of the project is to develop a novel platform that will lead to significant advances in the treatment of chronic pain for Veterans worldwide."
"9138122","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          A major cause of colon removal surgery in veterans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a failure of medically-induced mucosal healing. Mucosal healing is a reliable clinical marker of recovery after IBD therapy as it is associated with durable clinical remission. Despite the importance of mucosal repair, we continue to have a poor understanding of many of the cellular and molecular elements that mediate ulcer healing. The current proposal focuses on the role of colonic (epithelial) stem cells (CSC) in ulcer healing during colitis. Wnt/?-catenin signaling in stem cells promotes cell proliferation as well as self-renewal, both essential functions needed for ulcer healing and restitution of the mucosal barrier. A central tenant of this proposal is the hypothesis that Wnt/?-catenin signaling plays an integral role in mucosal repair in IBD and that steroids delay ulcer healing my impairing Wnt/?-catenin signaling. In mucosal ulceration, as seen in IBD, there is replacement of surface mucosa with granulation tissue that is re-epithelialized with new crypt structures. We suspect that active Wnt signaling is required for several steps through this sequence of events from stage 1) generation of an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) monolayer, to stage 2) formation of epithelial invaginations, to stage 3) formation of crypt islands on ulcer surfaces and finally stage 4) regeneration of mature crypts (Fig 3). Biochemical data from our lab indicate Wnt/?-catenin signaling is increased during ulcer healing in colitis in mice and IBD patients. In studies to interrogate the role of Wnt signaling in ulcer healing, we discovered that IEC expressing mRNA for the Wnt target gene Axin2 expand in ulcer margins, on ulcer surfaces, and within newly-formed crypt structures in the middle of ulcers. Studies using a novel Axin2 reporter mouse model indicate that Axin2+ IEC are pluripotent and capable of growing colonoid structures in vitro from a single cell. Together the preliminary data suggest that Axin2+ IEC represent a novel ISC population that forms new crypt structures during ulcer healing. In Aim 1, Axin2lacZ/+ and Axin2 CreERT2/+; R26RmTmG/+ mice will be used to study ulcer-associated Axin2+ IEC localization and gene expression profiles of this new stem cell population, as well as perform lineage tracing during ulcer healing in DSS colitis. In Aim 2 we will examine ulcer healing in mice treated with steroids. New studies will utilize Axin2-specific expression of stabilized ?-catenin to examine its role in ulcer healin during steroid therapy. Aim 3 studies will interrogate the role of Axin2+ IEC in human IBD and will analyze the mechanisms by which steroids impair ulcer healing. The goal of these studies will be to determine if untreated UC patients exhibit increased Axin2 expression, Wnt signaling and stem cell gene expression in areas of ulcer healing (Aim 3A) and determine whether steroid therapy reduces levels of Axin2 expression and stem cell activation in areas of delayed ulcer healing in a prospective trial of UC patients treated with steroids for a colitis flare (Aim 3B). Together the studies proposed will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern ulcer healing in colitis. The goal is to determine areas where therapeutic targets can be designed to safely accelerate ulcer healing and reverse the negative impact of steroids on mucosal repair in colitis."
"9143250","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Rates of alcohol use disorders are high among combat Veterans, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the most prevalent and costly substance use disorder among Veterans (SAMSHA, 2012). Current AUD is estimated at 16% in recently deployed veterans seeking VA care (VHA, 2011), and is approximately four times as common among combat Veterans than in the general population (Kessler et al., 2005). Care for individuals with AUD is standardized for across Veterans. An objective care framework that identifies individuals at highest risk for relapse may improve clinical outcomes. In addition, women may be more susceptible to consequences of problematic drinking behaviors than men, despite fewer years of drinking and less total drinks consumed yet research on AUD in women Veterans is sparse. Individuals with psychiatric co-morbidities have poorer outcomes than those with AUD alone, yet most research to date has excluded those with co-morbidities, leading to research results that are not generalizable to all Veterans with AUD. Evidence suggests that one component of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying AUD include dysregulation of emotional salience and reward circuits. It is not yet known exactly how dysfunction in brain circuits contribute to AUD, and how gender and co-morbidities moderate these effects, but research that answers these questions is critical.  The current diagnostic and assessment system does not provide a model for objectively identifying individuals at highest risk for relapse following treatment. The checklist of symptoms that defines AUD does not reflect underlying neurobiology, yet brain circuit function predisposes individuals to AUD (e.g., to relieve anxiety or seek reward) and the effects of AUD can produce chronic changes to these circuits even after abstinence. We also know that these circuits may be moderated by other individual characteristics such as gender and/or the presence of a psychiatric co-morbidity. Technological advances in brain imaging have revolutionized our capacity to understand the brain circuits that underlie complex behaviors such as addiction. The most significant advancement in brain imaging research has been to identify core nodes of the large-scale circuits that are dysfunctional in mental health disorders. Despite this advance, there  is a critical gap in integrated brain-based models of addiction.  The proposed CSR&D CDA-2 seeks to fill this gap by conducted a neuroimaging study to assess the degree to which disconnections in networks implicated in reward and emotion circuits contribute to risk of relapse following treatment. We will achieve this via three specific aims: Aim 1: Define the neural circuits of emotion and reward processing that underlie AUD in Veterans. Aim 2: Test the relationship between defined neural circuits and treatment outcome (abstinence vs. relapse) and probability of relapse risk. Aim 3: Explore the impact of gender, psychiatric co-morbidities, and craving on the model developed in Aim 2. To test these aims, we will recruit 100 Veterans (50 men and 50 women) from outpatient and residential substance use treatment programs. In order to provide the most generalizable information, we will not exclude female Veterans or those with co-occurring depression, anxiety and PTSD.  Currently there are no neuroimaging studies that have examined brain circuits as they relate to relapse risk in men and women Veterans with AUD. Findings from the proposed study will be the first to determine if brain circuits underlying in AUD can be used to predict relapse in this population. This study is a foundational first step and will lay the groundwork in using innovative neuroimaging technology to identify individuals at greatest risk who may need prolonged or more precise treatment strategies. This neuroscience based translational program of research will help vulnerable Veteran populations obtain more effective treatments and achieve better outcomes."
"9138391","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Veterans suffer at a disproportional rate from squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) due to carcinogen exposure from tobacco and alcohol. Despite aggressive treatments, SCCHN is a devastating disease that portends an overall 5-year survival of only ~50%. A comprehensive genomic analysis of SCCHN revealed that ~30% of these tumors overexpress a gene that encodes a calcium-activated chloride channel (TMEM16A/ ANO1). Mechanistic studies have shown that TMEM16A contributes to tumor cell growth by activating the EGFR-ERK1/2 pathway. EGFR is the only FDA-approved molecular therapeutic target in SCCHN, yet the critical therapeutic biomarker(s) that predict response to anti-EGFR therapy remains unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the how TMEM16A and EGFR interact with each other to promote tumor growth and progression. We propose the following studies: 1) determine whether chloride flux through TMEM16A is necessary and sufficient to activate EGFR signaling; 2) examine how TMEM16A interacts with EGFR, and if this interaction is necessary for tumor cell growth; and 3) use a patient samples and tissues derived from a mouse model of carcinogenesis to determine if TMEM16A expression / TMEM16A-EGFR interaction is required for the development of oral dysplasia and ultimately progression to invasive carcinoma. At the conclusion of this project, we intend to implicate TMEM16A as a direct therapeutic target for the treatment of Veterans with OSCC."
"9135913","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Depression is among the most common, disabling, and expensive disorders afflicting our nation's veterans. Cellular and molecular studies of circadian (ca. 24 hr) biological clocks have recently provided tantalizing clues that clock defects may be involved not just in sleep disorders but in a wide range of clinical maladies, including mood disorders. Objectives: Our long-term goal is to define the precise relationship between genetically determined cellular circadian clock function and human mood dysregulation. Our overall hypothesis is that normal mood regulation requires proper circadian timing within brain circuits, and that mood disorders are therefore associated with dysfunction of the circadian clock at a cellular level. We hypothesize that vulnerability to mood disorders arises from clock defects not in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's master circadian pacemaker, but rather in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in mood regulation that contains a separate circadian clock. Our specific hypotheses are that: (1) circadian clocks are weak in human cells from depressed patients, (2) circadian clocks are also weak in NAc neurons in a mouse model of depression, and (3) weak circadian clocks in the NAc can increase vulnerability to depression in mice by removing normal daily cyclic repression of the CREB signaling pathway by the clock protein CRY. Specifically, we aim to test for circadian dysfunction in skin cells from depressed patients and in neurons from mice exhibiting depression-like behavior. We will then test whether manipulating the circadian clock or CREB signaling in NAc cells of mice alters their vulnerability to depression-like behavior. Research Design & Methodology: We will use viral vectors to introduce a firefly luciferase circadian reporter gene into human skin cells obtained by our collaborators. We will then monitor circadian rhythms of cell bioluminescence by luminometry and single-cell imaging, and analyze comprehensively the functioning of the clock, as well as expression levels of core clock genes. Next, we will use behaviorally induced learned helplessness as a mouse model of depression. Mice will harbor a bioluminescent circadian reporter, allowing us to test circadian clock function in NAc neuronal cells as we did in human cells. We will also measure levels of core clock gene expression and CREB activity in NAc brain slices, expecting to find low Cry expression and high P-CREB. Finally, we will manipulate clock or CREB function in mouse NAc by injection of various inhibitory RNAs or CREB constructs, respectively, followed by testing vulnerability to induced learned helplessness. We expect that weakening NAc rhythms by Cry knockdown, but not by knockdown of a different clock gene, will increase vulnerability to learned helplessness, and that selectively reducing CREB function at dawn, by properly phased rhythmic expression of a dominant-negative CREB construct, will be optimal for reducing vulnerability. Clinical Relationships: Our goal is an improved understanding of the relationship between neuronal circadian clocks and depression. This project may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to mood disorders, which are major afflictions and sources of disability for veterans."
"9032292","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Pharmacogenomics of risk factors and therapies outcomes for kidney disease Kidney disease is highly prevalent among US Veterans, affecting more than 200,000 patients and it is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Pharmacologic treatment of major risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), hypertension (HT), and immunosuppression after kidney transplantation (KTx), remain the mainstays of preventing chronic kidney disease (CKD), progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) and premature death. However, wide heterogeneity in both the pharmacologic response to therapies and risk factors limits the full potential benefit of therapy. The overall aim of this proposal is to use genome wide association studies (GWAS) to promote personalized medicine for patients at risk of incident and progressive CKD by increasing our understanding in the following three domains: 1) The pharmacogenomics of metformin for the treatment of T2D: Metformin is the recommended first line therapy for the treatment of diabetes and is superior for reducing CV death and CKD incidence compared to other alternatives. However, marked inter individual variability in the glycemic response to metformin exists5,6. There have been few genome wide association studies and these are limited by the sample size. The NIH recently highlighted the need to improve our understanding of the genetic determinants of the glycemic response to metformin, which will allow personalized prescription of metformin and potentially prevention of diabetes complications like CKD. 2) The Genetic determinants of HT and Resistant HT (RHT): Hypertension (HT) is a major contributor to loss of kidney function, especially among patients with RHT (defined as failure to achieve BP targets with three or more drugs or success with four or more drugs). In the VA population, hypertension prevalence approaches 70%. The prevalence of RHT has been estimated at 9-17% with strong disparities for African Americans (AA). GWAS have identified in African ancestry few novel loci involved in BP traits. However, despite the severe long-term effects of uncontrolled HT and RHT on health, no GWAS studies of RHT risk have been published. 3) The pharmacogenomics of immunosuppressive therapy (IT) after KTx: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), such as tacrolimus, are the backbone of IT regimens, and are essential for long-term kidney graft survival by preventing rejection. The benefits of IT are mitigated by loss of kidney function due to under dosing or nephrotoxicity due to over dosing. We have shown that blood concentrations of tacrolimus are influenced by cytochrome P450 3A5 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs776746. This study will further expand our knowledge in genetic determinants of tacrolimus levels, which are essential for personalized dosing of tacrolimus in KTx and prevention of rejection or CNI nephrotoxicity. In this proposal, we will leverage the resources from the Million Veterans Program (MVP) genetic data linked to the Veterans Administration national electronic medical record, which provide an unprecedented large cohort, to perform a series of GWAS to discover and validate the genetic determinants of the pharmacologic response to these key therapies and risk factors. We will replicate our results in the Vanderbilt DNA Repository. We will accomplish our goals with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the genetic determinants of the response to metformin therapy on glycemic lowering response using the lowest HbA1c in the 18 months following an incident metformin prescription. Aim 2: To evaluate the genetic determinants of HT and RHT Aim 3: To evaluate the genetic variants associated with the pharmacokinetic response to tacrolimus in KTx recipients by using routinely measured blood concentrations for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose titration. The current proposal will promote personalized medicine in the VA system for the care provided to patients with or at risk of CKD. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team and we are well poised to conduct the work proposed."
"9189456","PROJECT SUMMARY Hypertension, the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) worldwide, affects nearly one in three adults in the United States and has been negatively associated with increased sodium consumption. High salt diets mediate an increase in sodium delivery and flow in the renal tubules, where nitric oxide synthase-1 (NOS1) has long been known to act as a key natriuretic factor. However, the mechanisms by which NOS1 activity is upregulated to promote nitric oxide (NO) production under high flow conditions is still elusive. The central hypothesis of the proposed studies is that, within renal inner-medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells, high tubular flow leads to increased histone deacetylation 1 (HDAC1)- and cilia- mediated NOS1 upregulation that leads to increased nitric oxide production and, subsequently, effective natriuresis. In order to study the contribution of HDAC1, we will utilize mouse IMCD cells in vitro and ex vivo under acute flow conditions to elucidate the nature and location of interactions between HDAC1 and NOS1. HDAC1 inhibitor MS-275 and NOS1 site-specific lysine mutants will aid in pinpointing these connections. To determine the contribution of primary cilia, we will utilize cilia-deficient renal epithelial cells in vitro to illuminate the capability of cilia to activate NOS1 in response to flow and visualize the impact of mechanosensation via real-time simultaneous measurements of intracellular calcium signaling and NO production. Furthermore, fluid-electrolyte homeostasis will be examined using a collecting duct deficient mouse model (CDIFTKO). The long-term goal of this research is to harness the understanding of NOS1 activity to direct cardiovascular interventions beneficial to hypertension patients."
"9136481","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. The 2015 global cancer statistics report indicated an estimated 951,600 new gastric cancer cases and 723,100 deaths occurred in 2012. Several studies have reported frequent association of gastric adenocarcinoma with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. The World Health Organization has classified H. pylori as a class I carcinogen and the main risk factor for gastric cancer. Despite efforts to eradicate H. pylori, infection remains a global health problem with almost half of the world's population infected. Of note, chronic infection with H. pylori persists for several decades before the development of gastric cancer. This latency in the development of gastric cancer and the fact that only 1% of infected individuals develop cancer suggests that epithelial cells have an inherent protective capacity against cellular transformation  by H. pylori. When epithelial cells lose their protective capacity, they become prone to the carcinogenic effects of H. pylori, leading to the development of intestinal metaplasia, gastric dysplasia and progression to cancer. We and others have reported that trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) expression is lost in nearly all human gastric cancers. Our studies have shown that TFF1 is a potent tumor suppressor and anti-inflammatory protein. Our preliminary data in this proposal, using in vitro and in vivo models as well as carcinogenic H. pylori strains, demonstrate that TFF1 suppresses activation of STAT3 and expression of its target genes that are involved in proliferation, anti-apoptosis angiogenesis, invasion, and immune evasion. Based on our novel findings, we hypothesize that TFF1 is as a gatekeeper protein in gastric epithelial cells that suppresses the dynamic pro-inflammatory oncogenic cross-talk between STAT3 and NFkB  in gastric tumorigenesis. Our goal is to understand the molecular and functional consequences of loss of TFF1 as they relate to STAT3 and NF??B cross-talk in H. pylori-induced molecular signaling in the multi- step gastric carcinogenesis cascade. In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanisms by which TFF1 regulates STAT3 in gastric tumorigenesis (Aim 1). We will determine the molecular and biological functions of TFF1 loss and activation of STAT3- NFkB  pro-inflammatory cross-talk signaling in gastric tumorigenesis in Aim 2. In addition, we will investigate the clinical significance and associations between TFF1 loss and activation of NFkB  and STAT3 across stages of human gastric tumorigenesis (Aim 3). We will also test the therapeutic significance of inhibiting STAT3 as a single agent or in combined regimens in pre-clinical models of gastric tumorigenesis. This proposal tackles etiology-based biologically-relevant questions to uncover novel information regarding the role of TFF1-loss in shaping the H. pylori-induced inflammation and carcinogenic signaling in the multi-step gastric tumorigenesis. A successful completion of this project will have a positive impact on understanding the biology and identification of diagnostic, prognostic and possibly therapeutic targets in gastric cancer."
"9236857","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive scarring interstitial lung disease (ILD) that affects mainly older adults. Recently, a paradigm shift has occurred wherein the concepts of epithelial cell dysfunction and abnormal wound healing have been placed at center stage as mechanisms driving fibrotic lung remodeling offering new opportunities for therapeutic discovery for IPF. Surfactant protein C (SP-C), an alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell-specific hydrophobic protein that enhances the biophysical activity of surfactant phospholipid, has provided an important clue for understanding epithelial cell dysfunction in IPF pathogenesis as the heterozygous expression of over 50 mutations in the SFTPC gene in humans is associated with chronic ILD. During the current funding period we have shown that sequence alterations in the SP-C primary translation product (proSP-C) associated with clinical ILD phenotypes result in either of 2 distinct aberrant cellular expression patterns, each capable of triggering a series of aberrant cellular responses. ILD-associated, aggregation-prone SP- C isoforms resulting from mutations within the distal COOH domain of the SP-C proprotein (termed ?BRICHOS?) produce vigorous induction of an unfolded protein response (UPR), ER stress, and apoptosis. We have also made the seminal observation that SFTPC mutations found in the more proximal proSP-C COOH linker domain (?Non-BRICHOS?) are mistrafficked to the plasma membrane with a secondary disruption of endosomal / lysosomal function. The induced cellular phenotype includes a late block in macroautophagy, impaired mitophagy, and alterations in general proteostasis repertoires. Building on this, the overall goal of this Merit Review renewal is to now use SFTPC mutants as substrates in vivo to identify and translate molecular mechanisms underlying the disrupted cellular quality control and epithelial dysfunction to the pathophysiology of IPF/ILDs. This proposal will leverage a novel mouse model also generated in the current cycle which expresses the disease-causing clinical non-BRICHOS SFTPC mutant, SP-CI73T, exclusively in AT2 cells. Our Preliminary Data reveals that SP-CI73T mice exhibit alterations in normal proSP-C biosynthetic routing, acquire disruptions in AT2 cell autophagy, and develop diffuse parenchymal lung remodeling. Our experimental approach will be to exploit the unique features of this genetic model combined with tools and reagents available in our program designed to interogate cell quality control and integrated stress responses to first define the ontogeny of and cellular mechanisms mediating the aberrant lung injury, repair, and remodeling responses induced by non-BRICHOS SP-C mutations in vivo [Specific Aim 1]. This will be combined with reductionist studies using primary AT2 cell culures isolated from SP-CI73T mice at key time points in the development of the lung phenotype to characterize the biosynthesis and specific AT2 cellular responses to mutant SP-CI73T in vitro [Specific Aim 2]. Finally, to obtain a more complete model of IPF pathogenesis, the effect of exogenous ?second hits? such as oxidative-nitrative stress and infection on the SP-CI73T mouse lung phenotype will be investigated [Specific Aim 3]. As epithelial dysfunction and susceptibility to injury have not been studied extensively in vivo in the context of fibrotic lung diseases, this approach offers the unique opportunity to comprehensively identify mechanisms mediating responses to the mutant SFTPC substrate by AT2 cells, and to assess the pathways promoting crosstalk between AT2 cells, inflammatory cells and fibroblasts that drive parenchymal remodeling. By understanding the path to epithelial injury from mutant SP-C, the mechanisms identified using these systems can be cross-purposed to better understand the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial IPF."
"9231123","Project Summary/Abstract My primary research interest focuses on the central nervous system regulation of visceral pain with a strategic objective of using preclinical rodent models and multiple state-of-the-art techniques, from molecular and cellular to behavioral, pharmacological and electrophysiological methods to advance basic scientific knowledge that has direct relevance to the diagnosis and treatment of veterans with visceral pain. Below I have summarized the main research projects in my laboratory. 1. Central Neural Circuitry Underlying Anxiety and Visceral pain: Mechanisms of Resilience and Novel Treatments: In one aspect of my research we are studying the neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological substrates involved in the interaction between visceral pain and anxiety. My research focuses on the role of amygdala-mediated mechanisms in the control of visceral and somatic pain and the mechanisms connecting anxiety and visceral (colonic) hypersensitivity. We are attempting to identify at least one potential neural substrate that might be involved in the central processing of visceral pain. From there we hope to identify a receptor mechanism within the neural substrate that mediates central processing of visceral pain. A long-term goal is to investigate how the neural substrate modulates visceral pain sensitivity within the larger neural pathway controlling anxiety, and use this knowledge to identify potential pharmacotherapeutic targets in the central processing pathway that mediates visceral pain. We have demonstrated long lasting increases in anxiety-like behavior and viscerosomatic sensitivity in response to the local exposure of the amygdala to corticosterone (CORT). We found persistent down-regulation of GR expression and increases in the expression of CRF and HCN1 channels leading to hyper-excitability of the CeA neurons. These changes in gene expression represent a potential mechanism leading to chronic anxiety and pain, via facilitation of the HPA axis. The objective of latest experiments has been to use gene knockdown to directly manipulate CRF and GR expression in the central amygdala. We found that knockdown of CRF within the amygdala inhibits stress-induced chronic visceral and somatic pain, and that loss of GR within the amygdala is key to triggering visceral and somatic pain. Such findings are relevant for the future development of gene targeted therapeutics to treat stress-induced visceral and somatic pain (Funded by the Department of Veteran's Affairs Merit Award: 2013-2017). 2. Early life stress on visceral and somatic pain in adulthood: Sex differences. In women, IBS is the most prevalent GI disorders. Emotional stressors, increased anxiety or uni- and bipolar associative disorders often exacerbate symptoms. Despite this knowledge and evidence that females embody strong connections to life stressors, physical/sexual abuse and an emotionally reactive disposition related to the outbreak of symptomatology, there has been very little progress made to enhance our understanding of the descending connections between the brain and the GI tract in female Veterans. Our latest project was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which the context of the early life stress (ELS) can affect nociception in adulthood. We are also exploring evidence for a two hit hypothesis underlying the vulnerability to visceral pain in females. Specifically, we will investigate the mechanisms by which an unpredictable stress in early life leads to chronic abdominal pain in adulthood. Additionally we will assess the impact of ELS on the amygdala response to an adult stressor (Funded by the Department of Veteran's Affairs Merit Award: 2010-2014; 2015- 2019)."
"9192661","Project Summary/Abstract Contrary to the widely-held belief that nearly all vertebrate cells have primary cilia, our lab recently discovered that extra-embryonic visceral endoderm cells lack primary cilia. Our lab was also the first to demonstrate that primary cilia are required for all signaling through the Hedgehog pathway in mammals, which is consistent with data that extra-embryonic cells do not respond to Hedgehog ligands. However, extra-embryonic cells do secrete Hedgehog ligands, which are required for normal development of the embryo-derived vasculature of the placenta. I hypothesized that other cell types that make, but do not respond, to Hedgehog ligands may also lack cilia. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that epithelia of a number of adult endodermal organs, which secrete but do not respond to Hedgehog ligands, lack primary cilia. However, I have also found that endodermal epithelia have primary cilia in early development. This primary cilia are present early in gut tube morphogenesis but are lost before adulthood, suggesting that dynamic signals from adjacent tissues can inhibit formation of primary cilia. In the proposed research, I will determine at what point primary cilia are lost in endodermal epithelium, which will allow me to identify the exogenous signals present at this time point. Expression of candidate factors will be manipulated to test whether primary cilia can be ectopically assembled in cells that would normally lack these organelles. I will also test the functional relevance the lack of autocrine hedgehog signaling in these tissue by expressing a constitutively active mutant of Gli2, the major Hedgehog transcriptional activator, in embryonic and adult endodermal epithelium, and assaying its effects on gut development and recovery from gut injury. To find additional factors responsible for inhibition of ciliogenesis, I propose to perform transcriptome analysis of ciliated and non-ciliated endodermal epithelium. I also propose to perform screens to identify small molecules that can induce cilia on non-ciliated extra embryonic visceral endodermal stem cells (XEN), in an effort to find therapeutic targets capable of inducing ectopic ciliogenesis, which may prove invaluable in treatment of a variety of developmental disorders and cancers."
"9185465","Kansas PRAMS: Component A (Core Surveillance) Project Summary/Abstract The Kansas Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is a collaborative project with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish a state-specific, population-based, epidemiological surveillance system of selected maternal attitudes, behaviors, and experiences during preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum. The Kansas PRAMS provides data to inform a variety of maternal and child health issues. Two major goals of the Kansas PRAMS are to: 1) reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, and 2) to reduce low birth weight. The specific aims of the Kansas PRAMS project are to provide quality, statewide, population- based surveillance data to inform the Kansas Title V Maternal and Child Health Priorities for the next five years. The Title V Priorities include: 1) Women have access to and receive coordinated, comprehensive care and services before, during and after pregnancy, 2) Services and supports promote healthy family functioning, 3) Developmentally appropriate care and services are provided across the lifespan, 4) Families are empowered to make educated choices about nutrition and physical activity, 5) Communities and providers/systems of care support physical, social, and emotional health, 6) Professionals have the knowledge and skills to address the needs of maternal and child populations, 7) Services are comprehensive and coordinated across systems and providers, and 8) Information is available to support informed health decisions and choices. PRAMS contacts new mothers two to six months after delivering a live birth. The sample is drawn from the Kansas birth certificate file. Mothers from this sample are mailed a questionnaire covering a number of questions related to prenatal and postnatal behaviors and experiences. The PRAMS Project utilizes a mixed mode surveillance system, meaning respondents are sent up to three mail survey packets, followed by telephone contact for nonrespondents. Incentives and rewards are used in an effort to maximize participation in the study. PRAMS data contribute to maternal and health planning and decision making statewide and help further the Kansas Department of Health and Environment?s mission to ?protect and improve the health and environment of all Kansans.?"
"9238578","[ Persistent memory impairment is one of the most common complaints after brain injury and is the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI; a transitional stage between healthy aging and AD). The prevalence of these conditions is increasing, as 40% of the VA population is elderly and age is the greatest risk factor for AD. Head injury also increases the risk of developing AD and the incidence of brain injury in Veterans (and the memory sequelae that accompanies it) has increased in recent years due to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Efforts to understand the functional and structural substrates of memory impairment have focused almost entirely on impaired new learning. Impaired remembering of the past (retrograde memory [RM] loss) has received little attention even though this impairment is particularly devastating (e.g., one forgets family relationships, important events, and facts about the world). Although impaired new learning is well studied, RM has received less attention even though Veterans with MCI and AD exhibit severe RM loss. Interestingly, individuals with MCI can exhibit relatively mild impairment in new learning in conjunction with relatively severe RM loss, suggesting that a new tool to detect RM loss could serve as an early estimate of cognitive and neural decline associated with the development of AD. Older Veterans exhibit changes in brain structure and function as the result of aging, and Veterans with aMCI exhibit even more significant changes in the brain. We will study RM in these two groups and identify brain regions (and connections between brain regions) where measures of structure and function are related to performance on RM tests. The two goals of the proposal are 1) to identify which brain regions support RM in cognitively normal older Veterans; and then 2) determine if a RM test could serve as a novel and unique gauge of the cognitive and neural changes associated RM loss in MCI. As time passes after learning, it is thought that the role of the hippocampus and related structures in supporting memory retrieval gradually decreases, whereas the role of the prefrontal cortex and other cortical areas gradually increase (memory consolidation). These observations are typically observed across years and decades in humans but, curiously, across days and weeks in animals. The proposed studies will identify the neuroanatomy of RM for both the short and longer time frames. In addition, we will identify the relevant neuroanatomy using four neuroimaging measures (i.e., 2 focusing on brain regions and 2 focusing on connections between brain regions). For the longer time frame, memory for facts will be tested during functional brain imaging (fMRI). The facts will concern 160 notable news events that occurred 1 to 30 years earlier. For the short time frame, memory will be tested during scanning for 320 fact- like, three-word sentences that were learned 1 hour to 1 month earlier. Measures of grey and white matter structure will also be obtained from anatomical magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, respectively. To identify regions where structural changes correlate with the accuracy of RM, we will identify correlations between measures of brain structure (grey matter and white matter) and performance on the RM tests. Measures of brain function will be obtained from task-related fMRI activity and task-related fMRI functional connectivity. To identify regions where function correlates with RM, we will identify regions where brain activity and brain connectivity change with the age of memory. Next, we will ask which findings for structure and function are common to both time frames. Then, we will determine if the brain regions important for RM in cognitively normal older Veterans are dysfunctional or damaged in Veterans with aMCI. Finally, for developing a practical RM test, we will identify a subset of the questions that best predict genetic, neuropsychological, and neural risk for developing AD. We anticipate that a RM test can serve as a robust and sensitive clinical measure for staging preclinical AD or gauging the efficacy of treatments in Veterans with neurodegenerative disorders and reduce the burden on caregivers and VA Healthcare. ]"
"9241240","Coronary artery disease is the principal cause of myocardial infarction (MI) and a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality in the veteran population. A consequence of MI is congestive heart failure (CHF), which is secondary to defective myocardial remodeling post-infarct. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant role for inflammation and immune cells in cardiac remodeling, particularly infiltrating monocyte/macrophage cells in cardiac repair. We recently determined that the oral immunosuppressant FTY720 is cardioprotective and increases survival in mouse models of coronary ligation and accelerated atherosclerosis leading to heart failure. While FTY720 has been shown to exert direct protective cell signaling effects in cardiac myocytes, its effects on immune cells, which result in cardioprotection have not been delineated. Our proposal focuses on our central hypothesis that cardiac ischemic injury initiates an inflammatory response that promotes abnormal cardiac remodeling which can be interrupted by immune modulation. Our proposal will determine specific changes in immune cells following FTY720 treatment that correlate with improved outcomes and determine if an optimal window for protective immune modulation exists following an ischemic event. By identifying specific changes induced by immune modulation, we will determine mechanisms that initiate beneficial cardioprotective immune responses that will be useful to target therapeutically and identify biomarkers that reflect the pathological aspects of the immune responses to MI. We will investigate the hypothesis that FTY720 improves cardiac repair following an ischemic event by altering the influx, phenotype and function of cardiac monocyte-derived macrophages. We will explore potential cardioprotective mechanisms for FTY720 effects: 1) a direct effect of FTY720 on macrophage polarization and/or 2) a primary effect of FTY720 on lymphocyte egress. We will also determine whether a short, critical period of FTY720-driven immune modulation can improve outcomes in an ischemia-reperfusion model. Aim 1: Determine if FTY720 treatment alters post-infarct cardiac macrophage phenotype  and function. Aim 2: Determine if cardio-protective effects of FTY720 against ischemic injury are  dependent on B lymphocyte trafficking. Aim 3: Determine if a limited window of FTY720 treatment is cardioprotective following  ischemic injury. Our multi-PI proposal leverages the expertise of established investigators with diverse areas of expertise in cardiac remodeling, immunity and macrophage biology. Together we are well positioned to explore how modulation of immunity can impact and improve cardiac repair. Significantly, our findings will define mechanisms by which FTY720 improves post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and survival, which could lead to new therapeutics to improve repair post-MI and decrease CHF. Our project is novel in that it seeks to define a mechanism of beneficial immune modulation in the post-ischemia setting and will identify how FTY720 alters cardiac inflammation post-ischemia/reperfusion injury and the cell types responsible for cardioprotection."
"9120586","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently, 25% of the U.S population suffers from metabolic syndrome (MetS) which is a condition defined by the presence of at least 3 of these criteria: central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, diabetes and hypertension. The incidence of MetS has paralleled the increasing rate of renal disease. Renal disease associated with MetS can occur before the onset of hypertension or diabetes. Consequently, available treatment options for MetS are only partially effective in preventing or delaying the progression of renal disease. Other studies have revealed obese and/or MetS patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) present with elevated levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1). However, the role of ET-1 in the progression of renal disease associated with MetS remains unclear. For these reasons, there is a critical need to identify the early mechanisms by which MetS triggers the development of CKD so that more effective treatment strategies can be developed. Recently, we characterized a rodent model of MetS that develops progressive renal injury including renal lipid accumulation without developing overt diabetes and hypertension (SSLepR-/- strain). In the current proposal, we will use this model to determine these underlying mechanisms. Our preliminary data suggest ET-1 production is associated with the early development of proteinuria and changes in renal hemodynamics that may contribute to the early renal injury seen in these rats. Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that altered renal hemodynamics is an early event occurring in MetS that stimulates glomerular ET-1 production leading to increase podocyte lipid accumulation via the ETA receptor thus facilitating chronic inflammation resulting in podocyte damage, proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis and CKD. We test the central hypothesis in three specific aims: Aim 1 will investigate whether increases in mechanical strain directly stimulates ET-1 production and contributes to podocyte injury, Aim 2 determine that increased lipid accumulation in podocytes is mediated by the ETA receptor, and Aim 3 to test the effects chronic blockade of the ET- 1/ETA cascade in delayig the development of renal injury and prevent renal lipid accumulation in the SSLepR-/- strain. This proposal will use a combination of novel in vivo and in vitro experimental techniques to determine whether ET-1 participates in renal lipid accumulation during the development of renal disease associated with MetS."
"9174066","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Corneal & retinal angiogenesis are driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and are key events in corneal transplant rejection, trauma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. Current treatments for these conditions rely on chronic monthly injections of anti-VEGF agents (e.g., Avastin(R); Lucentis(R)) into the eye, with attendant risks of hemorrhage and infection. We propose to suppress VEGF using a sustained-release, intracellular, anti-angiogenic strategy. This strategy uses morpholinos which shift VEG receptor 1 or 2 (Flt-1 or KDR, respectively) expression towards their soluble isoform, essentially inhibitin membrane-bound receptor expression and increasing expression of soluble, decoy receptors. This strategy has potential benefit for treating corneal transplant rejection, macular degeneration and other ocular vascular disorders.  During the prior funding period, we used biodegradable, nontoxic, albumin nanoparticles containing plasmids expressing anti-VEGF molecules to sustain angioinhibition for up to 6 weeks. We will next advance nanoparticle delivery through conjugation with transferrin (to facilitate topical delivery) or with arginine-glycine- aspartic acd (RGD) oligopeptides (to home to neovascular tissues). Targeted delivery of anti-angiogenics to block VEGF intracellularly selectively in neovascular tissues is a significant unmet medical need as recent data indicate that long-term use of intravitreal ranibizumab (the widely used anti-VEGF Fab fragment, which binds VEGF extracellularly) is associated with a 30% risk of developing geographic atrophy within 2 years and over 50% risk at 7 years. Based on the above rationale, our central hypotheses are that:  [a] expression of morpholinos promoting soluble VEGF receptors, will inhibit corneal transplant rejection  and choroidal neovascularization; and  [b] nanoparticle-morpholino therapy may reduce fibrosis or atrophy. Our specific aims are to test the following predictions based on the above hypotheses:  1. Morpholinos will inhibit angiogenesis and rejection of corneal transplants. We will test delivery using  intracorneal and subconjunctival injections, as well as topical delivery of nanoparticles designed to cross  the corneal epithelium.  2. Targeted nanoparticles delivering morpholinos can inhibit and regress choroidal neovascularization  (CNV) in laser-induced and transgenic models  3. Long-term nanoparticle-mediated expression of morpholinos inhibits fibrosis and induces less atrophy  in corneal transplants and choroidal neovascularization.  The results of these studies will define whether intracellular anti-angiogenic therapy can inhibit corneal  rejection and macular degeneration, and demonstrate the potential of nanoparticles for long-term anti-  angiogenic therapy either by topical routes for corneal disease or targeted systemic delivery for age related  macular degeneration. These may enable new treatment modalities which avoid the risks of current  standard of care."
"9274916","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The onset of clinical heart failure (HF) is associated with poor prognosis even today, and unfortunately the incidence of HF is projected to continue to increase in the coming decades. Therefore, organizations such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have identified the prevention of HF as a major need and therefore have commenced efforts aimed at preventing HF. Early initiatives included a new system of HF classification which identified at risk individuals as Stage A (those with risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes) or Stage B (those with some structural myocardial changes [for example, left ventricular hypertrophy] but without manifest HF). However, such systems of classification identified the majority (~65-75%) of a middle-aged population as Stage A or B. Recently we have shown that HF risk prediction can be improved using cardiac troponin T measured with a novel high-sensitivity assay (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Furthermore, hs-cTnT seems to identify individuals at higher risk among those with established risk factors (such as hypertension) for HF. In preliminary results, we have shown that individuals with systolic blood pressure of 120- 129 mm Hg and elevated hs-cTnT have a higher rate of incident HF than those with systolic blood pressure of 150-159 mm Hg and undetectable hs-cTnT. Therefore, we believe that by using hs-cTnT to estimate HF risk we can identify individuals in whom aggressive modification of risk factors such as high blood pressure will be associated with a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Our objective/specific aim therefore is to evaluate if treatment of selected subjects with Stage A or B HF (i.e., those with hs-cTnT >5 ng/L and an estimated 10-year HF hospitalization risk of >5%) who have reasonably well- controlled blood pressure with antihypertensive agents (carvedilol or spironolactone) will be associated with improvement of surrogate markers associated with incident HF (i.e., speckle-tracked cardiac and vascular strain). Carvedilol and spironolactone were chosen for the following reasons: a) they are not routinely used as first-line antihypertensive agents; b) beta-blockade was associated with decreases in hs-cTnT in our preliminary analysis of subjects with established HF; and c) the mechanism of actions of carvedilol and spironolactone provide a sound scientific rationale for use in prevention of HF. Using a prospective open-label blinded end point (PROBE) design, we propose to randomize 210 subjects aged >40 years with systolic blood pressure between 125-150 mm Hg, cardiac troponin T (measured with a novel high- sensitivity assay) level >5 ng/L, and 10-year HF risk >5% (estimated using a validated laboratory model including demographic factors, NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnT) to receive carvedilol (nonselective beta-blocker), spironolactone (aldosterone antagonist), or usual care for 18 months. The primary end point will be change in global longitudinal systolic myocardial strain estimated using 2D speckle tracking. Additionally, changes in vascular strain and biomarkers will be evaluated. This study will help us identify whether both or either of the medications can be further tested in large randomized clinical trials to prevent the incidence of HF."
"9137250","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Human squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) arising from the skin and oral cavity can present in an indolent form, similar to hibernation, with no obvious tumor expansion or local/systemic invasion. SCC indolence, which restricts net tumor expansion and invasion at the primary site, is severely understudied. Very little is known about why indolent SCCs persist and when they evolve into an aggressive form. Without molecular and cellular markers of SCC indolence, they are either over-treated thus causing morbidity or under-treated thus resulting in increased death. To overcome the lack of matched indolent and evolved SCCs in humans for comparative studies, we created a mouse model system, in which tumors developed from the same primary tumor can enter into and break out of indolence. In this system, we targeted a KrasG12D mutant and Smad4 deletion, the two most frequent genetic alterations in human SCCs, into keratin K15+ stem cells. These mice rapidly develop SCCs. After transplanting these SCCs to the skin of immune compromised or immune competent mice, some grew similarly to parental tumors (non-indolent) while others became indolent. When indolent SCCs were out-of-indolence, they grew and metastasized rapidly. This unique model system provides matched indolent and out-of-indolence SCCs for longitudinal comparisons. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize: Breaking SCC indolence is not simply leaving proliferative dormancy or overcoming microenvironmental stress. Intrinsic tumor epithelial properties and microenvironmental influences that control self-renewal and motility of tumor cells are key contributors of breaking SCC indolence. Based on our preliminary data, Aim 1 will assess if the numbers and properties of a subset of tumor initiating cells (TICs) influence indolence. Aim 2 will assess if EMT-mediated TIC expansion and cell migration are sufficient to contribute to breaking indolence. Aim 3 will determine the net effect of tumor-associated macrophages and B lymphocytes on tumor indolence. In all three aims, cellular processes and molecules responsible for breaking SCC indolence in mice will be examined in human SCCs from our tumor bank to determine if these cellular and molecular markers correlate with non- or out-of-indolence behavior in human SCCs, thus predicting poor prognosis. Our unique model system, high throughput approaches and cross- species comparisons will significantly accelerate identification of markers associated with breaking SCC indolence. The proposed functional validation of candidate markers will simultaneously test therapeutic strategies to halt SCC evasion."
"9142792","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The U.S. Veteran population suffers from high rates of depression and significant mental health symptom burden. Sadly, suicide rates reflect this as well, being significantly higher for Veterans relative to the non-Veteran populations. Therefore, a critical need exists to identify the complex gene x environment interactions and the underlying neural substrates that drive the pathogenesis of depression. Clinical observations abound associating reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression with depression and increased BDNF expression with effective antidepressant responses. Rodent models have reliably confirmed those associations, and revealed important mechanistic roles for hippocampal BDNF expression in the response to antidepressant drugs. However, the neurobiological mechanisms by which reduced BDNF expression might engender vulnerability to the development of depression remain unclear. The existence of a high frequency polymorphism of the bdnf gene (Val66Met; allelic frequency 20- 35%) in humans that reduces BDNF protein levels makes this a highly relevant biomedical problem that needs to be addressed. Inflammation or chronic stress, as environmental precipitants of depression represent an ideal context to conduct translationally relevant mechanism based experiments aimed at understanding this gene x environment interaction. Our exciting new preliminary data, in both human and mouse model systems, suggest that BDNF may play an important negative regulatory role on microglial activation state, and disruption of the BDNF system sensitizes mice to the development of inflammation or stress-induced depressive-like behavior. The experiments proposed in this application will utilize two of the quintessential mouse models of environmentally-induced depressive-like behavior and novel methodology in a human postmortem system to better understand the interactions between the BDNF system and microglia activation state in relation to depression scores and prefrontal cortical (PFC)- dependent symptom profiles (e.g. impulsivity, cognitive flexibility and attention).  We propose to test the hypothesis that BDNF deficiency induces vulnerability to development of PFC- dependent depressive-like behaviors as a direct result of increased microglial reactivity and neurotoxic tryptophan metabolism. If successful, the new experimental data that emerge from these experiments can be immediately `reverse translated' to the clinic to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for vulnerable patients."
"9233587","My research focus is on Veterans who have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a war- related illness. I was among the first to document hostility, violence and anger among individuals (both men and women) with PTSD. I was also among the first researchers to observe that individuals with PTSD self-report and are diagnosed with more physical health problems, including cardiovascular disorders. This work has led to several significant contributions in understanding the behavioral and psychophysiological mechanisms that may contribute to increased risk of poor health among persons with PTSD, including that individuals with PTSD have higher ambulatory heart rate and blood pressure, lower baroreceptor sensitivity, and lower heart rate variability. I have shown that individuals with PTSD have reduced sleep duration and sleep efficiency, which may lead to reduced levels of ambulatory heart rate variability, and that these effects occur early in the trajectory of those who develop PTSD. I have investigated mechanisms that may explain the association between increased prevalence and higher nicotine dependence in smokers with PTSD. I evaluated the effect of nicotine and smoking behavior on prepulse inhibition as well as acoustic startle among smokers with and without PTSD. My research has shown that smokers with PTSD experience higher craving and negative affect in response to trauma cues, that smoking cigarettes with or without nicotine reduces symptoms, but the ameliorative effect is short lived, and that emotional reactivity to trauma stimuli is related to a shorter time to smoking relapse. I have developed a novel mobile health intervention that has shown tremendous promise toward reducing smoking among those with PTSD and other psychiatric disorders. I have worked with my colleagues to demonstrate that global positioning monitoring may be ultimately useful in intervening with smokers. I am currently expanding the evaluation of mobile health approaches in a NIH-funded treatment development grant for smokers with schizophrenia and a merit review-funded randomized clinical trial in homeless smokers. My mentees and I have several grant applications under review to extend this work to changing two behavioral targets simultaneously (e.g., quitting alcohol and smoking cigarettes; quitting smoking and increasing physical activity; and quitting smoking tobacco and marijuana). Each of these approaches may help Veterans with key health problems. Because of my expertise in PTSD mechanisms and experience with developing registries, I was invited to lead the Genetics Laboratory of the VA VISN 6 Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center in 2006, and I have served in that role since the inception of the VISN 6 MIRECC. The current registry has collected DNA and RNA among nearly 4,000 returning Veterans. My team and I have published a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with PTSD cases and non-cases, and evaluated several candidate genes in PTSD. I have also represented the MIRECC in the national PTSD Genetics Consortium, and the MIRECC samples have been included in a very large scale Consortium GWAS manuscript (more than 21,000 total samples) and a methylation manuscript. After collecting, extracting, and generating data over the past 10 years, we are currently excited to evaluate methylation and gene expression in the MIRECC sample as well as participate in the meta-analyses associated with the Consortium. I have recently been approved to serve as the Durham VAMC site PI for the VA Million Veteran Project (MVP), and this should lead to additional productive collaborations between the MIRECC Genetics Core and MVP-related projects focused on PTSD and substance abuse. I will continue my research program on PTSD and co-morbid conditions."
"9140679","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Acute and chronic inflammation is a common finding in the adult prostate that has been implicated in the genesis of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in aging men. The strong association has generated considerable interest in prostate inflammation and its potential as a therapeutic target to prevent or treat LUTS. We and others have postulated that prostatic inflammation contributes to development of LUTS in two ways: (1) producing irritative voiding symptoms by effects on afferent nerves co-innervating the prostate and bladder and (2) producing obstructive voiding symptoms by inducing fibrosis in the prostate. We will perform a retrospective analysis of surgically treated patients who underwent detailed preoperative urodynamic evaluation to examine the association of inflammation with fibrosis. To test the hypothesis that inflammation produces irritative symptoms, we will examine the correlation of inflammation with detrusor overactivity. To test the hypothesis that fibrosis produces obstruction,  we will examine the correlation between if fibrosis and increased urethral resistance. This analysis will provide the first comprehensive assessment correlating inflammation and fibrosis and their individual associations with changes in bladder function that are the hallmark of BPH/LUTS. We will perform mechanistic studies using an established mouse model of prostatic inflammation in which we have shown that inflammation induces a significant increase in voiding frequency and prostatic fibrosis. We will determine whether increased voiding frequency is associated with detrusor overactivity due to changes in motor nerve activity and/or cholinergic sensitivity of the detrusor and the role of epigenetic regulation in the fibrotic response. We will  then examine the reversibility abnormal voiding behavior and prostate fibrosis when inflammation subsides. Three specific aims examine the hypothesis that prostatic inflammation causes urinary frequency by producing detrusor overactivity and causes bladder outlet obstruction by inducing prostatic fibrosis. Specific Aim 1. Determine the association of transition  zone inflammation and fibrosis with detrusor overactivity and increased urethral resistance in men with BPH/LUTS. Specific Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that chronic prostate inflammation induces detrusor overactivity and increased voiding frequency. Specific Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that prostatic fibrosis associated with chronic inflammation is reversible."
"9033250","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The incretin glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has been a major focus of diabetes research and drug development for the past 20 years. The incretin system is essential for normal glucose homeostasis and recent evidence indicates that there is specific dysfunction of this system in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). While initially proposed to act as a hormone, secreted into the circulation from enteroendocrine cells, recent work has raised questions as to whether this is an important mechanism of endogenous GLP-1 action. In fact, GLP-1 circulates at low levels and is rapidly inactivated by specific enzymatic metabolism. Emerging information suggests that blood borne GLP-1 may not account for many of its actions. We have recently observed an important effect of GLP-1 receptor activity in the fasting state when plasma levels are very low and unchanging. These studies, in mice and humans, suggest a role for ?-cell GLP-1 to regulate insulin secretion as a paracrine factor. This is currently an underdeveloped area of research, but has the potential to dramatically change the understanding of the incretin effect and physiology of GLP-1. Given that there is already a solid base of therapeutics based on GLP-1, new mechanistic understanding could be rapidly translated into clinical application. This proposal will  take up the issue of fasting/paracrine GLP-1 action by addressing the following specific aims: 1. Determine the roles of fasting GLP-1 concentrations and alpha-cell secretion on insulin release; 2. Determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on the ?-cell response to insulin resistance; 3. Determine the role of basal GLP-1 action on fasting glucose regulation in lean, obese, prediabetic, and diabetic subjects. Each of these aims will be conducted in selected groups of human subjects.  The studies proposed herein will use methods of human investigation that we have developed or refined in recent years and take advantage of INDs issued to our group by the FDA to use synthetic GLP-1 and a GLP-1r agonist, exendin-(9-39), in human research. At the conclusion of this project we will have a much clearer picture of how GLP-1 regulates ?-cell function, and the role of fasting GLP-1r signaling and islet paracrine action in this process. A critical aspect of this project is the examination of ?-cell secretion of GLP-1 as central in the  regulation of fasting insulin secretion. In addition, the results of the experiments proposed herei will examine a novel role for GLP-1 in the compensation for abnormal glucose metabolism. We will connect the findings from studies of healthy subjects made insulin resistant with parallel measures in diabetic and prediabetic subjects. These related hypotheses are driven by the goal of optimizing the GLP-1 system as a means of improving metabolic control. Overall, the outcomes of this project will be beneficial to the broad swath of diabetic patients currently needing better treatment, both inside and outside the VA system."
"9339798","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There have been multiple attempts in the U.S. to close the gap in the quality of health care for diverse racial and ethnic subpopulations. In 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services launched the Healthy People 2020 plan. Two of four main goals of the plan are decreasing racial and ethnic health disparities and attaining high-quality lives free of preventable diseases. Because of this and other programs, a number of improvements in health care have been made that should help reduce health disparities in the U.S. Despite these efforts, some racial/ethnic minority groups still have considerably higher mortality rates from cancer and other smoking-caused conditions and diseases than Non-Hispanic (NH) White people. In addition, there are limited research findings regarding public awareness, efficacy and availability of smoking cessation methods for racial/ethnic minorities. The overall goals of the proposed study are to determine the quality of smoking- cessation-related (SCR) health care for diverse racial and ethnic groups, over-time changes in the quality of the SCR health care, and smokers' awareness and attitudes regarding currently available smoking cessation methods and treatments, as well as identify methods that have been used to successfully quit smoking. The primary investigation will focus on assessing potential differences with respect to each of these factors across the largest racial/ethnic U.S. subpopulations (i.e., NH White, NH Black/African American, and Hispanic); the secondary investigation will concern smaller U.S. subpopulations: NH American Indian/Alaska Native, NH Asian, and NH Multiracial. The necessity of differentiating between relatively large and small subpopulations is confirmed by the preliminary research findings. The data from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) will be used. The TUS-CPS is the key source of data on smoking behaviors among diverse racial/ethnic groups, including small U.S. subpopulations. The proposed research is innovative because it is the first study to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of smoking cessation efforts across diverse racial/ethnic groups using a representative sample of the adult U.S. population and the first to examine longitudinal changes in the quality of the SCR health care services, as well as differences in the SCR health care services offered to diverse racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities. Results of the proposed study are expected to play a vital role in improving the health care system as a whole, helping to close the gap in the quality of health care services offered to racial/ethnic minorities and non-minorities, and further decreasing rates of smoking-caused conditions and diseases across all subpopulations. The research findings will be beneficial for further refining smoking cessation programs for diverse subpopulations of smokers, increasing awareness of available smoking cessation interventions and medical treatments, and reducing smoking prevalence and rates of smoking-caused diseases and conditions, especially in underserved Americans."
"9051836","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We make multiple rapid eye movements, called saccades, every second. Each saccade disrupts the flow of visual information to the brain, yet our perception of the world is not that of jumpy images, but of a smooth and stable scene. One hypothesis behind this visual continuity is that the brain uses presaccadic visual information, combined with a copy of the oculomotor command, to predict the post-saccadic visual scene. After each eye movement, the afferent visual information may be compared with the prediction to evaluate object stability and update our internal model of the world. It was shown recently that  neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF) may contribute to this pre-/postsaccadic comparison, because they report whether visual stimuli change across saccades. My overall goal is to build on this previous work, using my background in biomedical engineering, to investigate transsaccadic visual stability through computationally grounded psychophysics and single neuron recordings. Our world is a complex landscape of stationary and dynamic objects, and therefore, my overall hypothesis is that our beliefs about object motion, our priors, affect visul perception during saccadic scanning of a scene. My first aim is to use novel psychophysics experiments to reveal how priors, coupled with visual evidence, influence perception across saccades. All of the experiments are grounded in a classic task called saccadic suppression of displacement, which permits fine-scale quantification of whether the visual scene appears stable across saccades. I will test the perceptual effects of three types of priors using the task: expectations about object movement, expectations about object identity, and expectations about the statistics of images that are not discrete objects. My second aim is to determine how priors are encoded by neurons in the FEF and influence their signals about transaccadic changes. I will record from FEF neurons in non-human primates as they perform a task of transaccadic visual stability that involves a range of learned priors about object movements. My prediction is FEF activity will not only report transaccadic changes in visual objects, but also will be modulated by priors just as behavior is modulated. The overall outcome of my project will be to advance our understanding of visual continuity across saccades at both the perceptual and neural levels, by taking into account the fact that subjects have a variety of expectations about the diverse elements of a scene."
"9259342","Project Summary Low birth weight (LBW) is an important risk factor for hypertension, cardiovascular and kidney disease; however, the mechanisms by which an adverse fetal environment programs risk for adult disease are poorly understood. Because this risk factor is determined at the beginning of a person?s lifespan, a better understanding of developmental programming can provide insight that improves early disease prevention and intervention to drastically reduce the burden of disease in later adulthood. Novel findings in this area also have great potential to reduce health disparities, as African-Americans are disproportionately affected by LBW and other conditions linked to this risk factor including hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Placental insufficiency is the most common cause of LBW in the Western world, and the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) animal model of preeclampsia mimics the same health effects seen in human offspring, including the sex differences in how programming influences cardio-renal disease. Evidence suggests that renal inflammation plays a mediatorial role in the link between hypertension and kidney damage. The objective of this project is to study the effects of chronic elevations in blood pressure on renal health in intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) offspring, and to elucidate the mechanisms by which changes during development lead to increased renal risk in later life in a sex-specific manner. This will be done by inducing a secondary insult of reduced renal mass by uni-nephrectomy in 18 month old IUGR offspring, and comparing physiological indicators of renal function as well as molecular and histological markers of tissue injury between control and IUGR males and females. Blood pressure-lowering and anti-inflammatory medications will also be used to determine whether early intervention can prevent this renal damage in response to an insult. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that intrauterine growth restriction programs a long-term increase in blood pressure in males that initiates a progressive accelerated age-related decline in renal function leading to an enhanced susceptibility to renal injury in growth-restricted rats. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that intrauterine growth restriction programs enhanced up-regulation of renal TNF-? and TGF-?1 in response to a secondary renal insult that contributes to enhanced susceptibility to renal injury in growth-restricted rats."
"9240497","Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and among Veterans in the United States, the third despite the successful implementation of successful preventive screening measures. One contributing factor that has newly emerged is the rapid development of cancers in small, sessile adenomas (polyps), with mutational processes and signatures that drive early CRC tumorigenesis. Yet, to date, biomarkers and risk factors for polyps (adenomas) that inordinately and rapidly develop into colon cancer remain poorly defined. We recently observed surprisingly high mutational profiles through whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis in 2 of 4 pairs of benign colorectal adenoma tissue samples. Extending this to unsupervised hierarchical clustered transcriptomic analysis of a further 7 pairs of adenomas reveals distinct mutational signatures regardless of adenoma size. Strikingly, we observe mutations in the TGF-? pathway and CEA-associated genes in 4 out of 11 adenomas, overlapping with the Wnt pathway. Immunohistochemical labeling reveals a nearly 5-fold increase in CEA levels in 23% of adenoma samples tested, with a concomitant loss of TGF-? signaling. We have defined a functional role by which the CEA B3 domain interacts with TGFBR1, potentially inactivating the tumor suppressor function of TGF-? signaling. Raised CEA levels occur with concomitant loss of TGF-? signaling and activation of oncogenic molecules that include STAT3. Furthermore, deletion of Smad3/4 adaptor ?2SP results in loss of TGF-? signaling, with a spontaneous formation of adenomas as well as overt CRC, and presents a strong mouse model of CRC. The overall hypothesis of this application is that disruption of the TGF-? tumor suppressor pathway, and concomitantly raised levels of oncogenic molecules such as CEA, STAT3, disrupt normal colonic mucosa and promote oncogenesis in CRC. Our aims are to: AIM 1a) Expand and validate the significance of loss of the TGF-? pathway associated with high CEA and/or CEACAM6 levels as prognostic factors in advanced adenomas that rapidly progress to CRC through i) First, whole transcriptomic sequence, immunohistochemical and RT-PCR analyses of 40 additional adenomas ii) Secondly, by examining The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan gastrointestinal cancer (GI) datasets to obtain a complete evaluation of our findings. 1b) Determine whether CEA/CEACAM6 and STAT3 with loss of TGF-? signaling are drivers of early CRC in vivo. 2 a) Determine the molecular mechanisms by which CEA inhibits the TGF-? tumor suppressor pathway in early and advanced CRC. We plan to accomplish this through i) Analyzing the role of CEA and CEACAM6 in the disruption of the TGF-? pathway and concomitant IL-6/STAT3 activation in CRC. ii) Determine antitumor activity of CEA inhibition, with and without STAT3 inhibitors and characterize their mechanisms of action. Through translational studies- interrogating human cell lines/genomics, and animal model systems of colon cancer, this application proposes an integrated approach for human CRC, providing novel insights into early and advanced CRC. With vaccines available, as well as new low toxicity therapeutics, identifying specific populations particularly among Veterans with multiple co-morbidities, that could respond to treatment, these goals are centrally important for improving the quality of life under treatment, as well as the mortality from this common cancer."
"9190709","Project Summary:  The immune system responds rapidly to traumatic injuries in multiple ways, as cells and mediators of the innate and adaptive immune systems undergo changes that have been categorized as both pro- inflammatory and counter-inflammatory immune responses. We propose that while this immune response may have evolved to protect the injured host from infections or excessive reactivity to damaged tissues, these contrasting responses ultimately disrupt immune system homeostasis. The loss of homeostasis is central to the immunological complications associated with traumatic injuries. In addition, injuries have been shown to cause a two-hit response phenotype, defined as an amplified secondary inflammatory response in individuals that survive traumatic injuries. This ?second hit? usually is an infection and can lead to septic shock and multiple organ failure (MOF). Thus, the combined risk of developing infections and the two-hit response is a principal complication of traumatic injuries.  Since trauma creates a complex physiological response, specific treatments targeting the immune system to enhance anti-microbial immunity and promote resolution or healing have not yet been developed for clinical use. However, advances have been made in pre-clinical animal studies to suggest that treatment with immune response modulators (IRMs) can redirect the injury response to enhance immune function and protect injured animals from developing post-injury infections.  The goal of the proposed studies will be to use systems biology approaches to phenotype how a specific class A CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), CpG2336, or IL-12p75 treatment changes the immune response to injury. Cellular time of flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) will be used to specifically measure immune cell changes in blood, spleen, and lymph nodes of sham or burn mice treated with these IRMs. Our approach for CyTOF experiments will be to treat sham or burn mice with CpG2336 or IL-12. Fluorescent tagged IRMs will be given to mice that will be harvested at 30, 90, and 120 minutes after administration to identify early cellular targets of IRMs, and these cells will be isolated in subsequent experiments and profiled with CyTOF and Luminex assays to evaluate activation markers and cytokine production. At day 7 after injury, blood, lymph node, and spleen cells will be prepared for CyTOF staining using panels to broadly identify immune cell subsets and cell activation phenotypes. We will then use CyTOF to evaluate IRM treatment effects on cellular responses to S. pneumoniae infection in normal and injured mice. These experiments together will help phenotype the immune response to injury and demonstrate the effects of IRM treatment on survival in a post-trauma infection model."
"9138069","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Diabetes and its complications are a significant burden on the healthcare system in the United States with nearly $250 billion spent on the care of these patients in 2012. This is even more significant in the VA Healthcare System where the incidence of diabetes is three times as high. Diabetic patients are prone to develop foot and leg ulcers resulting from neuropathy, susceptibility to infection, and microvascular disease. Unfortunately, diabetics have a significantly impaired ability to heal these ulcers and often go on to minor or major limb amputations. These events lead to loss of productivity and associated morbidity and mortality. One of the deficits associated with impaired wound healing in diabetic patients is the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and insufficient nitric oxide (NO) production. It has been demonstrated that reduction of ROS or delivery of NO to diabetic wounds can improve healing rates and reduce infection. However, NO delivery is hampered by the short half-life of the molecule and its highly reactive state. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is an enzyme known for its ability to produce ROSs and we identified that it is highly expressed in skin and wounds. XOR has attracted a great deal of attention in the past few years because it can convert the stable compound nitrite back to NO. XOR has been shown to utilize dietary nitrite to mediate the beneficial effects of NO in a variety of disease models. In the wound, preliminary data indicate that XOR plays an essential role in normal wound repair but its role in diabetic wounds remains uncertain. The systemic inhibition of XOR in diabetes appears to improve wound healing while local inhibition further delays healing. In addition, the administration of systemic or topical nitite also improves wound repair. An attractive property of XOR is that it favors the production of NO when nitrite is provided in the setting of hypoxia. When producing NO, XOR mediated ROS production is reduced. These properties are extremely favorable in the setting of chronic wounds where vascularity is diminished with resulting ischemia. In such a setting, administering nitrite may not only induce XOR to generate NO but it may also reduce ROS production. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the precise role of XOR and its products in the diabetic wound repair process. Studies will examine the function of XOR generated NO and ROS in diabetic wounds. The role of XOR in wound neovascularization will be examined to define the importance of the source of the XOR function. These studies will be aided by the use of endothelial cell specific XOR knockout mice. The proposal will culminate in examination of human wounds of different etiologies to quantify XOR activity, the ability to augment local NO production through nitrite supplementation, and the impact of other nitrite reductases in this NO production. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish the foundation for developing topical nitrite as a treatment for impaired diabetic wound healing. The extremely attractive aspect of such a therapy is its simplicity, low cost, and the ability to harness the body's own machinery to produce the therapeutic agent. If effective, topical nitrite therapy may also be applied to wounds of other etiologies such as venous stasis and ischemic wounds."
"9241000","Every day, 22 veterans complete suicide, primarily due to the ramifications of untreated depression. Due to fear and stigma, many do not seek treatment. For those who do, about one third of the time, no drug offers relief and even those antidepressants that do work often require 6-8 weeks before therapeutic onset. Unfortunately, no unifying hypothesis for a molecular/cellular basis of action for antidepressant drugs (or depressive disorders) has emerged. Over the last several years, we have suggested that, in addition to pre- synaptic targets (uptake sites), a number of antidepressant drugs have a post-synaptic mechanism of action. Toward this end, we have observed that chronic treatment (3-5 days) of cultured neural or glial cells with a number of chemically diverse antidepressant compounds translocates the heterotrimeric G protein G?s outof lipid rafts and into a closer association with adenylyl cyclase. Post-mortem tissue from depressed suicides shows just the opposite, with an increased proportion of G?s ensconsed in lipid rafts and preliminary data suggest that this is also observed in blood cells, where the extent of G?s in lipid rafts correlates with both depression and clinical response to antidepressants. Furthermore, several experimental compounds may have antidepressant effects as well as shorter therapeutic onset, and the proposed studies will search for a cellular ?biosignature? for antidepressant action. Proposed studies will also attempt to establish a mechanistic understanding for the translocation of G?s from lipid rafts as a hallmark of depression and as a conduit for antidepressant action. During the period covered by this proposal, we will pay particular attention to short- acting antidepressants like ketamine. One intent of the proposed studies is to develop a platform that can provide a cell- based screen for putative antidepressant compounds as well as a screening tool to indicate personalized antidepressant choice. Another intent of these studies is to provide a peripheral tissue biological marker for depression and an early (< 1 week) indicator of successful antidepressant treatment that can be developed into a clinically useful, inexpensive and simple biomarker for clinical use. The identification of a pathway for antidepressant action might lead to novel antidepressant drugs, while the assignation of a quantitative value for depression may help overcome stigma and encourage thousands of depressed veterans to seek treatment."
"9240851","    Project Summary/Abstract The vascular access is the ?Achilles Heel? of the hemodialysis procedure. Sixty percent of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) that are created fail to mature successfully for dialysis use (AVF non-maturation), resulting in a very significant clinical morbidity and mortality for hemodialysis patients. On a radiologic level, AVF non- maturation is most commonly characterized by a juxta-anastomotic stenosis, and at a histological level it is characterized by a combination of aggressive neointimal hyperplasia at the juxta-anastomosis and an absence of outward vascular remodeling. At present, there remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanisms and pathways that lead to AVF non-maturation. Thus, there are few, if any, effective therapies to improve AVF non-maturation. The poor early outcomes following AVF creation and lack of therapies to treat this clinical problem represent an unmet clinical need. Our long-term goal is to better understand the pathobiology of AVF non-maturation in order to develop novel therapies. Preliminary work from our rodent AVF model has shown impaired endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation (EDR) locally at the AVF early after creation. Impairment in EDR represents reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3)-derived nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. A decrease in NO bioavailability is associated with endothelial dysfunction. NOS3 and cGMP regulation play key roles in regulating nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and vascular endothelial function. We have identified histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1), through its dysregulation of NOS3 function, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as potential mediators of endothelial dysfunction following AVF creation. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to examine two important systems, HDAC1 and cGMP, that may play key roles in influencing endothelial function during AVF development. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that dysregulation of NOS3 and cGMP activity during AVF development (exacerbated in the setting of chronic kidney disease), results in loss of NO bioavailability, which impacts AVF remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia development. We will test our central hypothesis with two specific aims: (1) To evaluate mechanisms by which HDAC1 reduces NOS3 function and alters local endothelial function in the setting of AVF development and (2) To determine the effects of inhibiting cGMP degradation on restoring local endothelial function, and improving AVF remodeling and reducing neointimal hyperplasia development. We believe our proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance the understanding of the pathobiology of AVF non-maturation. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to improve therapies for AVF non-maturation. We expect that novel therapies to treat AVF non-maturation will positively impact Veteran ESRD patients' health by improving morbidity and mortality, through reduction in tunneled hemodialysis catheter use.     "
"9223644","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that often emerges in young adulthood, interfering with normal social development. The diagnosis is present in 1-2% of the population and cuts across socioeconomic, demographic and national lines, affects veterans as well as civilians, shaters families, and costs society billions in lost income due to social disability. The social deficits associated with schizophrenia wreak havoc on the lives of individuals who develop the disorder, and these deficits independently predict worse clinical, functional, and occupational outcomes above and beyond positive symptoms and other cognitive deficits. Despite their clinical importance, social deficits are poorly understood and resistant to available treatment options. Furthermore, abnormal neural and autonomic responses to social stimuli appear to underlie these deficits in schizophrenia. For example, patients demonstrate decreased activity of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), increased activity of the amygdala, and decreased activity of the ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) when performing certain social tasks. The neuropeptide oxytocin plays an important role in social behavior in animals and humans, increasing pro-social behavior and improving social cognition in healthy and autistic individuals. Oxytocin has also been shown to have positive effects on neural and autonomic responses in healthy individuals. Despite its potential as a new treatment for social deficits and for remediation of neurophysiological abnormalities, few studies have examined the effects of oxytocin on social cognition and behavior or on neural and autonomic responses to social stimuli in patients with schizophrenia. We propose a series of experiments aimed at both investigating the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of oxytocin's pro-social effects and quantifying the potentially clinically useful effects of oxytocinin patients with recent-onset schizophrenia. In order to accomplish these important goals, we will first examine the effects of a single dose of exogenous oxytocin on behavioral and psychophysiological responses using validated social cognition measures in 45 patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and 45 matched healthy comparison subjects. We will also assess PNS activity as indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in order to test the hypothesis that oxytocin promotes social behavior by increasing PNS tone. Next, we will examine if oxytocin administration normalizes neural responses to social stimuli by decreasing activity of the amygdala and increasing activity of the vPFC, using a well-studied fMRI social cognition paradigm in 36 of these patients and 36 of these healthy comparison subjects. If successful, these experiments will: 1) Provide novel and important data on the neurobiological factors that underlie social deficits in patients with schizophrenia; 2) Lead to larger clinical trials of oxytoin to improve clinical outcomes in young individuals with recent-onset schizophrenia; and 3) Provide a deeper understanding of the functional and mechanistic relationships linking interrelated neurophysiologic systems that support socially meaningful behavior in healthy and schizophrenic individuals. Studying young adult patients with recent-onset schizophrenia minimizes potential confounds of chronic illness including social isolation, drug abuse and neuroleptic use and maximizes the potential long-term impact of this intervention. Overall, this work has the potential to uncover mechanisms of social dysfunction in schizophrenia, and to identify a novel treatment for the difficult-to-treat social deficits of the illness."
"9033585","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          A decade ago, (pro)renin receptor (PRR) was cloned as a new component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with the capability to bind prorenin and renin to increase their catalytic activity. Soluble PRR (sPRR) is derived from the extracellular domain after cleavage by furin or ADMA19. Within the kidney, PRR is predominantly expressed in the collecting duct (CD) where its expression is elevated by AngII. Preliminary studies employing a novel PRR decoy peptide PRO20 demonstrated that intramedullary antagonism of PRR in rats produced remarkable attenuation of AngII-induced hypertension, renal medullary ?-ENaC expression, and kidney injury, in parallel with suppressed renal medullary renin response and urinary aldosterone excretion. Strikingly, after adrenalectomy, this treatment suppressed urinary aldosterone excretion to undetectable level in AngII-infused rats, indicating a dominant role of PRR in nonadrenal aldosterone synthesis in the kidney. In vitro studies provide strong evidence for a direct action of PRR/sPRR in regulation of ENaC activity and aldosterone release from cultured CD cells. Based on these results, we hypothesize that during AngII infusion, PRR expression is increased in the CD where it triggers the local renin/aldosterone response, leading to ENaC activation and hence hypertension. To define the functional role of PRR in the CD, we propose to produce CD-specific deletion of PRR and study its impact on AngII-induced hypertension, target organ damage, local renin/aldosterone response, and ENaC activation in vivo and in vitro. We employ intramedullary infusion and conditional gene targeting techniques to evaluate the contribution of CD ENaC to AngII-induced hypertension. Lastly, we will evaluate urinary sPRR as a biomarker and further study the functional role and mechanism of sPRR in regulation of CD Na+ transport and blood pressure. The current proposal is expected to offer new insight into the role of CD PRR in the pathogenesis of hypertension and kidney injury."
"9140904","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The overall goal of this MERIT review grant application is to characterize polyphenols as potential prophylactic as well as therapeutic agents in veterans with depression. The proposed studies have important implications for the veteran population since approximately 30% of veterans, in particular those from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom, are affected by mood anxiety disorders, especially depression. We recently identified a safe and well-tolerated bioactive polyphenol preparation effective in delivering multiple (16 that we identified) bioavailable polyphenol metabolites to the brain. Moreover, we found that oral supplementation with this preparation significantly promotes resilience to depression/anxiety phenotypes in the repeated social defeat stress (RSDS) mouse model of depression. Synaptic plasticity abnormalities in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons (MSN) play a key role in the development of stress-related depression/anxiety. Our proposed studies are designed to identify select polyphenol metabolites that can preserve synaptic plasticity in vitro i primary NAc MSN-enriched cultures and in vivo in the RSDS model. Our evidence indicates that down-regulation of Rac1 (a GTPase-related protein that controls actin remodeling) in NAc MSNs is central to aberrant synaptic remodeling in depression/anxiety, and that resilience to depression/anxiety may also be augmented by attenuation of excitatory VGLUT2 and/or promotion of inhibitory VGAT MSN synaptic mechanisms. Based on this evidence, in the proposed studies, we will first screen individual polyphenol metabolites for their in vitro dose-response bioactivities in modulating Rac1, VGLUT2, and VGAT in MSN- enriched cultures. Based on the outcomes of the in vitro screening, we will then prioritize the three most bioactive candidates and conduct dose-finding studies in vivo using polyphenol precursors as potential pro- drugs able to deliver the identified metabolites to the brain. Based on the outcomes of this  set of studies, we will identify the lowest safe and efficacious doses of polyphenol precursors with sufficient concentration to engage the molecular targets (e.g. Rac1) in the NAc. In efficacy studies, we will then test whether these brain bioavailable bioactive metabolites delivered through precursors may promote resilience to stress-induced depression/anxiety phenotypes by normalizing stress-induced pathological neuroplasticity remodeling and functional electrophysiological changes in the NAc. Collectively, the outcomes from our proposed studies will identify novel prophylactic as well as therapeutic agents that can prevent and reverse the maladaptive behavioral responses that result from chronic stress. The proposed studies will also provide novel mechanisms underlying the beneficial role of polyphenols on stress-mediated depression. The proposed studies will provide the impetus for translational application of safe polyphenol pro-drugs to promote psychological resilience to stress-related conditions, including depression and anxiety disorders in veterans."
"9143207","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alcohol abuse exacts a major toll on health and health costs in Veterans. Indeed, even though there is an epidemic of hepatitis C in the U.S., alcohol-related liver injury remains a higher cause of mortality. Studies from the Veterans Administration showed that patients with cirrhosis and superimposed alcoholic hepatitis had > 60% mortality over a four-year period of time, with most of those deaths occurring in the first few months. Thus, the prognosis for this stage of ALD is worse than many common types of cancer, such as breast, prostate and colon. Unfortunately, there is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD, and this makes the need for this proposed research even more compelling. Recent studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that dietary unsaturated fat, specifically rich in linoleic acid (LA), exacerbated alcohol-mediated liver and intestinal injury in an experimental animal model of ALD. Our preliminary data show elevated levels of circulating oxidized LA metabolites, specifically 9- and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (9-and 13-HODEs) in parallel with the up-regulation of hepatic 12/15 lipoxygenase (12/15-LO), a key enzyme involved in the oxidation of LA, in an animal model of ALD. These findings led us to postulate that specific oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs) play a significant role in ALD. OXLAMs are natural ligands to the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), a ligand-gated non-selective cation channel with high permeability for Ca2+. Recent studies demonstrate a critical role for Ca2+ release in inflammasome activation, which are key signaling platforms for stressor-induced pathogenesis, and which, upon activation, trigger the release of highly pro- inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1? (IL-1?)  and interleukin-18 (IL-18). IL-1? release is thought to be a critical mediator of inflammation and  thus, serves as a potential therapeutic target for treating hepatic inflammation in ALD. We propose that OXLAMs contribute to the EtOH-induced hepatic inflammation and injury via two major mechanisms: 1) OXLAMs-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and hepatocyte death; and 2) OXLAM/TRPV1/Ca2+-mediated inflammasome activation and IL-1? release. The proposed studies will help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver injury, including alcohol-diet interactions, which may lead to identification of new therapeutic targets and potential dietary interventions for treating ALD, as well as help to explain why only some heavy drinkers develop clinically important ALD. Our research will be achieved through 3 specific aims: Aim 1. Evaluate whether OXLAMs exacerbate EtOH-mediated liver injury via induction of mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, and hepatocyte cell death in an animal model of ALD; Aim 2. Determine whether OXLAMs contribute to an EtOH-induced hepatic pro-inflammatory response via OXLAM-TRPV1-mediated inflammasome activation and subsequent increase in IL-? release in an animal model of ALD. Aim 3. Explore the role of OXLAMs in monocytes/macrophages inflammasome activation in Alcoholic Hepatitis in Veterans."
"9033185","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Abstract Sustained multi-substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and opioids) is common among veterans and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. According to the Centers for Disease Control, substance use disorders collectively represent the single most preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Numerous genetic variants have been linked specifically to alcohol, tobacco or opioid use but these explain only a small proportion of phenotypic variation. Studies aiming to find shared genetic loci and pathways across substances have yielded inconsistent results. Among the major challenges for gene discovery are phenotypic ambiguity and inadequate statistical power to detect the small genetic effects that are accounted for by individual variants. Phenotypic ambiguity can result from cross-sectional assessment using DSM-criteria or diagnoses, which yield lower sensitivity and specificity than longitudinal, quantity-frequency data. Inadequate statistical power stems from the difficulty in ascertaining large numbers of well-phenotype individuals. To overcome these limitations, we have assembled a consortium of scientists with unparalleled expertise in substance use clinical epidemiology, genetics and computational genomics to harness the unprecedented opportunity that the Million Veteran Program presents to advance this field. To address the specific limitations of prior work noted above, we propose to use validated phenotypes based on quantity-frequency data (AUDIT-C for alcohol, self-reported smoking for tobacco, and prescription refills for opioid use) from a longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) in a large patient population. These phenotypes, previously developed and validated within the Veteran Aging Cohort Study (VACS), will be used to identify genetic variants associated with sustained heavy use of each substance and joint, multi-substance use in the Million Veteran Project (MVP). We will apply a two- stage genome-wide association (GWA) approach for genetic analysis. Prior to GWA analysis, we will define and identify highly valid, longitudinal heavy substance use phenotypes in the MVP sample, employing VACS-validated algorithms in the EHR. Then, we will perform the standard two-stage GWA approach: discovery and replication. Both stages will be stratified by race/ethnicity (European American and African American); will examine the genetic associations with single, dual and multi heavy substance use phenotypes; will use principal component analysis to address population admixture; and will be meta-analyzed across population strata."
"9025127","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common malignancies among our Veterans. The main goal of this project is to investigate the role of miRNAs in targeting c-Myc/HIF pathway and thus suppress kidney cancer progression and metastasis using both in vitro and in vivo models. The major barrier or clinical challenge is that despite the recent advances in the understanding of the biological basis of RCC, the management of the disease, especially in the advanced metastatic phase, remains a significant challenge. Molecular understanding of pathways associated with kidney cancer progression may lead to better diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic strategies against kidney cancer. Based on the preliminary data and published literature, c-Myc/HIF pathway is involved in the progression and metastasis of kidney cancer. We have identified a set of miRNAs that can target c-Myc/HIF pathway and thus may play an important role in inhibition of kidney cancer progression and metastasis through targeting this pathway. The rationale is that the c-Myc/HIF pathway coordinates complex multifunctional events and has a wide range of downstream targets that regulate tumor-associated cell processes such as cell growth, cell cycle, survival, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis in kidney cancer. The role of the miRNA network that regulates the c-Myc/HIF pathway is only beginning to be explored and such studies are lacking in kidney cancer. In this project we will investigate the role of a set of miRNAs in regulation of the c-Myc/HIF pathway that in turn inhibit kidney cancer progression and metastasis. To address this problem, we hypothesize that a set of miRNAs may directly target the c-Myc/HIF pathway and thereby inhibit kidney cancer progression and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we have proposed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments described under specific aims. Specific Aim # 1. To investigate the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated inhibition of c-Myc/HIF pathway in suppression of kidney cancer progression and metastasis using both in vitro and in vivo models. Specific Aim # 2: To investigate the molecular mechanisms of alteration of a set of miRNAs in kidney cancer. Specific Aim # 3. To investigate whether expression profile of a set of miRNAs can predict clinical outcome of kidney cancer patients. Accomplishment of this project will be a significant step forward in understanding miRNA-mediated suppression of c-Myc/HIF pathway and designing novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategies for inhibition of progression and metastasis of kidney cancer among our Veterans."
"9143405","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goals of this Merit project are focused on characterizing the roles and mechanisms of actions of vitamin C in skeletal biology since its deficiency induces skeletal fractures. During the last funding period, we identified novel roles fo prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) in regulating articular cartilage (AC) development besides mediating vitamin C effects on osteoblasts (OBs). By using mice with a conditional knockout (cKO) of the Phd2 gene in OBs and chondrocytes, we determined that loss of Phd2 in OBs resulted in osteopenia while chondrocyte-specific KO of Phd2 lead to a dramatic increase in trabecular bone mass caused by increased endochondral bone formation (EBF), thus suggesting distinct roles and mechanisms for PHD2 in the two cell types. New preliminary data described in this proposal show that Phd2 and Phd3 are differentially expressed in the superficial zone (SZ) and middle zone (MZ) of AC, respectively, and that transition of AC chondrocyte progenitors in the SZ into differentiating chondrocytes in the MZ capable of EBF is tightly regulated by relative levels of Phd2 and Phd3 expression. Furthermore, our data show that PHD2 and PHD3 regulate AC chondrocytes by precise control of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1? and HIF2? levels and by an epigenetic mechanism involving hydroxylation of 5- methyl cytosine (5-mC). Based on these data, our major goal in this competitive renewal application is to elucidate the role of Phd2 and Phd3 in AC development and in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA), since OA is a significant public health problem in the U.S., posing a substantial financial burden with no available therapies for treatment. We will use new genetic mouse models to test the prediction that dysregulation of Phd2/Phd3 expression in AC contributes to the pathogenesis of OA by involving HIF signaling and epigenetic modification of genome activity. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that loss of Phd2 expression in AC progenitors impairs development and maintenance of AC by promoting HIF1? signaling. We will generate mice in which expression of Phd2 is disrupted in Prg4 expressing AC progenitors and examine the AC phenotype as a function of age and in response to a destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM) injury and determine if the AC phenotype in Phd2 cKO mice is abolished by disruption of Hif1? expression in AC progenitors. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the  hypothesis that loss of Phd3 expression in differentiating chondrocytes regulates the AC phenotype by promoting HIF2? signaling. We will generate mice in which expression of Phd3 is disrupted in aggrecan expressing differentiating chondrocytes and determine if the AC phenotype in Phd3 cKO mice is abolished by disruption of HIF2? signaling. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that Phd2 and Phd3 regulate transition of AC progenitors into differentiating chondrocytes in part via epigenetic control of genome activity via regulating hydroxylation of 5-mC. Successful completion of our proposed studies will provide important information on the pathway by which Phd2 and Phd3 regulate AC and could provide novel PHD-based drug targets for treatment of OA prevalent in aging veterans."
"9174067","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This research proposal encompasses four inter-related projects that seek to do the following. Specific Aims I and II: Delineate mechanisms of, and identify effective therapies for, chronic pain resulting from traumatic nerve injury and limb amputation. Neuromas resulting from traumatic nerve injury and traumatic limb amputation can act as sites of abnormal ectopic impulse generation, which are linked to neuropathic pain. In many cases, neuroma-induced pain is not responsive to existing medications. We have shown that sodium channel Nav1.3 accumulates in both painful human neuromas and in experimental neuromas. The biophysical characteristics of Nav1.3 support its contribution to ectopic impulse generation in neuromas. In translational Aim I, we will build upon our viral- mediated shRNA (AAV-shRNA) knockdown of Nav1.3 in rat DRG in vivo and test the hypothesis that AAV- shRNA-Nav1.3 attenuates neuroma-induced pain. Multiple studies have indicated a contribution of channel isoform Nav1.7 to neuropathic pain. Nav1.7 accumulates in injured axon tips within human neuromas and in experimental neuromas, and has been genetically linked to human pain. As an alternative to targeting Nav1.3, Aim II will test AAV-shRNA mediated knockdown of Nav1.7 toward attenuation of neuroma-induced pain. Specific Aim III: Decipher specific sodium channel isoforms responsible for action potential conduction along nociceptive nerve fibers. In this mechanistic aim, we will assess the contribution of Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.3 to electrogenesis in small-diameter axons of DRG neurons. We have recently developed the capability to patch-clamp small diameter (<1mm) DRG neurites in vitro and demonstrated that TTX-S and TTX-R sodium conductances are sequentially activated during action potentials. To advance our understanding of axonal electrogenesis, a logical next step is to identify the underlying channel subtypes and assess their contribution to excitability in nociceptive axons, as we propose in this specific aim. In addition, we will assess the functional effect of gain- of-function variants of Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 that are known to be associated with chronic pain syndromes in humans, on electrogenesis within the axonal compartment, utilizing our DRG culture/patch-clamp system. Specific Aim IV: Determine the contribution of aberrant sodium channel expression in SCI-induced spasticity. Spasticity after SCI has been classically thought to be a result of enhanced synaptic transmission along the spinal reflex pathways as well as loss of inhibition. However, studies at the circuit level, and computer simulation studies, suggest a contribution of increased intrinsic excitability of motor neurons and altered expression of sodium channels within motor neurons to spasticity after SCI. We have demonstrated upregulated expression of Nav1.3 within dorsal horn neurons after SCI and several investigators have reported upregulated expression of sodium channels in spinal and facial motor neurons following peripheral axotomy. Additionally, we have shown that Nav1.8 is mis-expressed in human CNS neurons, cerebellar Purkinje neurons) in patients with multiple sclerosis and in mice with EAE. In this mechanistic/translational aim, we will use molecular, patch-clamp, and knockdown methods to test the hypothesis that dysregulated sodium channel expression in motor neurons contributes to spasticity following SCI, and will determine whether knockdown of such dysregulated channels ameliorates spasticity."
"9240877","Rates of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are high among combat veterans, with reports suggesting 10-20% of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans meet diagnostic criteria for mTBI, the vast majority of which being related to explosive blasts. There is on-going debate as to whether blast-related mTBI may result in long-term neuropsychological impairment, given the paucity of positive findings, despite on-going complaints of cognitive difficulties within this cohort. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that traditional neuropsychological test procedures may lack sensitivity in capturing subtle deficits in everyday functioning in blast-related mTBI. Prospective memory (PM) is the ability to remember to execute an action at a certain point in the future, or is the fulfillment of delayed intentions. PM may be more sensitive to the functional difficulties described by some Veterans with mTBI (e.g., forgetting appointments) than those domains typically assessed (e.g., executive functions, attention and retrospective memory). Results of functional neuroimaging studies suggest that PM is dependent on a frontally-guided cortical network comprised of the anterior prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Neurostructural damage to the white matter pathways that integrate this network presents a possible underlying mechanism for PM disruption in mTBI. To date, few studies have investigated the effect of mTBI on PM, and no published studies have investigated the neurocircuitry of PM in OEF/OIF Veterans with a history of blast-related mTBI. The proposed study aims to utilize neuropsychological assessment and an integrated multi-modal neuroimaging analysis to study prospective memory (PM) functioning in Veterans with histories of blast-related mTBI. Eighty participants will be recruited from within an existing VA-funded TBI research study and will include Veterans with a history of blast-related mTBI (n = 40) or deployed Veterans without a history of mTBI (n = 40). Participants will complete a broad neurocognitive assessment which includes PM questionnaires and objective measures of PM. Veterans will also undergo an MRI scan which includes diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and completion of a PM fMRI task. The study aims are to investigate PM performance in Veterans with histories of blast-related mTBI, investigate the neural network associated with PM functions via integration of fMRI and DTI modalities and determine whether this network is disrupted for Veterans with mTBI. The candidate is a current VA postdoctoral fellow studying mTBI and neuroimaging research, has trained in the neuropsychological assessment of mTBI, has demonstrated a capacity to learn neuroimaging research methods across multiple imaging modalities and has collaborated with the proposed mentorship team on several prior grant applications and manuscripts related to neuroimaging and cognitive functions following TBI. Successful completion of this VA Career Development Award-2 with advance the candidate further toward a long-term research career goal of being an independent clinical researcher in the VA focusing on the integration of neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment in the study of TBI. The CDA-2 will lead to independence not only through the experience of conducting the proposed research and training plan, but also by providing critical pilot data for a VA Merit Award. The specific immediate training objectives of this CDA-2 are to: (1) develop expertise in integrating neuroimaging modalities including fMRI and DTI, (2) develop expertise in the study of prospective memory, (3) achieve proficiency in advanced biostatistics and (4) continue my professional development aimed toward transitioning from a postdoctoral fellow into an independent VA clinical scientist. These goals will be achieved via collaboration with the identified mentorship team that will provide further specialized training in neuropsychological assessment, TBI research and neuroimaging techniques."
"9142566","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world, and it affects more than 285,000 U.S. veterans. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is associated with both development and progression of primary open angle glaucoma, and IOP is the only modifiable risk factor for the disease. However, the mechanisms causing elevated IOP remain poorly understood. Trabecular meshwork cells are critical to maintaining a normal aqueous fluid flow and intraocular pressure. In other tissues such as the kidney, bones and cartilage, the primary cilia play a mechanosensory role in fluid flow. Here, we further explore the potential for cilia of trabecular meshwork cells to serve a mechanosensory role in the eye. Indeed, our previous findings demonstrate that phosphoinositide lipids within primary cilium are an important regulator of eye pressure. In the primary cilium, inositol phosphatase OCRL interacts with TRPV4, a mechanosensory channel that lowers IOP in mice when TRPV4 is stimulated. Previous studies have established that phosphoinositides regulate TRPV4 activity. We hypothesize that phosphoinositide signaling within the cilia of the trabecular meshwork cells regulates aqueous outflow via TRPV4 channels. In this application, we propose to employ novel optogenetic techniques to selectively direct protein translocation and activation of ciliary inositl kinase/phosphatase to modulate TRPV4 activity and IOP. In Aim 1, we will determine whether alterations in PIP2 dephosphorylation via OCRL affect ciliary outflow facility and IOP in mice by optogenetic stimulation of inositol phosphatase OCRL. We will then assess whether optical stimulation of ectopically expressed OCRL can rescue a steroid-induced glaucoma (SIG) mouse model. We expect that the activation of TRPV4 channels via light-responsive OCRL in the anterior chamber of mouse eye will lower IOP. In Aim 2, we will determine whether PIP2 phosphorylation via PI3K activation will affect ciliary outflow facility and IOP in wild-type mice.  We anticipate that optogenetic stimulation of PI3K signaling will increase IOP and reduce outflow facility. We will then determine whether small molecule inhibition of PI3K decreases IOP in the steroid-induced glaucoma mouse model. In Aim 3, we will determine whether steroid-induced glaucoma patients exhibit changes in their trabecular meshwork cell membrane phosphoinositide content. We will also compare phosphoinositide levels in cultured trabecular meshwork cells from patients undergoing trabeculectomy surgery to normal aged- matched cadaveric controls. The proposed research is expected to have a significant impact on the understanding of mechanosensation of eye pressure in mammals, thereby facilitating the discovery of new therapies for open angle glaucoma and other forms of glaucoma. Ultimately, the knowledge obtained from this study may allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies in glaucoma that will benefit our veterans."
"9205554","Summary  A quantum based computational approach identified amongst existing molecules new antimalarial activity separately for both blood and liver-stages. Prominent amongst the liver-stage molecules was a near identical match to cethromycin, comprised of the well known antimalarial quinoline nucleus joined to the erythromycin scaffold. In a limited preclinical mouse liver-stage sporozoite challenge model, cethromycin reduced the malaria parasite load using a single lower than human-equivalent dose. In previous extensive clinical trials cethromycin was shown to be equivalent to existing pneumonia drugs with a good safety profile in more than 2000 persons treated for bacterial pneumonia.  The hypothesis is that human equivalent cethromycin dosing will be curative in the mouse liver-stage models and that cethromycin will demonstrate P. vivax hypnozoite activity in the in vitro primary human hepatocyte assay.  The specific aims are:  1. Synthesize gram quantities of preclinical grade cethromycin  2. Characterize mouse liver-stage cethromycin activity alone or in combination using  azithromycin as macrolide class comparator.  3. Perform in vitro P. vivax hypnozoite activity assays in collaboration with Medicines for Malaria  Venture on human primary hepatocytes  4. Pharmacokinetic measurements on rodent liver, lung and blood levels for pharmacodynamics analysis.  The broad long-term objective is a safe, effective malaria prophylaxis with weekly dosing and/or replacement of primaquine for cure of dormant P. vivax/ovale liver-stage parasites. These preclinical studies will supplement existing cethromycin preclinical pharmacologic data for the goal of a controlled human malaria infection phase 2 clinical trial. This quantifiable preclinical work will validate the quantum based modeling approach to identify repurposing drugs for clinical use."
"9140269","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common liver disease among veterans and is characterized by hepatic steatosis, sterile inflammation and liver damage [1]. NASH is associated with the metabolic syndrome, and can progress to cirrhosis and cancer. The mechanisms governing NASH development are not known, and currently there is no effective therapy. We have shown that the DNA receptor TLR9 (TOLL like receptor 9) is required for acute sterile inflammation in the liver and pancreas [2-4]. Here we propose to examine role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in TLR9 activation and its importance in murine and human NASH. Our hypothesis is that increased levels of mitochondrial DNA from hepatocytes contributes to the development of NASH via TLR9 activation on Kupffer cells, monocytes and hepatocytes.  We will focus on identifying the cellular source and biochemical (oxidation) status of cfDNA, and the functional role of cfDNA in NASH. Our data will support the progression to clinical trials of a TLR9 antagonist that has already been safely used in humans. Preliminary data: i) Plasma levels of cfDNA are higher in mice fed a HFD and in obese patients with NASH, and the cfDNA is of mitochondrial origin. ii) Plasma from NASH subjects has an increase in intact mitochondria (mt), and the majority are in microparticles (MP). iii) Plasma DNA from mice with NASH is a potent ligand for TLR9. iv) Increased ability of plasma from NASH patients to activate a TLR9 reporter cell line is significantly reduced when MP are removed. v) Increase in oxidation state of mtDNA in plasma from patients with NASH. vi) Total body deletion of TLR9 results in less NASH in a HFD model of NASH. vii) Selective deletion of TLR9 on macrophages results in less NASH. viii) Hepatocytes mtDNA from mice fed a HFD has a greater degree of oxidation and a greater ability to stimulate inflammatory, but not anti-inflammatory pathway. ix) The TLR9 antagonist IRS954 protects mice against NASH. Aim 1: Identify the cellular origin and biochemical characteristics of DNA responsible for TLR9 activation in NASH. Aim 2: Identify the cell specific effects of TLR9 activation on a) monocytes and Kupffer cells and b) hepatocytes. Aim 3: Identify the role of mtDNA oxidation on the selective activation of pro-inflammatory pathways, and test a clinically available TLR9 antagonist in a mouse model of NASH. This grant will identify the cellular origins of the elevated the TLR9 ligand plasma cfDNA in NASH, and identify if the development of NASH increases the ability of DNA to function as a ligand for TLR9. It will further establish the role of TLR9 activation on KC, monocytes, and hepatocytes in the development of HFD NASH. Finally demonstration of the efficacy of a clinically available TLR9 antagonist in a mouse model of NASH will allow for the rational progression to clinical trials."
"9174068","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause vasospasm, defects in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cognitive decline. Traumatic SAH is associated with poor outcomes. The underlying causes for these injuries are unknown. Parasympathetic efferents and trigeminal afferents innervating large cerebral vessels as well as intrinsic innervation of cortical vessels may play a role in regulating CBF after injury. The present project focuses on a central neural circuit that has the potential to regulate neurovascular interactions by modulating the perivascular innervation. The objective of the proposed study is to explore a novel hypothesis, namely that the brainstem is an important mediator of cerebral perfusion during SAH. More specifically, an important medullary autonomic and sensorimotor integration center, the rostroventral medial medulla (RVM) modulates cerebral blood flow as part of a coordinated response to SAH aimed at preventing ischemia, and that failure of brainstem compensatory mechanisms contributes to the pathophysiology of subarachnoid hemorrhage. We will test three specific aims. 1. The specific neural pathways through which the RVM modulates CBF (Cetas et al., 2009) are unknown. We will test the role of parasympathetic and sympathetic outflows, interactions with trigeminal sensory pathways, and connections within the central nervous system in the effects of RVM stimulation. 2. The neurons in the RVM are diverse in terms of neurochemistry, physiology, and pharmacology. We will determine which of the physiologically defined RVM cell classes respond to SAH, and test the hypothesis that a class of neurons known to be activated by dural inflammation, ON-cells, are critical for an acute compensatory response that contributes to the restoration of CBF following an experimental SAH. 3. Determine the role of the RVM in delayed cerebral ischemia after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our overarching hypothesis in this Aim is that a failure or reorganization of RVM modulatory mechanisms is important in delayed ischemia following SAH. We will use pharmacological tools to manipulate functionally specific RVM neuronal populations. Effects of RVM manipulation on long-term outcomes will be assessed with quantitative MRI imaging and neurocognitive behavioral studies. This will allow us to test whether distinct neuronal groups in the RVM have an ongoing role in regulation of CBF in the chronic timeframe following experimental SAH. We have adapted a rodent model of SAH in which autologous blood is injected into the prechiasmatic cistern. CBF will be measured using laser Doppler and the powerful optical microangiography (OMAG). MRI will be used to supplement OMAG and correlate changes in CBF with regional isechemia and neuronal injury. We will use pharmacological tools to manipulate functionally specific RVM neuronal populations. Particular classes of RVM neurons will be indentified using standard extracellular neurophysiological recording techniques. Cognitive changes will be tested using standard learning paradigms such as the rotarod test and modified Morris water maze."
"9326534","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) persons across the lifespan are increasingly well- documented, yet gaps remain in our basic understanding of the health status, behaviors, and outcomes within LGB groups. Specifically, bisexual women tend to fare the worst on a majority of health outcomes, with the most consistent and pronounced disparities in mental health. A potentially important area of investigation pertains to the unique identity-based stressors associated with a bisexual identity. Minority stressors at the daily-level, known as microaggressions, may be more common among bisexual women and may explain health disparities among this group. The proposed study will use daily process measures, in the form of electronic diaries (EDs), over a 4-week period, to study the effect of microaggressions on bisexual women's daily mental health. Qualitative interviews will also be conducted. In addition, we will consider lifetime stressors that may potentiate deleterious effects of microaggressions on daily health and lifetime mental health. The main hypothesis of the proposed study is that bisexual women who more frequently report sexual orientation microaggressions will experience poorer mental health than bisexual women who less frequently report such microaggressions. In order to test this, we propose the following aims: 1) determine the frequency and source of sexual orientation microaggressions (SMAs) among racially diverse bisexual women and test their association(s) with mental health, 2) identify the characteristics of bisexual women's microaggressive experiences, e.g., context, content and source, including their responses to such experiences, through both quantitative and qualitative methodologies and 3) identify lifetime stressors that influence associations between SMAs and daily health and lifetime depression. Such stressors will include: childhood sexual or physical abuse, adult sexual or physical abuse, and a history of hazardous drinking. This exploratory project relies on a novel multi-method approach to study daily-level minority stressors, in the form of microaggressions, among a relatively understudied population, bisexual women. This preliminary exploration of within-group differences can significantly advance our knowledge of the risk factors associated with mental health disparities among racially diverse bisexual women. Findings will be critical for informing directions for future research and practice through the identification of relevant research questions and/or foci for preventative interventions."
"9190568","Project Summary/Abstract Vaccination is essential to the global fight against infectious diseases. However, some pathogens are experts at evading the immune response, and therefore present a challenge to current vaccination strategies. Influenza vaccination is currently only 60% effective, and depends on proper predictions of influenza strains that will become seasonal epidemics every year. HIV vaccination has been unsuccessful thus far, with some vaccine trials resulting in adverse outcomes. Traditionally, vaccine design focuses on eliciting memory responses by effector cells of the adaptive immune system. However, it is unknown how cells of the innate immune system respond to vaccination, and whether they play a role in successful vaccine responses. Natural killer (NK) cells are effector cells of the innate immune system that respond rapidly to viral infection. In this proposal, we aim to determine the effect of influenza or HIV vaccination on NK cells. We will deeply interrogate the NK cell response to vaccination by using mass cytometry, an innovative new technology that allows the analysis of 40+ protein expression parameters simultaneously at the single cell level. This method will allow us to analyze clinical samples from influenza and HIV vaccine studies in great depth. Additionally, we will determine the cell biological mechanisms involved in generation of a diverse and functional NK repertoire by analyzing the genome-wide epigenetic profiles of NK cells that respond to vaccination and viral infection. This will allow us to define signatures of NK cell maturation, activation, and diversification. These studies will deepen our understanding of the innate immune response to vaccination, which will lay the foundation for future vaccine designs that incorporate both the innate and the adaptive immune systems."
"9031899","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimation has focused on outpatient data from whites according to age, sex, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), diabetes, smoking, and blood pressure (BP) information. Risk factors (RFs) and overall CVD risk are associated with genetic variations in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and phenotypes have largely been based on single RF measurements using a Framingham approach. Previous research has focused on European Americans (EA), and generally has not included Veterans. There is little information on CVD risk factor genes in African Americans (AA) or Hispanic Americans (HA), two population groups that are extremely important in the VA. With the availability of the Million Veteran Program (MVP) cohort, we have a unique opportunity to study genes and CVD risk among these subgroups. Up to now methods have not been developed to link MVP questionnaire and genetic data to the Veteran's electronic healthcare information. We propose to address scientific gaps by focusing on multiple ethnicities, rare variants, and antecedent risk factor levels using the MVP cohort. In the proposed study, we first create a virtual baseline exam by developing methods to link data from MVP baseline examination to the VA electronic health record using a systematic approach. Results for Veterans are influenced by geographic region in the U.S., race/ethnicity, frequency of outpatient clinic visits, and other variables. Based on our systematic approach of handling MVP questionnaire data and the electronic healthcare data, we assess the genome-wide associations of both common and rare alleles with CVD RFs in causal pathways, with consideration of the environment (diet quality, pharmacological treatment), and assessment of current and antecedent RF levels. Methods include single VA outpatient measurements of quantitative CVD RFs (LDL-C, non- HDL-C, triglycerides, body mass index) with and without diet quality adjustment using the Willett Food Frequency Questionnaire performed at the MVP baseline visit. Other methods include pharmacologic treatment of CVD RFs to derive imputed untreated RF levels, and antecedent quantitative CVD RFs measured at VA outpatient visits 5 and 10 years before the MVP baseline visit when such data are available. We will perform common variant association studies (CVAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) testing the association of genetic variants to quantitative CVD risk for a) prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD) [myocardial infarction, history of coronary bypass grafting (CABG), history of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)] and b) prevalent atherothrombotic stroke, with comparison of effects by race and ethnicity, and c) examine the multigenic association of CHD and stroke using the genetic risk score (GRS) of validated CVD-associated SNPs within and across ethnicity. This project will provide a platform for CVD incidence analyses for MVP participants across the VA in the future. Furthermore, the proposed study findings will allow for the comparison of the impact of genetic variants on cardio metabolic RFs risk factors and atherosclerotic disease prevalence across AA, HA, and EA Veterans. CVD accounts for an extremely large health care burden in veterans. This project will investigate the role of genetic and environmental determinants of CVD risk factors in MVP participants across different ethnic and racial groups."
"9135730","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Here, we will determine if improved small molecules can protect the microtubule associated  protein tau from a pathogenic cascade caused by the molecular chaperone Hsc70. Tau accumulates  in  traumatic  brain  injury  (TBI),  leading  to  neurodegeneration  and  cognitive  deficits.  Active  Hsc70  binds  to  tau  just  after  microtubule  disruption  precipitated  by  bast-­induced  axonal  injury  and  then  directs tau along one of two paths: It either preserves tau, even when it is hyper-­phosphorylated, in  an effort to recycle it to microtubules, or it triages au for a specialized degradation system called  chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA).  While this seems appropriate in principle, tau is actually a problem for CMA.  It  gets  trapped  in  the  channel  called  LAMP2a,  and  then  it  is  cleaved  into  an  aggregation-­prone form that can seed further aggregation. So the mechanisms used by Hsc70 to triage tau are ineffective, and the overall outcome is its abnormal accumulation. We have shown that  just by inhibiting Hsc70 with small molecules, tau is sent for proteasomal clearance, which is more  effective  for  clearing  tau  than  CMA.  Therefore  we  predict  that  subverting  tau  away  from  CMA  processing  with  Hsc70  inhibitors  will  reduce  the  pathogenic  tau  burden,  and  could  possibly  be  a  therapeutic strategy for TBI, especially immediately following blast TBI when tau fate is determined.  We also predict that we will be able to use these small molecules to define the mechanism through  which  Hsc70  makes  decisions  about  tau  fate.  Our  team  has  developed  an  extensive  suite  of  compounds  that  reduce  tau  levels  in  cells  through  this mechanism  and  a  number  of  tools  to  investigate  mechanism  of  action.  Therefore,  we  will  be  able  to  evaluate  both  the  efficacy  of  this  approach for in vivo application whilealso dissecting the mechanisms involved in Hsc70 triage of  tau. We have recently shown that Hsc70 inhibition by rhodacyanines can effectively lower tau in cells  and  in  brain  tissue.  This  scaffold  has  been  modified  to  improve  anti-­tau  potency  and  pharmacokinetics, even permitting BBB permeability. Thus, this compound family could hold promise  as a viable drug candidate for tauopathies. We used this information to create a library of structurally  diverse  derivatives  of  the  rhodacyanine  backbone.  But  we  do  not  know  if  they  have  improved  neuronal anti-­tau potency or pharmacokinetic profiles. We hypothesize that these properties can be  improved. We propose a step-­wise advancement process to test the potency, toxicity, efficacy and  ADME/pharmacokinetic profiles of these derivatives. In addition to their potential therapeutic utility,  the rhodacyanines provide excellent tool molecules to examine mechanisms of Hsc70-­directed tau  trafficking and turnover. We will also employ innovative cell-­based assays, shRNA vector screening,  and our developed compound toolbox to clarify how Hsc70 makes tau triage decisions and how they  relate  to  its  pathobiology.  The  proposed  studies  will  hopefully  form  the  foundation  for  a  viable  treatment approach in TBI."
"9256822","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder in which pathogenic T-cells destroy the insulin producing ?- cells of the pancreas. Despite the NOD mouse contributing to our understanding of T1D pathogenesis, it has not proved ideal for testing potentially clinically applicable disease therapies. This lack of clinical translation argues for the need for new mouse models that will provide better pipelines for therapy development. Since the major histocompatibility complex (MHC in mice, HLA in humans) genes are the most potent contributors to T1D susceptibility, the on going creation of HLA-?humanized? NOD mice represents the next level of models to develop possible disease interventions. The Serreze lab has developed several such mice carrying different human HLA class I genes linked to diabetes susceptibility: NOD.?2m-/-.HHD (HLA-A2.1), NOD.?2m-/-.B39 (HLA-B39) and NOD.?2m-/-.A24 (HLA-A24). In order to prevent expression of murine MHC I molecules, these mice carry the ?2m-/- mutation. However, since ?2m is a critical component of the FcRn complex and IgG salvage pathways, these mice are limited for testing antibody-based therapies. Therefore, we have used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to directly eliminate expression of murine MHC class I molecules in NOD mice (designated NOD.MHCI-/-). The transgenes described above encoding human diabetogenic class I transgenes have been crossed into the NOD.MHCI-/- stock. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that such largely already available HLA-humanized NOD mice can be utilized to develop potentially clinically translatable means to attenuate autoreactive CD8+ T-cell populations of pathogenic significance to a sizeable proportion of T1D patients. Taking advantage of the mouse genetics training I am receiving at The Jackson Laboratory, in Aim 1 I propose utilizing a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated approach to also knock out the sole NOD MHC II (H2-Ag7) variant in the recently developed NOD.MHCI-/- mice. Any combination of HLA-A2.1, B39, A24 class I or DQ8 or DR4 class II transgenes already available on the NOD background can then be crossed into the NOD.MHC-/- stock to generate additional new models for HLA-specific therapy development. Additionally, I propose to test two potential therapies in newly developed NOD.MHCI-/-.A2.1 mice. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that tolerogenic delivery of HLA-A2.1 restricted peptides (INS1B:5-14, INS1/2A:2-10, IGRP228-236, and IGRP265-273) via PLGA- microspheres can attenuate diabetogenic CD8+ T cell responses directed against these epitopes. In Aim 3 I will test the hypothesis that induction through an irradiation free pre-conditioning regimen of mixed chimerism with MHC-mismatched donor cells can eliminate or inactivate diabetogenic CD8+ T-cells with cross-reactivity to the donor-MHC. Together, this proposal aims to improve current NOD mouse models to develop and validate curative therapies for T1D, while providing me with the necessary training in mouse genetic and genomic editing techniques to eventual create humanized mouse models for other autoimmune disorders."
"9174069","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Abstract  Stroke is a major medical concern for United States military veterans. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a catastrophic event in the pathogenesis of ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) brain injury. Our recent studies suggested that structural alterations in brain endothelial cells (EC), including abnormal actin polymerization and the resulting redistribution of junctional proteins, is a novel mechanism responsible for early BBB leakage after I/R (30 min-3h); while matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2/9 activation, a predominant mechanism thought to contribute to post-stroke BBB disruption, contribute to the BBB leakage to larger molecules (>40kDa) in a relatively delayed manner. Therefore, restoring EC structure/function may offer an innovative therapeutic strategy for early BBB protection against I/R, while blocking MMP2/9 may provide a relatively delayed protection to BBB.  Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), a member of the small heat shock protein family, confers neuroprotection in several models of CNS diseases, including I/R brain injury. In addition to its well-known protein chaperone and anti-apoptotic functions, HSP27 may act as a potent actin depolymerization factor in certain cell types such as EC, thus potentially inhibiting actin polymerization-mediated BBB disruption. Further, HSP27 may inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB, a central signaling molecule for the production of MMP2/9 and pro-inflammatory mediators. We recently observed that HSP27 is transiently upregulated in brain EC after I/R. However, the precise role of HSP27 in the functional integrity of EC following I/R and the underlying mechanism remain unknown.  Using transgenic mice overexpressing HSP27 and the lentiviral gene-transfection approach, we have obtained novel pilot data showing that HSP27 overexpression protects the endothelium from I/R-induced hyperpermeability in vitro and in vivo; that HSP27 inhibited oxygen glucose deprivation-induced actin polymerization and redistribution of junctional proteins in EC; and that intravenous administration of HSP27 containing a cell permeable transduction domain (TAT-HSP27) enabled rapid delivery of the protein into brain micro-vasculatures, reduced BBB damage and inhibited MMP2/9 activity after I/R. This proposal will further explore the BBB protective effect of HSP27 on I/R brain injury and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The central hypothesis to be tested is that HSP27 protects BBB against I/R injury by stabilizing EC cytoskeletal organization in microvasculature early after I/R and inhibiting the production of MMP2/9 as well as pro-inflammatory proteins. The following specific aims are proposed:  Aim 1: To determine whether endothelial targeted overexpression of HSP27 is sufficient to provide early protection on BBB integrity and to confer long term protection against cerebral I/R.  Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that HSP27 protects endothelial integrity following I/R by dualistic mechanisms: stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton and inhibiting NFkB-dependent MMP2/9 production and inflammation.  Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that post-stroke delivery of TAT-HSP27 to EC protects against BBB damage and improves outcomes in both young adult and aged mice.  The proposed study attempts to develop HSP27 into a novel, clinically feasible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate post-stroke BBB damage, brake down the progression of brain damage, and improve long-term neurological functions in stroke victims. The successful completion of this proposed study will help improve the quality of life for veterans suffering from stroke."
"9203653","Project Summary  Despite decades of effort to reduce HIV transmission, 35 million individuals are still presently infected globally. While the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has enabled the control and suppression of infection, a large fraction of people worldwide do not currently receive these drugs, resulting in millions of preventable deaths. Those with access to HAART treatment still have persistent infection requiring lifelong adherence to antiviral therapy for viremic suppression and there exists the constant threat of emerging viral resistance. This necessitates continuing investigation into new therapeutics against HIV-1. Isolation of potent broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) that can control infection in humans up to two months after passive transfer has revealed a new potential therapy for HIV-1 infected individuals. In this proposal, I aim to investigate the utilization of `vectored immunoprophylaxis' (VIP), whereby an adeno-associated virus vector is used to deliver systemic monoclonal antibody in vivo, as a novel HIV immunotherapy to effectively control and suppress viral replication. This proposal aims to mimic impending human clinical trials testing vectored bnAbs as immunotherapeutics and will examine the concentration of various AAV-vectored bnAbs required to prevent HIV-1 viral outgrowth in suppressed patient PBMC's in humanized mice. Additionally, BLT humanized mice will be used to examine the ability of combinations of vectored bnAbs to suppress replicating HIV-1, independent of HAART therapy and furthermore, investigate the impact that monoclonal antibody therapy has on the functionality of the immune response in humanized mice. Ultimately, this proposal will predict the success of upcoming clinical trials and efficacy of utilizing a sustained monoclonal antibody expression system as an alternative therapy to HAART.  "
"9134359","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are common neurodegenerative disorders that disproportionately affect aging veterans. These disorders are progressive, fatal, and without effective treatment. Recently, the most common known cause of ALS and FTD was identified as an intronic GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene C9orf72 (C9FTD/ALS). This repeat triggers synthesis of toxic proteins via a process known as Repeat Associated Non-AUG (RAN) Translation. These RAN peptides kill neurons and sufficient to cause neurodegeneration in model systems. We know very little about how RAN translation at C9 repeats (C9 RAN) actually occurs. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms underlying C9 RAN and to identify methods of blocking it as a first step towards novel therapeutic development. Our central hypothesis is that C9 RAN utilizes a non-canonical translational initiation pathway that can be selectively blocked. Moreover, we predict that preventing C9 RAN will stop neurodegeneration elicited by GGGGCC repeats. To test these hypotheses, we developed a robust and quantitative in vitro assay of C9 RAN, as well as a collection of models derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells, rodent neurons, and Drosophila. Using these tools, we will define the mRNA species that undergo C9 RAN, identify the critical RNA and protein based factors that allow for C9 RAN, develop a small molecule screen to identify selective C9 RAN translation inhibitors, and test whether blocking RAN precludes toxicity in model systems. Together, these studies should provide us with a working map of how C9 RAN occurs and what steps can be taken to prevent it. This project has broad reaching implications both for our understanding of how RAN translation contributes to disease as well as providing a logical path towards therapeutic development in C9FTD/ALS and other neurodegenerative nucleotide repeat disorders that affect veterans."
"9191167","PROJECT SUMMARY Ocular surface injury is second only to cataracts as the most common cause of visual impairment worldwide. Chemical exposure is a frequent route of ocular surface injury, and both acid and alkali burns of the cornea are considered ophthalmologic emergencies. However, alkali burns present more frequently and often pose a greater threat to sight due to the rapidity by which damage occurs after exposure. Healing of corneal epithelial injury occurs through cooperation between corneal stem cells, called limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs), and the terminations of trigeminal neurons, called corneal nerves, that densely innervate the cornea. LESCs are responsible for generating new epithelial cells to replace those lost to injury while corneal nerves contribute to maintenance of corneal avascularity, number and function of LESCs, and differentiation of postmitotic corneal epithelial cells. When injury prevents rapid and efficient repair of the cornea, vision can be compromised or permanently lost due to abnormal epithelial growth and scarring. Standard clinical approaches to corneal injury focus on minimizing inflammation or restoring a stable tear film to promote corneal reepithelialization with less attention paid to corneal reinnervation. This project aims to ascertain the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of a pair of novel pharmacologic agents in the cornea following alkali burn with the goal of informing improved strategies for managing corneal injury. Our agent (-)- P7C3-S243 has demonstrated potent neuroprotective effects in both peripheral and central nervous systems following injury, while P18C8 has demonstrated mitogenic efficacy. We hypothesize that (-)-P7C3-S243 and P18C8 will target the corneal nerves and epithelial cells, respectively, to accelerate recovery following alkali corneal injury. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1) Determine whether coadministration of (-)-P7C3-S243 and P18C8 accelerates wound healing in a mouse model of chemical corneal injury. We will model alkali-induced corneal injury in mice through application of sodium hydroxide to the ocular surface, and evaluate both acute and chronic phases of corneal wound healing. 2) Determine the effects of (-)-P7C3-S243 and P18C8 on cultured corneal epithelial and trigeminal neurons. The focus of this aim will be on corneal nerves and corneal epithelial cells, the hypothesized targets of (-)- P7C3-S243 and P18C8, respectively. We will model axonal and epithelial injury in cultured mouse trigeminal neurons and corneal epithelial cells. At the conclusion of this project, we will have characterized the therapeutic efficacy of two novel pharmacologic agents in a model of alkali-induced corneal injury and established a foundation on which to advance mechanistic work for these agents. This research is thus positioned to advance current clinical practice paradigms by laying the groundwork for advancing new approaches to corneal injury, thereby supporting the mission of the National Eye Institute."
"9143284","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Each year in the U.S. 200,000 people are diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and 15,000 will inevitably die from rupture due to unrelenting expansion of the aneurysm sac. Consequently 40,000 elective endovascular or open surgeries are performed annually with morbidity rates as high as 23% and two-year costs up to $116K per patient treated in the Veterans Administration medical system. The risk of rupture accelerates with AAA diameter thus an effective therapy that could suppress AAA expansion would have a significant impact on patient survival, quality of life, and health care costs. Randomized, controlled trials with doxycycline, statins, and beta-blockers have failed to decrease AAA expansion rates and thus pharmacologic inhibition of AAA remains an unmet medical need. There is accumulating evidence that AAA is an autoimmune disease characterized by activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. In patients with AAA we and others have demonstrated that circulating CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells (Treg) are significantly diminished in frequency and immune suppressor function whereas CD4+/CD8+CD28- T-cells and activated monocytes are increased in number and cytoxicity. In mouse models we have demonstrated that human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) increase Treg frequency, promote their immune suppressor function by inducing expression of the transcription factor FoxP3, and inhibit AAA expansion. Our central objective in this Phase I randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial is t determine if the pathogenic immune responses implicated in AAA formation can be favorably modulated by administering MSCs in patients with small AAA (35-45. mm. diameter). The primary endpoint of Aim 1 is to assess the dose effect of allogeneic MSCs (1 or 3 million MSCs/kg) on circulating Treg number and immune suppressor function as compared to a placebo treated control group. The secondary endpoints are changes in frequency of Tr1 regulatory cells, CD4+CD8+/CD28- T-cells, changes in cytotoxic function (perforin and IFN-? activity), and frequency of activated CD45+CD14dim/-CD16++ monocytes. The primary endpoint of Aim 2 is to characterize the MSC secretome produced in response to patient specific signals in vitro and in vivo, specifically focusing on IL-10. Aim 3 will assess the effectof MSC administration on aortic inflammation by measuring 18-flurodeoxyglucose uptake with PET/CT and serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 activity. Completion of this proposal will allow us to develop statistical power to calculate the sample sizes needed to execute a larger clinical study that will test the efficacy of MSCs in suppressing AAA expansion. Equally important, this proposal will be plenary in its definition of the mechanisms by which MSCs modulate immune responses in human disease and facilitate bedside to bench experiments that may yield more effective therapeutic strategies for AAA in the future."
"9141958","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is debilitating and common (up to 30% in Vietnam Veterans and 16% in Afghanistan and Iraq Veterans). A significant number of Veterans do not engage in or drop-out from effective trauma-focused therapies due to avoidance from trauma-related memories. Because of this limitation, and because scientific literature suggested that acupuncture might be effective for PTSD symptoms, we developed an acupuncture intervention for PTSD and conducted a clinical trial that showed positive effects. This remains the only high quality trial of acupuncture for PSTD published, because of which the current VA/DoD guidelines for PTSD state that acupuncture is a B recommendation (fair evidence, provide service) for PTSD treatment. That civilian study compared acupuncture to an effective therapy (CBT) and a wait-list control, but did not have a placebo control. And, research has shown that Veterans may respond differently to therapies than civilians. More definitive data about the efficacy of acupuncture for PTSD is required in order to recommend it as an A evidence-based intervention for PTSD in Veterans. Specifically, it is important to show that acupuncture is better  than a placebo control and that it has effects on biological abnormalities of PTSD. The aim of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of acupuncture for PTSD by showing clinical and biological effects that are statistically larger and clinically more important than effects of sham acupuncture. Given current knowledge and the need for efficient, ethical and best practices within an experimental design, the primary aim is best accomplished by a randomized controlled trial comparing verum acupuncture (ACU) to placebo minimal needling sham acupuncture (MIN). The goal is to evaluate ACU for a significant positive signal, not to compare ACU to other interventions or to evaluate treatment durability. Acupuncture is delivered in 24 sessions over 12 weeks. The primary hypothesis is that efficacy of ACU for PTSD symptom severity will be large (pre- to post- treatment Cohen's d > 0.8), and significantly better than MIN (between group Cohen's d > 0.30, with 80% probability of detecting a true group difference at p<0.05 (2-sided). The secondary hypothesis is that compared to MIN, ACU will be associated with a significantly larger change from pre- to post-treatment in psychophysiological response (decreased startle by EMG eye blink during fear conditioning procedure). The study design is a two-arm, parallel-group, prospective RCT. The sample frame is Veterans with chronic PTSD with a sample of convenience from those seeking care at the Long Beach VA. Exclusion criteria are meant to keep out individuals with characteristics that are known to be PTSD treatment confounds, associated with non- adherence or negative response to treatment, that may significantly affect biological assessment, or who may be put at risk of harm. The sample size (90) provides adequate power to test hypotheses. Subjects will be allocated to intervention group by computer-generated adaptive randomization. General linear mixed models will be used to evaluate hypothesized effects over time (mid treatment, end of treatment, 1-month follow-up), controlling for baseline severity of symptoms and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender) using intent-to-treat modeling. Outcome effect size (Cohen's d) within and between subjects will be calculated. Interaction terms will be included in the models to evaluate treatment  fidelity and treatment expectancy as potential moderators. Study results will provide clinicians and policy makers with more information to make decisions about the rational use of acupuncture for PTSD. This is important because acupuncture is being touted for PTSD by many advocates. It has the potential to reach PTSD sufferers who are not willing to engage in trauma-focused psychotherapy, or for whom current therapies are ineffective. The objective of this project is consistent with priority research areas of specific interest to CSR&D including PTSD and complementary medicine, and all participants are Veterans at a VA Hospital."
"9258085","PROJECT SUMMARY: BET proteins (Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4) are chromatin-binding cofactors that have emerged as potent epigenetic drug targets in various cancers and inflammatory diseases. By modulating the chromatin environment, therapeutic BET protein inhibitors can succeed in what was largely considered impossible ? impacting the function of disease-associated transcription factors. However, unsurprisingly, BET inhibition is not completely benign, with early clinical studies reporting hematopoietic toxicities. Indeed, BET proteins are important in regulating housekeeping genes as well as in mediating inducible gene programs associated with cell fate decisions during embryological development and hematopoiesis. Their critical role in biology is highlighted by their conservation across species and their lethality in nullizygous mice. However, a clear mechanistic understanding of how BET proteins function similarly or distinctly is lacking. A major challenge has been a lack of models systems. Furthermore, though BET inhibitors are useful reagents, they lack specificity for individual BET proteins. The aim of this proposal is to gain deeper mechanistic insights into the roles of individual BET family proteins in regulating gene expression during Gata1-induced erythroid differentiation. Based on prior studies in which we observed that BET proteins Brd2 and Brd3 play a shared role in mediating erythroid differentiation that is distinct from that of Brd4, we hypothesize that BET proteins have both unique and overlapping roles in gene regulation that are conveyed by their modular functional domains. To test this, we will capitalize on a novel, gain-of-function cellular system that models erythropoiesis and for which rich genomic data sets already exist. Our studies aim to identify structural and mechanistic determinants of individual BET protein functions and elucidate any interdependencies that may exist. Our preliminary data indicate substantial genome-wide co-localization of Brd2 and the architectural protein CTCF. We will test the intriguing hypothesis that Brd2 in cooperation with CTCF plays an unforeseen role in three-dimensional genomic organization. We propose to explore the mechanistic underpinnings of this interaction and examine the functional consequences of Brd2-CTCF cooperativity with regard to genome folding at specific genes. In concert, the proposed studies aim to define the functions of individual BET proteins as guide for the design of selective BET inhibitors. Based on the novel discovery of a Brd2-CTCF interaction, existing pharmacologic BET inhibitors are expected to cause global perturbations in genome architecture. Dissecting the mechanism of Brd2 function in the context of CTCF might instruct the development of inhibitory compounds that avoid or selectively exploit perturbations in genome folding in therapeutic settings."
"9240533","Both vitamin D deficiency and skin cancers arising from epidermal keratinocytes are highly prevalent in Veterans. Although exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths normally found in sunlight initiates vitamin D biosynthesis, the practice is not currently recommended since UV is also the principal cause of skin cancers. However, there remains uncertainty as to whether the relatively low doses sufficient for vitamin D production in the skin are associated with a meaningful risk of skin cancer in healthy individuals, and the Institute of Medicine's report on this topic identified resolving this issue as a major research need. Based on work in both our laboratory and those of others, there is evidence that UV-inducible mechanisms such as DNA repair might be directly coupled to vitamin D signaling. For example, we have observed that mice lacking the vitamin D receptor are prone to develop UV-induced epidermal tumors, and vitamin D and some of its metabolites induce DNA repair proteins. On the other hand, mice unable to synthesize the most biologically active form of vitamin D are not tumor-prone. However, it remains possible that one or more of the multiple other vitamin D metabolites does have anti-photocarcinogenic effects, including induction of nucleotide excision repair activity, the principal mechanism for removing UV-induced DNA lesions. The overall hypothesis of this research proposal is that vitamin D or its derivatives stimulate compensatory mechanisms to repair the collateral DNA damage associated with its own UV-mediated photosynthesis and thus minimizes photocarcinogenic effects. In Aim I, cultured keratinocytes and epidermal explants derived from CYP27B1-null mice will be used to compare the activities of major vitamin D3 metabolites for their effects on nucleotide excision repair. Both exogenous supplementation and chemical inhibition to modulate endogenous vitamin D metabolite levels will be employed, and expression of repair genes as well as repair activity and UV resistance will be assayed. In Aim II, both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms for vitamin D's effects on DNA repair will be investigated. Cultured keratinocytes and mouse epidermal explants will be used to assess the relevance of the vitamin D receptor in DNA repair, and the assembly and stability of nucleotide excision repair factors at lesions. Aim III will use mice treated with the most active vitamin D derivative and the broad cytochrome P450 inhibitor, ketoconazole, to assess whether supplementation or depletion of the major vitamin D3 metabolites protects animals from photocarcinogenesis, or predisposes them to it. Mutational spectra of tumors in the TP53 and XPC genes will also be analyzed to understand the pathways involved. These studies should make an important contribution to understanding the physiological and cellular mechanistic role of vitamin D in regulating DNA repair in skin and in suppressing UV photocarcinogenesis. The resulting fundamental biological insights may allow a rational basis to help guide health policy decisions regarding vitamin D in nutrition and skin cancer prevention for Veterans as well as the general population."
"9316758","The overall mission of this CHAVI-ID application is to define immunogens and immunization regimens that induce sustained HIV cross-protective B cell and CD4+ T cell responses in preclinical models and, thereby, guide product development strategies for a preventive human AIDS vaccine. Focus #1 will concentrate on B cell and antibody research to facilitate the development of immunogens and immunization protocols that elicit protective broadly neutralizing antibody responses.    Our overall strategy in this focus can be briefly summarized in the following goals: 1) To fully define a comprehensive map of the broadly neutralizing (bn) epitopes of the HIV Env spike. Breakthroughs in generating broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) in the last two years are bringing this goal within reach; 2) To determine which of the HIV bnMAbs provide the most effective protection against viral challenge in the non-human primate (NHP) model. At the same time, we shall closely monitor developments in the field, including suggestions that some non-neutralizing antibodies may have protective qualifies that might be exploited in vaccine discovery; 3) To determine which HIV broadly neutralizing Abs (bnAbs) are most readily elicited through natural infection and how and when they are elicited using several large cohorts to which we have unique access; 4) To determine which immunogens and immunization strategies best stimulate HIV bnAb generation in the knock-in mouse and NHP models, drawing upon data collected on bnAbs in goals 1-3 and emerging from Focus #2. As we gather together information on optimal immunogens and immunization strategies, we will move forward with small-scale human trials with the advice and close involvement of our Vaccine Discovery Scientific Research Support Component."
"9223630","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in neurogenic muscle wasting, paralysis, and death. Nearly 95% of ALS cases have pathology featuring ubiquitinated and hyperphosphorylated inclusions of the TDP-43 protein in neurons and glial cells. Similar inclusions of TDP-43 are hallmarks of another neurodegenerative disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP), which is a major cause of mid- to late-life dementia. An understanding of the mechanisms controlling TDP-43 pathology in ALS and FTLD-TDP is critical to the design of neuroprotective strategies. TDP-43 is directly phosphorylated by the kinase CDC7, and this phosphorylation drives TDP-43 neurotoxicity and resultant neurodegeneration. This proposal describes experiments exploring the cellular and molecular changes that promote TDP-43 targeted CDC7 kinase activity, with a focus on the development of therapeutic interventions for the treatment of TDP-43 proteinopathies such as ALS and FTLD-TDP.  Disease specific changes in CDC7 may promote TDP-43 phosphorylation. In fact, increased CDC7 protein levels and post-translational modifications of CDC7 are observed in parallel with pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation in a mammalian cell model of TDP-43 phosphorylation. CDC7 protein levels, localization, post-translational modifications, and gene expression will be evaluated in mouse primary neuron culture, mammalian cell culture, and transgenic C. elegans models exhibiting TDP-43 phosphorylation using molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics techniques. Characterizing disease-relevant changes in CDC7 will further our understanding of the causes of TDP-43 pathology in ALS and FTLD-TDP.  To identify pathway(s) controlling CDC7 kinase activation in neurons, CDC7 kinase regulators, pathway genes, and co-factors have been surveyed for effects on TDP-43 phosphorylation. The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway was identified by this screen as a key regulator of TDP-43 phosphorylation. Components of the DDR pathway will be evaluated in detail using mouse primary neurons, C. elegans and mammalian cell models of TDP-43 proteinopathy. The determination of the genes and gene pathways regulating TDP-43 targeted CDC7 kinase activity will provide insight into disease pathobiology, and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets for intervention.  CDC7 is a promising therapeutic target for th inhibition of pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation that is observed in ALS and FTLD-TDP. However, small molecule inhibitors specific for CDC7 with appropriate pharmacokinetics in vivo are not commercially available. Therefore, a targeted library of small molecules structurally similar to CDC7 inhibitors will be assembled. These small molecules will be surveyed for specific inhibition of CDC7 kinase activity, and tested in vivo in C. elegans and in mammalian cell culture models for protection against TDP-43 driven neurodegeneration. This is a critical step towards developing viable treatments for ALS and FTLD-TDP."
"9191235","The human gastrointestinal tract is home to trillions of microbial organisms, collectively known as the gut microbiota, that play a critical function in maintaining human health by providing the host with nutrients, promoting maturation of the immune system and preventing colonization by pathogenic organisms. However, more recently it has been appreciated that certain members of the microbiota can actually exacerbate disease associated with enteric pathogens. Therefore, there is a critical need to investigate the effect of commensal species on the virulence of intestinal pathogens. Enterohemmorhagic E. coli (EHEC) is an important human food borne pathogen that causes 265,000 cases of bloody diarrhea year in the United States, which in severe cases can progress to hemolytic uremic syndrome or even death. EHEC encodes two principal virulence factors that contribute to disease: a type three secretion system (T3SS) encoded on a pathogenicity island known as the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), and Shiga Toxin. Previous studies have demonstrated that microbiota-derived products can modulate expression of these important virulence factors and affect the severity of disease. The objective of this proposal is to determine the effect of human gut commensals on EHEC associated disease. Our hypothesis is that members of the microbiota affect EHEC disease by modulating expression and activity of, and directly processing virulence factors. We have previously demonstrated that Bacteroides- produced succinate enhances LEE expression, leading to more severe EHEC disease. We will investigate the effect of other common gut commensals on EHEC disease and use metabolomics to identify the metabolites that may be eliciting these effects. We have also previously demonstrated that the presence of a common gut commensal, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) leads to enhanced destruction of the host mucus layer during a mouse model of EHEC infection. We will investigate the mechanism of this enhanced mucus degradation and define the role of commensal mucosal glycan degradation in this process. Finally, we have demonstrated that B. theta-produced proteases are capable of cleaving EspB, a critical component of the EHEC T3SS, into two smaller products. We will identify the B. theta proteases responsible for this cleavage and functionally characterize the resulting cleavage products. Successful completion of the proposed work will reveal novel mechanisms of EHEC virulence modulation by the human gut microbiota. Understanding more about the factors that affect disease progression will allow us to design more effective therapies for this important human pathogen."
"9139032","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      ABSTRACT Osteoporosis is a common skeletal degenerative disorder that is characterized by decrease of bone-mass and micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue. It results from increased osteoclast (OC)-mediated bone resorption and/or reduced osteoblast (OB)-mediated bone formation. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive dementia. Intriguingly, AD patients frequently have lower bone mineral density and higher rate of hip fracture, compared with the same age normal population. Several newly identified AD risk genes/loci encode proteins critical for osteoclastic activation and/or bone-mass homeostasis. Increasing evidence from clinical and genetic studies thus supports a degree of association of both disorders. However, very few studies are available to address the underlying mechanisms.  The goal of this proposal is to determine if and how the Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) acts as a risk factor for osteoporosis. APP is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein. Its cleavage product, A?, is believed to be a major culprit for both early- and late-onset AD. We thus explored the possible contribution of APPswe to AD- associated skeletal deficits in mice. Tg2576 mice express APPswe under the control of prion promoter, and develop AD-relevant neuro-pathologic deficits at older age (>10 months old). Remarkably, our preliminary studies revealed age-dependent osteoporotic deficits in this AD animal model, including reduced trabecular bone-mass in young adult age and deteriorated bone tissue at older age. The reduced bone-mass was associated with a decrease in osteoblastic bone formation and an increase in osteoclastic bone resorption. The deteriorated bone structure was preceded by an impaired osteoclastic bone resorption. To investigate underlying mechanisms, we generated a transgenic mouse that enables cell-type specific expression of APPswe in OBs and OCs. Our results suggest that APPswe plays a cell autonomous role in suppressing OB-mediated bone formation and in regulating OC activation. These results uncovered potentially novel cellular mechanisms by which APPswe disrupts bone homeostasis. However, underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this proposal, we will address this issue.  This research will not only provide a potential link between AD and skeletal deficits, but also identify unrecognized functions of APP and APPswe, and reveal new pathophysiological mechanisms underlying osteoporosis and AD, both chronic degenerative disorders affecting many veteran's quality of life and highly relevant to Strategic Objectives of VA."
"9138218","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Allergic rhinitis is a common illness suffered among US Veterans. Despite the availability of medications, many patients fail to get adequate control of symptoms especially in high pollutant areas. Southern California air pollutants, like diesel exhaust particles may act as adjuvants to allergens leading to an exaggerated allergic response in certain individuals. These individuals may lack adequate Glutathione transferase activity; necessary to protect cells against pollutant induced oxidative stress. Sulforaphane has been shown to protect against oxidative stress. We hypothesize consumption of foods containing high levels of sulforaphane are beneficial to US Veterans with GST deficiencies suffering from allergic rhinitis. In our preliminary data, we discovered administration of broccoli sprout extract rich in sulforaphane leads to diminished nasal inflammatory reaction brought on by diesel exhaust particles though did not have sufficient patient numbers to prove an association with GST deficiency. We propose a 3 week randomized clinical trial comparing broccoli sprout extract consumption with nasal corticosteroid administration after subjects with allergic rhinitis undergo a Timothy, Bermuda or Johnson grass nasal challenge. In Aims 1 and 2, we will compare clinical (nasal symptom scores and peak nasal inspiratory flows) and laboratory (inflammatory cytokines, eosinophil cationic protein, tryptase) measurements between four groups: nasal corticosteroid, broccoli sprout extract, nasal corticosteroid plus broccoli sprout extract, and placebo. Aim 3 focuses on exploratory genetic analysis of the 3 glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes to determine if correlations exist between the inability to produce GST enzyme and the response to broccoli sprout extract. At the conclusion of this study, we will gain further knowledge of which patients benefit from anti-oxidant nutritional supplementation in treating allergic rhinitis."
"9139574","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Treatments for virus-induced diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are sub-optimal or non- existent. Virus infection of the CNS results in a robust host neuroinflammatory response, defined by the activation of resident CNS immune cells (microglia and astrocytes) and the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory genes. The role of these responses in virus-induced CNS disease remains unclear. Neuroinflammatory responses likely play a protective role in facilitating the removal of infected cells and the recovery of damaged neurons. However, many of the factors released by immune cells may contribute to injury within the CNS. Indeed, neuroinflammation is a key pathogenic component following neurologic injury and during non- infectious forms of neurologic and neurodegenerative disease. West Nile virus (WNV) is the most common cause of epidemic encephalitis within the US. This proposal will investigate neuroinflammatory responses induced by WNV-infection and will evaluate neuroinflammatory processes as potential therapeutic targets for WNV-induced CNS disease. Since neuroinflammatory responses are central to a variety of CNS injury and disease pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, the proposed experiments will likely have wide reaching clinical implications.  Microglia and astrocytes are the first cells to respond to disturbances within the CNS and likely play a key role in neuroinflammation both as effector immune cells and by influencing subsequent responses generated by immune cells that infiltrate the CNS from the periphery. Activation of microglia and astrocytes can also lead to specific mechanisms of neuronal death by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as nitric oxide (NO), and glutamate excitotoxicity. The role of resident CNS cells in virus-induced neuroinflammatory responses is unclear since infiltrating immune cells produce many of the same pro-inflammatory molecules. The proposed studies will use ex vivo slice cultures, sub-regions of these cultures, and isolated CNS cell populations, to determine the contribution of CNS resident cells (microglia and astrocytes) to neuroinflammatory responses, and cell death pathways associated with these responses, that are generated in the CNS following virus infection. In these studies the expression of pro-inflammatory and cell death associated genes following virus infection will be determined at the mRNA and protein level by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting and/or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The proposed studies will also evaluate microglia and astrocytes as therapeutic targets for virus-induced CNS disease. Microglial and astrocyte activation/activity will be inhibited in ex vivo and in vivo models of viral pathogenesis using a combination of genetically modified animals and pharmaceutical treatments. The effect of microglia and astrocyte activation on viral-pathogenesis will then be evaluated using well established markers of virus-induced CNS disease, including viral titer, virus-induced injury and apoptosis and survival studies."
"9233632","Dr. Shetty's current research primarily comprises three themes:  (1) Mechanisms by which neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) grafts ease seizures and memory and mood dysfunction in prototypes of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE): Previous work from Dr. Shetty's lab has shown that grafting of NSCs into the hippocampus of animals displaying spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) for an extended period of time (a model of drug-resistant epilepsy) has promise for reducing the frequency and intensity of SRS. Additional studies have shown that early intervention with grafting of GABA-ergic cells or NSCs restrains epileptogenic changes and the development of chronic epilepsy after status epilepticus. His current research is focused on further refining the neural cell grafting therapy for TLE. A project funded by the VA (Combined NSC Grafting and Neurogenic Drug Therapy for Temporal Lobe Epilepsy) investigates the long-term survival and functional effects of NSC grafts (derived from the embryonic rat medial ganglionic eminence) in a rat model of TLE, when grafted into the hippocampus along with two weeks peripheral administration of therapeutic compounds such as fibroblast growth factor-2 or neurosteroid ganaxolone. Another project funded by the DOD (Human iPSC-derived GABA-ergic Precursor Cell Therapy for Chronic Epilepsy) examines the efficacy of human GABA-ergic progenitors (derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells) for easing seizures and improving cognitive and mood function in a rat model of chronic TLE.  (2) Elucidating pathophysiological changes and examining the efficacy of promising compounds/drugs for easing cognitive and mood dysfunction in Gulf War Illness (GWI): A project funded by the VA (Memory and Mood Enhancing Strategies for GWI) examines mechanisms of brain dysfunction in a rat model of GWI. The results have shown that combined exposures to moderate doses of the anti nerve gas drug pyridostigmine bromide and pesticides (DEET and permethrin) with or without mild stress cause memory and mood dysfunction. Importantly, these changes are linked with declined neurogenesis (a substrate for maintaining normal memory and mood function), NSC dysfunction, chronic low-grade inflammation, increased oxidative stress and loss of GABA-ergic interneurons in the hippocampus. Recent studies have evaluated the efficacy of natural anti- inflammatory compounds (Resveratrol and Curcumin) and antidepressant therapy (voluntary physical exercise) for reversing memory and mood impairments through enhancement of neurogenesis and suppression of inflammation and oxidative stress. These studies have provided interesting positive results, which are currently in preparation for publications. Another recent project funded by the DOD (Monosodium Luminol for Improving Brain function in GWI) examines the efficacy of monosodium luminol (a drug that maintains redox homeostasis) in an animal model of GWI.  (3) Examining novel neuroprotective approaches that prevent the evolution of an initial injury into cognitive and mood dysfunction, using models of traumatic brain injury (TBI): The current studies (supported by Emerging Technology Funds from the State of Texas) are focused on two mouse models of TBI, which include a moderate TBI induced by controlled cortical Impact injury, and a mild TBI induced by exposure to blast shock waves (BSWs). Recent studies have suggested that single exposure to BSWs causes long-term cognitive and mood dysfunction associated with decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Additional studies examine the efficacy of several approaches for preventing functional deficits in TBI prototypes. These include administration of anti-inflammatory compounds and exosomes derived from human mesenchymal stem cells."
"9192990","Project Summary/Abstract Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is an invasive procedure evaluating the functional significance of an intermediate stenosis by measurement of pressure differences across that particular stenosis. Noninvasive techniques such as CT-FFR, using computational fluid dynamic methods with computed tomography (CT) images to calculate the FFR index, have shown to reduce the number of patients requiring invasive procedures. However, the use of ionizing radiation in CT prevents longitudinal monitoring of patients who were deferred from invasive tests and treatment. To address the problem, we propose a noninvasive pressure measurement technique in the coronary arteries using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has no ionizing radiation. The method is based on velocity measured from phase-contrast MRI (PC-MRI) in conjunction with navier-stokes equations to derive pressure differences, which has been studied in various vessels such as the aorta, carotid, renal and intracranial arteries. To apply the technique in the coronary arteries, challenges such as cardiac and respiratory motion and high spatial and temporal resolution for PC-MRI acquisitions need to be addressed. In this study, we aim to address the challenges by using 1) ECG and Navigator-gating to minimize motion errors and 2) 2D interleaved multi-slice radial acquisition using a golden-angle sampling scheme to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. The hypothesis is that the proposed PC-MRI technique could further improve the navier- stokes analysis and thus, the derived pressure difference index. The measured velocity values from proposed PC-MRI and derived pressure difference index will be compared to invasive flow and pressure to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method and its correlation to clinical gold standard. This noninvasive technique could potentially obtain both the anatomical and functional information in one imaging session without added risks, patient discomfort and high surgical costs from invasive procedures or ionizing radiation from CT-FFR."
"9138080","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Mortality from chronic infectious diseases, including Hepatitis C, HIV, and tuberculosis, remains a major problem among Veterans, making the development of new vaccines an important priority of biomedical research. Immunologic memory is a cardinal feature of adaptive immunity and an important goal of vaccination strategies. Traditional vaccination strategies are very effective at generating neutralizing antibodies against bacteria and viruses. However, a vaccine capable of generating robust T cell memory is still beyond our research, due, in part, to an incomplete understanding of the molecular basis for memory lymphocyte fate specification. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying immune `exhaustion,' a state in which T cells are rendered ineffective during many chronic viral infections, remain incompletely understood. Thus, a fundamental understanding of how memory lymphocyte fate is specified, as well as what goes awry in the exhausted state, is a crucial first step in rational vaccine design for infectious diseases such as HIV, HCV, malaria, and tuberculosis. Our underlying hypothesis is that previously unappreciated molecular determinants control the specification of terminal effector and memory (TCM, TEM, and TRM) cell fates as well as the exhausted CD8+ T cell state. Our goal is to identify and validate these determinants using innovative multi-disciplinary approaches that include single-cell RNA sequencing, computational analyses, and immunological techniques."
"9122604","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major complications of diabetes, and the leading cause of end stage renal disease in the United States. Histologically diabetic nephropathy is characterized by fibrosis of the glomeruli due to an expansion of the mesangial extracellular matrix (ECM). This excess ECM disrupts the glomerular filtration apparatus leading to a decline in renal function. Mesangial cells produce the ECM that surrounds glomerular capillaries. They express fibronectin (FN) and collagen, and both of these ECM components are up- regulated in diabetic nephropathy. FN matrix also provides a framework for the deposition of other ECM components including collagens. Therefore, deregulation of normal FN matrix assembly can have adverse effects on the overall structure of the ECM, as occurs in glomerulosclerosis. Elevated glucose is a known risk factor for diabetic nephropathy. We have shown that high glucose conditions increase FN matrix assembly by mesangial cells through activation of integrin receptors by a protein kinase C pathway. Integrin binding to FN initiates FN assembly into fibrils by promoting FN-FN interactions. As more FN dimers are incorporated, the nascent fibrils mature into a stable, insoluble FN matrix. This assembly process can be followed by measuring FN in the detergent-insoluble fraction and by analyzing fibril formation using immunofluorescence. In addition to cell signaling, other mechanisms are activated by increases in glucose such as non-enzymatic glycation and lysine acetylation and these might also contribute to excess ECM production. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) accumulate on ECM proteins exposed to high glucose conditions. AGEs induce a range of cellular responses usually through the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). Both AGEs and RAGE have been implicated in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy and our preliminary results show a role for AGEs in stimulating mesangial cell matrix assembly. We will determine the effect of AGEs on FN matrix assembly by treatment of mesangial cells with AGE-modified proteins, and whether the effects result from binding to RAGE by using blocking agents and siRNA knockdown of RAGE. Another protein modification that is affected by hyperglycemic conditions is lysine acetylation, which is increased in animal models of diabetic nephropathy and has been shown to occur on the cytoplasmic tail of ?1 integrins. We will determine whether high glucose induces increased lysine acetylation using anti-acetyl lysine antibodies and whether this alters the level of FN matrix assembly by mesangial cells using deacetylase inhibitors combined with our standard matrix assembly assays. In addition, the effects of acetylation on ?1 integrin activity will be tested by point-mutation studies with established integrin activity assays. There are currently no therapies to reverse the effects of fibrosis. Understanding the mechanisms for increased FN matrix assembly in response to hyperglycemic conditions may provide novel therapeutic targets to stop or slow the accumulation of ECM."
"9192183","PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Adolescent girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 24 bear a disproportionate burden of negative sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes worldwide. This is particularly so in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where the leading causes of death among girls aged 15-19 are complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. About a third of all new HIV infections in SSA also occur in young women aged 15-24 annually. Research from various high-income countries (HICs) suggests that vulnerability to negative SRH outcomes, including early pregnancy and childbirth and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), may be elevated in girls and young women who reach menarche at an early age (an indication of early sexual maturation). There are indications that this also applies to girls in SSA, but the little available evidence is inconclusive. The few menarcheal data from SSA also suggest secular trends of declining age of menarche across SSA. There is an urgent need to better understand the effect of early menarche on SRH in SSA, and the underlying process by which early menarche affects SRH given the high burden of negative SRH outcomes experienced by SSA girls and young women. Using data from ?Gendered Social Context of Adolescent HIV Risk Behavior in Ghana? (R01HD06101; PI: Bingenheimer, PhD), a three-year longitudinal study of adolescents from two peri-urban communities in Ghana, the current proposal aims to begin to address this gap in knowledge. The longitudinal nature of the data being used in the proposed study will allow me to examine girls? transitions to various outcomes over time relative to their age at menarche thus facilitating causal inferences ? an advantage over the few other available studies from SSA that have all used cross-sectional data. The current proposal will examine how early menarche affects various SRH outcomes in adolescent girls and young women in SSA to determine whether patterns seen in HICs also apply to SSA or whether unique patterns are found in SSA. Building on the methodological skills and substantive knowledge I gain through my training activities, I will explore the process by which early menarche contributes to negative SRH outcomes in SSA with the following specific aims: 1) to test whether early menarche is associated with sexual violence, risky sexual behavior and early pregnancy in Ghanaian adolescent girls and young women; 2) to explore the process through which early menarche leads to negative SRH outcomes among girls in SSA by assessing the meditational role of forced first sex, early sexual initiation and early marriage; and 3) to identify which factors that are known to protect against or increase vulnerability to negative SRH outcomes, including education and alcohol use, interact with early age at menarche to affect SRH outcomes in SSA. The research project will contribute to a greater understanding of the SRH consequences of early menarche in SSA youth and help identify factors to intervene on to mitigate negative SRH outcomes resulting from early menarche. The project will provide training and research experiences necessary for my development as an independent researcher."
"9143185","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alcohol-related health problems are the worldwide health concern. More than 50% of Veterans use alcohol and nearly 23% are binge or heavy drinkers. Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) involves endotoxemia caused by gut barrier dysfunction. About 25% of alcoholics develop ALD, but the factors that make them susceptible to ALD remain to be determined. The relationship between stress and alcoholism is well known, so this project focuses on the effects of stress on alcoholic tissue injury. Our preliminary studies showed that different types of stress  disrupt tight junctions (TJs) and increase permeability in the intestinal epithelium by a mechanism that involves intracellular signaling elements. Preliminary data also indicated that chronic restraint stress exacerbates alcohol-induced gut permeability and associated liver injury. Probiotics are well known to promote gastrointestinal cell survival and barrier function. Our preliminary data indicated that Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) ameliorates stress and ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction. On the basis of these results it is hypothesized that: a) stress-induced cell signaling promotes alcohol-induced TJ disruption and barrier dysfunction in the intestinal epithelium, b) chronic stress exacerbates ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia and liver injury by a CaV1.3 channel and JNK2-dependent mechanism, and c) L. casei ameliorates stress and ethanol-induced gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia and liver injury. Using a cell culture model of the intestinal epithelium and gene knock out mice we will determine that: 1) Ca2+-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress mediates stress-induced activation of Ask1/MKK7/JNK2/c-Src signaling and TJ disruption in the intestinal epithelium, 2) Glucocorticoids mediate stress-induced cell signaling in the intestinal epithelium and exacerbation of alcoholic gut permeability, 3) Stress-activated signaling promotes acetaldehyde-induced TJ disruption, 4) CaV1.3 channel and [Ca2+]i mediate the synergistic effects of chronic stress and ethanol on gut and liver, 5) Down regulation of JNK2 blocks stress and alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction and liver injury, 6) L. casei prevents stress-induced cell signalin and attenuates acetaldehyde-induced TJ disruption in Caco-2 cells and mouse intestine ex vivo, 7) L. casei attenuates stress and ethanol- induced gut permeability and liver injury in vivo, and 8) Peptide-like factor released by L. casei blocks gut barrier dysfunction and prevents liver injur caused by stress and ethanol. The outcome of these studies will have direct impact on the fields of stress-induced alteration of intestinal mucosal homeostasis as well as pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.  ."
"9261345","Abstract Prior to 2011, there was no regularly scheduled neuroscience meeting devoted to broad, multidisciplinary issues related to learning and memory and associated diseases of cognition. The University of Texas at Austin Center for Learning and Memory recognized the need for such a conference and initiated the Austin Conference on Learning and Memory (ACL&M) with the intent of creating a bi-yearly conference. The inaugural conference that occurred in April 2011 was a tremendous success and formed the foundation for what has become a bi-annual conference that draws a national audience and represents a major focal point for scientific discourse in the field of the neurobiology of learning and memory, and related diseases of development and cognition. This application is for renewal of 2 R13 NS074860-03A1, the award we received for the 2011, 2013, and 2015 conferences, to obtain partial support for the 2017 ACL&M. The neurobiology of learning and memory is multidisciplinary, with relevant areas of research including molecular biology, genetics, neurophysiology, behavior, biophysics, engineering, and computer science. In addition, it is approached from varying levels of analysis including molecular, cellular, systems, cognitive, and theory, using both animal models and humans. Because researchers who study learning and memory come from a wide range of diverse backgrounds, it is essential to promote opportunity for neuroscientists to gather, share results, and discuss new techniques and developments in the field. The Center for Learning and Memory at The University of Texas at Austin is a basic research center with 15 multidisciplinary faculty members whose research programs focus on the neurobiology of learning and memory. This focused research center is part of The University of Texas Institute for Neuroscience, which embodies over 70 neuroscientists representing many areas of brain research. The neuroscience climate at The University of Texas at Austin represents an ideal venue for hosting a recurring conference with broad appeal for multidisciplinary neuroscientists with the common goal of understanding human memory and associated diseases. The ACL&M bi-yearly conference series is now in its fourth installation and has grown to be a major focal point in the field for neuroscientists from diverse background to gather and exchange data, techniques and discoveries in the rapidly growing and critically important field of learning and memory."
"9135629","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Mechanical forces and, in particular, fluid shear stress (FSS), play critical roles in endothelia t regulate vascular reactivity and in renal epithelia to affect transepithelial cation transport that collectively, determine blood pressue (BP). Mechano-regulation of tubular cation transport is an important regulator of renal sodium (Na) homeostasis and infers the existence of mechano-sensors in renal epithelia. Cholesterol (chol)-rich lipid rafts (LRs), signaling platforms located n the plasma membrane (PM), are mechano-sensors that induce paracrine-mediated vasodilation (ie nitric oxide synthesis) in endothelia; however, little is known about their sensory function in  renal epithelia. Chol maintains the integrity of LRs, and effects on LR chol content impacts FSS-mediated signaling. The FSS-sensitive signaling pathways which regulate mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cells (1) are localized to caveolin-1 (cav-1) and flotillin-2 (flot-2), respectively, expressing LRs in collecting duct (CD) cells, and (2) control changes in COX-2 expression and PGE2 release, respectively. Additionally, chol integration into E-prostanoid (EP) receptor expressing LRs can alter signaling that regulates transepithelial Na absorption. In PRELIMINARY STUDIES an anti-diuretic, hypertensive phenotype was uncovered in chol fed mice, volume expanded by parenteral saline, that was associated with suppressed flow-mediated COX-2 activity and PGE2 release in microdissected cortical CDs (CCDs). Thus, the final integrated epithelial response to tubular flow rate is determined by chol calibrated, FSS-mediated PGE2 release and EP receptor stimulation which regulate Na transport. We hypothesize that hypercholesterolemia alters the chol content in LRs of the renal CD to regulate flow/FSS-induced COX-2 expression and PGE2 release which, via autocrine/paracrine EP- receptor based signaling, influences Na transport in the distal nephron. This hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims (SAs): SA1. Test whether chol-rich LRs are mechanosensory platforms for FSS-mediated stimulation of polycystin-2 (PC-2) and MAPK activation. SA1.a Evaluate the localization of PC-2, a mechano-sensitive channel responsible for apical entry of Ca2+ into CD cells, and MAPK (p38, ERK) within specific populations of LRs in CD cells and microdissected CCDs. SA1.b Determine whether FSS leads to translocation of PC-2 and MAPK out of their respective chol-rich LRs to allow for maximal PC-2 activation and MAPK phosphorylation. SA1.c Test whether LR chol content affects resting localization and FSS-induced translocation of PC-2 and MAPK out of LRs. SA2. Test whether short-term chol ingestion leads to incorporation of chol into the CCD that alters flow-mediated COX stimulation, PGE2 release and Na excretion. SA2.a Evaluate whether dietary chol consumption incorporates into the renal CCD SA2.b Determine whether chol integration into renal CCDs modifies net PGE2 generating capacity, flow- mediated PGE2 release, Na excretion and, in turn, BP. SA3. Test whether short-term chol ingestion inhibits flow-mediated PGE2 release and alters EP receptor dependent signaling, to enhance transepithelial Na transport in microperfused CCDs SA3.a Evaluate whether chol incorporation in CCDs suppresses flow-mediated PGE2 release to augment Na absorption. SA3.b Test whether chol incorporation in CCDs modifies EP receptor signaling to enhance Na absorption."
"9223629","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         PROJECT SUMMARY Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease. Approximately 40% of diabetic patients develop diabetic nephropathy (DN); and nearly half of all incident cases of end-stage renal disease in the United States are due to DN. Despite widespread use of targeted therapies to lower glucose and to antagonize the renin-angiotensin system, the prevalence of DN has remained stable. Thus, effective and disease-specific therapies for DN are needed. The immediate goal of the applicant is to study the mechanisms underlying the development of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickening in DN. The applicant's long- term goal is to understand the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease in sufficient detail to develop mechanism-based therapies for DN. A clear and focused career development plan has been designed by the applicant and the mentoring team to provide new and enhanced training in cell-extracellular matrix interactions in DN, insulin receptor signaling, communication and presentation skills, grant and manuscript writing, and responsible conduct in research. There is a plan for progressive increase in independence over the course of the CDA-2 Award. Timelines for the specific aims, laboratory space allocation, scheduled meetings between the applicant and the mentoring team, expectations of the applicant, and the specific role(s) of each mentor are addressed in detail in the career development plan. In addition, the applicant is expected to submit smaller grant proposals in the earlier years and an application for independent funding (VA Merit Award, NIH R01) in the last two years of the CDA-2 Award. Studies currently being conducted by the applicant have demonstrated that aminopeptidase-A (APA), a type II transmembrane protein expressed in visceral glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes), may play an important role in the pathogenesis of GBM thickening in DN. Initial results show that APA knockout mice have significantly thickened GBMs. Moreover, APA is down-regulated in patients with DN and in rat models of type 2 DN. Also, knockdown of the insulin receptor in cultured glomerular epithelial cells reduces the expression of APA. In this proposal, the applicant will study the role of APA downregulation in mediating the expression of genes involved in GBM remodeling. The overall hypothesis is that APA down-regulation in the diabetic state causes displacement of transcriptional factors (ZHX proteins) that migrate into the podocyte nucleus and induce changes in the expression of matrix- related genes, thereby leading to GBM thickening. The goal of the proposed studies is to increase our understanding of key molecular changes that result in the development of GBM thickening and DN. In Specific Aim 1, the effects of APA down-regulation on matrix-related gene expression will be studied. In Specific Aim 2, the importance of APA-ZHX interaction in the development of GBM thickening will be examined. In Specific Aim 3, the effects of insulin receptor deficiency on APA and ZHX proteins will be investigated."
"9143196","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Objective: The proposed study will investigate the relationship between memory deficits and abnormal electrical activity seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with seizures. Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often demonstrate memory dysfunction in the setting of otherwise normal intelligence. This finding is consistent with the theory that establishing new memories is dependent to a large extent on the function of the hippocampus and other mesial temporal lobe structures, a network known to be dysfunctional in TLE. Prior studies found an association between disruptions of cognitive task performance and the presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). IEDs are intermittent spikes or sharp waves that reflect abnormal neuronal firing, but do not organize into a seizure. Embedded within the IEDs may be pathological high frequency gamma oscillations (HFOs), distinct from the normal high frequency activity that is thought to underlie memory formation. In clinical practice, IEDs are considered only to be markers of epilepsy and are not suppressed with medications. Little is known, however, regarding the properties of IEDs that pose the greatest risk to cognitive function or the mechanism by which IEDs cause cognitive deficits. The present study examines the effects of IEDs during encoding on subsequent memory for the stimulus items. The first aim of the study is to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of IEDs within the hippocampus that will predict poorer delayed recall and recognition, as well as identify the effect of embedded pathological HFOs. The second aim is to identify the mechanism by which IEDs interrupt memory encoding. The hypothesis is that IEDs disrupt the normal EEG rhythms that underlie memory formation. More specifically, the prediction is that IEDs will cause a decrease in the amount of normal high frequency gamma activity induced during memory encoding. Furthermore, it is proposed that IEDs and their associated pathological HFOs will disrupt the synchronous timing, or coherence, of normal gamma oscillations throughout the hippocampus. Research Plan/Methods: To test these hypotheses, subjects with TLE will complete memory tasks during intracranial EEG recordings. Testing will include verbal and non-verbal encoding, working memory, and delayed recall and recognition tasks. The electrodes will be implanted within or alongside the hippocampus for clinical evaluations prior to possible resective epilepsy surgery. IEDs will be identified by manual review, with temporal and spatial properties quantified using Neuroscan software. HFO power and coherence will be assessed using spectral analysis. Clinical Relevance: The interruption of normal EEG oscillations by IEDs would help to explain both transient and long-term memory dysfunction in this patient population. The proposed study will also determine if pathological HFOs within the IEDs contribute to their adverse cognitive effects. Evidence that IEDs disrupt electrical activity necessary for memory encoding may indicate the need for suppression of discharges or point the way to new treatments for memory dysfunction. These findings could direct future investigations aimed at therapeutic approaches to improve cognition in epilepsy patients by alteration of abnormal oscillatory activity."
"9241187","Liver failure is characterized by a loss of hepatocytes or hepatic function due to an acute liver insult or chronic liver disease. Liver failure is often accompanied by neurological complications, called hepatic encephalopathy, which lead to reduced quality of life and increased mortality in patients. Acute liver failure is characterized by hepatocyte necrosis that occurs at a rate that is too rapid for the liver to regenerate resulting in a loss of liver function. In contrast, chronic liver diseases are characterized with progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis that can generate liver failure as hepatocyte death occurs and hepatic regeneration is impaired due to aberrant cellular processes. During chronic liver disease, transforming growth factor ?1 (TGF?1) has been well classified as a factor involved with apoptosis, inflammation and liver fibrosis and therefore contributes to the progression of liver pathology. We recently demonstrated that TGF?1 also contributes to the pathogenesis of both acute liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy and that this signaling protein promotes increased endothelial cell permeability following acute liver injury. Unfortunately attempts to develop therapeutics that target TGF? signaling have failed clinical trials. Therefore, targeting proteins involved in activating TGF?1 and/or proteins that interact with TGF?1 signaling may prove to be better tolerated by patients. Taking this approach, the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a homotrimeric glycoprotein that activates the propeptide form of TGF?1, and determine its contribution to pathology associated with acute and chronic liver failure. TSP-1 has been found to facilitate liver fibrosis through its interactions with TGF?1, though its actions during acute liver injury are not well classified. Our proposed specific aims will address two central hypotheses: (1) The hepatic expression of TSP-1 is elevated during acute liver failure leading to TGF?1 activation which drives hepatic inflammation, apoptosis, increased mortality and the development of hepatic encephalopathy; (2) Chronic liver failure is characterized by TGF?1 activation via TSP-1 which increases hepatic inflammation, fibrosis and other pathological processes associated with chronic liver disease. In this proposal, the pathogenesis of acute liver failure will be studied using a hepatocyte cell culture model as well as the azoxymethane-induced and acetaminophen-induced models of acute liver failure in mice. Chronic liver failure studies will employ rats that have undergone bile duct ligation surgery, a model of cholestasis and chronic biliary fibrosis with specific experiments targeted to assess cell-cell interactions in the liver. At the completion of this project, we expect to have determined the role of TSP-1 signaling on the pathological mechanisms involved with acute liver failure and chronic liver disease and will also determine the role of this signaling pathway in the development of hepatic encephalopathy. This will not only provide a greater classification of TSP-1 signaling during hepatic diseases, but could be used to identify potential therapeutic targets in patients."
"9323686","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visual malfunction is a common corollary of stroke and several other types of cortical injury. Posterior circulation infarcts, hemorrhages or traumati brain injury often produce varying degrees of damage to visual cortical networks, including the primary visual cortex, resulting in partial or complete homonymous hemianopias or quadrantanopias. The most common clinically significant visual cortical injury involves the primary visual cortex (V1). V1 is the chief relay of visual input to higher (extra striate) cortica areas and V1 lesions result in a dense contralateral scotoma within which visual perception is severely impaired. The resulting visual deficit is long thought to be highly resistant to rehabilitation, i.e. essentially irreversible. Hope, however, may not be entirely lost. Under carefully controlled conditions a limited capacity to process visual attributes such as motion often persists inside scotomas induced by V1 lesions, both in humans and monkeys (blindsight). Blindsight performance improves with training (Weiskrantz L, Prog Brain Res, 144:229-41, 2004; Huxlin et al., J Neurosci. 29(13):3981-91, 2009) raising the hope that better rehabilitation strategies may one day be able to increase the strength of V1-bypassing pathways to partially compensate for the loss of V1 input. Visual rehabilitation however remains challenging and the capacity of individual patients for visual rehabilitation highly variable (fig.3). It is important to understand which areas of the visual field are more amenable to rehabilitation and to study possible mechanisms underlying recovery. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to map population receptive field (pRF) properties in normal visual cortex (Dumoulin et al., J Neurosci, 2008). This offers a unique opportunity to characterize in detail, voxel by voxel, how pRFs in spared visual areas are organized following area V1+ injuries. However, in order to do so, the pRF mapping methodology has to be refined to eliminate biases that occur in pRF estimation near the border of a perceptual scotoma (fig. 1, 5, 6). We will study a patient cohort with chronic hemianopia and quadrantanopia as a result of V1+ lesions and age-matched controls. Specific aim #1 will develop a direct method of estimating pRF topography that is less prone to bias (figs 1, 5, 6). Specific aim #2 will characterize how visual field representation and pRF properties in spared visual areas differ in subjects with chronic V1+ lesions compared to controls. The capacity of spared visual areas to be modulated from visual field locations within the perceptual scotoma will identify locations more amenable to rehabilitation. Specific aim #3 will test the hypothesis that rehabilitative training in visual moton perception improves performance by increasing the sensitivity of the motion selective complex (hV5/MT+) to visual motion stimuli. This effect will be particularly strong in regions of the scotoma that can visually modulate area hV5/MT+ before training (SA #2). Overall, our approach will characterize how downstream areas adjust to chronic V1+ injury, and will suggest new ways to guide rehabilitative training in the future."
"9206082","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Traumatic brain injury (TBI) impacts nearly 2% of the population and is a major cause of disability in the Veteran population, often resulting in long-term physical, cognitive and neurobehavioral impairments that prevent return to the workforce and community. It has long been appreciated that poor sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness are common and persistent symptoms after mild TBI. Data suggests that poor sleep interferes with recovery from TBI. What is not known is why sleep-wake disturbances persist after TBI. More effective therapies are needed for the treatment of TBI and associated post-concussive symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand mechanisms underlying sleep-wake disturbances in order to identify better therapeutic targets.  Our long-term goal is to understand why sleep-wake disturbances persist after mild TBI. Our central hypothesis is that TBI disrupts physiological cortical function which in turn alters glutamatergic inputs to hypothalamic sleep-wake circuits, resulting in sleep-wake fragmentation, and subsequently delaying cognitive recovery in individuals with TBI. Our hypothesis was formulated on the basis of our own preliminary data showing decreased excitability of hypothalamic wake-active neurons in a mouse model of TBI, and improved wakefulness with administration of a dietary therapy that is thought to increase synaptic glutamate content. The rationale for the proposed research is that, once it is known how changes in brain glutamate cause sleep-wake fragmentation in TBI, pharmacological manipulation of glutamate in sleep-wake circuits could yield novel approaches for recovery from TBI.  We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims:  1. Characterize regional patterns of sleep-wake dysfunction in TBI.  2. Assess glutamate and GABA changes during sleep and wakefulness in TBI.  3. Examine the effect of a dietary therapy on glutamate, GABA, and regional sleep-wake  dysfunction in TBI.  To accomplish these aims, we will first perform chronic, in vivo electrophysiological recordings across different cortical brin regions in freely behaving, brain-injured mice, analyze quantitative EEG measures in sleep and wakefulness, and correlate these metrics with behavior. Next, we will perform in vivo microdialysis in combination with EEG in brain-injured mice to determine extracellular glutamate and GABA levels in the hypothalamus during sleep and wake states. We will then use quantitative electron microscopy (EM) to confirm synaptic changes in glutamate and GABA in the hypothalamus. Lastly, given the hypothesis that our dietary therapy replenishes glutamate content in nerve terminal inputs onto wake-active neurons in the hypothalamus, dietary therapy will be administered to brain- injured mice to determine the recovery of extracellular glutamate and GABA (microdialysis), synaptic glutamate and GABA (EM), and sleep-wake measures (EEG).  With respect to expected outcomes, the work proposed in aims 1, 2 and 3 is expected to identify quantitative EEG metrics of sleep-wake dysfunction in TBI that predict functional recovery, and examine excitatory and inhibitory inputs to sleep-wake circuits in TBI that are amenable to therapeutic intervention. Such results are expected to have a profound impact on our understanding of TBI and post-concussive symptoms, by deepening our understanding of cortico-hypothalamic interactions in TBI-induced sleep-wake disturbances, and evaluating a therapy that has enormous potential to optimize wakefulness, and therefore recovery, from TBI."
"9254419","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Ischemic heart disease caused by atherosclerosis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among U.S. Veterans. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by heterogeneous, lipid-laden vascular plaques. Inflammatory plaques have traditionally been at high risk of rupture leading to clot formation and subsequent heart attack. Identifying calcified plaque has a predictive value in terms of overall atherosclerotic burden; however, inflammatory high-risk plaques tend to have minimal or spotty levels of calcium deposition. Thus some plaques are minimally calcified and very inflammatory in nature, whereas other types of plaque are heavily calcified and appear less inflammatory and less likely to rupture. Little is known about what mechanisms drive the evolution of plaque calcium composition. Macrophage adhesion signaling is critical to the augmentation pro-inflammatory factors secreted by macrophages, including proteases that remodel extracellular matrix. Cytoskeletal elements like Rac2 and Myosin IIA appear to be critical modulators of that adhesion-based inflammatory signaling and thus would make excellent potential targets for inhibiting plaque inflammation and reducing the risk of heart attack. Preliminary data in a Rac2 gene-deletion, atherosclerosis-prone mouse model demonstrates the evolution of heavily calcified plaques that are likely to be less inflammatory. The goal of this study is to define the mechanisms that drive this heavy calcification and to quantify whether heavy calcification truly represents decreased inflammatory activity within the plaque. Plaque calcium composition is thought to be derived from a balance between anabolic (calcium-promoting) osteoblasts and catabolic (calcium and matrix remodeling) osteoclasts. Macrophage subsets have the capacity to become osteoclast-like cells. Thus, the primary hypothesis is that adhesion signaling in macrophages, through Rac2- Myosin IIA networks, is a critical modulator of macrophage-derived osteoclast-like cell, leading to their effective differentiation and effector function, which serves to minimize calcific depositon in plaques and maintain an inflammatory phenotype. This hypothesis leads to three primary objectives that form the experimental design. The first objective is to define the dependence of osteoclast-like cell differentiation and function on Rac2 and Myosin IIA, using markers of osteoclast differentiation and the mineralized calcium resorption for function assessment. The second objective is to identify inflammatory factors, like matrix remodeling proteins, whose expression is driven by Rac2 and Myosin IIA through osteoclast-like cell adhesion, using molecular and biochemical techniques. The third and final aim is to define the dependence of calcific atherosclerosis on Myosin IIA and to quantify an inverse correlation between the degree of calcification and the expression of inflammatory markers in vivo, using molecular imaging tools and the atherosclerosis-prone animal model. Defining the inflammatory mechanisms that modulate calcification of atherosclerotic plaques will lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets for the development of new medications that can reduce the risk of heart attack, ultimately having a profound effect on the lives of U.S. Veterans."
"9134347","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more than 5 million Americans, and this number is expected to nearly triple to more than 13 million by 2050 due to the growing population of older adults in our society. In Veterans, the overall prevalence of dementia among those treated at VA medical centers has been estimated at 7.3%. AD is the most common cause of dementia in Veterans aged 65 and older. Veterans may be at increased risk for AD relative to the general population due to the demographics of the Veteran population (e.g., older age) and the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) which can increase risk for cognitive decline and dementia. As the number of Veterans diagnosed with AD increases dramatically in the coming years and decades, the costs associated with dementia care will also rise at alarming rates. The process of AD is believed to begin many years prior to the clinical diagnosis, and there is a need for enhanced detection and characterization of early phases of AD (i.e., mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). Previous studies have shown that AD and MCI are heterogeneous disorders that involve multiple underlying neuropathologies, including coexisting AD and cerebrovascular disease pathologies. Although there has been an increased focus on identifying sophisticated biomarkers indicative of early AD, methods of characterizing cognition in prodromal AD have remained relatively coarse. It has recently been established that the conventional method of diagnosing MCI is highly susceptible to diagnostic errors, while a novel actuarial neuropsychological method for MCI diagnosis significantly improves diagnostic accuracy. The goal of this Career Development Award (CDA-2) is for the candidate to develop the necessary skills to become an independent clinical scientist investigating cognitive and biomarker profiles associated with prodromal AD in Veterans. The application contains a research project aimed at identifying accurate and inaccurate MCI diagnoses in 84 older adult Veterans and characterizing participants in terms of their unique vascular and AD biomarker profiles. [The project will also examine preclinical AD, an asymptomatic phase of AD in which individuals are classified as cognitively normal yet test positive for biomarkers/cognitive markers  associated with AD.] All participants will undergo a multimodal assessment at baseline and repeat neuropsychological evaluation at one-year intervals. Vascular biomarkers will include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of blood-brain barrier breakdown (i.e., cyclophilin A, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and a CSF/plasma albumin quotient ratio), and neuroimaging evidence of vascular pathology (i.e., white matter hyperintensities, cerebral microbleeds, reduced cerebral blood flow). AD biomarkers will include CSF concentrations of beta-amyloid, tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau, and neuroimaging markers of cortical thinning. This study is highly innovative in that it is the first to examine vascular and AD biomarkers of both accurate and inaccurate diagnosis using novel definitional criteria for MCI in a Veteran population. [The use of  actuarial criteria to define subtle cognitive decline using individual test scores in preclinica AD is also novel.] This CDA-2 application includes a comprehensive training program which builds upon the applicant's background and existing skills in neuropsychological assessment/diagnosis, cognitive aging, and cognitive profiles of MCI. The training plan is focused on building additional competencies in CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers associated with vascular and AD risks, longitudinal data analysis, and developing expertise in the integration of neuropsychology and biomarkers. The multidisciplinary mentoring team includes expertise in all aspects of the proposal including cognitive profiling of MCI, CSF biomarkers, neuroimaging biomarkers, and longitudinal statistics. The proposed project and the exceptional training opportunities available at the VA San Diego Healthcare System and the University of California San Diego will assist the applicant in accomplishing her long-term career objective of transitioning into an independent VA clinical scientist conducting patient-oriented research in the  field of neuropsychology and dementia risk."
"9141011","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alzheimer disease (AD) produces a progressive degeneration of the brain that slowly destroys a victim's cognitive abilities. This disease inflicts tremendous social and economic burden on families and society in general. It is projected that more than 200,000 Veterans will be diagnosed with dementia in 2017, with AD the most common cause. Therapeutic options for AD remain very limited and no treatments have been shown to slow the relentless progression of the disease. Pathologically AD is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-? (A?) derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule associated protein tau that results in the formation of tangles inside neurons. These protein deposits are associated with a dramatic loss of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. The mechanistic relationship between these protein accumulations and neurodegeneration is, however, unknown. Synaptic dysfunction and loss of axon terminals are among the earliest recognized changes in AD, suggesting that impairment of mechanisms that maintain integrity of synapses may underlie or contribute to pathology. Removal and replacement of damaged proteins (proteostasis) is a primary mechanism by which cells maintain functional structures such as mitochondria. Clearance is mediated by two interconnected systems-the ubitquitin-proteasome system and the autophagy-lysosome system. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that there may be locally regulated proteostasis programs at presynaptic terminals. In our preliminary data we demonstrate that the autophagy-lysosome system is upregulated specifically at synapses in response to A?. In this Pilot Project we propose to test the hypothesis that presynaptic autophagy plays a crucial role in the neurodegeneration that occurs in AD. To test the hypothesis, we have generated two presynaptically targeted molecular regulators of autophagy - one enhancer and one suppressor. We propose to determine the consequences of altering presynaptic autophagy on an in vitro model of AD as well as a murine model of the disease. At the end of the proposed studies we expect to have a better understanding of autophagy of presynaptic structures and how this process relates to neurodegeneration in AD. This knowledge will hopefully help us to identify novel targets for the treatments that slow the progress of this devastating disease."
"9220724","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Since the aging population is growing at an unprecedented pace, the number of Veterans diagnosed with dementia is estimated to increase dramatically. Identification of individuals before the onset of significant clinical symptoms is essential for facilitating intervention when therapies may be most effective. One approach to identifying potential biomarkers of prodromal dementia involves assessing brain structure in individuals at increased risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). With a recent explosion in MCI research, it has become clear that it is a heterogeneous disorder and distinct clinical subtypes (e.g., amnestic, nonamnestic) have been proposed. Heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of MCI may relate in part to the heterogeneity of underlying neuropathological mechanism(s). Although debated, evidence suggests that individuals with amnestic MCI demonstrate greater medial temporal lobe damage typical of early AD (e.g., Singh et al., 2006). In contrast, those with nonamnestic MCI show greater frontal lobe involvement (Nobili et al., 2008) and greater cerebrovascular disease (as evidenced by white matter abnormalities) on MRI (Delano-Wood et al., 2009). Mixed MCI characterized by impairment in multiple domains of cognitive ability may represent individuals with mixed pathology with both neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular features (Libon et al., 2010). Taken together, previous studies highlight a complex relationship between MCI, white matter, AD pathology, and cerebrovascular functioning. The proposed study will combine imaging markers of white matter abnormalities and vascular risk markers with AD-related biomarkers (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] measures of amyloid and tau, hippocampal volume) as well as take into account MCI clinical subtypes in order to more completely characterize the contributions of AD and cerebrovascular risk to the dementia prodrome. In doing so, we can compare the prevailing model of biomarkers of MCI and AD, which emphasizes neurodegeneration (e.g., Jack et al., 2013) with a model relating the combined effects of vascular and AD pathologies to the probability of developing dementia (Chui et al., 2012). The current study aims to (1) better characterize the structural brain changes and vascular risk profiles underlying distinct MCI subtypes, (2) critically examine novel neuroimaging measures that might distinguish MCI subtypes and contribute to the nature and severity of cognitive impairment, and (3) determine which neuroimaging markers of white and gray matter alterations and additional risk factors for dementia (i.e., vascular risk factors, APOE ?4 status) are most useful in predicting cognitive decline and progression to dementia. In the proposed study, 92 older adults (23 cognitively normal, 23 amnestic MCI, 23 nonamnestic MCI, and 23 mixed/multiple domain MCI) will undergo comprehensive neuropsychological assessment; laboratory testing to assess vascular risk factors (e.g., fasting glucose); CSF measurement of amyloid and tau; and neuroimaging exams including high resolution structural, perfusion, and white matter imaging. White matter imaging protocols include T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) as well as two cutting edge techniques: diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) and a novel, myelin-selective technique (multi-component driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 [mcDESPOT]). It is hypothesized that greater vascular risk burden and white matter changes in frontal regions will be associated with nonamnestic MCI and mixed/multiple domain MCI. In contrast, white matter changes in medial temporal lobe regions will be associated with amnestic MCI and mixed/multiple domain MCI. A better understanding of the underlying neuropathology associated with distinct MCI clinical subtypes and the implementation of multimodal neuroimaging markers that better detect heterogeneous pathologies may have important implications for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment selection, and monitoring of disease-modifying effects of therapy as well as selection criteria for clinical trials."
"9137350","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized pathologically by neuronal loss and the accumulation of aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in surviving CNS neurons. Collectively, these disease, which include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a common and important cause of progressive neurological disability in Veterans. Current treatments only partially mitigate symptoms and do not alter the course of these diseases; consequently, there is an urgent need for new approaches that address pathogenic mechanisms and prevent disease progression. Convergent genetic and pathological evidence strongly suggests that Tau is centrally involved in causing neurodegeneration in these diseases, and there is accumulating evidence that oligomeric Tau species are a key pathogenic mediator. In addition, human tauopathy tissue and experimental Tau models both show striking evidence of impaired mitochondrial function resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative damage to neurons. However, there is no consensus regarding the mechanisms by which Tau and mitochondria interact and it is not known whether changes in mitochondrial function are a proximate pathogenic event that could be targeted therapeutically. Building on: (i) our recent finding that cytoplasmic protein oligomers  inhibit mitochondrial protein import by interacting with the translocase of the outer mitochondrial  membrane (TOMM) complex; (ii) published evidence showing that oligomeric Tau species are neurotoxic and impair expression of mitochondrial proteins; and (iii) our preliminary data showing that Tau interacts with the TOMM complex in Alzheimer's disease tissue, our overall guiding hypothesis is that: inhibition of mitochondrial protein import by oligomeric Tau causes progressive mitochondrial functional deficits that provoke oxidative damage and neuronal death. To address this hypothesis directly in vivo, we have generated novel zebrafish tauopathy models with progressive and highly reproducible phenotypes, allowing establishment of the sequence of biochemical events underlying pathogenesis over a practicable experimental time course. This model has been constructed on a genetic background that lacks pigment, allowing imaging of CNS neurons in vivo by confocal microscopy. Coupled with novel transgenic zebrafish lines expressing ratiometric reporters of cellular mitochondrial function, we will determine how neuronal mitochondrial bioenergetic functions, ROS production, and cellular RedOx status change during progressive tauopathy the CNS in vivo, and whether abnormal phenotypes can be rescued by over-expression of the translocase complex protein TOM20 (Aim 1). These experiments will test the hypothesis that protein import-dependent abnormalities of mitochondrial function in neurons precede the onset of neurological phenotypes in tauopathy and worsen with disease progression, causing oxidative damage and cell death. Next, in a series of complementary experiments in vitro and in vivo, we will test whether oligomeric Tau competes with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins for interaction with TOM20 to directly inhibit mitochondrial protein import (Aim 2). Finally, exploiting the translational potential of Ta transgenic zebrafish, we will carry out the first phenotype-based drug re-purposing screen in a vertebrate tauopathy model (Aim 3). Using novel, automated neurological phenotyping assays we will interrogate a chemical library against functional endpoints that are caused by tauopathy, but which are unbiased to preconceptions regarding molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. Compounds that are identified as modulators of tauopathy in vivo in this pilot screen will be tested for activity in restoring mitochondrial protein import and function, and will be candidates for further therapeutic development. Together, these studies will elucidate mitochondrial mechanisms underlying degeneration of CNS neurons in tauopathy in vivo and will provide new avenues of investigation for the development of effective therapeutics."
"9234884","Project Summary/Abstract  My major research interest is to understand molecular mechanisms of gene regulation and function in the pathogenesis of cancer and cardiovascular disease, two major health burdens for our Veterans. We seek to determine the fundamental molecular signals that regulate cellular function, and translate the findings in the pathogenesis of disease using animal models, so as to identify novel molecular targets and strategies for prevention and intervention of disease.  Translational research on cancer pathogenesis and resistance to therapy. We have been focused on the death receptor signaling pathways in regulating apoptosis of cancer cells and their roles in cancer tumorigenesis and resistance to therapy. Our studies have demonstrated that modulating the Death- Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) determines the downstream survival and apoptosis signals. Recently, we discovered a novel regulator, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), in the death receptor-5 DISC that contribute to the resistance of pancreatic cancer to therapy, a critical hurdle for effective cancer treatment. Based on this novel finding, our current VA merit review award (2014-2018) is to delineate the mechanisms underlying DISC-associated PARP1 in regulating pancreatic cancer resistance to antibody immunotherapy with a humanized anti-death receptor 5 antibody (TRA-8/CS1008). I will continue my long-term collaboration with VA physician scientist, Jay M McDonald, MD (Pathology, Birmingham VA) and the inventor of TRA-8/CS1008, Tong Zhou, MD (Medicine, UAB). As CS1008 therapy has been effective in clinical trials for some cancer but resistant in others including pancreatic tumors, the overarching goal for our investigations is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and identify new compounds that sensitize pancreatic cancer to TRA-8-induced apoptosis, thus overriding drug resistance and leading to successful therapies.  Differentiation and reprogramming of vascular smooth muscle cells in vascular disease. Phenotypic plasticity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) provides an excellent model to study the function of cell differentiation in health and disease. We are particularly interested in studying how VSMC become bone-like cells (vascular calcification). Using tissue-specific gene knockout mouse models, we have demonstrated an essential role of the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 in regulating vascular calcification, a feature of atherosclerosis, diabetes and end stage renal disease. We have uncovered novel mechanisms underlying Runx2 upregulation in the vasculature by increased oxidative stress and hyperglycemia. We have also discovered a novel crosstalk between VSMC, macrophages and vascular stem cells in the development of atherosclerotic calcification. We have published a body of work demonstrating a critical integrative role of Runx2 upregulation in VSMC in promoting vascular pathology, which has been highly recognized and cited. Our overarching goals are to identify novel mechanisms that regulate pathogenesis of vascular calcification and identify therapeutic targets. We have brought together several physician scientists at the Birmingham VA including Drs. Paul Sanders and Anupam Agarwal (Nephrology) as well as Dr. Louis Dell'Italia (Cardiology and Associate Chief of Staff). Our collaborative studies have led to the development of a Program Project to investigate ?Novel Regulators for Vascular Disease?, which have been supported by the VA (2012-2016).  These investigations will not only elucidate the fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of cancer drug resistance and pathogenesis of vascular disease, but also provide novel molecular insights facilitating further studies to translate these findings into therapeutic strategies for patient care, so as to improve the Veterans' health, life span and quality of life."
