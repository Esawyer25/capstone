"9204797","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGs) are important for the treatment of a variety of serious infectious diseases including septicemia, complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and nosocomial respiratory tract infections. AGs are the mainstay of treating Pseudomonas infection in patients with cystic fibrosis and one of the best classes of medication for treating multiple drug resistant TB throughout the world. AGs would be even more widely used today if it were not for the fact that as many as 20% of patients treated with AGs develop measurable irreversible hearing loss and a significant fraction of these people become functionally deaf. This side effect, called ototoxicity, has moved aminoglycoside antibiotics from what would otherwise be a cheap and effective therapy into a treatment of last resort. Previously, we identified a class of small molecular compounds that were effective at preventing hair cell death in the zebrafish and later showed them to also protect hearing and prevent inner ear hair cell death in rats exposed to high doses of AGs. Our Phase I SBIR grant enabled us to show that these compounds did not interfere with the bactericidal properties of AGs and have a wide margin of safety in a variety of standard in vitro safety tests. The Phase I work led to the selection of our leading clinical candidate. This Phase II project seeks to continue to advance our candidate through the required steps of GLP/GMP manufacturing of a medicine and through the rigorous safety testing dictated by the FDA for in-human trials. We have assembled a team of hearing experts, medicinal chemists, pharmacologists, infectious disease experts, toxicologists and regulatory experts to guide the project through FDA IND application and approval. The project will result in the first medicine ever approved by the FDA to prevent hearing loss of any type."
"9244223","ABSTRACT Bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFS) include myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), aplastic anemia (AA) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobiuria (PNH) and are diseases characterized by failed blood production, stem cell failure and various degrees of clonality marked by the presence of somatic genomic lesions. These conditions have not only a growing socioeconomic and medical importance, but also their basic study has provided ground-breaking discoveries with implications for the understanding the physiologic pathophysiologic mechanisms within hematopoiesis and beyond for the whole field of hematology. The main focus of my early scientific career as physician scientist and hematologist has been on study immune pathogenesis, ways of stem cell enumeration, mechanisms of stem cell damage and molecular genetics of BMFS. The latter themes initially included discovery of new somatic and germ line lesions and subsequently transitioned to mechanistic studies. These lines of investigations, specifically pertinent in this R35, yielded important clues as to the mutational spectrum in MDS and later led to the growing appreciation of the role of clonal hierarchy and dynamics not only in MDS, but also in AA and PNH. Our team has made significant contribution to these advances made possible by a continuous funding from NHLBI and other sources. Our experience, commitment to the field, and created infrastructure provide a solid base for proposed expansions of ongoing molecular studies towards new paradigm-shifting scientific goals. By taking advantage of the newest molecular discoveries of somatic and germ line mutations and through progress in clarifying their mechanistic consequences, we believe that it is now time to advance translational goals to make tangible advances in medical care including diagnostics and therapeutics for BMFS. Such investigations would also contribute to improved understanding of basic disease mechanisms mediated by selected subset of common and important somatic mutations. We will use the newest technologies, including single cell sorting and sequencing, to further study the clonal architecture to identify targetable early events and also determine the dependence of clonal cells on these events following acquisition of subclonal lesions. These genomic investigations will involve also germ line lesions and their contribution of late manifestation of adult BMFs. They will provide substrates for mechanistic studies aiming at development of conceptually new therapeutic strategies. This theme will initially involve TET2 and other dioxygenases, DNMT3A and other histone and DNA methylases and spliceosomal mutations. These studies will also define the impact of germ line alteration and using integrative approaches identify disease subgroups by the presence of convergent pathways and results will provide a canvas for the rational selection of most suitable targets for development of new treatment strategies.  "
"9244139","Summary Cardiopulmonary fibrosis is a unifying factor in multiple pathologies, including post myocardial infarction (MI) scarring that leads to heart failure, heart valve disease (HVD), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), among others. My laboratory explores fibroblast-driven, mechanobiological mechanisms of cardiopulmonary fibrotic remodeling and develops innovative strategies to prevent or treat these diseases. We focus on cardiopulmonary fibroblasts and how their unique phenotypic signatures can be targeted to halt their fibrotic machinery. We uniquely leverage our engineering expertise to address mechanobiological inputs that drive cardiopulmonary fibrosis, by effectively combining animal models of disease with primary cell in vitro studies. Our prior accomplishments provide strong evidence for future promise to bridge key gaps in our understanding that leads to development of novel treatment strategies. Initially, we focused on HVD, but have since expanded into general cardiopulmonary fibrosis, including PAH, which results in right heart failure, and fibrosis following MI. These new pursuits are complementary to our well-established research program in HVD and combining my laboratory?s NHLBI research portfolio would allow us to make rapid progress and translate our findings to patients by: 1) building on past accomplishments, while sustaining present efforts and being nimble enough to pursue opportunities presented in the course of research activities; 2) solidifying the value of cardiopulmonary mechanobiology and positioning my group to not only continue our research but to ?seed? expertise more broadly in the NHLBI community; 3) maximizing common use of costly reagents and animal models more effectively; 4) supporting my group of eight trainees at steady state, including two junior faculty."
"9244269","Abstract Pneumonia caused by host-adapted, multiple drug resistant bacterial pathogens is a major clinical problem, associated with both primary infections and complications of hospitalization. Much of the pathology associated with these pathogens is due to the host response that is elicited ; either excessive inflammation that causes respiratory failure or an immunosuppressive response that permits unimpeded bacterial replication, pulmonary damage and sepsis. Organisms such as MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae readily adapt to the milieu within the human airways, acquiring mutations that affect their metabolism, immunogenicity as well as their resistance to antimicrobial agents. The goal of our studies is to apply a comprehensive approach to fully characterize such host adapted pathogens, isolated from patients, by using whole gen ome sequencing, murine modeling of immunogenicity, and proteomics. This type of analysis can provide the data necessary to identify bacterial components associated with specific patterns of infection. Bacterial genes that are linked to immuno-pathogenicity can be identified in clinical isolates in real time, just as methicillin resistance genes are routinely screened in staphylococci. A better understanding of the host response that is elicited will be used to apply immunomodulatory therapy to complement the often ineffective antimicrobial agents used to treat pneumonia. In other branches of medicine, targeting the inflammasome, IL-1, T cell signaling and TNF cascades have become standards of care and new immune targets are under active development. A comprehensive understanding of both the properties of the infecting organism and the host response that is evoked can be used to develop a strategy of precision medicine for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia."
"9387333","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The world dreams of curing every disease with stem cells. We all know this is unlikely. But the main barrier to using stem cells to regenerate tissues  and treat diseases is that stem cells that are not genetically identical to the recipient's cells ae prone to immune rejection. An innovative solution to overcome this barrier uses the patient's own somatic cells to generate stem cells called iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells). Once generated, these iPSCs can be administered to the patient without fear of rejection because iPSCs are genetically identical to all other cells in the patient. However, administering iPSCs is not a solution for most inherited diseases because the generated iPSCs also contain the disease-causing genetic defect. We have assembled a team with expertise in stem cell biology, neurotherapeutics, translational science, and neuropharmacology to solve this problem. We propose to use a new technology called CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated protein 9) to repair the faulty gene in the recipient's stem cells. CRISPR-Cas9 is the most efficient gene correction system to date. Our approach will use CRISPR-Cas9 to correct the genetic defect in iPSCs isolated from patients. The corrected stem cells will be transplanted back to the patient to provide cells that have a functioning copy of the gene. We propose to test this concept using neural stem cells to treat the inherited childhood neurological disease mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB). Gene-corrected, autologous stem cell therapy is ideally suited to diseases like MPS IIIB, which are due to lack of a secreted protein (in this case, NAGLU [alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase]), because a very small number of corrected stem cells can have a large therapeutic effect. We will also employ glycosylation-independent lysosomal targeting using a peptide derived from IGF2 that improves the uptake of secreted NAGLU into the brain. In the R21 phase of this proposal, we will perform in vitro studies to determine how effectively our corrected stem cells secrete normal NAGLU and NAGLU-IGF2 that can be taken up by MPS IIIB cells. We will also perform in vivo studies to determine how well the neural stem cells distribute throughout the brain at three different doses, in neonatal and adult animals. In the R33 phase of the proposal, we will put these concepts together for in vivo studies of the effect of corrected neural stem cell on MPS IIIB disease. We will assess biochemical, neuropathological, and neurobehavioral outcomes. The goal is to create a permanent treatment for this devastating, untreatable disease, and to build a platform for treating other genetic diseases that are caused by the lack of a functioning, secreted protein."
"9198795","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal first aims to improve, develop, and test powerful new molecular techniques to monitor and manipulate dynamic signal transduction in neurons. Goals for voltage indicators based on photoinduced electron transfer include greater sensitivity, genetic targeting, and longer wavelengths. New far-red fluorescent proteins engineered from phycobiliproteins are promising building blocks for in vivo indicators of cell cycle status, Ca2+, and protease activity. A novel alternative approach to measuring and manipulating neuronal activity is to engineer an artificial transcription factor activated by simultaneous high [Ca2+] and illumination, greatly improving on endogenous activity reporters such as c-fos. The genetically encoded snapshot reporter will capture the pattern of activity throughout a large ensemble of neurons at a time precisely defined by the triggering illumination, then drive expression of effector genes to mark those cells and allow selective excitation, inhibition, or ablation to test their functional importance. A chimeric channelrhodopsi activatable by red light permits optogenetic excitation of deep neurons through the intact skull, but its peak wavelength should be further increased and its residual sensitivity to blue light suppressed. Optogenetic inhibition of synaptic release will be improved by a more efficient singlet-oxygen generating protein, and introducing a singlet- oxygen-sensing GFP to map the spatial extent of inhibition. Both optogenetic tools will be applied to dissect amygdalar circuits n fear conditioning. The singlet-oxygen generating protein can now be split into two complementary fragments that only become photoactive after being brought together by chimeric partners. This complementation system may allow protein-protein interactions and kinase and protease activity to be captured for subsequent visualization by electron microscopy. A genetically encoded tag that marks proteins made during a pharmacologically defined period may become applicable to image synthesis and degradation of proteins in intact brain, thanks to development of nanoparticles that deliver small molecule drugs across the blood-brain barrier. Such nanoparticles may also aid clinical drug delivery to the brain. Such techniques will be used to test a new hypothesis that very long-term memories such as fear conditioning are stored as the pattern of holes in the perineuronal net (PNN), a specialized extracellular matrix that envelops mature neurons and restricts synapse formation. The 3-D intertwining of PNN and synapses will be imaged by serial-section electron microscopy. Lifetimes of PNN vs. intrasynaptic components will be compared by pulse-chase 15N labeling in mice and 14C content in human cadaver brains. Genetically encoded indicators and anti-neoepitope antibodies should improve spatial and temporal resolution of the in vivo activity of proteases that locally erode PNN. New techniques including genetic knockouts, better pharmacological inhibitors, and the snapshot reporter should enable more precise inhibition or potentiation of PNN erosion to compare with behavioral consequences. Biosynthesis of PNN components and proteases will be imaged."
"9198789","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early childhood is a critical period for establishing healthy diet and physical activity behaviors that may influence children's short- and long-term risk for obesity and other chronic diseases. Unfortunately, during this important stage of development, many preschool children have already adopted unhealthy diet and physical activity behaviors. Home and child care are two important spheres of influence that shape young children's diet and physical activity behaviors. Interventions engaging both spheres in a coordinated effort would ensure that children receive consistent health messages. There have been very few interventions that have targeted the child care setting, many of which made no attempt to engage parents. Those that did include a parent component generally used low-intensity strategies (e.g., newsletters, homework assignments). Innovative approaches that engage both the child care center and parents in a substantial and meaningful way are needed. Social marketing has been identified as a promising approach for health promotion efforts targeting children. Social marketing principals recognize the need to engage all individuals whose behaviors must be affected to bring about change, and to offer messages that emphasize benefits, and overcome barriers associated with behavior change. The application of social marketing principles in child care-based interventions is very limited. The proposed study is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial (86 centers and 860 children) to evaluate the effect of a 12-month intervention - Our Year of Healthy Living - on the diet and physical activity behaviors of preschool children (3-4 years) and their adult caregivers (parents and child care providers). The intervention will use a series of social marketing campaigns initiated in the child care center that incorporate visual cues, educational materials, activities, contests, and e-messages to deliver targeted messages. This study's primary outcomes are children's minutes of non-sedentary activity (measured via accelerometers) and diet quality (assessed with Healthy Eating Index scores). Secondary outcomes will assess: children's body mass index, food and physical activity practices in the child care center and at home, and health behaviors of child care providers and parents."
"9198790","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper synaptic communication is necessary for normal brain function and information processing, and disrupted synaptic communication is associated with many neurological disorders. AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are critical mediators of synaptic communication, mediating much of the excitatory postsynaptic responses in the brain. AMPARs exist as tetramers of either homogeneous or heterogeneous subunit composition. While the specific subunit composition of an AMPAR can dictate the biophysical properties of the channel, the role of these different subunits in vivo is unclear. It as been hypothesized that learning and memory is encoded by experience-dependent trafficking of AMPARs at synapses in intact neural circuits, yet how prior sensory experience modulates AMPAR trafficking and how changes in AMPAR trafficking in turn modulate synaptic efficacy and underlie behavioral plasticity in the intact animal remains an open question. Using C. elegans forward genetics, my lab has been studying regulators of AMPAR trafficking based on their functional requirements in vivo. Recently we found that AMPARs are recycled through an endosome-to-Golgi retrograde recycling pathway regulated by RAB-6.2 (a Rab6-type GTPase) and the retromer complex. Whereas little is known about Rab6/retromer pathway function in the nervous system, we found that this pathway maintains the synaptic level of specific AMPAR subunit combinations. We found that another Rab6 family member, RAB-6.1, regulates the recycling of a different set of AMPAR subunit combinations. Using yeast two-hybrid, we also identified candidate effectors and a GAP for theses Rabs. In a forward genetic screen, we identified mutants in a new gene that negatively regulates AMPAR retrograde transport, mostly likely by negatively regulating one or both Rab6 protein. We hypothesize that these two Rab6 proteins promote the recycling of distinct AMPAR subunit combinations. We propose that prior sensory experience regulates the balance of these two recycling pathways, which in turn determines which AMPAR subunit composition is localized at the synapse and thus the habituation kinetics at that synapse. We will test this hypothesis through four specific aims. Firs, we will characterize the role of RAB-6.1 in regulating AMPAR recycling. Second, we will characterize the role of TBC-1 as a potential GAP negative regulator of the two Rab6 proteins. Third, we will characterize the role of a new phosphoinositide phosphatase enzyme as a potential Rab6 effector that modulates lipid membrane composition. Fourth, we will clone and characterize the newly identified gene that appears to negatively regulate Rab6 activity and AMPAR retrograde recycling. These aims will include molecular, cellular, behavioral, biochemical, and electrophysiological analyses, and will provide clues to the mechanisms by which glutamate receptors are regulated."

"9199437","Project Description  The high energy collisional activation project will develop fundamental technology to improve proteomics and  lipidomics. The integration of genomic and proteomic data has revealed deficiencies in the sequence coverage  of proteins that are identified using conventional proteomic methods. Specifically, a minority of high value  genomic variants in cancer are currently identified by state-of-the-art proteomics. This work will deploy new  methods using high energy collisional activation tandem mass spectrometry on a MALDI-ToF/ToF platform that  is coupled to a two dimensional high performance liquid chromatograph. The ability of HE-CAD to promote  pathways of fragmentation (charge-remote fragmentation) that are not currently being used in proteomics is  aimed at identifying the proteins that are expressed. The second aim is to apply high energy collisional  activation to complex lipids, particularly those from pathogenic microorganisms. The lipids and the biosynthetic  pathways that generate them in microbes are very different from mammals and thus are a potential target for  therapies."
"9199436","Project Description  The goals of the lipid mass spectrometry (MS) technological research and development program (TRD3) are to  extend the study of ion chemistry and fragmentation mechanisms pioneered by M.L. Gross (Resource PI) and  his staff specifically to biomedically important complex lipid molecules. Studies of lipid structures in TRD3  complement the biophysical studies in TRD1 by offering the opportunity to study protein interactions with lipids  and membranes, including lipid-metabolizing enzymes. Lipid-protein and lipid-membrane interactions are  relevant to the interactions of the signaling enzyme Group VIA PLA2 with membrane substrates, allosteric  modifiers, and pharmacologic inhibitors (TRD1, C&S1, C&S2); to the recognition of lipid antigen-CD1 protein  complexes by T cell receptors of Natural Killer T cells (DBP6); and to interactions of the Fatty Acid Synthase  protein complex with subcellular membranes (DBP9, C&S3). TRD3 lipid MS technologies are integrated with  TRD4 initiatives by providing the opportunity for complementary development of ESI-LIT-MSn with low energy  collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) in parallel with MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS/MS with high energy CAD to  provide overlapping but non-redundant structural information for classes of large stable biomolecules that are  difficult to fragment under conditions of low energy CAD, such as glycan moieties of glycolipid antigens  (DBP7), archaeal ether lipids useful in immunoadjuvant preparation (C&S4), and mycolic acids (DBP6, DBP7)  that are potential diagnostic biomarkers.

"9199434","Mass spectrometry (MS) based protein footprinting is a new addition to structural biology tool box. The  sensitivity and speed of MS provide a bridge between low resolution methods, like circular dichroism, and high  resolution methods, like NMR and X-ray crystallography. Footprinting modifies proteins in biologically relevant  environments. The modified peptides can be qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by MS to generate maps  of the solvent accessibility of target proteins. This view of the protein structure at the peptide level is sufficient  to determine protein conformational changes introduced by the functional switch of proteins and can be  investigated without limitations of purity and size. Two approaches are deuterium (hydrogen deuterium  exchange, or HDX) and hydroxyl radical labeling (fast photochemical oxidation of proteins, or FPOP). Both of  them can label more than half of the amino acids in biologically relevant environments. FPOP can monitor  very fast events, down to a microsecond. Phenomena such as fast protein folding, conformational changes,  and aggregation can now be probed. In addition, other radicals that react with specific residues will be  developed. Combining HDX with MS allows much deeper investigation. Titration-based HDX will be exploited  to provide protein-ligand binding affinities. Pulsed HDX will be developed to look at challenging protein  aggregates such as amyloid beta (implicated in Alzheimer's Disease). Both technologies will be pushed to  determine if they can provide information at the amino acid residue level."
"9199426","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Washington University NIGMS Biomedical Resource proposes to continue its 37 years of support for biomedical research through the development of technology based on mass spectrometry (MS). The Resource will pursue this in three areas: 1) The characterization of complex lipids and lipid biosynthesis with a focus on a) pathogenic microorganisms like trypanosomes and mycobacteria and the biosynthetic pathways that offer targets for therapy, b) the characterization of lipid antigens, and c) lipid mediators o fatty acid synthase; 2) The establishment of a biophysics center that offers MS-based tools to probe protein dynamics, protein interactions, protein complex stoichiometry and structure, and membrane proteins using a) hydrogen deuterium exchange MS, b) fast photochemical oxidation of proteins, c) top-down analysis of proteins, and d) crosslinking methods for complexes; and 3) the extension of high energy collisional activation methods for the study of complex lipids and large peptides, especially those predicted from genomic data. This technology development will be driven by nearly three dozen collaborative efforts that are broad in scientific and geographic scope and focused on the study of human health and disease. The technology will be made available to other collaborators through our extensive dissemination and training efforts."
"9199421","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research is to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying pulmonary disorders, thereby identifying potential therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of lung diseases. In this proposal, we will study how the Miz1-C/EBP? pathway regulates inflammation and acute lung injury (ALI). Using multifaceted approaches, we have recently uncovered that the transcription factor Miz1 inhibited TNF? or LPS-induced inflammatory response and expression of C/EBP?, which contributes to persistent inflammation, in a transcription-dependent manner in lung epithelial cells. Interestingly, Miz1 is phosphorylated upon TNF? stimulation. More importantly, the loss of Miz1 transcriptional repression activity augmented inflammation and ALI induced by LPS (bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a principal surface component of Gram-negative bacteria) in mice. We hypothesize that upon TNF? (or LPS) stimulation, Miz1 is phosphorylated leading to repression of C/EBP? expression, thereby preventing inflammation and ALI. This proposal is novel, as it will study how Miz1 inhibits TNF? or LPS-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines, and how the Miz1-C/EBP? pathway is regulated by inflammatory stimuli such as TNF? or LPS, and the pathophysiological role of the Miz1-C/EBP? pathway in inflammation and ALI in mice. This study will put forward a novel paradigm regarding the molecular mechanism that controls persistent inflammation and acute lung injury, which has significant clinical implications in pneumonia and chronic pulmonary obstructive diseases (CPOD). The completion of this study should provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying respiratory diseases."
"9204847","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The K23 Award will support rigorous training for the development of a career as an independent translational investigator with a focus on the genetics of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and its progression. The principle investigator has completed a fellowship in cardiology and advanced imaging at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIMDC) and a fellowship in echocardiography at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The candidate has gained expertise in linkage analysis studies and phenotypic-genotypic correlations. As a staff cardiologist at BIDMC, she is now seeking new skills in genetic epidemiology and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). She will have access to a state-of-the-art genotyping facility (FHS), and echocardiography laboratories (BIDMC and FHS). Her multidisciplinary mentoring team includes experts in GWAS (Dr Ramachandran), and valvular disease/echocardiography (Drs Manning and Levine). A Master of Public Health in Clinical Effectiveness (Harvard School of Public Health) will provide the coursework necessary for her academic success. Although MVP is the most common cause of isolated mitral regurgitation (MR) requiring surgical repair, little is known about the genetic determinants of MVP and its progression. To date, 3 loci for autosomal dominant MVP have been described on chromosomes 11, 16 and 13, but gene finding has proved elusive. In addition, while the prevalence of MVP in the community is 2-5%, the prevalence of familial MVP is unknown. In the chromosome 13 family, previously non-diagnostic morphologies often represent early stages of expression in gene carriers and share two salient features with fully diagnostic MVP: an anteriorly displaced coaptation point and posterior leaflet asymmetry. This proposal tests the hypotheses that early stages of MVP exist and can progress in the FHS community, and that MVP heritability is high. In addition, several MVP loci can be identified through a multicenter GWAS. To test these hypotheses, the candidate will: 1) Measure mitral leaflet coaptation height, displacement, thickness, and degree of MR by echocardiography in the FHS Offspring Cohort and in a hospital-based sample (BIDMC) at baseline and at available follow-up of 11-17 (FHS) and 5 years (BIDMC). 2) Evaluate the presence of MVP in Gen 3 individuals whose parents in the Offspring Cohort have MVP. High MVP heritability would lead to specific gene-finding strategies such as whole-exome analysis and clarify if routine screening of family members in the community is warranted. 3) Search for MVP loci using GWAS both in FHS and in other US and European cohorts (> 2500 MVP subjects) (Leducq MITRAL Network). These aims represent crucial steps towards future gene-finding strategies and understanding of the variability of progression and clinical outcomes among MVP patients in the community, with the potential of developing therapeutic targets to prevent progression at an early stage."
"9317991","Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the causative agent of Lyme disease, is the most common arthropod-borne infectious agent in the United States and contributes to significant morbidity resulting in extensive health care costs. Bb is transmitted to humans and other mammalian hosts following the bite of infected Ixodes spp. ticks. A number of studies have shown the importance of rpoS as a central regulator of gene expression in Bb that facilitates the adaptation of the spirochetes to vertebrate-host specific conditions. An unanswered question in the field of borreliosis is how rpoS is repressed to facilitate adaptation of Bb to vector-specific conditions. An open reading frame in B. burgdorferi, BB0693, annotated as XylR1 (Xylose utilization Regulator 1), was identified as a DNA - binding protein and bound to up-stream regions of rpoS. Deletion of this regulator in a virulent strain of Bb resulted in de-repression of rpoS and its regulon. Based on additional in vitro and in vivo characterization, BB0693 was designated as Borrelia host-adaptation Regulator (BadR). The central hypothesis is that BadR regulates rpoS to facilitate adaptation of Bb to different hosts. Critical genetic and biochemical tools such as badR deletion mutants and cis-complemented strains restoring a functional copy of badR carrying all the infection-associated plasmids have been generated. The central hypothesis will be tested with two Specific Aims. In specific aim 1, the regulatory mechanisms of BadR will be determined. The working hypothesis is that BadR regulates levels of rpoS and other open reading frames in response to host-specific signals/nutrients. In this aim the following will be determined: 1) the effects of PTS/non-PTS sugars on growth of badR mutants; 2) the regulatory effects of sugars on transcriptional and protein profiles of Bb and 3) the membrane localization of BadR in response to different sugars. Completion of this aim will provide the molecular basis of how BadR regulates gene expression in response to different sugars and its effects on patho-physiology of Bb. In Specific Aim 2 the role of BadR in the vector and mammalian phases of Bb infection will be determined. The working hypothesis is that BadR is essential for the vector and mammalian phases of Bb infection. In this aim the following will be determined: 1) the transcriptional levels of badR and badR-regulated genes in infected Ixodes scapularis ticks; 2) the regulatory effects of badR in artificially fed- ticks and 3) transcriptional levels of badR and its regulon in infected C3H/HeN mice. These studies will help determine the role of BadR in the host-specific adaptation of Bb and for the completion of tick-mouse-tick cycle of B. burgdorferi.   "
"9198566","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac malformations are the most common type of birth defect. Improvements in the management of complex congenital heart disease (CHD) have resulted in >90% of those born with CHD now able to survive into early adulthood. In the U.S. alone, there are more adults with CHD (~1 million individuals) than children. Many of these patients are at risk of ventricular dilatation and dysfunction especially those with a functional single ventricle. Predicting those patients who will develop maladaptive remodeling and when is difficult, but there is a wealth of potentially valuable information available in medical images, especially longitudinal MRI exams. The goal of this project is to identify new early markers of compensatory or maladaptive remodeling in CHD patients with single ventricle physiology using atlas-based MR image-derived parametric models of ventricular shape and biomechanics, and to deploy these models and data via the Cardiac Atlas Project (CAP) database. CAP is a worldwide consortium and online resource for integrating and sharing cardiac imaging examinations, together with parametric model-derived functional analyses and associated clinical information. Our multi-disciplinary team of experts in pediatric cardiology, medical imaging, computational modeling and medical informatics aims to extend this resource to patients with CHD and use the models to identify early geometric and biomechanical predictors of maladaptive remodeling and heart failure.  The project will develop computational modeling tools to facilitate statistical analysis across population groups of regional heart shape and mechanical characteristics. The models and associated ontological schema will also facilitate data fusion between different imaging protocols and modalities. This project will be a collaboration with iDASH (Integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and Sharing), a National Center for Biological Computing at UCSD, and will use and extend the data-sharing infrastructure developed by iDASH.  The specific aims are: (1) To create a database of 60 single ventricle pathologies including some with longitudinal follow-ups. Existing CAP and iDASH infrastructure will be extended to accommodate longitudinal data from CHD patients, to enable insights into the progression of disease and the onset of failure; (2) To identify shape correlates of mechanical dysfunction in single ventricle CHD by developing atlas-based image- derived statistical models of ventricular geometry, wall motion and changes over time; (3) To use the new atlas-based models of CHD to implement computational simulations of cardiac mechanics and fluid structure interactions in these pathologies to derive potential early markers of maladaptive remodeling.  This work will have a significant impact on congenital cardiology by providing non-invasive analyses of regional shape, mechanics and bloodflow. If successful, the requirement for additional invasive procedures, which have increased risk of adverse events, could be substantially reduced. A web-accessible database will also facilitate education and training in cardiology, radiology, physiology and computational biology."
"9234776","Abstract Thiopurines (e.g., mercaptopurine [MP]) are highly effective against hematologic malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma) and autoimmune diseases (inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD]). In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in particular, prolonged daily exposure to MP is indispensable for the cure of this cancer. However, thiopurines have narrow therapeutic indexes with dose-limiting hematopoietic toxicity that causes extensive morbidity, disruption of treatment, and possible mortality. Therefore, there is enormous clinical benefit from preemptively identifying patients at risk of thiopurine toxicity and individualizing therapy to mitigate it. Thiopurine toxicity is also highly influenced by inherited genetic variations, particularly polymorphisms in the TPMT gene as discovered by our group and others. Recently, we reported a novel variant in the NUDT15 gene that lead to its loss of nucleotide diphosphatase activity, excessive levels of active thiopurine metabolite, dramatic increase in MP-induced apoptosis and severe toxicity in patients (J Clin Oncol 2015 and unpublished preliminary results). Because the low activity NUDT15 allele alters the metabolism of thiopurines, we hypothesize that we can rationally reduce thiopurine dose in patients who inherit the NUDT15 variants and tailor their exposure to thiopurine active metabolite TGTP to the level comparable to wildtype patients receiving conventional doses, similar to the principle of TPMT-guided thiopurine dose reduction. To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims to 1) comprehensively identify MP toxicity-related NUDT15 and TPMT ALL (N=1,028), 2) characterize the effects of NUDT15 and characterize how NUDT15 and variants influence thiopurine disposition in children with ALL (N=1,550), TPMT variants  variants in children with on its function, and finally 3) TPMT from which to develop a NUDT15-/TPMT-based pharmacogenetic algorithm for MP dose adjustments. Successful completion of these studies is likely to establish a novel precision medicine paradigm for thiopurine therapy to proactively individualize dose before toxicity occurs. We are confident that this highly translational project will likely have immediate impact on the treatment of ALL, and our findings can be readily extrapolated to thiopurine therapy for non-malignant conditions (e.g., IBD) thus impact a large number of patients."
"9256911","PROJECT SUMMARY The broad, long-term objectives are to understand how heterogeneity within stem cell populations affects disease states and tumor development in the brain. The goal of the proposed project is to investigate how stem/progenitor cells within different regions of the brain can differentially contribute to the formation of brain tumors in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). TSC is a disease of hyperactive mTOR pathway activity, resulting in increased cell size, survival and proliferation. TSC patients may develop either of two tumor types within the within the subventricular zone (SVZ), the largest stem cell niche in the adult and pediatric brain. They can develop small benign asymptomatic tumors, called subependymal nodules (SENS) or develop larger potentially life-threatening tumors, termed subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). Clinically, these tumor types are distinguished by size and location, with SEGAs being larger and restricted to the ventral SVZ. Despite clear prognostic differences, the mechanisms driving location-specific, larger tumor development are not well understood. Recent work has determined that the stem and progenitor cells within the SVZ have a positional identity- their location within the niche can predict the type of progeny they create. This property appears to be intrinsic as the cells retain their potential upon transplantation. This new information presents an intriguing possibility that SEGAS, which are thought to form from SVZ stem/progenitor cells, may reflect the properties of their location of origin. Additionally, the location of a stem/progenitor cell may determine its susceptibility to mutations in TSC1/2. The overarching hypothesis is that cell-intrinsic, region-specific differences in stem/progenitor-cell signaling promote the formation of location-specific tumors in the brain. The specific aims of this project are to (1) determine the intrinsic effects of cell location on neural tumor development in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and (2) dissect the mTOR signaling pathway components that differ between dorsal and ventral neural stem/progenitor cells. To accomplish these aims, we will use a conditional mouse model of TSC in combination with localized Cre activity to test the combination of specific stem/progenitor cell subgroups to larger tumor formation. In tandem with this model, we will use primary stem cell cultures to examine mTOR signaling in wild type and mutant cells using both microscopy and a novel flow- cytometry based approach. To achieve the proposed work, we are incorporating a clinical experience with our collaborator Dr. Kevin Ess, collaboration with a world expert in phospho-specific flow cytometry (Dr. Jonathan Irish) and utilizing our lab?s unique technique of targeting subpopulations within the stem cell niche. The proposed research is highly relevant as it will reveal novel information regarding the origin of TSC brain tumors. Additionally, this work is broadly applicable to many fields as it investigates how stem cells can possess differential basal metabolic programming and potential to signal through growth pathways depending on their location within a stem cell niche."
"9411240","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program is to prepare clinical psychologists, who are trained in university Departments of Psychology, for careers as clinical scientists in a variety of settings, including academic medical centers. Psychologists, who are well versed in psychological theory, experimental methodology, and quantitative skills, and committed to empirical approaches to clinical science, possess talents that are critically important for conducting clinical research. In this era, such research focuses on diverse areas of psychopathology (understood both as clinical syndromes and as transdiagnostic constructs and mechanisms) and requires multiple levels of analysis regardless of the specific phenomenon of interest. Nevertheless, additional preparation is needed to enable psychologists to work effectively with individuals with major psychiatric disorders; to collaborate with members of an interdisciplinary team, many of whom have medical backgrounds; and to compete successfully for independent research funding. In this competing renewal application, we propose to continue and refine the existing program that has become a successful model of an integrated three- year predoctoral and postdoctoral sequence for promising researchers trained initially in clinical psychology. We are requesting support only for the latter two years of the program, that is, six stipends for clinical research training at the postdoctoral level. By recruiting graduate students n clinical psychology with demonstrated scholarly accomplishments prior to the predoctoral internship, we are in a unique position to identify and prepare talented young psychologists for academic careers. The specific aims are to provide trainees with (1) intensive clinical experience (during the internship) in the management of a broad spectrum of patients seen in an academic medical center; (2) a predoctoral and postdoctoral curriculum that enhances conceptual and practical skills in clinical research, including instruction in the responsible conduct of research; and (3) an intensive research apprenticeship (at the postdoctoral level) with an established clinical investigator and mentor. We have a sustained record of recruiting trainees from the best clinical psychology programs in the country and helping them to launch research careers. The program has made a strong showing on outcomes central to the mandate of institutional research training grants: placement of graduates in academic positions, successful pursuit by graduates of independent research projects and support, and sustained academic productivity and recognition. Among the 45 graduates still active in the work force (2 have become medically disabled), 40 (89%) have primary academic positions (39 as faculty members and 1 as a research fellow), 4 (9%) have primary clinical positions (with 3 of these 4 maintaining academic affiliations as adjunct faculty members), and 1 (2%) has a position as a research scientist in a for-profit setting. Among the 40 graduates in primary academic positions, 35 (88%) have had some external research funding."
"9213307","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the mechanisms used by the brain to represent, and compute with, uncertain information marks a fundamental quest in systems neuroscience. Organisms often make decisions based on observations that are inherently uncertain due to noisy sensors and ambiguity in the world. To optimally perform such tasks, it is necessary for the brain to represent and utilize knowledge of sensory uncertainty. Behavioral studies have demonstrated that in certain tasks, humans perform close to optimally, implying that the brain represents and utilize uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis. The theoretical framework of probabilistic population coding (PPC) postulates that the brain encodes sensory information in the pattern of population activity by representing a likelihood function over the stimulus. Although PPCs have been used to construct implementations of several Bayesian computations using neurally plausible operations, there has been no population-level physiological evidence that this is the coding scheme used by the brain.  The proposed project combines electrophysiology (multi-neuronal recordings) and computational neuroscience with the goal to elucidate how the brain represents and computes with sensory uncertainty during visual decision-making. The project will use a simple orientation classification task previously designed in our laboratories. Optimal performance on this task requires the observer to utilize sensory uncertainty on trial-by- trial basis, and human and monkeys have been shown to perform near optimally. In Aim 1, population recordings in primary visual cortex will be combined with behavioral measurements to determine whether sensory uncertainty is encoded in this area, specifically, as likelihood functions in accordance to PPC. In Aim 2, simultaneous recordings from prefrontal cortex will be used to test whether there exists functional correlation between V1 and prefrontal cortex due to shared uncertainty information encoding. Taken together, the proposed work will be the most comprehensive test to date of Bayesian computation in perceptual decision- making, with a particular focus on PPC as the leading encoding framework to be tested. Understanding how the brain implements sensory uncertainty promises to usher in a new generation of neural networks, with possible applications to developing neuroprosthetic devices with improved decoding from cortical populations."
"9228313","ABSTRACT: Hotspots: Understanding Areas of Concentrated Alcohol and Drug Problems at the US-  Mexico Border Millions of Mexican Americans live in the US-Mexico border region, which is both an extremely disadvantaged area and a staging zone for migration to the interior. Thus, the health and substance use patterns of Mexican- origin border residents are of central concern. Nevertheless, despite preliminary evidence of high drug trafficking, drug availability, and substance use problems along the border, very little is known about alcohol and drug problems in this area. Our team recently initiated a large epidemiological study, the US-Mexico Study of Alcohol and Related Conditions, or UMSARC (R01AA018365; PI's Cherpitel and Borges), to address this gap. In addition to being one of only two large-scale epidemiological studies of the border addressing alcohol, UMSARC is the only known such study to survey residents of both the US and Mexico. Data represent 4,796 in-person interviews with a probability sample of Mexican and Mexican-origin individuals interviewed between 2011-2013. Emerging papers based on UMSARC data suggest a heightened risk for alcohol and drug problems, yet substantially lower substance use treatment utilization, at the US border, compared to the interior. Yet, preliminary evidence also suggests dramatic, unexplained variation even among border sites, with alcohol and drug problems being concentrated in a single US hotspot: Laredo, Texas. Preliminary, unpublished analyses also point to Nuevo Laredo, Laredo's sister city, as a hotspot for drug problems. This suggests that the local environment may play a critical role in alcohol and drug outcomes at the border?and perhaps among Latinos generally. A deeper understanding of the role of environmental factors in this apparent concentration of problems in border hotspots would help shed light on core processes in the epidemiology of substance abuse as well as possible points of intervention relevant to Latinos in the border region and more broadly. However, additional research is needed to 1) better characterize and contextualize variation across UMSARC sites in alcohol- and drug-related outcomes; 2) delineate the roles of specific environmental (and other) factors in explaining this variation; and 3) better understand pathways of influence between the US and Mexico, and how US-Mexico interactions may contribute to elevations of problems. The current project proposes to address these gaps. Aim 1 will better characterize the distribution of alcohol use and problems, drug use and problems, and substance use treatment utilization across study sites and relative to regional and national estimates. Aims 2 and 3 will involve geocoding the data to test roles for key neighborhood variables in explaining geographic variation in alcohol- and drug- related outcomes. Aim 4 will directly explore potential pathways of influence between Mexico and the US using existing and geocoded variables. Analyses will leverage a uniquely rich and well-powered dataset to extend the very limited knowledge base on alcohol and drug use and problems at the border, as well as improve understanding of environmental influences on these outcomes among Latino populations. "
"9228312","Abstract: Differential Effects of Alcohol-related Policy across U.S. Population Subgroups It has recently been recognized that not all groups may benefit from broad-based public health interventions. In some cases, disadvantaged groups have benefited less and this has had the unintended consequence of creating or increasing health inequities. Alcohol policy interventions are a vital tool for addressing excessive drinking and alcohol problems in the population but have not often been employed for the purpose of mitigating alcohol-related disparities. To begin to consider how alcohol policy might be used in this way, policymakers first need to know whether and to what extent alcohol policies improve both population health and health equity. This Component aims to address this question by determining which alcohol policies are likely to yield the largest reduction in alcohol-related disparities. Our study will focus on alcohol taxation, availability restrictions and treatment access, three of the most effective and prominent policy approaches for reducing alcohol consumption and problems. We will assess the effects of individual policies on the general population and on subgroups defined by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender and age, and will identify the most and least impactful policies for each group. We will also estimate the effects of hypothetical policy changes on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities, and ascertain the optimal mix of tax and availability policies for mitigating disparities in alcohol consumption, problems and mortality. Our study will draw on policy data from multiple sources, particularly the NIAAA's Alcohol Policy Information System, and will use several national data sets to analyze policy-relevant outcomes. These include individual-level, survey-based alcohol consumption and problems from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and National Alcohol Survey (NAS), and state-level alcohol-related mortality and treatment utilization rates from the National Center for Health Statistics and Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). Analyses will focus on the period from 2000-2015 and involve pooled cross-sectional time-series models with fixed and random effects, difference-in-differences models, and interrupted time-series analyses. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Investigate the impact of beverage- specific taxes on drinking patterns, alcohol-related problems and alcohol-attributable mortality; 2) Examine the effects of alcohol availability policies (government retail control, hours and days of sale, types of sales outlets, and alcohol outlet density) on alcohol use patterns, problems and mortality; 3) Assess the impact of treatment access policies (the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and Affordable Care Act) on the use of specialty and primary care-based alcohol services; and 4) Identify the policies (and policy mix) from Aims 1 and 2 whose hypothetical, nationwide implementation will have the largest impact on reducing alcohol consumption, problems and related mortality in the population, and disparities in these. Study results will help public health decision makers to weigh and prioritize individual policy strategies for improving population health and health equity. "
"9228304","ABSTRACT: Administrative Core  The overall goal of the Administrative Core is to provide scientific leadership and a framework for support services to ensure accomplishment of the research and educational missions of the Center. The Aims of this Core are to provide leadership for the Center in four broad areas: 1) Research; 2) Training; 3) Dissemination; and 4) Collaborations. To achieve these aims, the Administrative Core functions in the planning, evaluation, and oversight of scientific activities, the provision of sound fiscal management and the coordination of research projects, pilot studies, scientific cores, and training. It assures effective clerical, information technology (IT) and library services, fosters collaboration with researchers at national and international levels, promotes career enhancement opportunities provides opportunities and resources for participation in the dissemination and translation of findings. The Core fosters an intellectually lively, multi- disciplinary climate of discovery, one stimulated by enrichment activities from visiting experts who help us keep connected to advances elsewhere. This proposal for the continuation of The Alcohol Research Group's (ARG) National Alcohol Research Center as Epidemiology of alcohol problems: Alcohol-related disparities will involve the transition of leadership from Dr. Thomas K. Greenfield, who has successfully led the Center since 1999, to Dr. William C. Kerr. This transition of leadership, proposed by the Center Management Group, was approved by the Center Advisory Board, the ARG Executive Committee and the Public Health Institute. Dr. Kerr has played an increasing role in management serving on the ARG Executive Committee since 2005, becoming a permanent member as a Senior Scientist in 2008 and serving as Associate Director of the current Center since January, 2014. Principal Investigator and Scientific Director Kerr will be assisted by Dr. Sarah E. Zemore who will be the Associate Director in the new Center with responsibilities for training, in conjunction her roles as Co-PI of the affiliated NIAAA T32 Training Grant and Director of the Pilot Studies Core, including research career mentoring and leadership of the Center's enrichment program. They are joined in the Center Management Group of eight by the Core and Research Project leaders, Drs. Nina Mulia, Jason Bond, Katherine Karriker-Jaffe, and Greenfield, and the two former Center Associate Directors, Drs. Lee Ann Kaskutas and Cheryl Cherpitel. This Center Management Group will ensure that Center components and the ARG's independent grants are well integrated and interact productively, marshalling resources and seizing scientific opportunities where they arise. This group also acts as a steering committee for the Center, meeting monthly to provide regular communications between Cores and Projects, oversight of research quality and monitoring of the timely execution of proposed activities and the achievement of all Aims."
"9228300","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The continuation of the Alcohol Research Group's (ARG) National Alcohol Research Center, Epidemiology of Alcohol Problems: Alcohol-related Disparities, brings increased focus to the NIH's priority area of disparities in health, mental health and social problems. The Center, building on its ground-breaking conceptual and methodological contributions for over 35 years, studies the complex interactions between drinking patterns across the life-course, demographic characteristics, sociocultural and drinking contexts, community and policy factors, and problem outcomes, both in the general population and with attention to specific subgroups. Recognizing ARG scientists' increased focus on and expertise in disparities in alcohol use patterns, problems and health outcomes, and the significant gaps in the knowledge base addressed by this research, we have decided to make this the unifying theme of this Center round and going forward. The Center is organized around five cores: (1) the Administrative Core supporting our basic administrative needs; (2) the National Alcohol Survey (NAS) Resources Core that would allow continued implementation of our NAS, which is a repeated, cross-sectional, national epidemiological survey with large oversamples of Blacks and Latinos and individually-linked geo-referenced area measures, conducted with comparable measurement every 5 years and facilitating disparities analyses focused on race/ethnicity and socioeconomic groups; (3) the Statistics and Data Services (SDS) Core bringing together analytic expertise, experienced data management skills and training for ARG scientists and research staff; (4) the Pilots Core which follows on three, prior successful pilot programs and fosters exciting and innovative disparities-related projects from our most promising junior investigators; and (5) the Dissemination Core which will develop and disseminate alcohol risk and drinking guideline information with special focus on racial/ethnic minority populations, building on ARG research findings as well as incorporating new findings from Center projects. Additionally, we propose four research projects: (6) the Health Disparities project addressing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in alcohol-related injuries, diabetes and heart-related outcomes; (7) the Policy project assessing differential effects of alcohol-related policies on alcohol outcomes and treatment utilization across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups; (8) the US-Mexico Border project involving geographic area comparisons of alcohol and drug use, problems, and treatment among Latino groups in this highly disadvantaged region; and (9) the Neighborhood Methods project developing and utilizing measures of neighborhood effects relevant to racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities across the rural-urban spectrum. These Cores and Projects illustrate a rich diversity of approaches and compelling public health questions, and stand to inform future research in the disparities arena with conceptual, measurement and analytical innovations."
"9228311","ABSTRACT: Health Disparities in Alcohol-related Risks for Injuries, Diabetes, and Cardiovascular  Morbidity and Mortality The focus of this Center Project is on analyses of selected major causes of illness, injury, disability and death where significant racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities are evident in the US and which are substantially alcohol-related. Proposed analyses will extend prior and ongoing research programs led by PI Kerr and Dr. Cherpitel focusing on injuries and unintentional injury and motor vehicle crash subtypes which have high mortality rates in all racial/ethnic groups, particularly for those under age 40, and on diabetes, hypertension and heart problems, which are prevalent and inter-related diseases, conditions and causes of death with large racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. Our goals are to provide the details of recent health disparities in these major alcohol-related causes and to analyze the roles of alcohol use patterns for these health risks to improve understanding of the role of alcohol and the potential for reducing morbidity, mortality and disparities through alcohol policy, prevention efforts and treatment. There has been very limited research on the potential roles of racial and ethnic differences in life-course drinking and alcohol-related problems in health disparities. Data sources are the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the National Alcohol Surveys (NAS) and State-level mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Analyses will primarily focus on Black and Latino groups as compared to a White reference group with NAS analyses also considering socioeconomic disparities and some mortality analyses also considering Asian and Pacific Islander and American Indian and Alaska Native groups. Mortality analyses will focus on major acute and chronic causes with significant racial/ethnic disparities and alcohol involvement: unintentional injuries and the subtype of motor vehicle crashes and cardiovascular-related areas of ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertension and diabetes. The proposed study will evaluate risks for health outcomes among NAS respondents and will detail disparities in mortality rates and model relationships with sub-group drinking patterns from the BRFSS. Key innovations will include attention to life-course alcohol patterns in the NAS addressing the endogeniety of drinking and health and associations between alcohol patterns and other health risk behaviors, attention of beverage- specific associations in the NAS and consideration of state linked alcohol tax-based instrumental variable (IV) methods for causal effects. Alcohol tax measures are new estimates of spirits, wine and beer tax rates developed by PI Kerr that allow for the inclusion of spirits control states and ad valorem taxes in a framework where all tax rates are converted to equivalent wholesale-level beverage volume excise tax rates. This innovation improves the accuracy of tax rates allows the inclusion of 18 spirits control states providing greater variability over the period of analyses, which should significantly improve the performance of the IV models. Results will identify and quantify disparities in alcohol patterns and alcohol pattern risk relationships with morbidity and mortality, testing hypotheses regarding differential risks. "
"9228310","ABSTRACT: Pilot Studies NIAAA's Pilot Studies Core is intended to ?provide the Center with a flexible means to develop and explore new research activities or directions and unique scientific opportunities that have the potential to evolve into independently-funded research projects,? as well as to promote and encourage junior investigators in the field of alcohol research1. The current Pilots Core proposes a program for conducting pilot studies that would meaningfully extend the Center's research methods and agenda as well as directly enable NIH grant applications relevant to our current focus on health disparities. Our program would also address the research and career development needs of our most promising new and early stage investigators. Our application builds on 3 highly successful prior Pilots Cores from Center cycles 1995-2000, 2001-2005, and 2010-15, and this experience undergirds our proposed methods for soliciting and selecting projects and managing studies. We also draw on our experience with our longstanding (35-year) NIAAA T32 alcohol training program, which involves cultivation and oversight of research projects, and career development broadly, for post-doctoral and pre-doctoral trainees. We have identified 5 pilot studies for potential inclusion in the current round, and all are scientifically sound and well-integrated with our Center's overall program of research and focus on health disparities. Nevertheless, they are also highly innovative; multidisciplinary; broad in scope and potential impact; and highly diverse in questions, methods, and populations. We believe that this diversity of approaches and questions is critical to fostering a vibrant and innovative program of research at our Center, and that our Center is the ideal environment for these studies: Our strong grounding in epidemiology, policy, and health services, along with our rich base of disparities researchers (and statistical department), lend important support. This Core will be directed by Dr. Sarah Zemore, who is Co-Director of Training and MPI of the T32 at our Center (with Lee Ann Kaskutas) as well as Associate Director of the Center. Management will be supported by a Pilots Committee, which will include all Center Managers and prior Pilots Core Director Kaskutas. Specific Aims are to 1) requisition, select, and monitor pilot studies that are well-integrated with the Center's program of research; that are consistent with our Center's focus on health disparities; and that have high potential to lead to independent, NIH-funded research grants and high-impact lines of research; 2) promote and encourage junior (new and early stage) investigators in their career development via supporting and guiding their research lines and providing specific career development resources; and 3) continually evaluate the pilot program and refine procedures as necessary."

In addition to continuing support for existing NAS datasets (including the most recent 2014-15 N13), this scientific core will conduct a new National Alcohol Survey (N14) in conjunction with a skilled and tested fieldwork organization. As in past surveys, we will include African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino oversamples and dual-frame (cell phone and landline), list-assisted random-digit dial (RDD) sampling. Innovations include conducting a study comparing RDD response rates and survey estimates with those for a non-probability sample (web panel) and for a web survey sample recruited using address-based probability sampling. We also will include a pilot test with experimental manipulation of the telephone recruitment script to increase participation and completion by racial/ethnic minority respondents. Using results from the Neighborhood Methods Project Sub-Study 3, we will introduce new questions on the neighborhood and community context of alcohol use and its consequences. For the planned household survey, instrument development and piloting begins in 2018 (Year 3) and fielding in 2019, with completion by early 2020. Throughout the proposed period, beginning Year 1, we will prepare NAS datasets (together with the Statistical and Data Services [SDS] Core) for use by investigators in the Center's research projects, affiliated independent grants, and other research projects. Dataset enhancements will include (a) cleaning and (b) weighting data, as well as additional routine methodological tasks to (c) adjust alcohol consumption measures for alcohol content of specific beverages consumed on- and off premise using NAS drink size and beverage type data; (d) provide certain data imputations (e.g., to address missing income data); (e) develop and confirm algorithms (e.g., for calculating mean intake, or volume); (f) create needed scales (e.g., for measuring Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and other constructs); and (g) conduct, with the SDS Core biostatisticians, needed psychometric analyses to provide basic reliability and validity information. For N13 and N14, we also will (h) add geo-referenced contextual data elements drawn from Census and other archival sources. When ready, we will (i) merge new NAS data with the earlier series extending from N6. Finally, per the data-sharing plan, we will (j) de-identify the NAS data and periodically place datasets and supporting documentation in the public domain, by agreement with the Alcohol Epidemiological Data System (AEDS), managed for NIAAA and grantees by CSR, Inc."

"9237852","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Progress in the early detection and treatment of cancer requires accurate model systems to further evaluate new, promising discoveries. Small animal, and in particular mouse, model systems are attractive to researchers for numerous reasons, including their ease of use and well-described platforms. Immunotherapy has revolutionized clinical oncology, but lacks pre-clinical models of the human immune system and human cancer to investigate new modalities and limitations/toxicities of treatment regimens. The ability to grow human tumors in immunodeficient mice (so-called patient-derived xenografts, or PDXs) allows researchers to work directly with human cancer tissue in a controlled setting. However, PDX models are limited by their lack of an intact immune system. The broad objective of this proposal is to validate an in vivo model to evaluate human tumors in the context of a complete and intact human immune system in a completely personalized and autologous fashion. Herein, we propose to: (1) validate the ability to establish humanized mice from patients with melanoma; (2) evaluate tumor growth and lymphocyte development in autologous human melanoma tumors established in humanized mice; and (3) validate the ability of this humanized system to serve as a model for cancer immunotherapy treatment response and toxicity. In each of these areas, we will leverage our multi- institutional team's individual expertise along with our institutional infrastructure to maximize the success of the experimental aims. Furthermore, we will participate in the Oncology Models Forum and utilize the NCIP Hub resources to ensure that the methodology, data, and biologic model systems that result from this project are made widely available to the general research community for future, hypothesis-driven research. Taken together, the studies described in this research proposal will meet multiple goals and address several unmet needs identified in this grant opportunity, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of a fully autologous and immunocompetent precision model system for use in translational oncology research."
"9404642","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How brain activity can lead to complex and ?exible behavioral outputs has fascinated neuroscientists and philosophers alike. There is mounting evidence that complex behaviors result from the activity of a multitude of simpler (sometimes competing) circuits. Yet, our understanding of even the simplest circuits remains spotty, in part because available technology has limited researchers to studying only one or a few aspects of a circuit at a time. We stand at the cusp of a revolution in recording and imaging technology that will ultimately allow us to investigate comprehensively how the fundamental biological building blocks of the human brain are constructed and ?t together. Even now, the limitations mentioned no longer apply to certain less complex, more experimentally approachable brains. These provide attractive stepping stones for understanding our own complex brain. The relatively simple nervous system of the European medicinal leech will be used to develop insights about how the activity of all the cells in a nervous system together produce individual behaviors from overlapping functional networks, a phenomenon that - at a much larger scale and undoubtedly with many complexities added - is also crucial to human brain function. Three types of experiments will be performed: Record the activity of all the neurons in a ganglion - the unit of activity in this animal's brain - using high-resolution voltage-sensitive dye imaging, as it perfors four different behaviors - swimming, crawling, local bending, and shortening. Use electron microscopy to reconstruct the full connectivity pattern - the connectome - of the same ganglion that was imaged. Use electrophysiology to add functional signi?cance to the anatomical connectome. Obtaining a simultaneous activity record of all the individual neurons in a ganglion as it generates several behaviors will be a ?rst. Combining this record with the reconstructed connectome of that very same ganglion will establish a data set with unprecedented potential for advancing our understanding of the link between neuronal connectivity and behavior. A particular focus will be on neurons and synaptic connections that span multiple behavioral circuits, to determine their roles in selecting behaviors. This project will generate huge amounts of data on circuit anatomy and neuronal activity. These data will be made generally available, so that other laboratories can generate and test hypotheses of their own on function and connectivity of leech neural circuits. Many aspects of the dynamics that the leech nervous system uses to select and perform behaviors appear to be similar to the mechanisms used by more complex brains. Accordingly, the value of the hypotheses that we and other users of our data will generate may extend far beyond the leech to distant branches of the taxonomic tree including our own."
"9211355","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Over half of the human genome is comprised of repetitive DNA organized as gene-poor, late replicating, transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Recent studies suggest that there is a widespread opening of chromatin at repeated regions during carcinogenesis and aging. Given the total amount of repetitive DNA and the tendency of sequences in open chromatin to more readily serve as replication origins, these chromatin changes could significantly perturb global genome replication by outcompeting other regions of the genome for limiting replication factors. Indeed, our data from budding yeast suggest that increasing the efficiency of origin firing at repetitive sequences impairs DNA replication across the genome. In this proposal we use Saccharomyces cerevisiae to test our model that nucleosome re-positioning promotes the recruitment of initiation factors to replication origins in repetitive sequences and furthermore, that activation of origins in these repetitive sequences compromises the replication and stability of unique portions of the genome. S. cerevisiae is an excellent system in which to perform these tests: the major repetitive sequence, the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is composed of homogenous tandem repeats (150 copies), each containing a potential origin of replication whose function is sensitive to chromatin context. Moreover, the sequence specificity of yeast origins creates uniform and predictable positioning of replication initiation factors and nucleosomes in their vicinity, greatly facilitating application and interpretation of a deep sequencing method for epigenomic profiling that we have developed. Our results will provide insights into the mechanisms by which chromatin and nucleosome positioning modulate replication origins at repetitive sequences and will shed light on the largely unexplored phenomenon of intra-genomic competition for replication resources as a mechanism that shapes global replication."
"9379437","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this Phase I pediatric oncology clinical trial will be to evaluate the safety and use of 4-demethyl-4-cholesteryloxycarbonylpenclomedine (DM-CHOC-PEN), as anticancer therapy for children with advanced cancer involving the central nervous system (CNS). DM-CHOC-PEN is a polychlorinated pyridine cholesteryloxycarbonate that crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB), accumulates in CNS tumor tissue in humans and has produced objective responses, with acceptable/reversible hepatic toxicities (in patients with prior liver disease) and no evidence of hematological, renal, neuro-toxicities with improved quality of life and overall survival in adult Phase I/II clinical trials - IND - 68,876 (1-6). The FDA supports the proposed Phase I clinical trial designed to identify safety, toxicities and an acceptable MTD in children with CNS cancers, now that the adult Phase I trial has been completed with acceptable toxicity and MTDs identified (2, 3, 5, 6). Primary malignant cancers of the central nervous system (CNS) account for less than 2% of all malignancies, yet brain tumors are the 2nd most common cause of death in children (7). Some childhood malignancies, e.g., intrinsic diffuse pontine gliomas - are located such that surgery is not attempted (8). A critical component in designing an agent that will cross the protective blood brain barrier (BBB) is that the agent must be readily transported intracerebrally, does not produce local irritation/neurotoxicity and is not recycled back into the general circulation. After IV administration DM-CHOC-PEN readily penetrates the BBB, is not a substrate for the transporter protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and has shown anticancer activity in CNS tumors (4). The effective transport of DM-CHOC-PEN into CNS tumors in adults without neurotoxic behavioral alterations and associated events supports the drug's use in children with CNS tumors at an age in which brain development and maturation is still very active with cognitive ability. The observed responses noted in adults with metastatic cancers involving the CNS and cerebellum treated with DM-CHOC-PEN (Table 1) may also occur in medulloblastoma, a primitive cerebellar tumor of neuroectodermal origin, that is the 2nd most common brain tumor in children (7, 9). Thus, the drug's unique properties and lack of toxicities noted in the adult studies merits the Phase I trial proposed here in children. The specific objectives of this Phase I study will be to: 1) Conduct a Phase I clinical trial with DM-CHOC-PEN in children that have advanced cancers  involving the central nervous system to document toxicities, define an acceptable maximum  tolerated dose (MTD), and identify anticancer activity for the drug. All data will be communicated through an e-RAP program. This will be accomplished through IND - 68.876. 2) Studying the pharmacokinetic/dynamic profiles of DM-CHOC-PEN and metabolites in children with advanced cancers involving the central nervous system. 3) Analyze data and prepare a Phase II clinical trial in children for FDA review. Dr. Johannes Wolff, Chief, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH will be the trial site director. Dr. Wolff is an established pediatric neurooncologist and qualified to direct the clinical trial. Consultants are identified in the Design Section."
"9188093","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Core B will be part of a multi-tiered expression analysis core set up to support all four projects of the PPG.  We have been successful in our effort to develop an expression profiling resource at our center. In collaboration with Rick Young at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Aviv Regev at the Broad Institute of Genetics and Genomics, we have developed technologies to undertake multiplex expression profiling using newly acquired Nanostring nCounter technologies. With the support from MIT and the Broad  Institute, our expression Core has the know-how, technologies, resources and analytical skills to support the research projects of this PPG. The Core allows for multiplex expression analysis of up to 500 genes in a single RNA sample using a recently acquired Nanostring nCounter, which saves time and materials.    Furthermore, Nanostring nCounter technology is particularly suited for expression analysis of rare cells present or infiltrating into the CNS. The core has been set up so that expression data obtained from different projects and cell types can be readily analyzed and compared. The major aim of the core is undertake multiplexed gene expression profiling using Nanostring nCounter technologies."
"9188090","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):    T cells that restrain immune responses are essential for maintenance of homeostasis and for preventing autoimmune disease. Such regulatory responses prevent local and, very likely, distal site inflammation induced by the intestinal commensal microbiota. Much attention has been lavished on Foxp3+ Treg cells, but other cell types also have key roles in restraining inflammatory processes. One of the key components is the Tr1 cell that produces IL-10, an essential cytokine in systemic homeostasis. Tri cells differentiate in response to IL-27 and TGF-b, and the transcription factors (TFs) AhR and c-Maf are essential for this process both in vitro and in vivo. In the revised grant application, we will undertake a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional network involved in the differentiation of Tr1 cells in vitro, in vivo in mice, and in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. For the first Specific Aim, we will employ genome-wide ChlP-seq to identify direct targets of Ahr, c-Maf, and other relevant TFs in mouse T cells at different times of polarization towards the Tr1 or control ThO phenotype. The analysis will be performed with CD4+ T cells from wild-type and Ahr- and/or c-Maf-deficient mice to determine if there is cooperativity in binding to target sequences. Genome-wide analysis on cells from wt and mutant mice of histone marks (H3K4, H3K27, and H3K36 methylatlon; H3K9/14 acetylation), Polll and p300 binding, and DNA methylatlon will complement the binding of TFs. Genome-wide RNA sequencing will also be performed on polarized cells from wt and mutant mice at multiple time points. The data will be examined using network algorithms (in collaboration with Richard Bonneau, NYU) to identify other key players in the Tr1 differentiation program. For Specific Aim 2, RNA-seq analysis will be performed on Tri cells obtained from mice after diverse stimuli, including oral gavage with polysaccharide-A from Bacteroides fragilis and injection of anti-CD3 mAb. IL-10-GFP reporter mice will be used for sorting the appropriate cells. Genes modulated both in vitro and in vivo will be the focus of further analysis, including shRNA knockdowns to study the effect on Tr1 differentiation. ChlP-seq and RNA-seq will be performed with cells bearing mutations or RNAi knockdowns of key genes, and the perturbation data will be incorporated in the network analysis. The effect of Ahi- ligands, that modulate IL-10 production, on TF binding and histone modifications will be incorporated in the analysis. For Specific Aim 3, we will validate the role of candidate genes using in vivo models for Tr1 cell differentiation and anti-inflammatory function. This will include mouse models of EAE and transfer colitis. Human Tr1 cells will also be generated in vitro and subjected to treatment with Ahr ligands, and RNA-seq analysis will be performed. Genes identified in the network analysis will guide shRNA knockdown experiments to determine effects on human Tri cell differentiation. We anticipate that these comprehensive analyses and validation studies in vivo in mice and in vitro with primary human T cells will identify novel targets for modulation of human immune responses and for therapeutic applications in multiple sclerosis. In addition. Project 2 will act as a transcriptional core (as a part of multi-tiered core) for the PPG, where we will undertake RNA-seq and ChlPseq analysis for other projects of the PPG."
"9188089","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  EAE is induced because of inflammation of central nervous system (CNS) primarily caused by autoreactive CD4+ T cells. It is well documented that myelin-specific T cells, especially TH1 cells and more recently TH17 cells, are important in the initiation of tissue inflammation in EAE. We have demonstrated that IL-27, a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines, directly suppresses the induction of TH17 cells and generates regulatory IL-10-producing type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells. However, the mechanism by which IL-27 mediates inhibition of TH17 cells and promotion of Tr1cells is not well understood. In vivo administration of IL-27 suppresses the development of Th17 cells and EAE. Our preliminary data suggests that IL-27 controls tissue inflammation in EAE by two different but interlinked mechanisms: 1, by inducing the expression of IL-12R?2, and therefore inhibiting the generation of Th17 cells in an IL-12 dependent manner; 2, by enhancing the expression of two transcription factors, AhR and c-Maf, that generate Tr1 cells.    In this project, we will molecularly define the mechanism by which IL-27 regulates tissue inflammation in EAE by studying the following specific aims: 1) Mechanism by which IL-27 inhibits generation of Th17 cells by studying whether induction of IL-12R?2 chain by IL-27 not only suppresses IL-23R expression but also makes Th17 cells highly responsive to IL-12 and make them plastic to produce IFN-y; 2) How IL-27 generates Tr1 cells by studying the role of transcription factors AhR and cMaf and their mutual association in differentiating Tr1 cells. TThese studies will provide a mechanistic basis of how  IL-27 suppresses autoimmunity and tissue inflammation in the CNS."

"9192731","Project Summary The lymphatics are mainly recognized for their fluid transport roles, draining liquid and cells from interstitial spaces and peripheral tissues. Indeed, many years of research have revealed ow the lymphatic vasculature pumps fluid and shuttles immune cells to the draining lymph nodes. In chronic inflammatory conditions, such as airway inflammation, increased growth and expansion of lymphatic vessels, or lymphangiogenesis (LAG), has been thought to accommodate for the increased need lymphocyte trafficking1-8. However, recently our lab and others have found that the lymphatics do more than just shuttle immune cells: they play critical roles in modulating immune responses. Indeed, lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) can take up and present antigen to the adaptive immune system and express costimulatory molecules that can dysfunctionally activate adaptive immune cells9-13. In addition, LAG in tumors has been associated with increased tolerance to tumor antigens as well as metastasis, and acute renal allograft rejection, indicating that LAG also has immunomodulatory ef- fects3,4,14-17. However, what these effects are and whether the lymphatics and LAG contribute to disease per- sistence or resolution is poorly understood. This project seeks to understand these immunological implications in a model system of chronic allergic airway inflammation. We have preliminary data that indicates that the blocking LAG and specifically deleting molecules that allow LEC-immune cell interactions exacerbate the adap- tive immune response. Therefore, my hypothesis is that LECs, particularly in an expanded state, play regulato- ry roles that help shape the adaptive inflammatory response in chronic allergic airway inflammation. To test this hypothesis I will use flow cytometry, histology, qPCR, and protein analysis via ELISA to determine how block- ing LAG alters the immune response in chronic allergic airway inflammation, specifically looking at the effects on regulatory immune cells and the memory response (Aim 1). In addition, I will use fluorescently labeled anti- gens to assess the distribution and uptake of allergens in the lymphatics of the lung and its draining lymph nodes, as well as a novel mouse-model to assess how LEC-immune cell interactions alter the allergic immune response (Aim 2). The results of the proposed project will introduce the role of LECs and LAG in modulating the immune response in chronic allergic airway inflammation. Additionally, this will provide vital knowledge that can inform the development of novel therapies for chronic allergic airway inflammation."
"9392774","SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE (AC)  The integrated approach described in the UNM Center for Native Environmental Health Equity (Native EH  Equity) will for the first time address, across multiple tribes, disparities in social determinants of health, and  tribal cultural and traditional practices with the potential to provide resilience to reduce the effects of  environmental disparities on the health of Native Americans. The Native EH Equity approach, also for the  first time, provides an integrative understanding of the generalizability of risk and resilience factors across  multiple tribes ? Navajo Nation, Crow Nation, and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe (CRST) - to improve both  our understanding of these relationships, and our ability to develop and prioritize evidence-based risk  reduction and prevention strategies. The focus of Native EH Equity will be to develop common data sets  that for the first time will standardize our approach to assessing these variables across multiple tribes.  Achieving these goals requires a strong administrative structure to ensure consistency across all  components of the Center, to ensure parallel data are collected from each of the partner tribes, and that  data are managed in a structure that ensures integration and allows comparative analyses. The  Administrative Core (AC) for Native EH Equity brings decades of experience working with Tribal  communities, leadership, and agencies; of managing and analyzing large and complex datasets; of  oversight of career development programs; of integrative analyses allowing replication of findings with  multiple levels of data; and of successful translation of results to enhance understanding in communities,  among researchers, to federal agencies, and to health care providers. The goal of the Administrative Core  (AC) is to facilitate responsible management, resource allocation, integration and communication within the  team; to foster successful career development for new investigators; to provide and manage pilot funding;  and long-term to develop sustainable partnerships integrated within the institutional and tribal structures to  ensure sustainability of research on Native Environmental Health Equity."
"9392753","Project Summary The nervous system is precisely wired, and this precision underlies the structure of the neural circuits, and their function. In the central nervous system of vertebrates, and in neuropils of invertebrates, unmyelinated axons are organized into fascicles (or bundles) that form en passant (along the length of the axon) synapses with conjoining axons. The organization of the fascicle limits the contact sites that a given axon makes with potential postsynaptic partners, thereby restricting the position and identity of en passant synapses between neurons. How fascicles are organized in vivo to result in precisely organized neuropils and circuits is a fundamental question in developmental neuroscience. Key fasciculation proteins such as FasII/N-CAM and Cadherin have been identified, but the specific mechanisms that regulate and instruct fascicle formation are unclear. Furthermore, it is unclear how fascicle organization results in accurately formed neuronal circuits and neuropils. This gap remains in part because it has been challenging to examine the dynamic development and organization of fascicles in vivo at single neuron resolution. In this proposal, I will address this knowledge gap by studying the development of the Caenorhabditis elegans nerve ring (the nematode brain). The nerve ring is a neuropil consisting of 185 fasciculating neurons that are precisely positioned during embryonic development. To image the development of the nerve ring we custom-designed a light-sheet microscope capable of continuously imaging the entire 8-hour development of the C. elegans nerve ring at sub-cellular resolution. Combing the genetic and cell biological tools available in C. elegans with our enabling light-sheet microscope, I will identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that organize fascicle development in vivo to specify the precise formation of neuronal circuits. Neurodevelopmental genes formerly identified in C. elegans are conserved across evolution. Therefore, I foresee that this work will reveal conserved mechanisms of fascicle development in metazoans that could be biomedically relevant for understanding the underpinnings of neurodevelopmental diseases."
"9389737","Project Summary Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes epidemics of rheumatologic disease. In the last decade, CHIKV has reemerged to cause outbreaks of unprecedented scale in islands of the Indian Ocean, India, South East Asia, and Europe. In 2013, CHIKV reached the Western Hemisphere, where it is responsible for an ongoing outbreak in the Americas that has affected millions. Large populations of the world are at risk for CHIKV outbreaks due to the expansive range of its mosquito vectors. Up to two thirds of individuals infected with CHIKV experience an incapacitating arthralgia that persists for months or years after the initial infection and is linked to persistent infection of musculoskeletal tissue. Vaccines and antiviral agents are not currently available for CHIKV infection, and treatment is limited to managing symptoms with analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Very little is known about the pathogenesis of CHIKV infection, which is a significant impediment to developing novel prevention or treatment. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that facilitate CHIKV persistence and chronic disease. Addressing this gap has the potential to guide CHIKV vaccine design and provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of acute and chronic CHIKV disease. This proposal takes advantage of attenuated and pathogenic CHIKV strains that differ in their ability to establish persistence in musculoskeletal tissue of infected mice. The central hypothesis is that efficient T follicular helper (TFH) cell responses contribute to clearance of the acute CHIKV strain 181/25 and that impairment of TFH cell responses promotes persistence of the pathogenic CHIKV strain AF15561 in an otherwise immunocompetent host. Guided by substantial preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) To define TFH and germinal center (GC) B cell differentiation during acute and chronic CHIKV infection, 2) Determine whether the function of TFH cells is altered during pathogenic CHIKV infection, and 3) Define the requirement for TFH cells in CHIKV clearance. Under the first aim, the magnitude of the TFH, T follicular regulatory (TFR; a specialized follicular T cell population that regulates TFH cell functions), and GC B cell response during acute and chronic CHIKV infection will be measured by flow cytometry analysis of endogenous cells and transferred TCR transgenic T cells. Under the second aim, the quality of the TFH and GC B cell response during acute and chronic CHIKV infection will be measured by response to immunizations, molecular analysis of isolated TFH and TFR cells, and in vitro TFH stimulation assays. In the final aim, mice that lack TFH cells will be infected to determine whether the absence of TFH cells converts an acutely cleared CHIKV strain to a chronic infection. The proposed research is significant because it will provide new insight into the immunologic mechanisms that facilitate persistence of CHIKV in musculoskeletal tissue. Ultimately, this knowledge will provide an important foundation for the development of vaccines and novel therapeutics that may improve the prevention and treatment of CHIKV infection."
"9206519","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) the goal of this project is to map distinct respiratory functions onto brainstem noradrenergic neurons. Several respiratory pathophysiologies including SIDS, Rett syndrome, and CCHS feature both disordered breathing and are associated with brainstem noradrenergic system abnormalities and, noradrenergic signaling appears to be important in obstructive sleep apnea. In multiple model systems, the central NA system has been shown to be involved in respiratory control. However, prior experimental techniques, including lesions, gene knockouts, and pharmacological manipulations have been hampered by the imprecision inherent in these techniques. To clearly delineate and access NA subtypes, we are using intersectional genetics to subdivide NA neurons by rhombomere of origin. We hypothesize that the early developmental gene expression programs intrinsic to each rhombomere underlie the organization of the NA system into distinct functional modules with in the central respiratory network. Within each NA rhombomeric subset, we will use new mouse intersectional genetic tools to anatomically, functionally, and molecularly map circuit organization. We propose to test our hypothesis in three separate Aims. In Aim 1, we will anatomically map NA rhombomeric subtype projections to known brainstem respiratory centers to determine the flow of information from NA neurons. In Aim 2, we will use pharmacogenetic (Dreadd) neuron manipulations in combination with whole body barometric plethysmography to assign distinct respiratory functions to NA subtypes. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that early developmental rhombomeric subdivisions carry into the adult brainstem at the molecular level through molecular profiling. The resulting integrated framework of anatomical, functional, and molecular characterizations across rhombomeric NA subtypes will add clarity to our understanding of central NA neuron organization and its role respiratory disorders. Ultimately, we expect this approach to enable the development of highly targeted diagnostics and therapeutics that are directed to the required sites of action with minimal side effects on the other behavioral and physiological functions served by the NA system."

"9261915","B cells regulate atherosclerosis with adaptive B-2 cells aggravating atherosclerosis and innate B-1 cells attenuating atherosclerosis. B-1 cell production of IgM to oxidation specific epitopes (OSE) on LDL such as MDA-LDL is thought to occur in the bone marrow and spleen and serve to block the inflammatory effects of these modified lipids. However, we and others demonstrated that atheroprotective B-1 cells reside in the outer layer of the vessel wall including perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), a region known to play an important role in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. Preliminary data provide the first evidence for B-1 cell derived IgM production in the PVAT of mice and demonstrates that adipose tissue B-1-derived IgM limits M1 macrophage production of inflammatory cytokines, a potential mechanism whereby PVAT IgM may attenuate atherosclerosis. Preliminary murine data implicates the chemokine receptors (CR) CCR6 and CXCR4 in B-1 cell-mediated IgM production in PVAT and atheroprotection. Consistent with murine findings, we identified B-1 cells and IgM production in coronary artery PVAT of humans. Moreover, utilizing our well phenotyped human cohort at UVA, preliminary data suggests that CXCR4 expression on circulating human B-1 cells positively associates with plasma levels of IgM to MDA-LDL and inversely associates with human coronary artery plaque volume and indices of plaque instability as measured by intravascular ultrasound-virtual histology (IVUS- VH). Accordingly, we hypothesize that specific CR expression on B-1 cells leads to increased numbers of B-1 cells in PVAT and these B-1 cells inhibit inflammatory cytokine production by M1 macrophages and attenuate diet-induced atherosclerosis in an IgM- dependent manner. We further hypothesize that expression of specific CRs on human B- 1 cells is positively associated with plasma IgM to OSE and is inversely associated with coronary artery plaque volume and indices of plaque instability. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that the expression of specific CRs (CXCR4, CCR6 and CXCR5) on B-1 cells promotes their recruitment to the PVAT and enhances local IgM production. Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that CR-mediated B-1 production of IgM in PVAT reduces PVAT and lesional inflammation and diet-induced atherosclerosis. Specific Aim 3: Identify CRs on human circulating CD20+CD27+CD43+ B cells that are inversely associated with plaque burden and plaque instability in humans as measured by IVUS-VH and determine if these unique B-1 subsets spontaneously produce IgM to OSE and are associated with plasma levels."
"9235597","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Obesity is the dominant cause of insulin resistance in man and it is the obesity epidemic, which is driving the dramatically increased incidence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Adipocyte dysfunction and chronic low-grade tissue inflammation are major causes of insulin resistance. In our recent work, we have reported that G protein- coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) is the functional receptor for omega-3 fatty acids (?3-FAs) producing robust anti-inflammatory, insulin sensitizing effects, both in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, human genetic variants in the GPR120 gene had been described which predispose subjects to obesity and diabetes. The amount of ?3- FAs which would have to be consumed to sustain chronic agonism of GPR120 is too high to be practical, and, thus, a high affinity, small molecule GPR120 agonist would be of potential clinical benefit. Accordingly, GPR120 is a widely studied drug discovery target within the pharmaceutical industry. Recently, we have identified a high affinity, selective, small molecule GPR120 agonist (compound A; cpdA), which exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages in vitro, and in obese mice in vivo. GPR120 agonist treatment of HFD/obese mice results in anti-inflammatory signaling with improved glucose tolerance, decreased hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin sensitivity and decreased hepatic steatosis. This suggests that GPR120 agonists could emerge as new insulin sensitizing drugs for the treatment of T2D. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) represent current therapeutic agents for treating insulin resistance. However, these agents (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) are also associated with unwanted side effects, such as edema, weight gain, possible risk of heart failure, bone loss, and a possible correlation with certain cancers. While the exact mechanisms of TZD- induced insulin sensitization are not fully understood, these agents operate through PPAR?, and this subject has been extensively reviewed. Thus, both TZDs and GPR120 agonists can improve insulin resistance. Importantly, our recent preliminary data have suggested mechanisms whereby TZDs potentiate the effects of ?3-FAs at the same time that ?3-FAs potentiate the effects of TZDs, leading to a positive reinforcing system. In this project, we will explore the basic cellular mechanisms underlying the molecular interactions between PPAR? and GPR120. This concept also leads us to the novel hypothesis that the combination of PPAR? and GPR120 agonist treatment could produce additive or synergistic effects, leading to a greater degree of insulin sensitization than with either drug alone. Furthermore, combination treatment with a TZD plus a GPR120 agonist could lead to the use of much lower doses of TZDs, preserving the overall insulin sensitizing benefit, while mitigating unwanted side effects."
"9235633","PROJECT SUMMARY Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are regulated by a broad range of stimuli, including chemicals, temperature, mechanical stress and membrane voltage and are directly involved in the perception of sensory modalities such as vision, taste, olfaction, hearing, touch, temperature and pain. TRP channels are implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases and some of them represent important prognostic markers and promising targets for new therapeutic strategies to treat a variety of human cancers. For efficient drug design, we need detailed information about TRP channel structure and function. We plan to study TRP channel structure and function using a combination of different biophysical and biochemical methods. Our specific aims are: 1) establish molecular bases of TRP channel regulation by calcium, 2) determine the molecular mechanism of TRP channel gating, and 3) develop molecular models of TRP cannel inhibition by various organic and inorganic molecules. TRP channels are challenging targets for structure-functional studies because they represent multimeric integral membrane proteins of a large size with typically low expression levels. To achieve our goals, we will use a combination of structural and functional approaches including modern crystallographic techniques, Fluorescence-based Size Exclusion Chromatography (FSEC), calcium imaging, fluorescent spectroscopy and electrophysiology. We will use different crystallization methods and temperatures, screen detergents, lipids and ligands to obtain structures of intact TRP channels in different conformational states. We will then combine the nascent structural information with functional data to discern mechanisms of TRP channel regulation and gating. Achieving our aims will have a significant impact on sensory biology and will result in a new structural/functional model of TRP channel that can serve as a dynamic template for theoretical prediction, in silico fitting and chemical synthesis of new drugs."
"9191508","Project Summary Cu is an essential micronutrient that can also be toxic to biological systems. Mammalian cells therefore need to tightly control Cu homeostasis. The kidney appears particularly effective at regulating Cu because this organ displays some of the smallest magnitude of Cu fluctuations during conditions of Cu excess or Cu limitation. However, recently published work in the Culotta lab has shown that kidney Cu levels can fluctuate during infection and inflammation. Specifically in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis, infection with the fungal pathogen Candida albicans stimulated a drop in kidney Cu and the invading pathogen responded by activating a fungal Cu starvation stress response. Concurrent to this drop in kidney Cu, serum Cu levels rose. In my preliminary studies, I discovered that the cause of this high serum Cu is a strong elevation in serum ceruloplasmin (Cp), an acute phase protein. Ceruloplasmin is a multi-copper oxidase for controlling Fe homeostasis and I observed increases in both Cp protein levels and Cp activity that can account for virtually all the elevated serum Cu. I hypothesize that during C. albicans infection, the demand for high Cu in producing ceruloplasmin triggers a loss in Cu from the kidney, and this drop in Cu is mediated through regulation of kidney Cu uptake or efflux. To investigate this hypothesis I will carry out the following aims. Aim 1: To define the host and fungal Cu responses as a function of infection severity. I will identify the level of infection required to stimulate the host Cu response (elevating serum Cp and decreasing kidney Cu) as well as the fungal Cu response (activate the Cu starvation stress response). Aim 2: To understand the mechanism for kidney Cu loss during infection. I will investigate the mechanism by which kidney Cu decrease occurs: does this involve reduced Cu uptake or enhanced Cu efflux? I will scrutinize both protein levels and localization of the Cu uptake transporter CTR1 and the Cu efflux transporter ATP7A in an effort to answer this question. Aim 3: Determine the signal for Cu loss in the kidney. To determine whether serum Cp is sufficient to induce kidney loss of Cu without fungal infection, I will inject mice with lipopolysaccharide and heat-killed C. ablicans cells, both of which will induce an inflammatory response including Cp induction without infection. Furthermore I will test if the phenomenon of kidney Cu loss occurs in Cp-/- homozygous deletion mice infected with C. albicans. Together these studies will provide insight into the mechanisms by which kidney Cu homeostasis is affected by infection and inflammation."
"9052996","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Globally, women in established relationships remain at risk for unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. In Vietnam, the location of the proposed research, unmet need for contraception is substantial as reflected in the nation's high abortion ratio. Married women account for about one-third of HIV cases in Vietnam, and among this group, most were exposed to the virus through sexual activity with their husband. Despite recent advancements in biomedical interventions for HIV prevention, condoms will remain a crucial component of reproductive health interventions for some time to come. Sustained condom use, however, is notoriously difficult to achieve. A key barrier to the consistent use of condoms is their effect on sexual pleasure. Although sexual pleasure is a primary motivation for engaging in sex and is an integral part of overall sexual health, most programs to improve sexual health operate within a pregnancy and disease-prevention paradigm. A new condom, CSD500, containing an erectogenic drug was developed for use among healthy couples to improve sexual pleasure by increasing penile firmness, size and erection duration. The overall objective of the proposed two-arm randomized trial is to test whether promoting the novel condom CSD500 for improved sexual pleasure results in couples having less unprotected vaginal sex. We will measure the occurrence of unprotected vaginal sex by testing women's vaginal fluid for the presence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an objective, biological marker of recent semen exposure. The project has three specific aims: Aim 1. To evaluate whether CSD500 provided to improve sexual pleasure, as compared to the standard condom, results in less semen exposure among women in an established relationship. Aim 2. To determine whether CSD500 provision increases men and women's reports of sexual pleasure, as measured using a validated scale. Aim 3. To identify correlates of semen exposure, measured by PSA positivity, which could provide insight into subgroups of women who fail to use condoms consistently. To accomplish these aims, we will randomize 500 adult, heterosexual, monogamous couples in Thanh Hoa province, Vietnam to receive either CSD500 for sexual pleasure or the standard condom currently provided only for pregnancy and disease prevention to patients during routine care. We will interview female participants at enrollment and after 2, 4, and 6 months and their male partners at the 6-month visit. We will sample vaginal fluid from female participants at all visits to test for the presence of PSA. The proposed study is  significant because the results could support a transformative approach of promoting condoms for sexual pleasure in order to prevent unintended pregnancy and HIV/STIs."
"9196386","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Results from our studies in Ugandan children with severe malaria suggest children with severe malaria other than cerebral malaria may have cognitive sequelae and that the functional areas, degree, and pathogenesis of cognitive impairment may differ by type of severe malaria. African countries plan to switch from quinine to artesunate for treatment of severe malaria because lower mortality has been documented with artesunate treatment. However, the effects of artesunate on neurodevelopment in children with severe malaria are unknown, as quinine has been used in all studies of neurodevelopment in severe malaria to date. Artesunate has effects that may be neuroprotective (e.g., more rapid parasite clearance, fewer seizures, less hypoglycemia than quinine), but high-dose artesunate has been associated with neurotoxicity in some animal studies. We propose to study the pathogenesis of developmental sequelae in the five most common types of severe malaria, in children treated with artesunate. The study's central hypothesis is that different types of severe malaria affect distinct pathogenic pathways leading to specific functional areas and levels of impairment. Our study has two primary aims. Aim 1 is to establish the areas and level of neurodevelopmental function affected by the five major types of severe malaria in children treated with artesunate. To accomplish this aim, we will compare areas and age-adjusted level of neurologic, developmental, and behavioral impairment in children with severe malaria (cerebral malaria [CM], severe malarial anemia [SMA], repeated seizures, respiratory distress, prostration) treated with artesunate versus healthy children, 12 months after enrollment. Level of impairment in children with CM or SMA will be compared between children in the present (artesunate) and in past (quinine) studies. Aim 2 is to identify immunologic, metabolic, and nutritional risk factors associated with neurodevelopmental impairment in children with severe malaria who are treated with artesunate. To accomplish this aim, we will compare the presence/level of risk factors in children with severe malaria to the level of neurologic, developmental, and behavioral deficits 12 months after enrollment. We will assess markers of endovascular and central nervous system inflammation, metabolic changes, and micronutrients that are affected by inflammation and associated with developmental impairment. We predict neurodevelopmental impairment will be present in all forms of severe malaria that level of impairment after artesunate treatment will be lower than after quinine treatment, and that specific immunologic, metabolic, and nutritional factors will be associated with risk of impairment. We expect this study will constitute a significant advance in the understanding of malaria-associated developmental impairment, and will provide a basis for interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental impairment in the millions of children who develop severe malaria every year."
"9196388","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's potential to flexibly engage different functional networks in a rapidly changing environment is crucial both for facilitating a wide variety of behaviors and adaptively reorganizing following damage. This network plasticity can emerge through both changes in the local connectivity strengths within functional networks and the more global network structure of the whole brain. A recent surge of studies has assessed the intrinsic functional connectivity of local networks of brain regions during rest using functionl MRI (fMRI). Quantifying the global properties of this complex brain organization is now possible using graph theoretical tools, in which brain regions are defined as nodes and connections between regions are defined as edges. The broad goal of this proposal is to apply local, network-specific connectivity measurements as well as global, graph theoretical methods to examine the capacity for neuroplasticity under two different contexts: disruption of cortical function (acute and chronic) and specific cognitive task demands. Studies of the effect of brain damage on network organization have focused on the local, network specific effects of damage, generally finding that damage to one portion of a network effects connected but undamaged regions. The consequence of focal damage on global brain organization has primarily been examined with simulated lesion data and it is proposed that brain regions particularly important for integrating information across networks, are most critical to maintaining network integrity. Here we will test this prediction by using resting state fMRI data collected from patients with focal brain lesions and healthy participants following transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We will test the hypothesis that perturbation of intrinsic brain organization results in both local decreases in the affected network and global reconfiguration of brain modules. Moreover, we hypothesize that the roles of nodes within networks that have reconfigured following brain damage is compensatory. Another approach for investigating network reconfiguration is to compare brain organization at rest to that during a cognitive task. Thus, we will also test the hypothesis that, similar to the adaptive reorganization after damage, specific task demands will result in rapid alteration of network organization at both the global and local level. This proposa will further knowledge about brain organization and its potential for plasticity in various context, such as brain damage and the dynamics cognitive demands of daily life. Moreover, we propose that network approaches such as those applied in this proposal can provide empirical data to reconcile strictly localizationalist vs. distributionist accounts of brain function. Relevant to th NIH mission, the neural mechanisms underlying brain plasticity identified in the proposed studies can serve as targets for the development of diagnostic biomarkers as well as cognitive therapy interventions for rehabilitation of patients with brain damage from prevalent neurological disorders such as stroke and traumatic brain injury."
"9272936","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Food insecurity increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. American Indians (AIs) in Oklahoma are three times as likely as Whites to be food-insecure (21% vs. 7%) and have burdens of obesity (42%), hypertension (38%), and diabetes (15%) that exceed those of the general US population. While individual-level obesity prevention efforts have been implemented with AIs, few environmental interventions to reduce food insecurity and improve fruit and vegetable intake have been conducted with tribal communities. Community gardening interventions have been shown to increase vegetable and fruit intake, reduce food insecurity, and lower BMI among children and adults; however, to date, no such interventions have been evaluated with AI families. The proposed study, entitled Food Equity Resource and Sustainability for Health (FRESH), will assess the impact of a tribally-initiated community gardening intervention on vegetable and fruit intake, food insecurity, BMI, and blood pressure in families living on the Osage Nation reservation in Oklahoma. The intervention will take place in the inaugural year of Osage Nation's Bird Creek Farm and Community Gardens, where 120 garden plots will be allocated to participating reservation families. The study is guided by the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) and the Indigenous food sovereignty movement, which seeks to revitalize seasonal growing and gathering practices and reverse the tide of unhealthy eating caused by the historical loss of tribal lands. Aims and Methods: Led by an AI (Choctaw) Investigator, the study will: Aim #1: Characterize the Osage Nation reservation's food environment by using both objective and perceived measures, and then examine the relationships between these measures and intake of vegetables and fruits, food insecurity, BMI, hypertension, and diabetes. Aim #2: Develop a culturally relevant community gardening intervention and conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate its efficacy in increasing vegetable and fruit intake and reducing food insecurity, BMI, and blood pressure among Osage families. Aim #3: Create and disseminate a Web- based multimedia manual and documentary film, and evaluate their effectiveness in increasing tribal readiness and capacity to improve local food environments. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first RCT ever conducted of a community gardening intervention, as well as the first community gardening intervention with AI families. The study will also be one of the first environmental interventions o simultaneously address healthy food production, access, preference, and intake among AIs. Significance and Impact: The community gardening intervention will be developed as part of a larger Osage Nation initiative on food security and food sovereignty and as such, is likely to be sustainable if it proves effective. Research findings and products will be disseminated to AI/AN communities nationwide and will help to identify environmental strategies that will improve tribal food environments and the health and quality of life of AI families."
"9334521","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 150 different types of epithelial cells perform essential vectorial functions required for homeostasis and survival of the organism. A key property underlying these functions is polarity, i.e. the ability of epithelial cells to localize different transporters, channels and hormone receptors to opposite (apical and basolateral) domains of their plasma membrane (PM). The experiments proposed will utilize state of the art molecular, biochemical and microscopic techniques to elucidate molecular sorting mechanisms that regulate the trafficking of molecules essential for epithelial polarity and kidney function/pathobiology. The proposed experiments follow up on our group's recent findings that clathrin plays a broad role of clathrin in basolateral protein sorting and that the ubiquitous (AP-1A) and epithelial-specific (AP-1B) clathrin adaptors carry out complementary basolateral sorting functions in MDCK cells. As we have shown that kidney proximal tubule (KPT) lacks the basolateral sorting adaptor AP-1B, Specific aim 1 will investigate in detail the roles of clathrin adaptors AP-1A, AP-3, AP-4 and GGAs in basolateral sorting in KPT using a domain-selective biotinylation, mass spectroscopy and biochemical and live-imaging trafficking assays. Specific aim 2 will investigate a novel role of clathrin and clathrin adaptors in the apical sorting of Megalin. We have recently described the complete apical recycling pathway of Megalin and our preliminary data suggest that the apical localization of this protein requires clathrin. Specific am 3 will investigate the mechanisms involved in the basolateral sorting of E-cadherin, a fundamental epithelial polarity protein. We will follow up on preliminary data indicating that the basolateral sorting of E-cadherin depends on both AP-1A and AP-1B in the recycling but not in the biosynthetic route, to search for novel TGN and endosomal basolateral sorting mechanisms that depend on sorting signals in the tightly associated protein beta-catenin. Specific aim 4 will characterize the sorting mechanisms of copper transporters A7P7A and ATP7B, highly similar molecules which reside in the TGN in low copper and are released to the PM in low copper. The studies proposed will contribute to a deeper understanding of fundamental epithelial trafficking mechanisms and human (including kidney) diseases associated with malfunction of the molecules under study in this proposal."
"9295467","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal addresses the need to improve candidate vaccines for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), one of the commonest causes of severe bacterial diarrhea worldwide. The disease primarily afflicts children in the poorest regions of the world, contributing to excessive morbidity and mortality associated with diarrheal illness. Vaccines targeting ETEC appear feasible based on protection observed in challenge models and the presumptive development of immunity to natural infection. Traditional vaccine approaches have been unable accommodate the extensive diversity of ETEC pathogens leading to my mentors discovery of novel antigens, involved in ETEC pathogenesis, that compliment traditional approaches. The main objective of this study is to advance the development of novel antigens as key contributors to an effective ETEC vaccine dovetailing with my continued career development. The two novel antigens are EatA, a mucinase degrading intestinal mucins allowing pathogen access to the host and EtpA, which binds to blood group A sugars on the intestinal epithelia. To advance my translational research career and pursue additional experience in human subjects research, I will advance the pre-clinical evaluation of these novel antigens to determine their utility in vaccine design and subsequent efficacy evaluation in future clinical trials. We will assess the conservation of novel ETEC antigens, EtpA and EatA through a variety of means including advanced sequencing and genomics analysis combined with functional analysis. The protection afforded by these antigens may differ based on blood type, impacting the interpretation of vaccine efficacy which will be assessed through retrospective, cross-sectional, and cohort studies. To achieve these aims, I will cultivate an ability to design, implement, and analyze data from human trials. I have assembled collaborators and mentors to aid in the evaluation of stored clinical specimens as well as the design and implementation of new pre-clinical evaluations in human subjects. Specifically, we will analyze the immune responses to EtpA and EatA answering the following questions:  ? Does the conservation of EtpA and EatA across the spectrum of the ETEC pathovar justify their  inclusion in ETEC vaccines?  ? How does blood type alter disease outcomes and immune responses to EtpA+ ETEC infections?  ? What impact does blood type have on the design and evaluation of clinical vaccine trials?  ? What is the best means to evaluate EatA and EtpA immune responses?  ? Are aspects of the immune response correlated with protection from infection and if so, can they  improve the efficiency of future ETEC vaccine studies? Genomics approaches as well as classic molecular studies will assess the conservation of these antigens while a variety of methods will be used to assess the consequences of each of these antigens on disease outcomes and the immune response based on these antigens. The culmination of these studies will provide data driving the rational design of novel ETEC vaccines as well as the rapid means to assess their efficacy."
"9196383","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurons are highly dependent on mitochondrial metabolism, because of high energetic demands and the need to maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis. To provide energy to the extensive neuronal cytoplasm of large projections cells, such as motor neurons, the mitochondrial network has to be adequately maintained and distributed. Dynamic mitochondrial transport, fusion, and fission, ensure that healthy mitochondria are provided at sites of high-energy utilization and calcium buffering. New mitochondria are generated by regulated biogenesis and damaged mitochondria are subjected to quality control (MQC): damaged proteins are removed by proteolytic and proteosomal systems. Irreparably damaged mitochondria are eliminated by mitophagy. The balance between mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial elimination ensures that adequate pools of functional mitochondria are available and that accumulated damaged mitochondria do not release toxic molecules, such as free radicals and pro-apoptotic factors, or excessive amounts of calcium.  Extensive mitochondrial damage in motor neurons has been described in vitro and in vivo in mutant SOD1 models and in other forms of familial and sporadic ALS, raising two fundamental questions: 1) Why in SOD1- ALS MQC is incapable of clearing damaged mitochondria? We found an increase in the ubiquitin-binding adaptor p62 associated with mitochondria, suggesting enhanced mitophagy, but delayed mitochondrial clearance. We also found that Parkin, an ubiquitin ligase involved in both proteosomal degradation of mitochondrial proteins and mitophagy, is decreased. 2) Does the failure to clear of damaged mitochondria play a role in the pathogenesis of SOD1-ALS? This question implies that impaired MCQ may lead to accumulation of damaged mitochondria and play a pathogenic role. The overarching hypothesis of this application is that in ALS motor neurons MQC fails, either because the demand exceeds capabilities or because the MQC is dysfunctional. To test this hypothesis and study the underlying mechanisms we propose two specific aims, each with two sets of studies.  Specific Aim 1 will investigate the causes of MQC impairment in SOD1-ALS. Study 1 will identify which steps of the MQC are impaired in mutant SOD1 neurons in vivo and in vitro. Study 2 will determine if MQC impairment in SOD1 motor neurons is caused by excessive mitochondrial damage.  Specific Aim 2 will assess the effects of Parkin modulation in SOD1-ALS. Study 1 will assess the impact of inducible/conditional genetic deletion of the MQC component Parkin on SOD1-ALS. Study 2 will assess the impact of Parkin genetic overexpression on SOD1-ALS.  The application aims at the mechanistic understanding of a pathogenic pathway that links MQC with mitochondrial dysfunction and motor neuron degeneration in SOD1-ALS. The findings will unveil novel disease mechanisms that could be addressed therapeutically by targeted approaches aimed at modulating mitochondria MQC in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases by pharmacological intervention."

Toward this end, we will:  * Create a Common Disease Consortium (CDC) that brings together a collaborative network of investigators with deep clinical and genetic expertise and >1.1 million well-characterized samples (cases and controls) across diverse populations, including Europeans, African Americans, Hispanics and Asians. The CDC will undertake genetic studies under three major projects related to: (1) Five systemic diseases - early-onset coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, atrial fibrillation, and stroke; (2) Three severe neurological disorders - autism, schizophrenia and epilepsy; and (3) Two countries with special advantages for genetic studies - Finland and Estonia. Through these three projects, the CDC will explore a range of study designs, population-genetic strategies, genetic architectures, and diverse populations.  * Sequence 450,000 samples from the CDC, using the expertise of the Broad Institute's genomics platform to generate high quality data and to drive down sequencing costs.  Analyze the sequence data to elucidate the genetic basis of the diseases, by applying state- of-the-art methods from in our preliminary studies and developing new methods to increase power to detect association. Create, disseminate and share data, tools, and resources, to enable the scientific community to access and analyze genetic studies from the CDC and other sources."
"9212844","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) exhibit phenotypic plasticity that contributes to human vascular disease. Serum response factor (SRF) and the Myocardin family of coactivators (e.g., MRTFA) have emerged as key inducers of the VSMC contractile phenotype. Although much work exists on SRF-MRTFA-dependent gene expression, a critical gap exists with respect to our understanding of signaling pathways that converge upon SRF-MRTFA to negatively affect VSMC gene expression. We and others have proposed p38MAPK signaling as a critical signal transducer of TGF?1-induced VSMC differentiation; however, all studies to date have relied upon the exclusive use of chemical inhibitors of p38MAPK (e.g., SB203580). Since such inhibitors likely have unknown effects un-related to p38MAPK, we performed small interference RNA knockdown studies of p38MAPK? (MAPK14), the major isoform of p38MAPK in VSMC targeted by SB compounds. Rather than inhibiting VSMC gene expression, as predicted by prior studies using SB compounds, we found knockdown of MAPK14 stimulates VSMC contractile gene expression. Using several well-defined vascular injury models, we found total and phosphorylated MAPK14 are enriched in the neointima of the vessel wall where phenotypically altered VSMC reside suggesting MAPK14 expression is somehow linked to the synthetic VSMC phenotype. New, exciting data show VSMC-specific Mapk14 knockout mice exhibit induced VSMC contractile gene expression and are completely resistant to injury-induced neointimal formation. Mechanistically, we have found that MAPK14 regulates MRTFA nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, a critical determinant of SRF-dependent VSMC contractile gene expression. Our most recent finding reveals depletion of MAPK14 up-regulates a novel Smooth muscle and Endothelial cell enriched long Non-Coding RNA (SENCR), that exerts positive effects on the VSMC contractile phenotype. Based on these findings, we have formulated the global hypothesis that MAPK14 antagonizes VSMC contractile phenotype and promotes vascular disease through dysregu- lation of MRTFA nuclear translocation and inhibition of SENCR. Three inter-related specific aims are pro- posed to address this hypothesis using novel mouse models and innovative concepts. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the role of MAPK14 in VSMC phenotypic plasticity leading to vascular disease. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the integrative role of MAPK14 and MRTFA in regulating VSMC differentiation. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the regulation and function of MAPK14-dependent inhibition of SENCR in VSMC. Collectively, these studies will illuminate an important and heretofore unrecognized role for MAPK14 in negatively regulating VSMC differentiation, thus providing fresh insight into the molecular control of VSMC phenotype. These studies also challenge the paradigm of p38MAPK as a pro-VSMC differentiation signaling pathway and will link this pathway to the antagonism of two key downstream targets (MRTFA and SENCR). Information gained through these studies has intriguing therapeutic potential for designing novel strategies to combat vascular diseases."
"9294641","Sensory and motor impairment after spinal cord injury (SCI) is well studied and classified with international standardized assessment tools. Meanwhile, autonomic impairment after SCI, is without a standardized clinical assessment tool/exam, is challenging to treat and causes greater impairment in quality of life than paralysis alone.1,2 One sequela of autonomic injury post SCI is thermal dysregulation. It is well accepted that persons with spinal cord injury have impaired ability to regulate core temperature due to compromised thermoregulatory vasomotor and sudomotor activity.3 In the setting of heat stress, impaired cutaneous vasodilation obviates skin blood flow (SkBF) increases and prevents convective cooling while impaired sweating responses (SR) prevents evaporative cooling. As a result, persons with SCI have difficulty maintaining thermal homeostasis, especially under heat stress. Body cooling intervention trials performed to date have all proven minimally successful likely due to lack of clear mechanistic understanding of autonomic change post-SCI. In non-SCI persons, sympathetic cholinergic mechanisms that mediate efferent control of both SkBF and SR are commonly thought to involve one and the same set of nerves; however, definitive proof is lacking. Indeed, cholinergic vasodilator nerves and cholinergic sudomotor nerves could actually be anatomically separate. Interestingly, it has been reported that during heat stress, persons with complete SCI have skin regions where SkBF increases without concomitant SR increases and other regions where SR increases without concomitant SkBF increases.7,8 These results suggest that efferent cholinergic sympathetic vasomotor nerves and efferent cholinergic sympathetic sudomotor nerves are separate, rather one and the same. Being able to study cholinergic vasodilator nerves and cholinergic sudomotor nerves in isolation in SCI will provide a valuable model for thermoregulatory physiology studies in non-SCI and SCI persons, and guide next steps in development of 1) An effective cooling technique so as to minimize heat related illness during exercise in the SCI population with a high prevalence of cardiometabolic disease and 2) A more quantitative assessement of thermoregulatory and autonomic function post-SCI to determine persons at greatest risk of its sequela. OBJECTIVES - To define and test the neurological control mechanisms of sudomotor and vasomotor activity after SCI to determine if their efferent cholinergic control is through an anatomically separate set of nerves. (1) Map areas of vasomotor and sudomotor activity during heat stress in persons with SCI and compare thermoregulatory level of injury (TLOI) with sensorimotor LOI. (2) Test whether increased noradrenergic vasoconstrictor activity attenuates SkBF increases in regions that show SR increases but no SkBF increases during whole body heat stress. (3) Test the hypothesis that cholinergic presynaptic nerve activity effects vasomotor and/or sudomotor responses in regions with discordant SR and SkBF increases during whole body heat stress. METHODS - 50 persons with chronic SCI and 25 AB persons will undergo passive heat stress and areas of sudomotor and vasomotor activity will be outlined. Pharmacologic tests using bretylium iontophoresis and onabotulinum toxin intradermal injections will be utilized to manipulate areas with concordant and discordant vasomotor and sudomotor activity to determine the neurological control mechanisms in each area. Areas of intact thermoregulatory function will be compared to areas of intact sensory and motor function. IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM CAREER GOALS - Dr. Trbovich's career goals over the next 5 years include expanding her expertise and experience through the proposed research plan, structured training in research skills and mentorship under experienced researchers and clinicians in the field. This opportunity will allow her to develop necessary skills to compete for a VA Merit Review Award in the future. Her long-term goal is to become a VA physician scientist with an independently funded research program that will allow her to significantly contribute to current unanswered questions in the field of autonomic dysfunction after SCI."
"9291272","Project Summary The yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of several medically-important arboviruses, such as Zika, chikungunya, and dengue. The control of mosquito-borne diseases relies on the use of insecticides targeting the nervous system of mosquitoes (e.g., pyrethroids) to reduce their populations. However, the emergence of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes has reduced the efficacy of these control agents. Thus, new insecticides targeting novel molecular and physiological targets are needed to embellish our chemical toolbox for vector control. We have recently discovered a drimane sesquiterpene dialdehyde (cinnamodial, CDIAL) from the bark of an endemic plant of Madagascar (Cinnamosma fragrans; family Canellaceae) that is toxic to adult female and larval Ae. aegypti. Moreover, CDIAL is equally toxic to representative pyrethroid-susceptible (Liverpool) and pyrethroid-resistant (Puerto Rico) strains of Ae. aegypti, suggesting a novel mechanism of action from pyrethroids. The goals of the proposed research are to 1) elucidate the structure-toxicity relationship of CDIAL against Ae. aegypti, and 2) develop natural and synthetic analogs of CDIAL with improved efficacy as mosquitocides. Aim 1 will use leading-edge natural product drug discovery, biotransformation, and medicinal chemistry approaches to develop a library of CDIAL analogs. Aim 2 will evaluate the toxicity of the analogs in larval and adult female Ae. aegypti from pyrethroid-susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant strains. Analogs with improved potency compared to CDIAL will be assessed for potential mammalian/human safety using an in vitro cytotoxicity assay with a normal cell line (African green monkey Vero cells). The results from the two aims will yield a diverse collection of natural compounds and their synthetic derivatives that offer high potential for development into safe, resistance-breaking mosquitocides for controlling the primary vector of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses."
"9237744","Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is one of the most common complications following cardiac surgery. Veterans are not spared from this frequent complication: the incidence of new onset atrial arrhythmias requiring treatment ranges from 30% for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to 64% for patients undergoing a combined CABG and mitral valve replacement. There is also an increased incidence of postoperative stroke, increased length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, and a two fold increase in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation and it is tied to a higher rate of hospital and long-term mortality. There has been essentially no reduction in the incidence or severity of the problem despite many new prophylactic treatments introduced and adhered to in the last twenty years. It is notable that moderate- dose steroid administration at the time of surgery, which directly suppresses systemic inflammation, has consistently demonstrated decreased rates of atrial fibrillation in multiple studies. Unfortunately the side effects of steroids prohibit routine use for this disease. There is a critical need for strategies to mitigate this problem; our long term objective is to develop a treatment for postoperative atrial fibrillation that is effective and can be used in the majority of patients undergoing surgery. Many studies have shown significant changes in the peripheral blood which correlate with POAF. However, the contribution of perturbations in the physiologic area housing the heart (the pericardial space) has been largely ignored. Increased inflammation in the peripheral circulation including correlation with raised white blood cell counts and higher levels of inflammatory markers has consistently demonstrated correlation with POAF after cardiac surgery. Our preliminary data show that the kinetics of increase are similar to the peripheral blood for some cytokines, but markedly different in others. Some of the inflammatory markers in the pericardial fluid (PCF) are at much higher concentrations, by up to ten orders of magnitude or greater. This damage likely contributes to the development of postoperative arrhythmias. Our first aim is to confirm that these high local levels (i.e. pericardial) of specific cytokines and other cellular products contribute to the immense problem of POAF. Aim 1 will allow confirmation that neutrophils, monocytes, and their products contribute to POAF. Furthermore, we will identify the specific factors in the inflammatory pathway(s) that lead to the arrhythmia and compromised cardiac function. Based on preliminary data, our working hypothesis is that inflammatory stress in the pericardial environment, driven by neutrophils and monocytes (which are the two vastly most abundant cell population in the pericardial space at the time the majority of people develop POAF), directly affects atrial electrophysiology, resulting in an increased probability of atrial fibrillation. In addition to delineation of the inflammatory components of PCF which are contributors to POAF, our second aim is to demonstrate that activation of neutrophils and/or monocytes in the pericardial space is a key factor in the arrhythmogenic milieu surrounding the heart after surgery. We will use our canine beating-heart atrial tissue model which allows us to monitor the electrophysiological effect of the addition of activated cells and their products on the super-perfusate (addition to the bath to simulate PCF). We will sue activated neutrophils and then monocytes, and then measure the effect on the ability to incite atrial fibrillation. We will follow this with a highly relevant model of inflammatory cells? product using H2O2 and then with a known cytokine product of neutrophils and monocytes that correlates by multivariable analysis with POAF (which we have identified in our preliminary studies and will confirm with completion of Aim 1). This will allow for delineation of specific steps in the pathway of inflammation which contribute to the development of POAF, and subsequent intervention to ameliorate the disease."
"9210099","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies of human genetic variation over the last decade have revealed that mixture events between highly diverged population groups (archaic admixture), such as between Neandertals and non-Africans, have been a common occurrence and are likely to have had a major impact on human phenotypes. For example, studies have documented its phenotypic impact in analyses of individual loci, such as the MHC locus. However, a lack of adequate analytical tools has hindered a systematic understanding of the phenotypic impact of archaic admixture. This K99/R00 research proposal proposes to develop and validate statistical methods to infer the genetic structure arising from archaic admixture and to leverage this structure to identify genetic variants introduced by archaic admixture that influence phenotypes. Insights from the application of these methods will not only produce a more complete understanding of the genetic factors underlying complex phenotypes, such as common diseases, but will also ensure that currently under-served minority populations, many of whom descend from admixture events or from ancestral groups distinct from those of Europeans, can be studied just as effectively as populations of European descent and can benefit from the discoveries of genomic medicine. The first goal of this proposal is to extend and validate our current statistical model for accurate inference of local ancestry in archaic admixtures. The proposed model attempts to integrate a large number of patterns of genetic variation using the statistical framework of Conditional Random Fields (CRF). An important first example for the application of this model is the inference of Neandertal local ancestry in non-African populations. The inferred Neandertal ancestry will be leveraged for the second goal: to associate Neandertal variants with specific phenotypes. This goal will be pursued by analyzing a custom array designed to capture Neandertal-derived variants and by extending the CRF to infer Neandertal ancestry from SNP genotyping arrays rather than from next-generation sequencing. A complementary approach to study the action of natural selection on Neandertal variants, using a novel diffusion process-based statistical test, will be explored. Finally, the CR will be generalized to handle multiple ancestral populations as well as to the case where no reference genomes are available for the ancestral populations, and will be tested and validated on important examples for each case such as Denisovan admixture into Melanesian populations and sub-Saharan African populations that have evidence of unknown archaic ancestry.

The impact of such uncertainties is amplified in hypofractionated regimens such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), where very high, potent doses are delivered in relatively few fractions. Lung SBRT achieves excellent local control (>80%) but also shows significant collateral toxicity (10 - 28%). Several clinical studies have reported a strong correlation between toxicity and radiation dose. Thoracic anatomy changes continuously in all four dimensions (4D=3D+time) from cycle-to-cycle and day-to- day. A common limitation of current motion management techniques is that they discard large amounts of this 4D information and do not capture nor adequately account for cycle-to-cycle variations. We hypothesize that completely accounting for all four dimensions at each RT step will significantly improve dose-sparing and, consequently, lead to reduced toxicity. In response to PAR-10-169, we form a multidisciplinary academic-industrial collaboration between UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), University of Utah (Utah), University of Maryland (UMD), Varian Medical Systems and VisionRT. Our goal is to create a comprehensive 4DRT motion management solution that achieves e50% dose-sparing of serial structures and 30-50% more sparing of normal lung compared to current clinical lung SBRT. Towards this goal, we present a systematic, hypothesis-driven research plan. In Aim 1, we will investigate a novel binning-free maximum a posteriori (MAP) 4DCT reconstruction. The 4DCT will be parameterized by real-time surface photogrammetry (VisionRT) to create a high-spatiotemporal- resolution 4D motion model that describes the internal volume as a function of external surface over several respiratory cycles. The VisionRT system is installed in the CT-simulation room as well as the treatment room, thus serving as a common link between the CT-sim and the dose delivery stages. In Aim 2, we will investigate 4D optimization to create deliverable treatment plans that account for motion over multiple respiratory cycles. We will also investigate the novel concept of using motion as an additional degree of freedom rather than a constraint. In Aim 3, we will investigate real-time beam adaptation using multileaf collimator (MLC) tracking. This technique will reshape the beam so as to follow all of the complex changes (translation, rotation and deformation) of the tumor and surrounding organs. We will investigate closed-loop RT via a voxel-level dosimetric reconstruction of each delivered fraction; to be used for verification and, f necessary, for daily replanning. Our industrial partners will incorporate our research findings int two research 4DRT prototypes which will be deployed at UTSW and UMD for end-user validation. Validation will be performed using a deformable lung motion phantom and data from lung cancer patients. The latter will consist of 4DCT, and surface tracking data and in-room kV x-ray fluoroscopy. Finally, we will form physician-physicist teams to develop practice guidelines, quality assurance and education frameworks to facilitate clinical translation."
"9376407","PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In contrast to adenocarcinoma, druggable molecular drivers have not been identi?ed in LUSC, and the current targeted agents for lung adenocarcinoma are largely ineffective. Moreover, the most active recently-approved non-speci?c agents (pemetrexed and bevucizumab) have been shown to be either less effective or overly toxic in patients with LUSC and therefore lack FDA approval for these patients. Therapeutically, LUSC is an orphan disease. Gradually, oncogenic alterations have been described in a proportion of LUSC, including SOX2 ampli?cation dysregulation of the KEAP-NFE2L2 pathway, aberrant PI3K pathway activity, FGFR1 ampli?cationand DDR2 mutation. While targeted therapeutics to some of these genes and pathways are in early-phase trials, none is yet clinically-available. Analysis of gene expression datasets from resected tumors has classi?ed histologic LUSC into four mRNA expres- sion subtypes, de?ned as classical (35-40% of LUSC), primitive, secretory and basal . The oncogenic drivers and potential cells of origin of tumors within these subtypes are likely different. However, the practical application of these expression subtypes in clinical care has not been determined. The lineage-speci?c transcription factor SOX2 is elevated in the classical subset. and in many tumor of the other subsets Using our published Sox2 over expression mouse, we have identi?ed Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) as a potential therapeutic target downstream of Sox2. In this application, we propose to continue to develop targeted inhibition of CTGF to treat these patients. Aims include testing the effect of CTGF inhibition op proliferation and apoptosis in both preclinical and human tu- mor models and testing the effect of CTGF inhibition on chemotherapeutic sensitivity in both preclinical and human tumor models. We hope that completion of these aims will contribute further evidence that CTGF inhibition will help human squamous lung cancer patients."
"9397814","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Humans are extremely adept at extracting representations of causal relationships from the world. In addition to identifying causal links by abstract reasoning, there are some physical interactions that humans irresistibly perceive as causal. However, despite the centrality of causal representations in our everyday lives (consider for a moment how many cause-and-effect interactions you have had with your surroundings in the last five minutes), the origins of causal perception are not well understood. There is neither a clear account of how causal perception emerges in infancy, nor how it interacts with developing causal concepts. The field to date has focused on addressing these questions using only one type of causal event, called ?launching?, in which one object collides with another object and ?launches? it, causing it to move. Recent work with adults has identified a categorical distinction in causal perception between these launching events and another type of event called ?triggering?, in which one object contacts another object and ?triggers? autonomous motion, i.e. movement that exceeds the Newtonian constraints imposed by the force of the collision. Exploration of these event categories in infancy will inform our understanding of how causal perception develops and how it interacts with conceptual development in the first year of life. The proposed studies start this research program by addressing two questions: 1) Does the ability to perceive causal relationships in an event emerge with the ability to make enduring attributions of causal roles (agent and patient) across multiple events, or does causal event perception precede these dispositional attributions? 2) Do infants make different enduring inferences about whether objects are dispositionally self-propelled and agentive based on whether they are launched or triggered? These findings will not only provide novel and unique insight into the development of a core human ability and its connection to other developing concepts in the mind, it will provide a foundation for future efforts to quantify how the extraction and manipulation of causal representations are affected in developmental disorders."
"9322694","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We recently demonstrated that delivery of physiological amounts of microRNA-145 (miR-145) completely restored impaired coronary collateral growth (CCG) in a rat model of metabolic syndrome by restoring vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to their normal physiological phenotype (contractile vs. synthetic) in the late stage of CCG. miR-145 is highly enriched in smooth muscle and is expressed at high levels in normal, healthy coronary VSMCs. Its expression is severely decreased in VSMCs of metabolic syndrome animals and humans and correlates with loss of the normal contractile VSMC phenotype. As such this intervention has potentially important implications for clinical re-vascularization therapy. However, to assess the clinical applicability of miR-145-based therapy for induction of CCG, it is essential to understand the mechanisms by which it achieved restoration of CCG. We propose that this single miR delivered to a single cell type (VSMC) had such a profound effect on a complex process of collateral growth, which involves coordinated interactions between multiple cell types, because the miR-145-induced conversion of synthetic VSMCs to contractile VSMCs in turn modulated all key regulatory aspects of CCG including ECM remodeling, endothelial cell (EC) survival and function, inflammatory cell infiltration, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), bioavailability of growth factors vs. growth inhibitors, and nitric oxide (NO). Our data show that VSMC-specific miR-145 delivery converted VSMCs from synthetic to contractile phenotype and normalized (converted to profile seen in normal animals) ECM composition, inflammation, including cytokine, ROS and MMP levels, and endothelial function in the metabolic syndrome animals. In contrast, delivery of the biological inhibitor of miR-145 (antimiR-145) to the normal animals resulted in induction of the synthetic VSMC phenotype, which produced the ECM composition, inflammatory profile, ROS and MMP production, and endothelial dysfunction similar to that observed in JCR rats. Therefore, we hypothesize that restoration of physiological VSMC miR-145 levels in the late stage of CCG in the metabolic syndrome restores CCG by normalizing ECM composition and inflammation and restoring endothelial function. Three specific aims will be addressed: 1) determine whether VSMC-specific miR-145 delivery normalizes ECM remodeling during CCG in the metabolic syndrome, 2) determine whether VSMC-specific miR-145 delivery and normalized ECM remodeling ameliorate excessive inflammation (inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine, ROS and MMP production from these cells) during CCG in the metabolic syndrome, and 3) determine whether VSMC-specific miR-145 delivery and normalized ECM remodeling restore endothelial function during CCG in the metabolic syndrome. These in vivo studies will identify functional physiological responses, which account for miR-145's global effect on CCG recovery, at the cellular level."
"9398521","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a request for continuation of support for a training program in Neurostatistics and Neuroepidemiology launched in 2004 at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH). The grant will be administered through the Department of Biostatistics. It will involve active participation by an accomplished, experienced, and multidisciplinary training faculty, including 10 primary trainers at HSPH and 21 secondary trainers at the affiliated Harvard hospitals. These faculty members have appointments at the Departments of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at HSPH and at Harvard Medical School. The proposed training program aims to serve two pressing needs in neurologic diseases research: the need for well-trained biostatisticians who have an understanding of and commitment to research in neuroscience and neurology and the need for highly trained neurologists who have an understanding of and commitment to utilization of quantitative research methods. To serve these critical needs, this grant proposes to train two pre-doctoral students and one post-doctoral student in biostatistics and one post-doctoral student in epidemiology. The biostatistics trainees will develop methodologic expertise in areas relevant to neurologic diseases research, including survival analysis, longitudinal studies, clinical trials, fMRI analysis, and genetic studies, and substantive expertise in several neurologic diseases and their accompanying measurement and analysis techniques. The epidemiology trainees will be highly qualified MD specialists in neurology (or related field). These trainees will develop expertise in epidemiologic and biostatistical methods, enabling them to pursue successful academic careers in clinical and translational neurologic diseases research. Trainees will spend a minimum of two years in the Program. The Program will capitalize on the strong tradition of training in biostatistical and epidemiologic methods at HSPH and on the rich and varied resources in neurologic diseases research available at Harvard. Trainees will complete coursework in biostatistical and epidemiologic methods and they will actively engage in collaborative research experiences, including many opportunities offered through the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center."
"9231802","PROJECT SUMMARY Obesity increases the risk of kidney cancer. But, paradoxically, clinical studies of kidney cancer patients find that obese patients actually live longer than those with lower body mass index (BMI). This counter-intuitive phenomenon is known as the ?obesity paradox.? One interpretation of the obesity paradox is that excess weight benefits kidney cancer patients; therefore, obese kidney cancer patients should stay heavy to increase survival. However, this interpretation is in direct opposition to national guidelines that advise weight loss for obese cancer patients. Instead, we believe that the obesity paradox could result from inadequate study design and analytic strategies. Specifically, previous studies that compared weight status and survival among kidney cancer patients did not account for (1) disease-related weight loss before diagnosis, (2) kidney cancer risk factors that are stronger predictors of mortality than obesity is, and (3) obesity-related kidney cancer subtypes that may have more favorable prognosis than other subtypes. If any of these biases are present then, ?Association does not equal causation,? and the results from prior research do not address how weight-related interventions could affect RCC survival. No prior study has accounted for these biases when studying the obesity paradox in kidney cancer patients. Fortunately, by using longitudinal data to study kidney cancer patients before they get the disease and special statistical techniques that can account for cancer risk factors that increase mortality, we can estimate how excess weight actually affects kidney cancer survival. Using the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, the Specific Aims are: 1) Among prevalent RCC cases, perform a sensitivity analysis to quantify the degree to which pre-diagnosis weight loss and collider bias could affect the crude association between BMI and 5-year survival, and 2) Among incident RCC cases, use inverse-probability weighting (IPW) to estimate the association between pre-diagnosis BMI and mortality adjusted for collider stratification bias. Resolving the controversy around the RCC ?obesity paradox? requires an explicitly causal framework, appropriate analytic methods, and a rich, longitudinal data set like the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. By combining all of these elements, we will produce results that get to the heart of the RCC paradox and provide the basis for future obesity-related interventions to improve survival for RCC patients. Further, if our analyses demonstrate and eliminate biases in RCC survivorship research, then this project will introduce a new approach that shifts the paradigm of methods used in observational research on cancer survival."
"9262441","ABSTRACT Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer. If discovered early, it is usually cured with surgery; however, treatment options are limited for metastatic melanoma, with a 5-year survival of only 15-20%. Although immunotherapy as a first-line treatment option has improved survival, individual response is uneven, possibly due in part to the quality of protective tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) impacted by treatment intervention. There is critical need to: 1) identify patients with an aggressive phenotype; 2) improve therapies to increase overall survival of such patients; and 3) develop improved monitoring means to discern whether patients are responding to therapy. Here we propose a multi-faceted approach for imaging and therapy of metastatic melanoma, to be tested in mouse models of primary and metastatic disease. There is great interest in targeting very late antigen-4 (VLA-4; also called integrin ?4?1) for cancer imaging and therapy for multiple myeloma and melanoma, where it plays a facilitating role in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis by promoting adhesion and migration of cancer cells. In humans, increased expression of VLA-4 in melanoma correlates with development of metastasis. We previously showed that high-affinity peptidomimetic VLA-4 targeted agents labeled with 68Ga (for Positron Emission Tomography (PET); T1/2 = 68 min) and 177Lu (for radionuclide therapy; T1/2 = 6.7 d) are avidly taken up by B16F10 melanoma tumors in mice. A recently published study showed dramatic efficacy from combining external beam irradiation (XRT) with the combination immunotherapy agents targeting CTLA-4 and PD1/PD-L1 therapy in B16F10 tumor-bearing mice. As XRT is not optimal for treating widely disseminated or micrometastatic disease, we aim to improve upon this important finding by investigating VLA-4 targeted, systemic, radiotherapy with 177Lu-DOTA-PEG4-LLP2A (177Lu-LLP2A), in combination with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We will also develop PET imaging tracers targeting PD-L1 and CD8 to provide real-time, non-invasive monitoring of tumor cells, myeloid- derived cells and T cells in response to therapy. We hypothesize that targeted radiotherapy with 177Lu-LLP2A, combined with dual anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, will be highly effective in treating melanoma tumor-bearing mice, and that imaging of PD-1 and CD8+ T-cells will allow the monitoring of early ?clinical? responses to therapy. To address our hypotheses, we propose the following aims: 1) validate uptake of 68Ga- and 177Lu-labeled LLP2A in a mouse model of melanoma (BP20) where the tumors have the common BRAFV600E mutation, and in human tumors derived from patient melanoma metastases; 2) determine the optimal treatment strategy comparing 177Lu-LLP2A and XRT in combination with dual immunotherapy in B16F10 subcutaneous and disseminated tumors, and in BP20 tumors with the BRAFV600E mutation; and 3) develop and validate anti-mouse PD-L1 minibodies, and anti-mouse CD8 single domain antibody (sdAb) PET imaging agents labeled with 64Cu (T1/2 = 12.7 h) and 68Ga (T1/2 = 68 min), respectively. The combination therapy and PET imaging of early response will be performed. If successful, we will demonstrate that combining targeted radionuclide therapy and immunotherapy can effectively treat advanced-stage melanoma, while simultaneously identifying a panel of PET tracers for non-invasive monitoring of treatment efficacy."

It contributes the critical mass, creating a stimulating and exciting research environment for trainees and for us."
"9303039","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons. FUS and TDP-43 are DNA/RNA binding proteins found to be mutated in both sporadic and familial forms of ALS. To investigate the pathogenesis of ALS caused by FUS/TLS mutations, we established a series of transgenic Drosophila lines that ectopically express human wild type and mutant FUS/TLS. Targeted expression of mutant, but not wild type FUS, in Drosophila eyes causes the formation of ubiquitinated aggregates and an external eye degenerative phenotype. Interestingly, ectopic expression of mutant FUS in motor neurons resulted in larval paralysis, pupal lethality, whereas wild type FUS expression had minimal effect. Mutant FUS localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas wild type FUS localized only to the nucleus, suggesting that the cytoplasmic localization of FUS/TLS is required for toxicity. Furthermore, we found that deletion of the nuclear export signal strongly suppressed toxicity, suggesting that cytoplasmic localization is necessary for neurodegeneration. We found that expression of mutant FUS in the fly muscles leads to held-up wing phenotype, muscle degeneration and mitochondrial degeneration. We also found that mutating RNA binding residues of FUS strongly suppress mutant FUS toxicity in vivo. While doing an unbiased genetic screening, we discovered muscleblind as a novel modifier of mutant FUS toxicity. In our proposed studies, we will determine the role of mitochondrial functions in mediating FUS- related ALS and which functions of mitochondria are disrupted by the ALS causing mutations. We will systematically determine the role of RNA binding ability of FUS in causing ALS pathogenesis. We will also investigate if muscleblind regulates alternative splicing and sub- cellular distribution of FUS and contributes to the onset and progression of FUS-related ALS. Our proposed studies are expected to provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of FUS-related ALS that would help in developing a therapeutic interventions for ALS for which currently no cure available."
"9198195","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atlanta, due to the large size of its HIV epidemic, will serve as the ideal site to recruit HIV-infected and at-risk women who are representative of the Southern epidemic into the Women's Interagency Health Study (WIHS). Inclusion of Atlanta will expand the WIHS research expertise and agenda to include areas for which the Emory faculty are leading experts nationally. The potential of an Emory CRS is evident from the experience and excellent track record in the accrual of hundreds of women into HIV research including the DAIDS supported networks (ACTG, HPTN, HVTN) trials, and from the availability of state-of-the-art research capacity relevant to women's health (colposcopy, DXA and fMRI, carotid intima ultrasound, cardiac CT, local specimen repository, etc.). The size of our HIV clinical activities, which include 7,921 patients (22% women), 950 whom are newly diagnosed and antiretroviral treatment naive, offers a unique opportunity to diversify the WIHS cohort. Through long-standing collaboration between Emory investigators, county health departments, and community based organizations in the state, the Emory WIHS CRS will attract eligible subjects from rural Georgia and from the hard-to-reach communities to better characterize the changing demographics of the epidemic in the South. Innovative approaches guided by principles aligned with community-based participatory research will be employed to recruit, link, and retain women in the WIHS cohort. The overarching focus of the Emory WIHS application is HIV/AIDS secondary prevention for women through immunological, clinical, pharmacological, epidemiological and behavioral research. Our vision is to make major contributions in effective behavioral and clinical interventions, and explore immunologic, epidemiological and pharmacological activities confronting women living with HIV. This vision is operationalized in our multisite research proposal The Emory SWEET Trial, an innovative implementable smartphone intervention designed to enhance antiretroviral adherence, promote harm reduction, reduce STDs incidence, and improve overall clinical and biomedical outcomes among HIV-infected and at-risk women. The site-specific projects engage the expertise of leading scientists at Emory to explore using the local WIHS cohort, the intracellular pharmacokinetics of commonly used antiretroviral drugs in HAART and PrEP, define the dyadic features that impact the lives of women living with HIV through couple voluntary counseling and HIV testing, and examine B cell subsets, PD- 1 expression, and serologic memory in peripheral blood and the female genital tract of HIV-infected women, to better characterize the impact of HIV infection on genital mucosal immunity."
"9225256","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective strategies for conferring immunity against a host of preventable diseases. The World Health Organization estimates that over 2.5 million child deaths are prevented annually worldwide due to vaccination efforts, however, an estimated 24 million children under the age of one are not reached by immunization programs. Infants must receive all recommended vaccinations in a timely manner to be fully protected from deadly infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis and polio. A large body of evidence has shown that children in socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to be vaccinated late, or not at all, compared to their counterparts from wealthier and more educated families, leaving them susceptible to preventable illness. While Tanzania has successfully achieved high national vaccination coverage, substantial regional variation exists and intermittent vaccination campaigns have masked poor rates of vaccination timeliness. In this proposal we seek to evaluate the feasibility and utility of combining two emerging types of interventions - mobile health (mHealth) and conditional cash transfers - to overcome individual barriers to timely vaccinations. Researchers at Duke University's Global Health Institute and Tanzania's National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), in collaboration with Tanzania's Expanded Programme on Immunisations (EPI), will partner to evaluate whether an mHealth-supported scheduling, reminder, and tracking system, combined with an innovative multi-tiered financial incentive scheme for families with young children, is acceptable and effective in improving rates of vaccination coverage and timeliness. The specific aims of the proposal are to (1) conduct formative research to identify locally relevant barriers to timely vaccinations; (2) develop an mHealth system to facilitate and monitor timely vaccinations and conduct surveys with 400 late-stage pregnant women in which contingent valuation methods are used to identify incentive amounts that vary systematically with the value of barriers to timely vaccinations, and (3) assess the efficacy of the intervention consisting of mHealth reminders and multi-tiered conditional cash transfers (CCT) for improving the rates and timeliness of vaccinations among infants in their first 6 months of life. Qualitative follow-up surveys with a subset of women will assess barriers to the acceptability and scalability of this mHealth-CCT intervention. The study will be implemented with support from Tanzania's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. Study results will form the basis for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of mHealth reminders and multi-tiered conditional cash transfers as means of improving timely vaccinations of young children."
"9210658","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated clinically with progressive cognitive decline and dementia and pathologically with axonal injury and the deposition of multiple aggregated proteins. Repetitive mild TBI can trigger chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a unique tauopathy, and single TBI can provoke an Alzheimer's-like neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, the only way to diagnose these posttraumatic neurodegenerations, including CTE, is by post-mortem brain examination. In order to conduct prospective research into the incidence, prevalence, risk factors, clinical course, and ultimately, treatment for posttraumatic neurodegeneration, consensus criteria for diagnosis as well as objective biomarkers for disease must first be established. This initiative will assemble a multicenter team of expert neuroscientists to evaluate the late effects of TBI, including single and repetitive TBI of varying severity, and CTE, using histological examination of postmortem bio specimens and neuroimaging tools as a foundation to develop in vivo diagnostics. As a first aim, this proposal will bring together a team of 5 accomplished neuropathologists in neurodegenerative disease to establish consensus criteria for the post-mortem diagnosis of CTE. This team will also define the stages of CTE pathology, the features that differentiate CTE from other neurodegenerations and the effects of substance abuse, and the characteristics of posttraumatic neurodegeneration after single TBI. As a second aim, this proposal will establish a national bio specimen and data bank for TBI (Understanding Neurological Injury and Traumatic Encephalopathy (UNITE) bio bank) by developing a nationwide brain donor registry and hotline to acquire high quality bio specimens and data. The UNITE bank will use strictly standardized protocols and a web-based interface to ensure that tissue and data are readily available to qualified investigators. Comprehensive retrospective clinical data including clinical symptoms, brain trauma and substance abuse history, and medical records (including common data elements) will be entered into a secure database. Behavioral/ mood dysfunction, cognitive changes, substance abuse and traumatic exposure will be correlated with quantitative assessment of the multifocal tauopathy, Ass deposition and axonal injury. As a third aim, neuroimaging signatures of the neuropathology will be determined in post-mortem tissue using high spatial resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and autoradiography using a highly selective PET ligand for tau. Quantitative assessment of axonal injury, tau, and Ass will be correlated with ex vivo DTI abnormalities and tau ligand autoradiography. Pilot neuroimaging studies of individuals at high risk for the development of CTE will also be conducted in the final 2 years of the proposal. This proposal will determine the clinical and neuroimaging correlates of CTE and posttraumatic neurodegeneration and create the groundwork for establishing their incidence and prevalence. This study will have a tremendous impact on public health of millions of Americans and greatly increase our understanding of the latent effects of brain trauma."
"9206898","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The primary goal of this research is to gain novel insights into how Interleukin (IL)-33 and the IL 33 receptor are involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, an often-debilitating inflammatory disease of the skin that affects over ten million Americans, including Veterans. Cytokines are an important class of inflammatory proteins produced by many cell types including keratinocytes. Interleukin 33 is a cytokine produced by keratinocytes and other cell types and is implicated in atopic dermatitis and another common inflammatory disease of the skin, psoriasis. Unlike most cytokines, IL-33 also has intracellular functions in the nucleus where it may regulate gene expression. This work will evaluate the mechanism(s) by which IL-33 and the IL-33 receptor regulate the atopic dermatitis-like phenotype in Stat6VT transgenic mice, a T cell-dependent mouse model of disease. These studies will also be extended to involve patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Use of T1/ST2 (i.e. the ligand-specific subunit of the IL-33 receptor) knockout mice will help determine if the immunoregulatory effects of IL-33 on the atopic dermatitis-like phenotype in Stat6VT mice are mediated by the IL-33 receptor. Adoptive transfer experiments will be performed to determine if regulatory T cells contribute to immunoregulation of the atopic dermatitis-like phenotype in Stat6VT mice in an IL-33 receptor-dependent manner. Skin-derived CD4+ T cells from patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (and healthy controls) will be isolated to study the impact of IL-33 on effector cytokine production by these cells. The roles of IL-33 and the IL-33 receptor in epidermal barrier function and keratinocyte differentiation will be evaluated using IL-33 and T1/ST2 knockout mice. Similar studies will be performed with using human keratinocytes in which IL-33 and IL-33 receptor expression are modulated using lentiviral systems to force and/or attenuate expression of IL-33 and T1/ST2. In conclusion this project is designed to advance the understanding of how IL-33 and the IL- 33 receptor are involved in atopic dermatitis and extend our studies to psoriasis, two of the most common inflammatory diseases of humans. The ultimate goal of these investigations is to identify novel therapeutic targets to improve treatments of these and other common inflammatory diseases of the skin thereby improving healthcare for Veterans and other patient populations."

"9204312","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer therapy-induced ovarian failure is a significant public health problem with potentially 1% of population being affected over reproductive life span. Our overall goal is to understand and prevent the damage caused by such treatments. In the previous grant period we made significant discoveries which set the tone for the next grant period. We discovered that gonadotoxic chemotherapeutics result in primordial follicle death primarily by causing double strand (DSB) DNA breaks, and in response to this insult, oocytes mount an ATM- mediated DNA DSB repair response (Aging, 2011). This response may enable some primordial follicles to survive chemotherapy. Furthermore, we found that DNA DSB repair response is critical in the way oocytes mitigate genotoxic insult and aging, and that women who are deficient in DNA DSB repair, specifically BRCA1- mutation carriers, maybe prone to prematurely depleting their ovarian reserve (Science Translational Medicine, 2013). In addition, we showed that S1P, a naturally occurring ceramide death-pathway inhibitor, reduces chemotherapy-induced primordial follicle death in human ovarian xenografts (Human Reproduction 2014). Stemming from these revelations and the DNA DSB repair response being the unifying theme, our specific aims for the renewal application are: 1. To determine if BRCA-mutation carriers are more prone to chemotherapy-induced ovarian follicle loss because of their inherent deficiency of DNA DSB repair; 2. To reveal the mechanisms by which some primordial follicles are able to survive chemotherapy insult; 3. To understand how S1P protects human ovarian primordial follicle pool. To achieve these aims we will utilize clinical studies, single cel real time PCR as well as microarray strategies, in situ hybridization, gene interference, coupled with human ovarian xenografting and laser capture approaches.

It takes many weeks for a progenitor cell to become a functional sperm yet it has been estimated that the human testis produces 1000 sperm with each heartbeat or about 37 billion sperm per year. To achieve and sustain this immense level of production, the pool of progenitor cells and the commitment of cells to differentiation must be carefully coordinated and maintained. This proposal addresses fundamental unanswered questions relating to how the commitment of undifferentiated A spermatogonia (SpA) to differentiation, and ultimately to meiosis, is both initiated and maintained. Retinoic acid (RA) is essential for spermatogonial differentiation yet little is known about how it is generated and controlled within the testis. This proposal will test the hypothesis that RA concentrations are tightly regulated by RDH10 in Sertoli cells and degraded by CYP26A1 in germ cells. This proposal will also test the hypothesis that the periodic differentiation of spermatogonia in the juvenile and adult testis is due to the appearance of preleptotene spermatocytes that trigger an increase in RA at different points along the length of the tubule. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether RDH10 in Sertoli cells and CYP26A1 in germ cells are required for the initial differentiation of SpA. This aim will also investigate whether patches of the tubules containing high levels of RA activity colocalize with markers of differentiating spermatogonia and whether the spermatogonial stem cell population tends to reside in areas of the tubule with low levels of RA. Specific Aim 2 will investigate how spermatogonial differentiation occurs in a periodic manner in the juvenile testis by utilizing an innovative technique that allows for the first wave o spermatogenesis to be synchronized. By synchronizing the first wave, we will, for the first time, be able to accurately measure changes in the levels of RA as spermatogonia differentiate to become spermatocytes, investigate whether RDH10 and CYP26A1 are required for cyclic increases in RA concentration, and determine whether the preleptotene spermatocytes can trigger these increases in RA. Specific Aim 3 will investigate whether other members of the retinoid metabolizing and signaling family display cell-specific expression profiles as the spermatogonia differentiate as well as profile global changes in the translatome of these cells. In addition, this aim will identify specific markers of the different types of differentiating spermatogonia, filling a gap in our current understanding of these cell types. Collectively, these data will enhance the current understanding of how spermatogonia differentiate and commit to undergoing meiosis and describe, for the first time, a mechanism for how the asynchronous production of sperm is not only initiated but maintained."
"9253625","ABSTRACT Membrane proteins control the flow of information, nutrients, and signals through the cell membrane, and are the targets for 59% of FDA-approved drugs. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that target membrane proteins can be exceptionally valuable in research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications, but for the vast majority of membrane proteins there are either no MAbs at all or only poor quality antibodies with limited application. The need for high quality MAbs against membrane proteins has been recognized by industry and the NIH, but efforts to identify such MAbs are limited by the difficulty in expressing and purifying membrane proteins in exogenous systems and by conventional MAb isolation strategies that focus on one target at a time. A novel approach to identify membrane protein MAbs in a high-throughput manner is needed to derive MAbs against the entire human membrane proteome. Here we propose a technology that can be used to rapidly isolate high quality MAbs against membrane proteins to fulfill this unmet need."
"9239010","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States, yet there are no current therapeutic treatments to halt disease progression. Airway inflammation and parenchymal destruction are central to the pathogenesis of COPD. Numerous inflammatory cell types have been implicated in COPD but an understanding of how these cell types contribute to lung destruction is lacking. Natural killer cells (NKs), an important component of the innate immune system, are known for their ability to detect and kill stressed, infected, or damaged cells. Our data demonstrate that NKs from the lungs of COPD patients are able to kill more autologous lung epithelial cells than NKs from the lungs of smokers without COPD. Similarly, in a murine cigarette smoke (CS) exposure model, lung NKs from CS-exposed mice are more cytotoxic towards autologous epithelial cells than air-exposed NKs. Therefore understanding the processes that control NK activation could identify therapeutic targets. In order to become activated, NKs undergo a priming phase, typically mediated by dendritic cells (DCs). We propose to use both human tissues and our murine CS- exposure model to demonstrate that mature DCs are necessary for NK priming. We will also investigate the mechanism of killing by focusing on the steps leading to cytotoxicity: adhesion to target cell, polarization of lytic granules, and degranulation. Finally, we will determine whether lung NK production of IL-22, a cytokine capable of inducing epithelial cells to make pro-inflammatory molecules, is also contributing to COPD pathology. To demonstrate the relevance of our findings to COPD, we also propose to study NKs and DCs from human lung tissue. Our goal is to translate results from these murine and human studies into clinically relevant discoveries regarding NK cytotoxicity in COPD pathogenesis."

"9203630","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuregulin-1(NRG) is a growth and survival factor that is critical for cardiac development, as well as cardiac repair after injury. Based on recent i vivo studies, we have made the novel discovery that NRG treatment results in less cardiac fibrosis subsequent to experimentally induced heart attack. Follow-up experiments showed that NRG inhibits the transition of rat primary cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, the cells primariy responsible for the massive collagen deposition that characterizes fibrotic scarring. NRG signaling most likely occurs via binding to the ErbB3 receptor, which is expressed by cardiac fibroblasts. Cardiac fibrosis is thought to be irreversible, and the current dogma regarding myofibroblasts is that these pro- fibrotic cells cannot revert to a fibroblast phenotype, but rathe die or become quiescent. Our finding is highly significant, because the possibility of preventing and/or reversing cardiac fibrosis would greatly contribute to recovery after heart injury. Moreover, NRG-inducible anti-fibrotic signaling has broad implications beyond the heart, including other forms of fibrotic organ dysfunction. This study will address the hypothesis that NRG signaling regulates fibrosis via direct effects on cardiac fibroblasts. This is an especially timely line of questioning, because recombinant NRG is currently being tested in clinical trials of systolic heart dysfunction. The efficacy of NRG as a post-injury treatment in animals and preliminary studies that demonstrate NRG ameliorates the development of cardiac fibrosis secondary to injury has led us to propose the following: Specific Aim 1: To examine the effect of exogenous NRG treatment on cardiac fibroblasts by testing the hypothesis that cardiac fibroblasts respond to NRG treatment by activation of anti-fibrotic signaling pathways. Specific Aim 2: To test the role of NRG signaling in the development of cardiac fibrosis in response to the pro-fibrotic aldosterone/high salt diet (ALDOST) model. Specific Aim 3: To develop a conditional fibroblast-specific ErbB3-knockout (KO) mouse to determine the contribution of ErbB3 signaling in cardiac fibroblasts to post-myocardial infarction (MI) cardiac fibrosis.  In addition to providing new mechanistic insight into the inhibition of the myofibroblast phenotype associated with adverse remodeling and cardiac fibrosis, the proposed project will serve as a springboard from which to launch my career as an independent investigator. My mentor's laboratory is an ideal setting to conduct these studies, and my mentoring committee includes experts in fibrotic cell signaling, cardiac fibrosis, the hypertension rat model and transgenic mouse studies that are proposed in the application. Vanderbilt University is more than adequately equipped to support the proposed research, which will provide the fuel for my own line of investigation that is distinct from my mentor's research that focuses on NRG signaling in cardiomyocytes and stem cell biology. I sincerely thank the reviewers for their time and consideration. (End of Abstract)"
"9405984","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron deficiency (ID) is associated with cardiovascular events such as stroke in children and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in adulthood. However, it is unknown whether ID in infancy contributes to the development of CVD and metabolic syndrome (cardio-metabolic risk). Studies of developmental effects of early ID demonstrate long-term negative effects on cognitive functioning, behavior, and socio-emotional development. Such changes may affect health behaviors that increase cardio-metabolic risk. Early adversity (e.g., poverty, maltreatment) is linked to higher cardio-metabolic risk and might also operate through similar cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional pathways. As ID is more common in low SES and other disadvantaged circumstances, a yet untested hypothesis is that there is a dual burden of having both ID and early adverse experiences that negatively affects functioning and subsequently increases cardio-metabolic risk. The goal of this project is to understand pathways between early ID and adversity and adult cardio-metabolic risk in order to identify targets for prevention and intervention and to detect subgroups at highest risk for disruptions in functioning and cardio-metabolic health. This goal will be accomplished using data from a large longitudinal study (n > 1000) of the effects of ID from infancy to early adulthood (PIs: Betsy Lozoff and Sheila Gahagan). Information on early ID and adversity (SES, life stress, maternal depression, father absence), adolescent cognitive functioning, health behaviors, and mental health, and adult cardio-metabolic risk (BMI, fat mass, blood pressure, blood lipids, hormonal regulators of metabolism) will be utilized. The first aim will test whether there are indirect effects of early ID on adult cardio-metabolic risk through pathways related to adolescent cognitive functioning, health behaviors, and mental health. The second aim will examine whether early adversity affects cardio-metabolic risk through similar or different pathways. The third aim will examine whether the dual burden of ID and adversity further increases cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood through these adolescent pathways. These aims will be accomplished with a training plan emphasizing the neurobiological and behavioral effects of early ID (sponsor Lozoff), childhood influences on cardio-metabolic risk (co-sponsor Gahagan), early adversity (Lozoff and Gahagan), and advanced statistical methods. Completing this research and training will be the first step in the PI's career plan to conduct policy-relevant research on the impact of nutrition and adversity on mental and physical health throughout the lifespan."
"9255332","Project Summary In spite of the prevalence and severity of many neurological disorders, the development of new classes of drugs has been sluggish for decades. The lack of new therapeutics is due, in part, to challenges in replicating the relevant biology in robust, scalable in vitro assays. Synaptic dysfunction, in particular, has been implicated in a number of devastating neurological disorders including epilepsy, Alzheimer?s disease, Parkinson?s disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, depression, ADHD and Huntington?s disease. Current approaches to measuring synaptic function suffer from the difficulty of stimulating the pre-synaptic cell and recording from the post-synaptic cell at a sufficient throughput for drug screening. The Optopatch platform recently developed at Q-State Biosciences, comprised of both engineered optogenetic proteins, custom microscopes, and software, makes it possible to simultaneously stimulate (blue light) and record (red light) electrical activity from around one hundred neurons with one millisecond temporal resolution, single cell spatial resolution and high signal-to-noise. Patterned blue light can be used to stimulate one or a larger subset of neurons while recording from all of the synaptic partners. Using a custom engineered channelrhodopsin for stimulation in combination with red fluorescent sensors of voltage, calcium and pH targeted to pre- and post-synaptic locations, we will develop a set of assays that span synaptic function. Furthermore, we will probe short- and long-term synaptic plasticity using different stimulus regimes. To validate the assays, we will test know pharmacological modulators of synaptic machinery. We will also test for an in vitro phenotype for knockout of a post-synaptic scaffolding protein, SHANK3, whose loss of function has been implicated in ASD and schizophrenia. We will use both mouse and human iPSC-based models of diseased neurons. These optical tools, which can scale to high throughput, have the potential to change the drug screening landscape for neurological disorders. We hope to open a new path to finding treatments for these devastating diseases."
"9210533","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Alcohol abuse by current military personnel and Veterans is a significant health concern. Enlisted personnel returning from deployment are often young enough that brain maturation and refinement processes are still ongoing. Given the escalation of drinking and stress-related risk factors in this population, it is crucial to understand how alcohol affects the brain during this tme period and later on in life. To investigate the neurobiological processes that are affected by alcohol abuse during this critical period of brain development, we replicate the blood alcohol levels seen in humans during alcohol binges by use of a chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) paradigm. Our lab has previously shown that rats exposed to this ethanol paradigm during late stage brain development undergo changes in brain physiology that manifest as impaired learning and memory even into adulthood. Until recently, the field has primarily focused on alcohol's specific effects on neurons and neuronal signaling. Here, we instead propose to elucidate the contributions of the non-neuronal glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia, as  a novel approach to understand the cellular mechanisms that underlie synaptic dysfunction resulting from repeated ethanol exposure. Astrocytes, in particular, play a critical role in synaps formation, neuronal maintenance, and synaptic repair after injury through the release of astrocyte- secreted factors. However, when astrocyte signaling goes awry, the resulting stress placed on neurons contributes to the pathology of disease states, such as epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Using our CIE paradigm in rats, we now have evidence that some of these astrocyte-signaling factors and their receptors involved in synapse formation are chronically upregulated in the hippocampus brain region into adulthood, well after the acute effects of alcohol exposure have subsided. This upregulation corresponds with disruptions in hippocampal synaptic structure and function, highlighted by selective deficits in a spatial memory task. These results suggest that the upregulation in astrocyte-secreted factors may contribute to the observed structural and functional neuronal changes observed after CIE, leading us to hypothesize that changes in astrocyte function during CIE contribute to these observed synaptic deficits. Intriguingly, pharmacologically inhibiting the interaction between one of these secreted factors and its neuronal receptor during the acute response to CIE prevented the upregulation of this receptor at later time points, strengthening our hypothesis that changes in astrocyte function  during CIE are driving the protracted synaptic deficits. Astrocytes and microglia have also been known to initiate and respond to inflammatory signaling cascades induced by excessive alcohol exposure, but here we propose to investigate whether the inflammation is linked to the upregulation of glial signaling factors and the disruption of synaptic structure and function observed after CIE. In summary, this proposed work uses a novel cellular approach to unravel the mechanisms of brain injury and dysfunction that occur after alcohol abuse, implicating astrocytes as potential targets for innovative therapeutic strategies in line with the VA mission."
"9394504","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop innovative statistical methods for causal inference in observational studies that can handle time-varying confounders, censoring by death, and missing data in addition to selection bias, and to answer important clinical questions on management of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) disease. The existing studies on addressing these questions have several limitations including their small to moderate sample sizes and the use of limited clinical data and statistical methods that did not adequately address complicating issues including selection bias commonly encountered in observational studies. This study will use the data from the Emory ALS Registry with several notable strengths including a large sample size of over 1,700 patients with long-term follow-ups and collection of extensive clinical information at each clinic visit since 1997. A a result, the Emory ALS Registry is uniquely suited for answering important clinical questions. The analysis of the ALS Registry presents several challenges including time-varying confounders, censoring by death, and missing data. The existing statistical methods cannot be applied directly to address all these issues. These considerations lead to three specific aims: 1) develop a new propensity score for balancing time-varying covariates in observational studies, the propensity process, and develop statistical methods for estimating causal effects based on the propensity process; 2) develop statistical methods for assessing the survivor average causal effects (SACE) in the presence of missing data in observational studies with time-varying covariates; and 3) perform systematic evaluation of the proposed methods in Aims 1 and 2 through extensive simulations and perform analysis of the Emory ALS Registry data. Progress in all aims will be guided by and evaluated on the Emory ALS Registry, and by extensive simulation studies. The proposed methods will enable us to answer important clinical questions, e.g., assessing the effects of procedures including the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and the non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) on patient outcomes. The proposed methods are general and promise similar benefits to a wide range of observational studies and registries, since similar data structures and analytical issues are often encountered in these types of studies."
"9198252","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines and efficacious therapies, however, many patients do not achieve the full benefit of CVD risk reduction. In particular, complex patients (defined as those patients who do not respond to current disease management approaches) with multiple concurrent chronic conditions represent a key segment of the population that would benefit from new approaches to care. In response to PA-12-024: Behavioral Interventions to Address Multiple Chronic Conditions in Primary Care, which seeks practical interventions...to modify behaviors using a common approach among patients with multiple co-morbidities, we propose to implement and rigorously evaluate an integrated behavioral intervention designed to improve a core set of chronic disease self-management skills and to overcome common barriers to care engagement encountered by this increasingly important segment of the U.S. adult primary care population. This randomized trial will be conducted within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), an integrated care delivery system serving over 3.2 million members, including patients insured through Medicare and state Medicaid programs. We will evaluate our intervention in 3 KPNC primary care practices by enrolling 576 complex patients who have persistently (e 2 years) uncontrolled CVD risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes) despite being enrolled in a CVD disease management program. This behavioral intervention is designed to activate and engage patients, identify potentially hidden barriers to care such as alcohol misuse or sub-clinical depression, and to develop individualized care plans that are designed to catalyze more effective primary care management. Randomization will be at the patient-level, blocked by primary care provider, with the following aims: 1) To examine the impact of (intervention + usual care) vs. (usual care alone) on control of systolic blood pressure [primary outcome], LDL cholesterol, Framingham Risk Score (if no baseline CVD), and HbA1c (if with diabetes) at 12 months; 2) To examine effectiveness of (intervention + usual care) vs. (usual care alone) on proximal outcomes (patient activation, medication adherence, and mental health status) after 3 and 12 months, and 3) To identify baseline patient factors associated with more vs. less successful clinical response among intervention arm patients. By focusing on core health skills and care barriers, this patient-focused intervention seeks to enable complex patients to become more effective agents of their own care and to thereby achieve similar clinical benefits as less complex patients."
"9238065","Project Summary/Abstract  Research indicates that pediatric obesity prevalence is high among all children, but that children from rural areas are disproportionately affected. There are very few interventions specifically targeting pediatric obesity treatment among rural children, a factor that contributes to this health disparity. Previous research from our lab indicates that mHealth is feasible and acceptable for the delivery of pediatric obesity interventions to rural children as this type of intervention lowers child Body Mass Index z score (BMIz) and helps children and families to significantly change their health behaviors. The current application extends this work in a new and innovative direction by moving the mHealth intervention into rural family homes, increasing convenience and dose simultaneously. The intervention is composed of both group and individual family level components, based upon new research that indicates this combination is highly effective. Finally, the composition of the intervention groups is also innovative as they will be composed of children from the same school, making individual level factors as well as factors clustered at the school level addressable in one intervention. The current study proposes to compare the effectiveness of two active interventions: iAmHealthy vs. control (a newsletter control group) using in cluster-randomized design. iAmHealthy is a 32 week behavioral intervention focused on nutrition, behavior and physical activity that engages parents and children in treatment using mHealth technology. It combines family based behavioral groups with individual level child and family support ? all provided directly to homes via mHealth technologies. Children and families meeting inclusion criteria from a total of 18 schools will be randomly assigned by school to condition, with at least 8 families participating at each rural school, for a total of 144 child and 144 adult participants. We hypothesize that: the iAmHealthy intervention will result in significantly greater improvement in food choices than the active control intervention (as indicated by servings of sugar sweetened beverages, number of servings of ?red foods,? and number of servings of fruits and vegetables); the iAmHealthy intervention will result in significantly greater improvement in levels of physical activity than the control intervention (as indicated by change in number of minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity); and, that the iAmHealthy intervention will result in significantly greater improvement in child BMIz and parent BMI than the control intervention. Aim 2 uses the RE-AIM framework to measure the effectiveness of iAmHealthy. iAmHealthy is an easily scalable, widely disseminable pediatric obesity intervention option for rural children and families, if found to be effective; the results of the current study could significantly alter the way we treat pediatric obesity among high risk and underserved rural children."
"9238196","Project Summary The goal of the proposed research is to understand the immunologic mechanisms by which specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules provide resistance to develop autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) by evaluating insulin specific T cell responses, particularly focused on insulin B chain amino acids 9-23 (B:9-23). For many autoimmune disorders, including T1D, specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles confer disease risk as HLA-DQ8 and/or DQ2 are present in approximately 90% of all T1D patients. Strikingly, the polymorphic HLA-DQ6 (DQB*06:02) allele provides dominant protection from T1D. The objective of the proposed studies is to bridge the gap of knowledge regarding MHC class II disease resistance and self- antigen T cell response in T1D. Our long-term goal is to understand how insulin specific T cell responses can be manipulated for preventative and therapeutic purposes, ideally using mutated insulin B:9-23 as antigen specific therapy. The central hypothesis is that the MHC class II genotype shapes autoimmunity to insulin B:9- 23, determining susceptibility or protection from T1D. We plan to test our hypothesis using mutated insulin B:9- 23 peptides to determine T cell phenotypes in the context of MHC class II genotypes in murine and human diabetes. In specific aim 1, we will utilize a spontaneous mouse model of autoimmune diabetes including a model with a single amino acid mutation in the MHC class II beta chain (?57Ser?Asp) implicated in diabetes resistance. Insulin B:9-23 specific T cells restricted to risk and protective MHC class II molecules will be tracked using fluorescent tetramers. Experiments will be done to test the hypothesis that a protective MHC class II molecule leads to the generation of B:9-23 regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress islet autoimmunity; either through converting a pathogenic T cell to become regulatory and/or by differentiating B:9-23 specific Tregs restricted to the protective MHC class II molecule. In the second aim, we will study insulin and insulin B:9-23 specific T cell responses from well-characterized human subjects at risk for developing T1D and subjects without islet autoantibodies in a prospective longitudinal study. We now have the ability to measure both inflammatory and regulatory T cell responses to insulin with mutated B:9-23 peptides from the peripheral blood, which will allow for an increased understanding of disease pathogenesis in preclinical T1D. Further, healthy controls having the protective DQB*06:02 allele will be studied to isolate, characterize and T cell receptor (TCR) sequence B:9-23-specific Tregs, thereby creating reagents to assess the structural interactions of a diabetes resistant trimolecular complex, TCR-B:9-23-DQ6. A B:9-23/DQ6 tetramer will be produced to stain and phenotype ex vivo T cells from DQ6 individuals. The findings from this research are directly applicable to the design of insulin antigen specific therapies, monitoring and timing in the preclinical T1D period to prevent disease onset."
"9196373","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 17 million Americans have sleep apnea and have persistent hypersomnolence. Chronic sleep disruption (CSD) is implicated in residual sleepiness in sleep apnea; yet the mechanisms by which CSD impairs wakefulness are not known. Wakefulness is modulated, in part, by collections of neurons throughout the brain that are activated in wakefulness and quiescent in sleep. We propose that CSD-induced repeated excitation of wake-activated neurons (WAN) across sleep stresses WAN metabolics, and that WAN injury and dysfunction contribute to wake impairments in sleep apnea. Utilizing a mouse model of CSD, we confirmed that CSD impairs wakefulness and arousal responses, and we have discovered that CSD markedly reduces neuronal excitability in locus coeruleus neurons, a representative group of WAN. Mitochondrial sirtuin type 3 (SirT3) plays several crucial roles in protecting metabolic homeostasis. In preliminary studies, we find that CSD imparts oxidative and inflammatory stress on WAN and that SirT3 is progressively lost from WAN across CSD. Loss of SirT3 induces wake impairments and WAN injury. We hypothesize that CSD reductions in SirT3 and augmentations in a pro-inflammatory response determine both WAN injury and lasting wake impairments. The goals of this proposal are to determine the relevance of WAN SirT3 loss in CSD WAN dysfunction and WAN degeneration and to identify the within WAN crosstalk between the CSD inflammatory response. Elucidation of neuronal mitochondrial metabolic dyshomeostasis as an important contributor to impaired wakefulness and WAN degeneration from CSD will extend our fundamental model of sleep/wake control under conditions of CSD and will enable development of molecular targets to improve wakefulness in many sleep disorders, including OSA."
"9242303","The Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) treats more than 26,000 individuals with HIV infection, making it the largest provider of care to HIV-infected individuals in the U.S. Neurological complications occur commonly in HIV infection, with over 40% of individuals being at risk for developing HIV-related neurocognitive impairment (NCI). Therefore, it is likely that a large number of Veterans experience symptoms related to NCI, which overall responds poorly to treatment with antiretroviral drugs. Factors that underlie the development of NCI include neuronal dysfunction due to enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-? and IL-1?) and other inflammatory mediators that are secreted by HIV-infected cells in the brain.  Astrocytes make up the largest percentage of cells in the brain and, when infected by HIV-1, secrete proinflammatory factors that can potentially have significant detrimental effects on the brain. In this proposal we will examine the potential effects of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism and activation of the glycohydrolase CD38, the energy sensing molecule 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-? (PGC1?) and the sirtuin SIRT1 in suppressing nervous system inflammation and other neuropathological abnormalities mediated by infection and activation of astrocytes. For these studies we will utilize two transgenic rat models of HIV-1 infection. One is a well- established model, developed on a wild-type F344 Fischer rat background (the HIV1Tg rat) and the other, developed more recently, is on a on a nude Fisher rat background (the HIV1TgNu+ rat); which provides a model of HIV infection in the presence of severe immunodeficiency.  The studies proposed in this Merit will be performed utilizing F344 and F344 nude (F344Nu+) rat primary astrocytes transfected with a plasmid containing an insert that is identical to transgene that is present in the transgenic rats as well as primary cells from the rats. Studies will be also performed in vivo using the animals. The cells and animals will be treated with activators and inhibitors of NAD, CD38, AMPK and SIRT1 to determine the effects of the agents on inflammatory response and neuropathological abnormalities that can occur. We anticipate that information obtained utilizing these innovative models and approaches will lead to the development of more effective treatments for HIV-related NCI in humans."
"9242270","Vascular dementia (VaD) is often caused by small vessel arteriosclerotic disease, resulting in ischemic damage to white matter and associated neurodegeneration. Autopsy studies indicate that such changes contribute to the roughly one-third of dementia cases attributed to mixed pathology (MxD), with features of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and VaD. MxD is particularly prevalent among older Veterans, who have increased risk factors such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. However, current clinical trials with AD therapeutics frequently exclude patients with MxD. The interactions of vascular and AD pathology remain elusive, in part due to the dearth of animal models that recapitulate MxD symptomology and pathology. Our project addresses this hurdle, establishing a novel rat model of MxD to elucidate mechanisms associated with vascular complications in AD. We examine the impact of promising therapeutics to prevent AD in the MxD model, focusing on amyloid vaccines, to facilitate the development of combination therapies that can minimize adverse effects of vaccine in MxD patients, such as vasogenic edema and microbleeds. Although asymptomatic in patients with pure AD, the impact on AD patients with VaD is unknown. This proposal will assess: a) if VaD exacerbates AD-associated A? and/or tau pathology; b) differences in peripheral and central inflammation in VaD, AD, and MxD relative to cognitive and/or neurodegenerative parameters; c) whether plasma endothelial microparticles differentiate VaD, AD, and MxD; and d) the effects of known modifiers of AD pathology on MxD. This proposal uses an APP/PS1 transgenic rat model of AD, which develops age-related cognitive deficits, A?/tau deposition, and gliosis. In Aim 1, we examine the impact of this FAD transgene in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHR-SP) rats, which exhibits age-related vascular and white matter pathology, neuron loss and progressive cognitive deficits. This MxD model (SHR-FAD) is compared with FAD positive controls and nonTg rats [SHR-SP versus the control strain WKY] for differences in cognition; peripheral and central inflammation, vascular and parenchymal A?, and synaptic loss; and other AD- and VaD- associated pathologies. Plasma and CSF biomarkers corresponding to specific disease pathologies will be identified. Aim 2 investigates interventions that promote amyloid clearance: passive immunization with an anti- A? antibody and curcumin, a pleiotropic A?-binding molecule, to determine their effects on vascular A? deposition and cerebrovascular disease in the SHR-FAD model of MxD. We hypothesize that VaD exacerbates neuroinflammation, synaptic loss and tau accumulation, but reduces neuritic plaques, increasing cerebrovascular amyloid deposition. Increased cerebral penetration of the peripheral anti-A? antibodies and increased plasma levels of cerebrovascular microparticles and cellular adhesion molecules may parallel disruption of the blood brain barrier. Completion of these aims is likely to provide knowledge important for AD trials in patients who also have VaD."
"9238815","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most cancers of the head and neck are squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and the majority affects the oral cavity or pharynx. Tobacco use and alcohol consumption are the major risk factors and together account for approximately two-thirds of the cases. Oral infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important independent risk factor for the development of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC); only 6% of other HNSCC sites are associated with HPV. Incidence of HPV-related OPC is increasing, most notably in the U.S. and Europe. Interestingly, and likely due to differences in etiology and related differences in tumor characteristics, HPV- positive [HPV(+)] tumors have a more favorable outcome than HPV-negative [HPV(-)] tumors. A recent large genome-wide association (GWA) study from this group identified multiple novel susceptibility loci for HNSCC, and in particular a strong role for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region in OPC. Further, recently completed tumor genome profiling efforts have provided important information on the somatic alterations present in HNSCC. However, only limited numbers of HPV(+) tumors were included and these studies have offered little insights into the clinical relevance of the identified alterations due to the limited nature of clinical and outcome data available. To improve understanding of the genetic factors involved in oral cancer (OC) and OPC risk and outcome, we will utilize samples and data from 5 well-annotated study populations to: (Aim 1) complete HPV analysis of 2,028 OPC cases in order to evaluate the relationship between germline variants, and in particular variants in the HLA region, and risk of HPV(+) OPC; (Aim 2) perform whole exome and targeted sequencing on 2,000 representative tumors (1,000 OCs, 1,000 OPCs) to further elucidate the driver mutations and potential therapeutic targets in OC and OPC, and to clarify potential mechanisms associated with lifestyle and infectious exposures for developing both cancers; and (Aim 3) utilize available outcome data on these 2,000 patients to evaluate the role of somatic alterations in OC and OPC in outcome, build prediction models for OC and OPC survival, and clarify the role of smoking in HPV(+) OPC outcome."
"9238807","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a largely incurable disease, with a 5 year survival rate of less than 10%. Effective targeted therapies to complement already maximal radiation and chemotherapy are urgently needed. Converging evidence shows that the EphA2 receptor is an attractive target for GBM. The PI's lab and others recently uncovered dual roles of EphA2 in tumor etiology and malignant progression. When engaged with ligands (ephrin-As), EphA2 is a tumor suppressor and inhibits both ERK and Akt activities in GBM cells. However, in the absence of ligands, EphA2 is phosphorylated by AGC kinases including Akt and p90-RSK on serine 897, and S897 phosphorylation converts EphA2 from a tumor suppressor into an oncogenic protein that promotes glioma cell migration in vitro and intracranial invasion of glioma stem cells (GSC) in vivo. Moreover level of pS897-EphA2 is correlated with tumor grades. Mechanistically pS897- EphA2 regulates the stem properties of GSCs and promotes gliomagenesis in the absence of ligands. In contrast, upon ligand stimulation, EphA2 induces GSC differentiation and inhibits tumor development. Based on this series of observations, we propose that ligand-mimicking small molecule agonists of EphA2 can be novel therapeutic agents for GBM. Such agonists are expected to i) restore the intrinsic tumor suppressor functions of EphA2, ii) disrupt the pro- oncogenic Akt/RSK-EphA2 signaling axis, and iii) induce differentiation of GSCs. Using structure- guided virtual screening and cell-based assays, we reported that doxazosin (DZ), an ?1- adrenoceptor antagonist still in clinical use for hypertension, is a bona fide EphA2 agonist. DZ inhibits ERK and Akt and suppresses tumor cell dissemination in an EphA2-dependent manner. Much more potent derivatives of DZ have been characterized through medicinal chemistry, including BW27, which suppressed GBM in preclinical models and was capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The overarching goal of this proposal is to translate these basic and preclinical discoveries into nove GBM therapeutic agents. BW27 will be subject to systemic preclinical test across all four molecular subtypes of human GBM. The on-target effects of BW27 will be investigated using the genetically engineered mouse model. Finally the X-ray co-crystal structure of EphA2 in complex with BW27 will be determined to guide the design of next generation(s) of EphA2 agonists. Completion of the studies could lead to new mechanism-based small molecule drug(s) for therapeutic intervention of GBM."
"9199220","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxytocin (OT) functions as a hormone in labor and lactation and as a neuromodulator in the brain. OT receptors are present on OT neurons, which they autoregulate during somatodendritic OT release. During pregnancy and lactation, OT release is pulsatile, not continuous, and this pattern is critical to avoid OT receptor desensitization and insure proper hormone function at target smooth muscle in uterus and mammary gland. Neurons in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) undergo remarkable plasticity during late pregnancy and lactation, including a glial-neuronal rearrangement and increases in synaptic activity. We have found enhanced spike afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) during both periods. AHPs are critical in sculpting the short (~4 sec) high frequency (~50 Hz) bursts from OT neurons underlying this pulsatility, bursts that produce a bolus release of OT into the bloodstream to maximally contract uterine smooth muscle or mammary gland myoepithelium.  Reproductive-associated plasticity in the SON and PVN depends on the pattern of ovarian steroid release during pregnancy and on the somatodendritic release of OT. We present the first in vivo evidence showing that central OT receptors are critical for the enhancement of the calcium-dependent AHPs normally manifest at late pregnancy. A specific OT antagonist administered chronically to the third ventricle during late pregnancy blocked this form of plasticity with no effect on VP neurons. In addition, we mimicked this plasticity by applying OT to hypothalamic slices from pregnant (E18-19) rats. The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms of this adaptation made by OT neurons, and how it shapes OT neuronal firing to maximize hormone release and thereby insure normal parturition and lactation for infant development. Understanding the mechanisms of central OT receptor transduction at the OT neuron will have important applications for understanding the wider roles of OTRs in brain function. There are Three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To determine if the enhancement of AHPs in OT neurons by OT is specific to OT neurons and OT receptor activation, whether it is specific to pregnant animals, and whether it is due to a change in the Ca2+ sensitivity of the underlying currents. Specific Aim 2. To test whether OT's effects on AHPs are mediated through a pERK 1/2-MAPK cascade, and whether it is associated with an increase expression of the AHP channels and/or the enzymes CK2 and PP2a, known to modulate AHP Ca2+ sensitivity. Specific Aim 3. To determine how enhanced AHPs modulate OT neuronal bursts, and to determine whether the reinsertion of missing excitatory activity differentially alters OT firing pattern in lactating vs. virgin rats, in an OT-dependent manner."
"9208060","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammary gland (MG) is composed of epithelial and surrounding stromal cells that are highly dynamic during puberty, pregnancy, lactation, and post-lactational involution. In the stroma, lipid-filled adipocytes exhibit greatest plasticity whe they regress during lactation and repopulate the gland during involution. The timing of repopulation suggests a functional role for adipocytes in the reconstruction of the MG epithelium during involution, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive their regeneration are not well understood. I have identified an adipocyte precursor cell (APC) population in the MG. This adipogenic population is crucial for regenerative processes in other tissues, such as hair follicle growth and muscle regeneration after injury. Whether this APC population plays a role in MG reconstruction is not known. During involution, adipocytes could repopulate the MG stroma through either adipogenesis, in which APCs differentiate to regenerate mature adipocytes; lipogenesis (lipid filling) of mature adipocytes that exist in the MG throughout lactation; and/or transdifferentiation of epithelial cells into adipocytes. In order to determine which of these mechanisms occurs, I will use in situ genetic lineage tracing mediated by Cre recombinase to identify whether mature adipocytes in the repopulated gland after involution are derived from APCs, mature adipocytes, or another cell lineage. Understanding the mechanisms of adipocyte repopulation will enable me to then evaluate whether adipocytes produce signals that control the reconstruction of the MG during involution. The ability of the MG to undergo multiple rounds of tissue development, degeneration, and reconstruction provides a unique model to evaluate mechanisms of tissue plasticity in adults, which is broadly relevant for many disciplines in regenerative medicine. Furthermore, the MG stroma has been implicated in problems with lactation due to maternal obesity, as well as tumor metastasis in pregnancy-associated breast cancer. In this research, I will establish a functional context for adipocytes in the MG that holds  therapeutic potential for addressing these public health concerns."
"9218361","PROJECT SUMMARY A plethora of receptor-mediated signaling pathways initiate production of the lipid messenger phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). Direct activation of phospholipase D (PLD) leads to distinctive molecular species of PtdOH that bind to a variety of cellular targets. A less direct pathway is the receptor-mediated process of phospholipase C (PLC) generation of diacylglycerol with subsequent lipid phosphorylation via diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) leading to downstream production of PtdOH. A third pathway includes direct de novo generation of PtdOH via the Kennedy Pathway. Surprisingly, these pathways from cell surface receptors and constitutively activated pathways leading to PtdOH production are largely uncharacterized. While some of the signaling components such as Arf GTPases, Rho GTPases, protein kinase C, among others have been identified, a well detailed map elucidating the network has not as yet been charted. In this project we use a multi-omics approach to identify key components of these phosphatidic acid signaling pathways looking at the downstream effectors, consequences to membrane lipid composition, intracellular metabolic pathways, innate immune components and other targets of phosphatidic acid signaling. This will provide a basis for understanding how phosphatidic acid signaling contributes to a number of important human pathologies that includes cancer, infectious diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders."
"9208057","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Morphogenesis, the process by which cells move through the embryo to form the shapes and structures of the body, is critical for multicellular lif. Its misregulation leads to a wide range of diseases including birth defects, cancer metastasis and improper wound healing. Genetic screens have been crucial for identifying genes involved in these processes, but traditional genetic screens are blind to large categories of genes, such as those that have a partially redundant function with other pathways, as well as pleiotropic genes. Gene expression profiling techniques such as RNA-seq shed light on these blind spots by taking a snapshot of the transcript level of every gene, regardless of whether it is pleiotropic  or partially redundant. I hypothesize that there are undiscovered pleiotropic or partially redundant genes, as well as genes simply not yet found by genetic approaches, that are critical to morphogenesis and which will be revealed by RNA-seq. Ever since the description of the invariant cell lineage of C. elegans development, the nematode has been a powerful embryological tool, allowing researchers to predict exactly when and where an event of interest will take place. Phenomena such as neuron specification, apoptosis, polarized cell division, or cell migration can be anticipated with a spatial resolution of a single cell, and a temporal resolution of minutes. But this cell lineage does not directly address how these phenomena are taking place, and what genes are responsible. Single-cell RNA-seq allows us to profile transcripts levels from each of these cells throughout development, to identify genes that correlate with the well-documented phenomena of development. I will perform single-cell RNA-seq on each individual cell of the C. elegans embryo until the 16-cell stage, thereby creating a molecular lineage to complement the known cellular lineage of development. Regulators of morphogenesis have been difficult to identify, in large part due to the often pleiotropic or partialy redundant functions of these genes. I will analyze the transcriptomes of a variety of gastrulating cell types over time leading up to gastrulation. I hypothesize that there are genes whose expression correlates across cell types as each cell type initiates gastrulation, and that these genes have functional roles in regulating morphogenesis. One of the main contributions of this project will be the transcriptional lineage, which will be made available as a resource to cell and  developmental biologists. In order to ensure the utility of this resource, I will program an interactive data visualization web tool. This tool will allow the user to query my data by visually  describing a spatiotemporal expression pattern of interest, and receiving information about all the genes that match the described pattern. This tool will bridge a communication gap between computational and non-computational biologists. While these data will be relevant to many questions in developmental and cell biology, I will use them to generate hypotheses about the regulation of morphogenesis, which I will then test in the gastrulating nematode."
"9197318","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children don't say their first words until around the time of their first birthday, but research using experimental methods has shown that infants learn a great deal about their language before they start saying words. Researchers now believe that infants learn to perceive their language's speech sound categories (consonants and vowels) in the first year, and they learn to recognize dozens of words (even if  they don't know what they mean). This project will help us determine how this learning happens, and how it helps children make further progress in language learning over the second year. The project begins by following up on the investigator's discovery that even infants as young as 6 months already know what some words mean; using recently developed techniques, it will be possible to tell whether infants learn abstract words as well as more concrete ones, and what kinds of learning mechanisms may be responsible. The project will also support study of the acoustics of infant-directed speech and testing of computational models of how infants might learn vowels, starting from a theory stating that knowing words helps infants learn speech sound categories. A second set of experiments will test how infants and  toddlers learn to tell when two different-sounding words really are different words (like ten and tin) and when they are the same (like ten spoken in different linguistic environments). Thus, the project will trace the development of speech sound perception and interpretation from early infancy into the second year, aiming for mechanistic explanations of the child's first steps in language acquisition."
"9240823","Both androgens and estrogens contribute to the maintenance of bone mass during adult life in men, but the cell targets and molecular mechanisms of these effects remain poorly understood. During the preceding funding period, we found that the effects of androgens on cancellous bone result from AR signaling in cells of the mesenchymal lineage leading to a decrease in osteoclasts; and orchidectomy (ORX) increases soluble RANKL levels as well as the number of B-lymphocytes in the murine bone marrow. RANKL derived from osteocytes is critical for cancellous bone remodeling and B-lymphocyte-derived RANKL contributes to the loss of cancellous bone mass in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In cortical bone, however, the effects of androgens do not require AR signaling in any cell type of the mesenchymal lineage, nor do they require ER? signaling downstream of committed osteoblast progenitors targeted by Osx1-Cre, or AR or ER? signaling in the osteoclast lineage. Estrogens, nonetheless, attenuate endocortical resorption in females by ER? signaling in uncommitted mesenchymal progenitors targeted by Prx1-Cre. In addition, the mRNA and secreted protein levels of SDF1 ? a chemotactic cytokine of the CXC family that is abundantly expressed in Prx1-Cre targeted cells and promotes osteoclast generation ? are higher in GFP-tagged ER? null cells as well as bone marrow cell cultures from female ER?f/f;Prx1-Cre mice as compared to identical cultures from littermate controls; and so is osteoclastogenesis in co-cultures of ER? null BM stromal or calvaria cells with macrophages. Furthermore, both OVX and ORX increase SDF1 in the bone marrow plasma, administration of E2 to ORX mice prevents this increase, and E2, but not DHT, prevents cortical bone loss in ORX mice. Finally, we found that the OVX- or ORX-induced cortical bone loss is prevented by restraining H2O2 generation in osteoclast mitochondria; and the loss of cortical bone mass in OVX mice is prevented by a 17?-E2 dendrimer conjugate (EDC), incapable of stimulating nuclear- initiated actions of ER?. Based on these advances, we will test the interrelated hypotheses that: in males, the protective effects of androgens on cancellous bone result from AR signaling in osteocytes, B-lymphocytes, or both. These actions result in the attenuation of RANKL and thereby attenuation of the number of cancellous osteoclasts. The protective effects of androgens against endocortical resorption result, at least in part, from ER?- mediated actions (upon aromatization of androgens to estrogens) on Prx1-Cre targeted uncommitted mesenchymal progenitors. These actions repress SDF1 production, thereby attenuating osteoclast formation and homing at the endosteal surfaces. The suppressive effect of estrogens on SDF1 production ultimately leads to the restraining of H2O2 accumulation in osteoclasts and results from non-nuclear-initiated signaling of the ER?. To advance these hypotheses we will try to elucidate the mechanism of the protective effects of androgens on cancellous bone by determining the role of osteocyte- and B-lymphocyte-derived RANKL as well as the role of the B lymphocyte AR in these effects. To do this we will study: i) mice in which RANKL is deleted from mature osteoblasts/osteocytes (RANKLf/f;Dmp1-Cre), ii) mice in which both AR and RANKL are deleted from osteoblasts/osteocytes (RANKLf/f;ARf/y;Dmp1-Cre), iii) mice in which RANKL is deleted from B-lymphocytes (RANKLf/f;CD19-Cre), and iv) mice in which AR is deleted from B-lymphocytes (ARf/y;CD19-Cre). In addition, we will elucidate the mechanism of the protective effects of androgens on cortical bone by investigating: a) whether down-regulation of SDF1 in uncommited mesenchymal progenitors is responsible for some of these effects using: i) mice in which SDF1 is deleted in Prx1-Cre targeted cells, and ii) mice in which the SDF1 receptor, CXCR4, is deleted in LysM-Cre targeted cells; and b) whether the effect of androgens results from ER?-mediated actions upon androgen aromatization to estrogens using ER?f/f;Prx1-Cre mice. Using co-cultures of stromal and hematopoietic cells, we will also examine whether SDF1 promotes osteoclastogenesis via H2O2; and whether the effect of estrogens on SDF1 results from non-nuclear-initiated signaling of the ER?."
"9198768","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Energy metabolism and metabolite transport are essential for the viability and function of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Understanding these processes and their perturbations in disease states is of fundamental importance. Our preliminary results show reductive carboxylation is much more prominent in RPE than in retina or other neuronal cells or tissues. We found that reductive carboxylation is deficient in RPE cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) cells made from a Sorsby's Fundus Dystrophy (SFD) patient and under conditions of oxidative stress, a critical component of early pathogenesis of AMD. Because of the potential disease relevance of reductive carboxylation in RPE cells, we will examine the role of reductive carboxylation in RPE cells using advanced tracer methodology, real time mitochondrial function analysis and live imaging. We observed in a well-controlled cell culture system that human RPE preferentially exports metabolites to the retinal side. We also found that metabolite transport is impaired in SFD iPSC-derived RPE cells. We plan to systematically investigate the regulation of metabolite transport by extracellular structure and intracelluar state, and identify the mechanisms of the defective transport in SFD RPE. This proposed research will generate a reference data set of metabolites that are preferentially exported and consumed by the RPE, determine the role of reductive carboxylation in RPE cell metabolism, and reveal normal and disease-relevant changes in metabolite transport in RPE. This new information can be used to develop treatment of retinal degenerative diseases."
"9188814","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Light has profound influences on many non-image forming (NIF) visual functions including circadian rhythms, sleep, mood, body temperature and the pupillary light reflex. In mammals, light influences these NIF functions through three retinal photoreceptors, namely the classical photoreceptors, rods and cones, and the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which express the photopigment melanopsin. As ganglion cells, ipRGCs integrate rod/cone input with their own intrinsic melanopsin-based phototransduction to serve as the sole conduits to signal light information to brain regions important for these NIF functions. However, how ipRGCs, a seemingly homogeneous population, integrate extrinsic light input from rods and cones with their own intrinsic melanopsin-based light responses to coordinate diverse behaviors is poorly understood. The overall goal of this competitive renewal is to address this fundamental question at three levels. In Aim I, we will determine the functional circuits by which rod, cone and melanopsin-based signals are integrated in ipRGCs to drive NIF functions. Recently, we found that ipRGCs are much more diverse than previously appreciated, consisting of multiple morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct subtypes. Additionally, ipRGCs appear to be unique among retinal ganglion cells in that they co-express two neurotransmitters, glutamate and a neuropeptide, PACAP. Thus, in Aim II, we will define the relative contribution of glutamatergic and peptidergic neurotransmission to diverse NIF functions. In Aim III, we will elucidate the functional contribution of individual ipRGC subtypes to NIF functions. These studies will advance our current understanding of the role of ipRGCs in controlling light- mediated behaviors that are essential to human health and a better quality of life."
"9298191","Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the oldest known human maladies and a major cause of mortality worldwide, killing 1.5 million people each year. Despite the widespread use of an attenuated live vaccine and several antibiotics, there is currently more TB than ever before, with one third of the world population infected with Mtb. This dire situation is compounded by increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Mtb, whose emergence is facilitated by the lengthy course of antibiotic treatment and the ability of Mtb to persist in the host. During infection, the host scavenges essential metal ions, particularly iron, as part of an antimicrobial strategy known as ?nutritional immunity?. In response to iron limitation, pathogens, including Mtb, synthesize not only high affinity iron sequestering molecules, but also virulence determinants and other factors that allow the pathogen to withstand the immune attack. Accumulating evidence shows that pathogenic bacteria concentrate and pack virulence factors into small membrane vesicles (MVs) that are released into the extracellular milieu and have the capacity to influence pathogen-host interplay. In particular, it was shown recently that Mtb also produces and releases MVs, which contain immunologically active molecules. Thus, MVs might be a tool used by Mtb to overcome host defenses and, as such, are potential targets of therapeutic interference. Furthermore, immunization with isolated MVs elicits a protective immune response against TB in mice. Although these findings indicate that MVs play an important role in host- pathogen interactions, very little is known regarding the biogenesis, regulation and functions of Mtb MVs. Our findings indicate that in response to iron limitation Mtb significantly enhances production of MVs and modifies their content. To identify factors involved in MV biogenesis in Mtb, we have designed a genetic screen based on the properties of MVs produced under iron limitation to identify mutants with altered MVs production. In addition to identifying genes required for normal MV formation, the availability of these mutants will facilitate effective efforts to elucidate the relevance of MV production for Mtb pathogenesis. In a complementary approach, we will test the hypothesis that under conditions of iron limitation, MV production is controlled by the machinery that regulates iron homeostasis in Mtb. Specifically, we will test whether the master transcriptional regulator of iron uptake, iron transporters, and siderophores are required for normal MV biogenesis during iron limitation. The results of these studies will help elucidate a still poorly understood mechanism used by Mtb to interact with the host and identify new points of intervention for development of new therapeutic or preventive therapies."
"9264097","G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are essential mediators of neurohormonal signaling in both the normal and failing heart. ?-adrenergic receptors (?ARs) in particular control many facets of cardiomyocyte function, including contractility and survival signaling, through the activation of both G protein-dependent and ?-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways. ?-blockers are commonly used in the treatment of heart failure and act to block cardiomyocyte cell death. While G protein-dependent ?AR signaling enhances cardiomyocyte death during heart failure, ?-arrestin-biased ?AR signaling has been suggested to promote cardiomyocyte survival in the heart following acute cardiac injury or during heart failure. Although the clinically used ?-blocker carvedilol has been shown to induce ?-arrestin-biased ?AR signaling in model cells, we have found that carvedilol actually ablates cardiomyocyte contraction. Thus, we believe ?-arrestin-biased ?AR modulators that promote survival, but not at the expense of cardiomyocyte contractility, would serve as more effective therapeutic agents for heart failure.  Our recent work has detailed the development of pepducins, palmitoylated peptides from the intracellular loops of a GPCR that selectively confer biased signaling via either G protein- or arrestin-dependent pathways. In particular, several pepducins designed from the first intracellular loop of the ?2AR were discovered to be completely ?-arrestin-biased. Further, we have shown for the first time that the most potent of these compounds, ICL1-9, enhances cardiomyocyte contraction in a ?2AR- and ?-arrestin-dependent manner. This is the first demonstration of a ?-arrestin-biased ?2AR modulator enhancing cardiomyocyte contractility in the absence of G protein activation, an exciting finding that has the potential to greatly improve heart failure therapeutics. We hypothesize that compounds that promote ?-arrestin-biased ?2AR signaling will be useful in the treatment of heart failure and propose to identify and further characterize the ability of such compounds to improve cardiac function. To test this hypothesis we will: 1) Dissect the mechanism of ?-arrestin-biased ?2AR signaling using ICL1-9 as a model; 2) Perform high throughput screening and characterization of compounds that promote ?-arrestin-biased ?2AR signaling and define their target and mechanism of action; 3) Determine the mechanism of ?-arrestin-biased ?2AR-mediated cardiomyocyte contractility and its impact on cardiac function in vivo; and 4) Evaluate the effects of ?-arrestin-biased ?2AR signaling on cardiomyocyte survival in vitro and in response to acute cardiac injury in vivo. Overall, the goal of this project is to understand the mechanism of ?-arrestin-biased ?2AR signaling and its impact on cardiomyocyte survival and function with a long-term goal of developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of heart failure.  "
"9252919","Project Summary/Abstract Breast cancer is the second most prevalent type of cancer worldwide with nearly 1.7 million new cases and greater than 500,000 deaths per year. In the United States, 3 million women are living with breast cancer, representing a significant burden of disease. Of the 232,000 new cases of invasive breast carcinoma each year in the U.S., 20-25% are classified as HER2+. The advent of therapies that target HER2/ErbB2 (e.g. trastuzumab and lapatinib) has lead to improvements in the clinical management of a subset of HER2+ patients. However, adaptive resistance mechanisms of HER2+ breast cancer still hinder long-term outcomes of targeted therapies. One avenue that would improve patient outcomes is identifying and characterizing the tumor-initiating cell (TIC) for HER2+ breast cancer. Our initial studies into the TIC for HER2+ breast cancer revealed a greater tumorigenic capacity in ErbB2+ mammary stem cells (MaSCs) compared with tumors derived from luminal cells. In order to understand the variance in tumorigenic capacity, we performed transcriptomic analysis, finding a pronounced reduction of Wnt5a in tumors derived from ErbB2+ MaSCs. Further investigation revealed WNT5A secretion from luminal cells represses growth of MaSCs by a RYK- and TGF?R1-dependent phosphorylation of SMAD2. We hypothesize that WNT5A/RYK represents a paracrine-signaling module that spatiotemporally regulates the quiescence of MaSCs/TICs in ErbB2 breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of lineage-specific expression of Wnt5a/Ryk in ErbB2 tumorigenesis. We will use in vivo methods for inducible Wnt5a knockout or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Ryk of preneoplastic luminal and basal cells. Our study will test the hypothesis that the inhibition of ErbB2 tumorigenesis from MaSCs depends on both luminal Wnt5a and basal Ryk expression. 2) Elucidate the molecular mechanism of WNT5A/RYK-mediated repression of MaSC growth. We will characterize the binding and signaling of WNT5A to known receptors of the mammary duct. Our study will test the hypothesis that WNT5A binds RYK preferentially leading to the phosphorylation of SMAD2. The tumor microenvironment plays integral roles in regulating cancer cell survival, metastasis, and adaptive resistance to therapy. Understanding the role of paracrine WNT5A/RYK suppression of TIC outgrowth in HER2+ breast cancer would allow for a more comprehensive knowledge of the microenvironmental interactions that regulate breast cancer initiation and progression. Elucidating the changes that must occur extrinsically (in the surrounding premalignant field) or intrinsically (in the ErbB2 TIC) which allow for the escape of WNT5A-mediated repression would improve the understanding of the paracrine regulatory network of the mammary gland and aid in improving early detection strategies and robust targeted therapies. !"
"9294349","Abstract  Secondary infections due to compromised immune function are a significant cause of mortality in hospitalized trauma patients that have survived hemorrhagic shock. The Gram-negative bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common causes of secondary pneumonia in these patients. Neutrophil recruitment into the airspaces of the lung is critical for host defense against P. aeruginosa pneumonia, and studies suggest that this element of innate immunity is compromised following hemorrhagic shock. Animal models of critical illness and associated immune dysfunction have been developed to probe pathogenesis of secondary infection and evaluate potential therapies. However, a mouse model of pseudomonal pneumonia secondary to hemorrhagic shock has not been characterized. Here, we propose to develop and characterize a mouse model of P. aeruginosa pneumonia secondary to hemorrhagic shock as a more clinically relevant format to evaluate potential neutrophil-targeted therapeutic strategies. ?2 integrins are adhesion receptors that regulate neutrophil trafficking, and must become activated to bind to their ligands expressed on endothelium or extracellular matrix. Our previous studies suggest a strategy of attenuating ?2 integrin activation to promote neutrophil emigration from the pulmonary vasculature and recruitment into the airspaces during acute respiratory P. aeruginosa infection in mice with a fully competent innate immune response. In the second part of this study, we will use the new mouse model to evaluate the efficacy of XVA143, a small molecule antagonist that prevents ?2 integrins from achieving their highest ligand-binding affinity. We will additionally assess the effects of modulating neutrophil recruitment on lung injury and pulmonary edema, as neutrophils are also mediators of bystander tissue damage that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. These studies may identify regulators of ?2 integrin activation as effective therapeutics for promoting host defense of the lung against secondary bacterial pneumonia while maintaining tissue protection."
"9197678","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this grant proposal we seek to characterize how BMPER, an extracellular regulator of the BMP signaling pathway, influences the biology and function of endothelial cells. Understanding the biology of endothelial cells and the signaling pathways they use in order to orchestrate their pleiotropy of function is of critical importance given the vast array of cardiovascular, circulatory and blood diseases that result from the dysfunction of the vascular endothelium. Work in our laboratory and others has revealed that BMPER, through it's mediation of BMP signaling events, is critically involved in numerous aspects of endothelial cell biology that impinge on and affect vascular development in the embryo and the success of revascularization in mature tissues. Defining the mechanism behind BMPER's ability to affect these processes, however, has been complicated due to the unusual ability of BMPER to both promote and inhibit BMP activity in a context-dependent manner. Recently, we have discovered that BMPER modulates BMP4 activity via a concentration-dependent, endocytic trap-and- sink mechanism, with low levels of BMPER promoting and high levels inhibiting BMP4 signaling, thereby accounting for the biphasic nature of BMPER's regulation of BMP4 activity. Furthermore, we found that the differential recruitment of receptor complex proteins, determined by the concentration ratio of BMPER to BMP4, predisposes the BMPER/BMP4 signaling complex to be sorted by intracellular compartments that result in either the enhancement or inhibition of BMP activation. Here we propose to build on these findings by using a novel and highly integrated approach in which vascular events at the molecular, transcriptional, and genetic level will be related to pathologically and therapeutically relevant processes within the endothelial compartment. Specifically, we propose to: 1). Understand the broad biochemical regulation of BMPER activity in endothelial cells; 2). Elucidate the role of BMPER in the regulation of signaling events necessary for endothelial cell migration; and 3). Determine the role of BMPER-mediated signaling during coronary angiogenesis, a process that until now, has not been explored in terms of BMPER/BMP signaling but which our preliminary data demonstrate is reliant on BMPER. The aims of this grant are a logical extension of work done in the previous cycle. We anticipate that this approach, while challenging in its scope, will allow the individual parts of the project to be synergistic without being interdependent on one another for completion, should problems arise in one area."
"9379789","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nervous systems from invertebrates to humans have shown remarkably resilient and adaptive abilities to maintain stable functionality despite challenges that may otherwise lead to suboptimal or uncontrolled activity. In each of these systems, perturbations to synaptic activity initially lead to corresponding alterations in synaptic strength. However, given sufficient time, nervous systems in these organisms adapt by modulating presynaptic release or postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors to re-target previous levels of synaptic strength. This process, termed homeostatic synaptic plasticity, is thought to enable stable, yet flexible, synaptic activity and to play key roles in tuning neural function in health and disease. Yet there is a major gap in our knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that endow synapses with these extraordinary abilities. The long term goal of this proposal is to identify the genes and elucidate the mechanisms that achieve and maintain the homeostatic control of synaptic strength. To understand the principles governing homeostatic synaptic signaling, we will utilize the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, which has been established as a powerful genetic system to study this process. This proposal will use a combination of genetic analysis, electrophysiology, and imaging approaches to investigate the homeostatic mechanisms that enhance presynaptic release in response to a perturbation to postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor function. In particular, three genes encoding neuronal transmembrane proteins have been identified that appear to function together in the presynaptic terminal to promote the calcium-dependent, homeostatic potentiation of synaptic transmission. Interestingly, these genes have been associated with epilepsy, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. The proposed experiments will first characterize these molecules in synaptic function and homeostatic plasticity. Confocal and super-resolution microscopy will then be utilized to reveal the subsynaptic localization and cellular activities of these proteins. Finally, complementary forward genetic screens are proposed to identify new genes that orchestrate homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Together, this work is expected to reveal new homeostatic genes and mechanisms that control the adaptive modulation of synaptic strength and provide a foundation from which to understand how transcellular homeostatic signaling systems more generally are established in the nervous system."
"9169924","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a devastating disease, with a 5-year survival of less than 6%. This survival rate has not changed in the last 60 years, due in large part to a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. Characterizing these aspects of PDA pathogenesis is necessary to develop more effective treatments and better outcomes for patients. Protein kinases are a therapeutic target and multiple small molecule inhibitors targeting them are being developed clinically.  Recently, TANK-Binding Kinase-1 (TBK-1) has been associated with pancreatic cancer in humans. However, our functional understanding of the role of this kinase in pancreatic cancer is limited. In normal physiology TBK-1 is a pro-inflammatory mediator of interferon response as well as non-canonical NF-?B signaling and is primarily expressed in inflammatory cells. TBK-1 expression is dysregulated and overexpressed in many epithelial malignancies, including lung, breast, colon, and pancreatic cancers.  Preliminary experiments revealed that PDA cells express TBK-1, and furthermore, inhibition of TBK-1 in PDA cells lead to abrogated cell growth in a 3D culture system. The mechanisms underpinning the requirement for TBK-1 in PDA three-dimensional growth are unknown. PDA TBK-1 inhibition in vitro also leads to decreased activity of AKT signaling and upregulation of pro-apoptotic gene expression, suggesting a possible mechanism of action. In biochemical assays, AKT acts as a direct target of TBK-1 activity; however, whether TBK-1 mediates PDA cell survival via AKT activation has yet to be directly tested.  Using pharmacologic and genetic techniques, the proposed experiments will address the downstream mechanism of TBK-1 mediated PDA growth and the cellular mechanism of PDA growth abrogation upon TBK-1 inhibition.  The protein kinase TBK-1 is expressed in a number of human malignancies, but its role in pancreatic cancer has not been fully characterized. There is an increasing interest in the role of TBK-1 in cancer biology, since TBK-1 can regulate many downstream pathways in cancer, including AKT. Many recent studies have established AKT as required for pancreatic cancer maintenance, thus it a potential therapeutic target. However, efforts to target AKT in humans have been complicated by severe adverse side effects of AKT inhibition. Those include severe skin rash and gastrointestinal distress, and are associated with tissues that depend on AKT for normal physiologic function. If AKT function is dependent upon TBK-1 activity in the context of pancreatic cancer, targeting TBK-1 may result in a wider therapeutic window, as TBK-1's role in normal physiology is limited to host defense rather than tissue maintenance."
"9239953","Project Summary Preventative interventions involving video-feedback programs to promote parenting (VIPP; Juffer et al., 2008) have been shown to be successful in improving maternal sensitivity and infant-mother attachment security (Bakermans-Kranenberg et al., 2008). However, interventions might be substantially more effective if broader elements of family systems were also addressed, including father-child and inter-parental relationships, particularly given the growing body of evidence that highlights the importance of father involvement and positive engagement in children's socio-emotional development. Infancy is a particularly sensitive and vulnerable period not only for the child but also for the parents who often experience heightened daily stress, parenting demands, work-family role strain, and inter-parental discord associated with changes in the family (Feeney et al., 2001).The proposed longitudinal study addresses major gaps by testing the effectiveness of family-wide preventative interventions designed to promote healthy development and functioning in infants, mothers, and fathers, including low-income families. This three-phase study involves a rigorous randomized clinical trial (RCT) approach and will involve a demographically diverse sample of 400 families. Phase I involves a lab and home pre-test (infants 6 months of age) and 8-week intervention period; Phase II (12 months) includes an initial post-test, and Phase III (16-18 months) involves a second post-test. Families will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: sensitivity intervention (SI), couples intervention (CI), both (SI + CI) or control. Specific aims of the study include: (1) An evaluation of the effectiveness of the SI, CI, and SI+CI interventions at improving parental sensitivity, parental efficacy, parenting stress, inter-parental conflict, infant affective development, attachment security, behavior problems, and socio-emotional competence; (2) A test of the mechanisms through which change in behavior occurs. For example, relations between SI participation in Phase I and child attachment in Phase III may be mediated by enhanced parent sensitivity in Phase II. Relations between CI participation and child outcomes may be mediated by inter-parental functioning and more effective communication skills; (3) An examination of factors that moderate the effectiveness of the interventions, determining which families benefit the most. Potential moderators include demographic characteristics, family (dis)organization, parents' own caregiving history, parents' depressive and anxious systems, and infant negative temperament; (4) Mother-father comparisons on direct effects, mediating mechanisms and moderating processes. This study builds upon past research towards increasing children's emotional security in multiple family relationships by testing new directions in preventative interventions in infancy, addressing the mother-child, father-child, and mother-father relationships. The goal is to foster children's socio-emotional development and security through cost-effective family-wide interventions in infancy that promote sensitive parent-infant interactions and improved inter-parental communication."
"9216267","Project Summary/Abstract Cell invasion through the basement membrane is a key mechanism underlying cell dispersal and organ formation during normal development, immune surveillance and is dysregulated during cancer metastasis. Yet due to dif?culties of studying these dynamic behaviors in vivo, it is the least understood aspect of the metastatic cascade. My laboratory utilizes a powerful in vivo model to examine cell invasive behavior, by combining functional genomic and genetic tools with single-cell visual analyses. We examine anchor cell (AC) invasion into the vulval epithelium during C. elegans larval development. Data from our laboratory has shown a functional link between G1 phase cell cycle arrest and the acquisition of an invasive phenotype. Through high- throughput screens, we have identi?ed that the activity of a single conserved NR2E1 class nuclear hormone receptor, the transcription factor, nhr-67 (TLX), is required to maintain the invasive AC in G1 cell cycle arrest. Loss of nhr-67 results in mitotic ACs that fail to invade. Strikingly, AC invasion can be rescued by preventing cell division through induction of G1 cell cycle arrest. Downstream of G1 arrest, chromatin modi?ers, including the histone deacetylase, hda-1, are required for expression of pro-invasive genes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and regulators of the F-actin cytoskeleton, leading to differentiation of the invasive phenotype. For this proposal we plan to elucidate how cell cycle arrest is functionally linked to invasion. In Aim 1, using molecular epistatic interaction experiments and inducible transgene expression, we will identify the upstream network of transcription factors that mediate NHR-67 activity. In Aim 2, we will generate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated conditional alleles of cell cycle control genes to determine how the AC maintains G1 arrest. In Aim 3, we will pair tissue-speci?c RNAi screening of chromatin modi?ers with high resolution confocal and structured illumination (SIM) imaging of sub-nuclear organization, to understand the link between invasion and differentiation. The results of these aims will provide the ?rst mechanistic view of the transcriptional and epigenetic control of cell cycle arrest and invasive behavior. Thus, our proposed work has the potential to provide a mechanistic understanding of how cells acquire and maintain an invasive phenotype, a critical aspect of many developmental and genetic disorders."
"9181429","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vitamin A is required for proper mammalian embryonic development, owing to defective transcriptional action of retinoic acid (RA), its active form. Deficient or excessive maternal vitamin A intake of this essential nutrient results in congenital abnormalities or fetal death in experimental animal models and humans. Notably, vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is the third most prevalent nutritional deficiency, and is an overwhelming public health issue, affecting hundreds of millions of people (predominantly women and children) in developing countries. The majority of the world population, especially in the above-mentioned geographic areas, relies on the vitamin A precursor ?-carotene (BC) as a source of retinoids (vitamin A and its derivatives). In the embryo, BC obtained from the maternal diet can significantly contribute to the retinoid needs of the developing tissues upon conversion to retinaldehyde via the symmetric BC cleavage enzyme ?,?-carotene-15,15'-oxygenase, CMO1. Retinaldehyde is then oxidized to retinoic acid, the master regulator of many genes that are crucial to embryogenesis. BC is also cleaved asymmetrically by ?,?-carotene-9',10'-oxygenase, CMO2, generating C10 ?-apocarotenal (C10 apoAL). While retinaldehyde could also be generated from C10 apoAL, the role of CMO2 and its reaction product during mammalian embryonic development is unknown. Our preliminary data indicate that the well-known detrimental effects of VAD on mouse embryogenesis are aggravated when CMO2 is inactive and BC is administered to the dams, despite expression of CMO1. We showed that the embryonic phenotype of mice lacking CMO2 on the retinol-binding protein (RBP) knockout background, an established model of VAD, was due to the low levels of C10 apoAL along with limited availability of retinoids. Supplementing CMO2-/-RBP-/- mice on a vitamin A deficient diet with C10 apoAL reduced congenital malformations. We propose that C10 apoAL serves as a ligand for PKC?. This mitochondria-localized PKC isoform signals to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), increasing its activity, with the purpose of coordinating the fuel flux to the citric acid cycle with the demands for ATP production. PKC? is activated by redox mechanisms, with a mandatory catalytic role of vitamin A (retinol) that binds the activation domains of the kinase. CMO2 localizes to mitochondria and C10 aopAL is structurally similar to retinol. We showed that C10 apoAL interacts with the retinol-binding domain of PKC? and modulates respiration in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, in a PKC?-dependent manner. Overall, our data suggest that disruption of PKC signaling and mitochondrial functions when C10 apoAL and vitamin A are limiting could be the underlying cause of the exacerbated phenotypes of mice lacking CMO2 in the presence of BC. With this application we seek to further understand the function of CMO2 and the mechanisms of C10 apoAL action during mammalian embryogenesis. Specifically, we will test whether C10 apoAL is essential for embryonic survival under conditions of VAD (Aim 1) and we will define the interaction between CMO2/?- apocarotenoids and PKC? signaling network during embryonic development (Aim 2), both in vitro and ex vivo (Aim 2A) and in vivo (Aim 2B). Unique reagents, such as pure synthetic ?-apocarotenoid compounds, and new mouse models, with inactivation of the PKC? and carotenoid metabolism pathways, will be used to address the above-mentioned questions. Understanding the role of CMO2/?-apocarotenoids in embryogenesis is relevant to human health, as it will lead to novel interventions to ameliorate VAD-associated congenital defects."
"9238520","The proposed work involves density functional theory (DFT) calculations of geometric and electronic structure, electrostatics calculations, and quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics/molecular-dynamics (QM/MM/MD) simulations to provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of the catalytic reaction pathways and mechanisms of proton pumping in B-type and A-type cytochrome c oxidases (CcO's). Aim 1. Develop a quantum/electrostatic model explaining how chemical bonding and proton/electron flow to molecular oxygen within the Fea3-CuB dinuclear complex (DNC) leads to proton pumping across the membrane. QM/MM/MD studies will provide insights into dynamic processes of proton uptake, proton transfer within the DNC and the proton exit channel from the DNC. Aim 2. Detection and characterization of various oxygen species between and/or bridging the Fe-Cu species will be related to corresponding electronic states from DFT. Calculations of vibrational spectra and other electronic properties (Mössbauer) will be performed to connect our hypotheses with experimental spectroscopies. Aim 3. New single crystal X-ray structures at high resolution with little radiation damage will be obtained for B- type CcO from Thermus thermophilus. These will be analyzed in comparison to other structures and DFT calculations. Aim 4. We will further develop current methodologies to improve the quality of quantum chemical DFT calculations for these large active site models, to analyze dynamic processes with QM/MM/MD, and for the physical description of the remaining protein/membrane/aqueous solvent environment. CcO (Complex IV) of mitochondria links electron transfer through the electron transport chain to proton pumping across the inner membrane of the mitochondria, and similarly, across the plasma membrane in most aerobic bacteria. This is the proton motive force utilized for ATP production. Mitochondrial CcO's play an essential role in human health because adequate ATP supplies are required for most important metabolic functions. Also, disruptions in electron or proton transfer reactions or oxygen binding at CcO can lead the production of damaging reactive oxygen species including hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, and hydrogen peroxide. Understanding the structures, mechanisms, and functions of mitochondrial CcO's is important for better analysis of many genetic and metabolic diseases and cancers, and is also relevant to pathologies of aging."
"9219695","Project Summary Each individual elicits a diverse and complex mixture of different B cell clonal lineages after vaccination or infection, some of which are retained as memory B cells or plasma cells. However, the relationships between antibody specificity and affinity in determining which B cell lineages persist, which cellular compartments they occupy, and what future antigens they are able to recognize are not well understood. Detailed molecular understanding of the changes that decrease vaccine responses in old age has also been an elusive goal. We aim to overcome these barriers by studying a 5-year longitudinal cohort of healthy young adult and elderly human subjects vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccine, as well as a cohort of deceased organ donors whose spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and blood are sampled. We will compare the antibody repertoires and binding specificities of influenza-specific cells found in memory B cell pools compared to blood plasmablasts and a distinct CD71+ subset of ?activated B cells? in the longitudinal cohort, and memory B cells in lymph nodes and spleen compared to bone marrow plasma cell (BMPC) pools in the organ donors. By studying the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) specificity of unmutated ancestors of antibody lineages, and the mutated memory B cell, plasmablast, activated B cell and BMPC progeny, we will determine: the extent to which somatic mutation alters the HA specificity of later members of the clonal lineage; whether future vaccine responses can be predicted from an individual's memory B cell pool; whether BMPCs are subject to different selection criteria than the memory B cells in the lymph nodes, spleen and blood; and the impact of human aging on each of these critical components of humoral immunity. This knowledge will help to shape strategies for improved vaccines for influenza, as well as the whole range of emerging pathogens for which new vaccines need to be developed."
"9307118","Infections by parasites of the genus Plasmodium cause more than 200 million cases of malaria and kill more than 400,000 people annually, the majority of whom are Plasmodium falciparum-infected children in sub- Saharan Africa. Most Plasmodium infections are either asymptomatic or cause only mild malaria. A small proportion of infections progress to severe malaria that can be life threatening. To date, the host factors that predispose patients to developing severe malaria are not known, and it has not been possible to identify risk factors that predict progression from asymptomatic infection to severe malaria. These knowledge gaps hinder discovery of new strategies for the prevention of severe malaria. Using multiple Plasmodium species and mouse strains, we have recently published the novel observation that mice with distinct gut bacterial communities exhibit differences in the severity of malaria and humoral immune response following infection with Plasmodium. Mice resistant to severe malaria exhibit elevated T follicular helper (Tfh) and germinal center (GC) B cell numbers and accelerated antibody class switching following Plasmodium yoelii infection compared to susceptible mice. When mice predicated to develop mild malaria were treated with antibodies that disrupt Tfh-GC B cell communication, they developed high parasite burdens, similar to mice that develop severe malaria. These new observations support the scientific premise of this application and suggest that gut microbiome-mediated modulation of the GC reaction may be a critical mechanism underlying the development of severe malaria. The objective of this proposal is to determine the immunological mechanisms by which the gut microbiome determines susceptibility to severe malaria and identify the specific microbes and metabolites responsible for this outcome. These studies will move the field of malaria pathogenesis forward in new directions and may lead to new translational approaches to control severe malaria, which could, in turn, save the hundreds of thousands of lives lost to severe malaria each year. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that specific microbes and their metabolites modulate GC reactions to determine susceptibility to severe malaria. Our hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the dynamics of gut microbiota-mediated modulation of the GC reaction in mice. Aim 2. Determine the Tfh cell- and GC B cell- intrinsic pathways modulated by the gut microbiota in mice. Aim 3. Identify the specific gut bacteria and their metabolites that determine resistance or susceptibility to severe malaria in mice."
"9190165","PROJECT SUMMARY Addiction is a neuropsychiatric disease characterized by compulsive drug-taking and ?seeking and a high propensity for relapse even after long periods of abstinence. Unfortunately, treatment options for this debilitating disease are limited. Thus, understanding the neuroadaptations associated with the development of addiction are critical to identifying therapeutic targets and developing novel treatments. Alterations within cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuitry have been implicated in the development and persistence of addiction. The striatum (i.e., dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens) serves as the interface of this circuit and receives a variety of inputs to guide behavioral output. It is a heterogeneous structure that is primarily (~95%) comprised of GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) that form two divergent output pathways that differ in their anatomical targets as well as their neuropeptide and receptor expression. Direct pathway MSNs (dMSNs) express dopamine (DA) D1 receptors along with the neuropeptides dynorphin and substance P and project monosynaptically to the substantia nigra (SN) whereas indirect pathway MSNs (iMSNs) express DA D2 receptors and the neuropeptide enkephalin and project to the SN via the globus pallidus external and subthalamic nucleus. These pathways are thought to act in an opposing, yet balanced, manner to guide normal function with dMSNs promoting behavior (serving as a ?go? signal) and iMSNs inhibiting behavior (acting as a ?brake?). There is now accumulating evidence that dMSNs and iMSNs act in opposition to regulate addiction- related behaviors. However, much of the work examining the role of dMSNs and iMSNs in drug reward has utilized non-contingent drug administration paradigms such as locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference. It remains unclear what the role of dMSNs and iMSNs are in more complex animal models of addiction and whether the activity of these different striatal cell populations changes in individuals displaying characteristics of compulsive drug use. The overall aim of the proposed experiments is to use novel viral vectors expressing DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) receptors and ex vivo two-photon calcium imaging to define the role of dMSNs and iMSNs in compulsive drug-seeking behaviors characteristic of addiction. The proposed work has the potential to unravel this complex circuitry and could help steer the development of novel treatments for addiction."
"9198954","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are common and can be life-threatening if they progress to rupture. They have been reported in 5% of older men and account for over 15,000 deaths per year. Basic vessel dimensions are currently the primary imaging measurement used clinically to risk-stratify patients. But there is more to the story than dimensions. Wall stress estimated with computational modeling may better predict growth and rupture than diameters. Growth is often not continuous, and instead marked by periods of rapid growth followed by quiescence. Small series report that unrelated surgical procedures can precipitate AAA rupture. These findings suggest that episodic and heterogeneous inflammatory processes in concert with adverse hemodynamics are important for the progression of AAA disease. The complexity of aortic disease is more fully revealed with new functional imaging techniques than with conventional anatomic analysis alone. While AAA has been extensively studied, the mechanisms of disease progression have not been fully elucidated. If better understood, the management of patients with small AAAs (< 5.5cm) could be significantly improved. Many of these aneurysms can be followed safely with a long screening interval of 2-3 years, but some may progress to rupture. Identifying this subset would greatly streamline the surveillance imaging of the millions of patients with AAA. On the other hand, the majority of AAAs never rupture, and identifying low risk patients could help better manage resources and subject only those patients at truly elevated risk to intervention. Aortic wall inflammation can be evaluated with the MRI contrast agent ferumoxytol, which has macrophage- selective properties on delayed imaging. MRI also offers a unique and comprehensive assessment of aortic hemodynamics. Blood flow imaging with time-resolved, 3D phase-contrast MRI (4D Flow) allows quantification of key secondary vascular parameters including turbulence and wall shear stress (WSS). Cine Displacement Encoding with Stimulated Echos (DENSE) can quantify regional stretch differences experienced by the vessel wall. Computational modeling based on MRI volumetric data can be used to calculate wall stress. The goal of our study is to uncover important inflammatory changes and adverse hemodynamics that are not addressed with current imaging, and use them to predict disease progression. We seek to meaningfully advance the assessment of risk in patients who do not meet current intervention thresholds and improve outcomes by refining surveillance imaging regimens and decisions regarding early intervention for AAAs."
"9241168","Military occupational exposure to blast overpressure from improvised explosive devices can lead to mild traumatic brain injury (blast-TBI), resulting in debilitating persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) and psychological dysfunction, but diagnoses and treatment options are limited. Common PPCS complaints of Veterans with blast histories include both cognitive difficulties and physiological symptoms. Likewise, common psychological dysfunctions include impulse control disorders, substance abuse, post traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety, but the causal mechanisms remain unknown. Therefore, increases in preclinical research efforts using rodent models are required to provide much needed insight into the underlying mechanisms by which blast-TBI contributes to subsequent dysfunction. While rodent models of blast-TBI have largely focused on potential memory-related cognitive effects, no study to date has utilized rodent models to examine the effects of blast exposure on impulsivity or attention, which are common and recurring complaints of blast exposed Veterans and are highly implicated in psychological dysfunction among civilian populations. Likewise, the neuromodulator dopamine plays a critical role in reward processing and decision making, and in civilian populations, perturbations of phasic dopamine release have been implicated in a variety of psychological dysfunctions that are similar in nature to those seen following blast-TBI. Surprisingly, few studies to date have investigated a role for dopamine dysfunction following blast exposure. The current proposal seeks to fill these knowledge gaps and will combine a mouse model of blast-induced TBI, fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to measure subsecond nucleus accumbens (NAc) phasic dopamine release, and behavioral measures of impulsivity and attention. Aim one will examine the near and long-term consequences of single and repetitive blast exposure on the mesolimbic dopamine system using FSCV and electrical stimulation of discrete brain regions. Aim two will examine the near and long-term consequences of single and repetitive blast exposure on measures of impulsivity and attention, and will determine a potential role for augmented phasic dopamine release following blast in these behaviors. In rodent models, maladaptive measures of impulsivity and attention have been linked to an increase in phasic NAc dopamine neurotransmission. Therefore, based on the large number of blast-TBI Veterans presenting with impulsivity and attention impairments and our preliminary data demonstrating a blast-induced increase in impulsivity related behaviors and stimulated phasic dopamine release, we hypothesize that blast exposure will result in increased NAc dopamine release that in turn drives maladaptive measures of impulsivity and attention. These experiments are intended to further our understanding of the behavioral and neurochemical mechanisms underlying blast-TBI dysfunction, and will be an important preclinical step in elucidating potential treatment targets and strategies.  My overall goals of the CDA2 application are: (i) To create a translational research program to investigate the near and long term effects of blast-TBI on subsequent cognitive, psychological and dopaminergic dysfunction. (ii) To develop new skills and understanding of rodent models of blast-TBI, as well as the clinical issues facing Veterans with and without blast-TBI histories so that my research is both informed by and has the potential to inform future preclinical and clinical lines of research. (iii) To gain working knowledge and expertise in statistical techniques for use with advanced behavioral assays and large data sets. (iv) Lastly, by virtue of these goals, to clearly differentiate myself as an independent VA investigator who is both unique from my mentors and complementary to their efforts in helping Veterans with blast-TBI histories."
"9177770","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The stimulant methylphenidate (MPH) is the most commonly prescribed psychoactive medication in children. An abundance of studies attest to the efficacy of MPH for attenuating inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive symptoms in children with ADHD. Despite its efficacy, most children with ADHD who are prescribed MPH have poor continuity of treatment for a variety of reasons, including forgetting to administer the medication and delays obtaining refills. In addition, it is an accepted clinical practice for physicians to omt MPH for periods of time, such as during the summer or on weekends (i.e., drug holidays). Since MPH discontinuation is considered to be benign, many clinicians do not employ any special procedures or inform families of any special precautions in regard to its cessation. However, increasing evidence suggests that the pharmacological effects of MPH cause lasting changes in brain neurochemistry that persist beyond medication discontinuation. Moreover, these neurobiological effects of discontinuation appear to have neurobehavioral consequences. In fact, our preliminary data suggest that MPH discontinuation results in post-discontinuation worsening in behavioral, neuropsychological, and academic functioning that is compromised to the point of being significantly worse than prior to starting medication, and these effects persist as long as 2-3 weeks after the last dose of MPH. Moreover, the magnitude of discontinuation-related worsening is comparable to, or larger than, the magnitude of benefits seen from MPH treatment. There is a critical need to better understand the breadth and magnitude of the neurobehavioral effects caused by MPH discontinuation as well as to better understand the temporal trajectory of these deleterious effects. Hence, the primary goal of the proposed research is to conduct the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial specifically designed to study the negative effects of MPH discontinuation at multiple time points. 180 children diagnosed with ADHD will participate across two recruitment sites. After randomization to either a MPH discontinuation, sustained MPH, or sustained placebo condition, a comprehensive multi-time point, multi-informant (parents, teachers, study staff) and multi-modal (behavior/mood/affect ratings scales, direct behavior observations, standardized testing) assessment will be used to assess a broad range of neurobehavioral outcomes across the three groups. We will examine the magnitude and time course of effects of MPH discontinuation on behavioral as well as cognitive and academic functioning in children with ADHD. Furthermore, we will examine moderators of the adverse effects of MPH discontinuation on these outcomes to aid in the identification of those who are at increased risk."
"9243460","Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) affects 10,000 premature infants annually with an estimated cost of $2.4 billion. Up to a third of infants with BPD go on to develop pulmonary hypertension (PH), leading to worse long-term outcomes and increased mortality. Thus far, no effective therapies have been identified for BPD- associated PH. However, data from animal models suggest that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) and extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD) may hold promise as therapeutic targets in PH. PDE5 contributes to vasoconstriction by catabolizing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a critical pulmonary vasodilator. We have previously demonstrated that oxidative stress, a key mediator in the mouse model of hyperoxic lung injury, activates PDE5 and leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling. Overexpression of the antioxidant ecSOD has been shown to protect the lung against hyperoxia in the newborn mouse.  Our published and preliminary data in the mouse model of hyperoxic lung injury demonstrates that hydrocortisone, a glucocorticoid with a known safety profile in premature infants, normalizes hyperoxia-induced PDE5 activation and increases ecSOD protein in vitro, and decreases right ventricular hypertrophy in vivo. We believe that hydrocortisone has a direct effect on the pulmonary vasculature and thus represents a novel treatment for neonatal pulmonary hypertension. Our central hypothesis is that HC reverses hyperoxia- induced changes in the pulmonary vasculature through attenuation of aberrant PDE5 activity and oxidative stress via upregulation of ecSOD. We will utilize isolated mouse pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, the murine model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury, and ecSOD knockout mice to characterize the direct effects of hydrocortisone on pulmonary vasculature and on vascular signaling pathways. These findings will lay the foundation for the use of hydrocortisone as novel therapy in pulmonary hypertension, and add new knowledge about the role of PDE5 and ecSOD in pathophysiology and treatment of BPD-associated PH.  The candidate?s long-term career goal is to become an independently funded researcher with expertise in glucocorticoid signaling and pulmonary vascular pathophysiology. The short-term goal during the award period is to elucidate the specific pathways and mechanisms by which glucocorticoids affect neonatal pulmonary vasculature. The candidate?s career development plan involves didactic and skill acquisition training, career development activities, and a mentored research experience. This innovative work will be mentored by Dr. Kathryn Farrow, an expert in pulmonary vascular biology and nitric oxide signaling pathways in the pulmonary vasculature, with additional guidance of a highly experienced advisory team. This work is complimented by the academic environment at Northwestern University, the strength of the pulmonary research being conducted in the Department of Pediatrics, and the commitment of the Division of Neonatology and the Department of Pediatrics to the support and development of junior clinician scientists."
"9381157","Tumor is a living organ. Effective cancer treatment must deal with not only the genetic alterations within tumor cells, but also the supportive tumor microenvironment (TME). Our lab studies the roles of TME in medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor. Although improved radiation and chemotherapy greatly boosted patient survival rates, traditional treatment often leads to devastating side effects in young children. Since aberrant sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in granule neuron precursors (GNPs) is a common cause of desmoplastic medulloblastoma, inhibitors of the Shh pathway that can effectively kill tumor cells have been developed. However, toxicity in patients and mutations that resist these inhibitors greatly reduced their clinical applicability. To identify additional mechanisms that could alleviate that problem, we set out to investigate mechanisms of tumor-TME interactions with mouse genetic models and found the prominent presence of astrocytes and tumor-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs). We also screened a panel of growth factors with qRT-PCR, and found that IGF1 fits the bill as a TME factor since it is consistently elevated in the tumor mass, but is absent from tumor GNPs. Further studies showed that IGF1 greatly promoted proliferation of tumor GNPs in culture, and that the loss of IGF1R specifically in GNPs led to halted tumor progression. Using in situ hybridization, we pinpointed TAMs but not other cell types as the IGF1-secreting TME cell type. Co-culture of tumor cells with TAMs led to sustained proliferation, an effect abrogated by the IGF1-blocking agent. Finally, we found that IL-4 is produced by astrocytes in the TME, which is known to promote IGF1 expression in microglia/macrophages. In conclusion, we have identified a TME network that centered on IGF1 signaling to promote medulloblastoma progression. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that disrupting the TME-tumor crosstalk along the IGF1 axis should be an effective therapeutic strategy for medulloblastoma. In this grant application, we propose to test our hypothesis by directly inhibiting IGF1R signaling in tumor cells, by removing IGF1 from TAMs, and by cutting off the IL-4 signaling from astrocytes to TAMs thus reduce their IGF1 production. We have assembled a team of experts in mouse genetics, immunology, and human brain tumor pathology, and are confident that our studies will contribute to the development of highly effective, novel treatment strategies. In the long term, the principles that emerge from our studies should not only benefit medulloblastoma patients, but also provide a basis for innovative therapies for other neurological diseases."
"9197975","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to the location of the salivary glands in the oral cavity they are frequently an unintended target in patients treated with irradiation for head and neck cancer, resulting in permanent and often severe salivary gland hypofunction. Loss of saliva production can be debilitating as it affects digestion and chewing, and can result in increased chronic oral infections and diminished quality of life. Apoptosis of salivary epithelial cells, particularly acinar cells, is a major contributor to salivary gland damage and impaired secretory function in irradiated glands. We have shown that protein kinase C delta (PKC?) is required for apoptosis induced by ?- irradiation and other genotoxic agents in cultured parotid cells and in the parotid gland in vivo. The long-term goal of my lab is to understand how PKC? regulates apoptosis and to use this information to develop therapeutic strategies to suppress apoptosis in the salivary gland. Our work has defined how PKC? functions to regulate apoptosis in salivary cells, and has revealed a highly regulated pathway that controls nuclear import of PKC?, assuring that salivary acinar cells die only in response to specific damage signals. Importantly, we have identified critical steps in this process such as tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC? that can be targeted therapeutically. As tyrosine phosphorylation initiates pro-apoptotic signaling by PKC?, inhibiting the tyrosine kinases that mediate this step may suppress apoptosis in the salivary gland of patients undergoing head and neck irradiation. Here we will probe the mechanism by which the tyrosine kinases Src and c-Abl phosphorylate and activate PKC?, and explore the hypothesis that tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be used prophylactically to suppress apoptosis and loss of salivary gland function in response to irradiation. Our studies will also explore downstream targets of PKC? in the context of irradiation damage and address the hypothesis that PKC? regulates activation of the Extra-cellular-Regulated-Kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathway in the context of apoptosis. These later studies may identify additional therapeutic targets. As many tyrosine kinase and MEK inhibitors are FDA approved for cancer therapy; these classes of drugs could potentially be rapidly translated in to the clinic for use in patients receiving radiation therapy. Thus our studies may have a rapid and profound impact on the oral health and quality of life of the 45,000 patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer each year who face the prospect of loss of salivary gland function as a result of irradiation therapy."

Peter Devreotes and Jeff Segall, who organized the first meeting held in 2005, envisioned developing a forum fostering interactions among scientists with a strong interest in gradient sensing and directed cell migration. After 12 years, the conference is considered to be the top research conference in cell migration. The program for the 2017 conference, to be held January 21-27 at Hotel Galvez, Galveston, TX, brings together cell migration scientists from diverse disciplines, including molecular and cancer biologists, immunologists, developmental biologists, cell biologists, molecular biologists, engineers and physicists. A strong emphasis will be placed on (1) basic mechanisms of cell migration at the levels of signal transduction and actin assembly, (2) inclusion of researchers that work with model systems as well as in vivo systems, (3) the study of cell migration during development, leukocyte trafficking, wound healing, and cancer invasion and metastasis and (4) comparing and contrasting single-cell versus collective cell migration in 2- and 3- dimensional environments. The aims of the conference are to: (1) provide a forum for the discussion of cutting edge research and controversies in the area of directed cell migration, with the goal of bridging molecular/biochemical, cellular and organismal scales, (2) promote both formal and informal scientific exchanges among scientists investigating directed cell migration, including young scientists, women, and scientists from underrepresented minority backgrounds, and (3) discuss recent advances especially relevant to the biology of cancer invasion and metastasis. To accomplish these aims, the 2017 Conference will bring together an international cadre of young and senior scientists from academia that will interact in an atmosphere conducive to the free exchange of ideas. As in 2015, the 2017 GRC will be preceded by a GRS on Directed Cell Migration, organized by young researchers (Joseph Campanale and Brian Graziano). This event will help nurture junior researchers towards a successful and rewarding career in the field of cell migration. The GRS will be opened by Dr. Paul Kulesa (Stowers Institute), who will discuss neural crest migration. The closing GRS lecture will be given by Dr. Fanny Jaulin (Gustave Roussy) on imaging human colon cancer spread in ex vivo culture. Eight talks selected from the abstracts and two poster sessions will allow for engaged interactions and discussions. In addition, an informal ?Ask the PI? seminar with the Chairs and Keynote Speakers on career development in the field of cell migration will be included. For both, the GRC and GRS, financial support is needed to assure that the meeting will be successful and will provide needed sponsorship for travel and registration of invited speakers and other selected participants."
"9389158","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed K01 award will provide a 5-year training program to enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of child maltreatment etiology and prevention. The primary focus is to relate biobehavioral patterns of parent-child coregulation in high-risk families to individual differences in the antecedents and outcomes associated with child maltreatment. Specific aims are to: (a) examine whether parent-child coregulation of physiology, affect, and behavior buffers families at risk for maltreatment from poor parenting, child self-regulation problems, and maltreatment incidence; and (b) examine how parent-child coregulation in response to experimental challenge and repair conditions relates to profiles of healthy, abusive, and neglectful parenting behaviors. Long-term objectives include using these findings to inform the enhanced tailoring of child maltreatment prevention approaches according to parent-child profiles of biobehavioral coregulation. Study methods will involve a longitudinal design with observational and/or questionnaire assessments at child ages 2.5, 3, and 4 years old, which will allow for the study of both dynamic micro-level patterns in response to experimental conditions in the laboratory and the modeling of macro-level developmental trajectories of child maltreatment risk across early childhood. The candidate will conduct training with Drs. Manfred Diehl and Pamela Cole, experts in self-regulation and coregulation across the lifespan from normative and developmental psychopathology perspectives; Dr David Olds, an expert in early preventive interventions with high-risk families that have been shown to prevent child maltreatment; and Drs. Kristin Buss and Elizabeth Skowron, who will offer hands-on laboratory expertise in the assessment and analysis of physiological regulation and coregulation in maltreated parent-child dyads, respectively. Drs. Steven Boker and Ruth Feldman will act as statistical consultants in dynamic time series analytic methods. Training goals are to: (1) develop skill in the use, analysis, and interpretation of physiological data; (2) develop skill in dynamic time series statistical methods with which to analyze multiple, concurrent real-time data streams within and across interaction partners; (3) enhance expertise in observational research with populations at risk for child maltreatment and the implications of basic research for child maltreatment prevention; and (4) continue professional development through scientific publications and presentations, grant writing, and training in the responsible conduct of research. The activities proposed for this award will provide a firm foundation for investigating how individual differences in dyadic biobehavioral coregulation act as markers of child maltreatment risk and therefore reduce heterogeneity in our understanding of child maltreatment etiology. This work will provide an unprecedented level of detail in early risk factors for child maltreatment, which will offer prevention scientists and practitioners more specific targets with which to better tailor existing maltreatment prevention programs."
"9203047","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current treatments for breast cancer focus on the killing malignant cells but there is a substantial population of patients for whom these approaches ultimately fail. The long-term objective of this work is to develop an adjuvant therapy that targets the tumor-promoting stroma of cancer as a way to potentiate current approaches. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are activated in the tumor microenvironment and facilitate disease progression by promoting angiogenesis and tumor cell growth, and by suppressing the adaptive immune response. We have recently identified a peptide that preferentially recognizes murine tumor-associated macrophage but not resting macrophage, other leukocytes, or tumor cells. In this work, we will prepare multivalent targeting constructs to deliver pro-apoptotic agents to TAMs in a mouse model of mammary cancer. In addition, we will develop analogous targeting peptides for human TAMs. These technologies will be combined in a new construct for targeted ablation of human TAMs. Our goal is to move this technology toward clinical development and to provide an adjuvant treatment that is effective even for women with hormone-unresponsive or triple negative breast cancer."
"9411499","Project Summary/Abstract Every year, approximately 1,200 severe mistreatments happen in radiation therapy. Radiation therapy lawsuits rank in the top third of all medical specialties with an average of $313,000 per claim settled or litigated. The current method for detecting treatment errors is by a weekly patient chart check, where each treatment record is manually reviewed on a weekly basis. This labor-intensive and inefficient method prevents us from detecting the treatment error at an early stage. Here we propose a novel software system, ChartAlert, for automating patient chart checking. ChartAlert is a near real-time adaptive electronic checking system that can be configured to support different clinical workflows and different sources of patient treatment chart data in radiotherapy. We have already developed preliminary software based on the clinical workflow of our clinics. Our preliminary data indicated its effectiveness in automated patient chart checking. In this proposal, we will extend ChartAlert to general radiation oncology clinics. We will demonstrate the feasibility of the ChartAlert approach and its advantages over the standard manual checking method. We will determine the software specifications, design and implement a proof-of-concept system, and verify the proposed system at the partner site. Successful completion of these aims will demonstrate the feasibility and commercial potential of the ChartAlert approach. Ultimately, this work will result in an intelligent patient chart checking software, which will increase patient chart check efficiency, save staff time, improve cancer patient treatment safety, and preventing potential lawsuits."
"9278081","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial of treatment duration for male urinary tract infection (UTI). Specifically, 319 men with a UTI will be randomized to 7 vs. 14 days of antimicrobial treatment. The primary outcome is resolution of UTI symptoms, assessed 14 days after completing active antimicrobial treatment. Secondary outcomes include recurrent UTI in the 4 weeks after treatment, adverse drug events, and intestinal carriage of antimicrobial resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Subjects will be enrolled from the Primary Care Clinic and Emergency Department at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center (MVAMC). Currently, the optimal treatment duration for male UTI is unknown. A clinical trial of 14 vs. 28 days of treatment showed no difference in outcomes, whereas another trial of 3 vs.14 days showed an increase in recurrence with 3 days of treatment. However, current treatment recommendations are to treat men with UTI for 7 to 14 days, and no data exist to favor the shorter or longer duration. Most men with UTI in the VA are treated for more than 7 days, which is associated with a small but significant increase in Clostridium difficile infection. Additionally, other studies of non-UTI infectious diseases have shown that longer-duration treatment leads to increased antimicrobial resistance. Longer- duration treatment is also more costly and inconvenient to patients. Thus, since longer-duration treatment is associated with some adverse outcomes, in order to justify longer-duration treatment thee must be some clinically significant benefit to the extended treatment. Accordingly, the proposed randomized placebo-controlled trial of 319 men with UTI will test the hypothesis that 7 days of antimicrobial treatment is non-inferior for the resolution f UTI symptoms when compared to 14 days of treatment. This study will provide valuable information to VA patients and clinicians regarding a common and understudied clinical decision."
"9240512","PROJECT SUMMARY Pan-Genomic Approaches for Comprehensive Screening of Novel or Emerging Infectious Agents in Blood  Emerging infectious agents, the latest of which is Zika virus, continually threaten the safety of the 15 million transfusions performed annually in the United States, yet the lack of diagnostic tools to comprehensively test for all bloodborne pathogens or to identify infections from novel viruses has greatly hindered surveillance efforts. In a previous grant, we have pioneered the development of microarray and metagenomic sequencing-based approaches to comprehensively screen blood for both known and novel pathogens, and have identified a number of novel viruses circulating in human blood. We have established long-term collaborations with national and international collaborators who will provide us with clinical and donor blood samples from individuals infected with chikungunya, dengue, Ebola, Zika, Lassa, and West Nile virus, as well as non-viral pathogens (e.g. Babesia microti and Plasmodium falciparum), for analysis. This project proposes (1) to develop an accurate and comprehensive yet practical sequencing-based platform (BloodSeq) for simultaneous detection and whole-genome characterization of all American Association of Blood Banks (AABB)-priority pathogens in infected patients and blood donations, (2) to discover and further describe the epidemiology and potential pathogenicity of novel infectious viruses that pose a potential threat of bloodborne transmission, and (3) to define complementary host response biosignatures for transfusion-transmissible pathogens using transcriptome profiling, especially in asymptomatic infected donors. A key deliverable from this 5-year project will be implementation of the BloodSeq platform by public health agencies such as the American Red Cross for comprehensive bloodborne pathogen screening of the blood supply.The results from these studies will advance genomic sequencing technologies as validated screening tools to ensure transfusion safety, with significant clinical and public health implications."
"9193634","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Topic Area and rationale: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic immune disease that affects millions of Americans and has significant health and economic burden. Although the etiology of IBD remains unknown, disease pathogenesis is attributed in part to the increased infiltration and aberrant inflammatory responses of effector CD4+ T cells in the intestine lamina propria. Blocking of leukocyte trafficking has proved to be effective therapeutic strategy. However, mechanisms that govern CD4+ T cell migration to the colon have precluded colitis-selective treatment, as colon-specific trafficking molecules are poorly defined. Background & Hypothesis: We recently identified GPR15 as a T cell-expressed colon-specific trafficking receptor that plays a significant role in experimental colitis. We found high expression of GPR15 on colon Th2 cells of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients but is absent in mouse Th2 cells. In contrast to the mouse, human colon Tregs in both IBD and non-IBD patients do not seem to express GPR15. Detailed analysis of GPR15 expression in mouse versus human colon led us to identify species differences in Th2 versus Treg expression that correlated with preferential binding of Th2-associated GATA3 vs. Treg-associated Foxp3 transcription factor binding to human and mouse GPR15 enhancers, respectively. In addition to GPR15 expression on colon Th2 cells of UC, significant proportion of the GPR15+ CD4+ effector T cells in the IBD and non-IBD colons lack Th1 or Th17 cytokine expression. As a result, one of the project's goals is to further characterize the non-Th2 colon GPR15+ CD4+ effector T cells and understand their functional significance. Unlike the GATA3 binding motif, there exist two conserved binding sites for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in the GPR15 enhancer. Thus, our overall goal is to determine regulation of GPR15 and define T cell trafficking molecules in the human colon and compare to the mouse. In aim 1 we will characterize and define CD4+ T effector cells in the normal and inflamed human colon and test the hypothesis that GPR15+ CD4+ T effector cells represent specialized functional subset(s) in the colon under homeostasis and colitis. In aim 2 we will determine mechanisms that regulate GPR15 expression in the mouse and human, and test the hypothesis that GPR15 is AHR-regulated protein that plays a role in intestinal trafficking of effector T cells in response to AH ligands. Under aim 3 we will define dendritic cells that regulate GPR15 expression on CD4+ T effector cells in the colon and test the hypothesis that subset(s) of colon dendritic cells are efficient in priming colon homing CD4+ T effector cells. Significance & Impact: In order to develop new specific therapeutic targets and understand the pathogenesis of IBD/colitis, it is essential to elucidate the cellular mechanisms by which effector T cells gain access to the colon. The short-term impact of understanding colon T cell trafficking will be to define role and regulation of colon specific T cell trafficking receptors. The potential long-term impact is of gret clinical significance, as our studies could lead to development of colon T cell specific targets as potent new IBD therapeutics."
"9185308","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoblast differentiation and bone formation are controlled by a wide range of extracellular signals including cell-extracellular matrix interaction, matrix stiffness, biomechanical force, hormones, growth factors and morphogens. To induce differentiation, each stimulus must initiate a signal that can be efficiently dispersed through the genome to induce global changes in gene expression necessary for the osteoblastogenesis while simultaneously suppressing other lineages. The following hypothesis is proposed to explain how this is accomplished: i) After exposure to an osteogenic stimulus, P-ERK1/2 translocates to the nucleus and binds chromatin of osteoblast target genes via specific docking sites on Runx2. ii) By phosphorylating RUNX2 on specific sites, kinases initiate chromatin remodeling and transcription; the overall level of RUNX2 phosphorylation is a reflection of the various extracellular stimuli to which the cell is exposed. iii) Conversely, kinases may phosphorylate other lineage-specific transcription factors on chromatin to suppress non-osteogenic lineages such as adipocytes. This hypothesis will be tested by achieving the following aims: 1. Evaluate the role of MAP kinase phosphorylation of RUNX2 and PPAR? in the reciprocal control of osteogenesis and adipogenesis. 2. Evaluate the role of RUNX2 phosphorylation by ERK1/2 in the control of fluid flow shear stress (FFSS)-induced osteoblast gene expression. 3. Determine the role of Runx2 S301,S319 phosphorylation in skeletal development and remodeling.  Experiments include detailed epigenetic analyses of chromatin changes accompanying osteoblast versus adipocyte differentiation as well as genomic analysis using chromatin immunoprecipitation and next generation sequencing. These studies will test a new model for global control of gene expression that may explain how osteogenic stimuli, including extracellular matrix signals and mechanical loading, can reprogram the genome to stimulate osteoblast differentiation while suppressing other lineages such as adipocytes. Once this model is understood, it will be possible to manipulate osteogenic signals to optimize bone formation during remodeling and regeneration. Furthermore, this work will test the validity of using RUNX2 phosphorylation-site specific antibodies to monitor activation of this factor under different physiological conditions. This may have applications for diagnosis of osteoporosis and other bone disorders, such as osteoarthritis and certain cancers."
"9242450","Project Summary/Abstract  Despite the high rate of recurrence following therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) and relatively rapid pace of cancer stem-like cell research in solid tumors, researches are impeded due to limited knowledge of the CRC epithelial stem cell hierarchy and complex heterogeneity of the disease. Recent evidences suggest that colorectal tumors comprise a small fraction of cancer stem-like cells that seed the tumor bulk and may be responsible for metastasis, resistance to therapy, and tumor recurrence. Others (Buess et al., 2004) and we (Halder et al, 2006) have shown that STRAP (Serine Threonine Kinase Receptor Associated Protein) is significantly upregulated in colorectal carcinomas including metastases, and upregulation of STRAP in CRC patients contributes to worse survival with chemotherapy, suggesting its potential contribution to the aggressive disease and chemoresistance. Therefore, understanding the functional role of STRAP in CRC metastasis, in the maintenance of cancer stem-like cells, and in chemoresistance is very crucial.  We identified the novel WD-domain containing protein called STRAP that binds with both TGF-ß receptor complex and Smad7, and inhibits TGF-ß signaling. We have shown that STRAP is upregulated in several cancers, induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition (Kashikar et al, 2010), and promotes cell growth and tumorigenicity in vitro in a TGF-ß-independent manner (Halder et al, 2006). Our preliminary data suggest that STRAP regulates the expression of MMPs, and Wnt/ß-catenin and Notch signaling. To determine the role of STRAP in vivo, we have recently generated Strap knock out mice, which is embryonic lethal at 9.5 dpc. Azoxymethane treatment of the Strap heterozygous mice produces fewer and smaller tumors when compared with wild type mice. To study the effect of STRAP in an organ specific manner, we have also generated conditional knock out mice using the Cre-lox approach. Therefore, little is known about the TGF-ß- independent role of STRAP in intestinal cancer metastasis and chemoresistance. Based on the background information and our preliminary results, we have formulated the following hypotheses: Upregulation of STRAP in colorectal cancer plays an active role in metastasis and its functional interaction with Wnt/ß-catenin and Notch pathway is involved in colon cancer stem-like cell self-renewal and chemoresistance. The following Specific Aims are proposed to test these hypotheses: Aim 1: Determine the mechanism of how STRAP contributes to colorectal cancer metastasis. Aim 2: Determine the role of STRAP in the maintenance and self- renewal of colon cancer stem-like cells. Aim 3: Determine the role of STRAP in regulating chemoresistance of colorectal cancer.  Impact: Despite the development of treatment regimens, metastasis remains the most critical determinant of survival, as median survival for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is 5 months among veterans. Moreover, drug resistance and relapse of cancers are the other two critical survival-influencing factors of CRC. Completion of the proposed aims will uncover the novel function of STRAP in CRC metastasis, stem-like cell self-renewal, and drug resistance. The outcome of this project will provide strong translational potential to develop therapeutics by targeting STRAP for this un-targetable aggressive disease. This basic and preclinical biomedical research will include two priority research areas of specific interest to BLR&D, risky behavior related to smoking and women's health (RFA# BX-16-001)."
"9236127","Project Summary  Our long-term goal is to advance biomedical science by uncovering the mechanisms of proteins, such as K+ channels that underlie numerous physiologically and pathologically important processes including neuronal activity, blood pressure regulation and cardiac rhythmicity (or arrhythmias). Knowledge of protein mechanisms constitutes the necessary foundation for us to understand physiological and pathophysiological processes, and devise therapeutic strategies to treat diseases. The goal of this proposal is to develop a visible light microscope and use it to quantitatively examine angstrom-scale conformational changes of both soluble and membrane proteins on a physiologically relevant time scale, and to use this technique to uncover, for example, the control mechanisms of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels.  Crystallography has produced abundant useful protein structures for understanding protein function. However, full understanding of a protein molecule must include both its spatial and temporal characteristics. We thus need to go beyond describing a protein merely with static pictures and, instead, represent it with a real-time motion picture, i.e., a digital model that simultaneously exhibits both its structural and its kinetic mechanisms with embedded energetic information. However, the required experimental information about protein dynamics is often lacking, due to the absence of relatively general methods for reliably tracking angstrom-scale conformational changes of a protein. Generally, such small changes can be reliably and quantitatively resolved only with such structural techniques as crystallography or Cryo-EM, which, unfortunately, lack time resolution. Conventional light microscopy, on the other hand, may be time-resolved but its spatial resolution remains too low to resolve angstrom-scale changes, despite the landmark achievement with ~20 nm resolution of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy.  In the spirit of innovation, we will build a visible-light microscope?with angstrom- and millisecond-scale resolution?to examine multi-state protein-conformational changes in a single protein molecule. We will first develop it using the isolated, soluble control domain of Ca2+-dependent K+ channels as a model, and then extend the technique to membrane proteins, using intact channels. Additionally, in these studies, we will also systematically investigate the energetics and kinetics of the control (or ligand-gating) domain in these channels, information necessary for building a quantitative, mechanistic model that accounts of Ca2+- dependent gating-conformational changes. Such mechanistic inquiry cannot be carried out with existing electrophysiological and microscopic techniques. Success of our proposed study will transform the way we investigate the dynamics/kinetics of protein conformational changes, and accelerate the transition from the current, mostly static approach of structural biology to dynamic structural biology."
"9236096","Bladder cancer (BlCa) in the US is estimated to account for ~74,000 new cases of cancer and ~16,000 deaths in 2015. Despite research efforts, treatment options for muscle invasive cancers have remained largely unchanged for the past 30 years. BlCa is characterized by a gender disparity where men are three times more likely to develop BlCa than women. The theory that the androgen receptor (AR) and androgen signaling is involved in the etiology and progression of this disease is supported by numerous studies showing that AR signaling has a role in this malignancy. Our preliminary studies revealed that BlCa cells express varying levels of full length and low molecular weight (LMW) AR isoforms. LMW AR isoforms missing the ligand binding domain (LBD) are constitutively active and our studies found that cells expressing such variants are refractory to inhibition by AR antagonists, but sensitive to siRNA (against N-terminal AR) mediated AR depletion. The decreased cell viability following AR depletion is due to an increase in apoptosis and expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1. The LMW AR has several origins, but in multiple prostate cancers is due to the expression of AR splice variants that are missing the LBD. An analysis of AR splice variants most commonly expressed in prostate tumors shows that the V7 and V1 variants are also expressed in some bladder cancer cells. siRNA-mediated depletion of the V7 variant reduces cell viability. Additionally, using 3'RACE studies we have identified a novel AR splice isoform which is expressed in two cell lines and two of five primary tumors. Treatment of cells expressing abundant LMW AR levels with the AR N- terminal domain targeting inhibitor EPI-001 effectively attenuates cell viability at a dose comparable to what was observed for prostate tumor cells. These results lead to the hypothesis that full length and LMW AR isoforms direct distinct transcriptional programs in BlCa cells and ablation of AR signaling impairs BlCa cell survival. The proposed studies have three specific aims that will test this hypothesis and define how the AR isoforms contributes to bladder tumorigenesis. The goals of Specific Aim 1 are to further characterize the novel AR isoform, and assess the levels of the LMW AR in bladder tumor and control bladder tissue, in Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) and in bladder cancer derived cell lines. This analysis will provide a broad overview of the prevalence of AR isoforms in bladder cancer cells. Studies in Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that specific AR isoforms have distinct effects on cell viability and total AR ablation effectivity inhibits cell and tumor growth. In vivo isoform specific sh-RNA-mediated ablation will determine if targeting AR isoforms inhibits tumor growth. Treatment with EPI-001 will establish if this drug is a putative BlCa therapeutic. In Specific Aim 3 RNA-seq studies will test the hypothesis that the AR isoforms regulate a defined cohort of transcripts in BlCa-derived cells. The proposed studies are expected to define the importance of the LMW AR in bladder tumorigenesis and lead to the development of new strategies for the effective treatment of this malignancy.  "

We have developed a strong plan for evaluation of the training process including short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term outcomes."
"9229764","Abstract. Cytosolic and endosomal DNA sensing pathways are known to play a critical role in host defense against microbial pathogens. The same pattern recognition receptors also detect endogenous ligands and thereby promote the onset and progression of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. For example, endosomal TLRs contribute to the pathogenesis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosis (SLE), in part by promoting the production of type I IFNs. Cytosol DNA can be detected by a variety of receptors, including cGAS, which in turn generates an unusual cyclic dinucleotide that activates pathways downstream of STING. Overactivation of STING, either by loss of nuclease activity or STING gain-of-function mutations, also drives a strong type I IFN response now associated with diseases such as Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome. We have explored the potential crosstalk between cytosolic and endosomal sensors in murine SLE. Quite unexpectedly, we found that STING-deficient SLE-prone mice developed more severe, not less severe, clinical disease. These obser- vations point to a novel role for STING in the negative regulation of TLR-driven systemic autoimmunity. Our preliminary studies have led us to propose that constitutive activation of the STING pathway in hemato- poietic cells limits the inflammatory response of myeloid cells to TLR ligands, promotes the production of negative regulators of immune activation such as A20 and immunomodulatory enzymes such as Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and contributes to B cell tolerance induction; the nucleotidyl transferase DNA sensor cGAS acts upstream to recognize host DNA and regulate these STING-mediated effects. We will validate and explore this hypothesis through the following specific aims: (1) identify the cell types directly activated as a result of STING-deficiency; (2) explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for STING-mediated suppression of TLR-driven inflammation; and (3) determine the role of cGAS in the negative regulatory role of STING. To precisely compare STING-sufficient and STING-deficient macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells in models of SLE, we will utilize autoimmune-prone CD45 and Igh allelically distinct mixed bone marrow chimeras.This strategy will preclude any potential confounding factors arising from subclinical infection, changes in microbiome, or effects of disease driven inflammation. SLE is a complex chronic systemic autoimmune disease that afflicts over 1.5 million Americans. Current treatments involve immuno-suppressive regimens associated with debilitating adverse side effects. Attempts to develop safe and efficient therapies that block TLR activation have been stymied by the relative short in vivo half lives of known inhibitors and the potential dangerous outcome of complete MyD88 blockade. Better understanding of the natural regulators of the disease process will provide major insights toward the design of more disease-specific therapeutic options and also avoid the use of STING antagonists that could trigger unanticipated dangerous outcomes. Therefore, the mechanisms we are exploring are highly relevant to human disease and key to future targeted therapies."
"9239686","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Cancer death in CRC is mainly due to tumor recurrence and distant metastasis. Sprouty2 (SPRY2), an endogenous suppressor of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/ Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, acts as a tumor suppressor in breast, prostate, and liver cancer. We discovered oncogenic role of SPRY2 in CRC. The objectives of this application are to assess the requirement and significance of SPRY2 in CRC progression, treatment and recurrence. Studies demonstrated that upregulation of SPRY2 accentuates cancer phenotype whereas suppression of SPRY2 augments epithelial features and decreases epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). We hypothesize that deletion of SPRY2 will suppress CRC. To test this hypothesis, in AIM 1, SPRY2 LoxP/Vil-Cre ERT2 mouse model will be utilized. Effect of SPRY2 deletion on azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colonic tumorigenesis will be studied. It was further established that SPRY2 stable transfection significantly increased RTK cMet expression. Suppression of SPRY2 decreased endogenous and TGF-? induced cMet protein and mRNA expression. In AIM 2, we will delineate TGF-?/SPRY2 dependent transcriptional regulation of cMET in colon cancer cell lines. While inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are beneficial in the treatment of metastatic CRC, increases in cMet expression and EMT are resistance mechanism to anti-EGFR therapy. In AIM 3, effect of SPRY2 suppression on tumor growth (xenograft model) and metastasis (cecal implantation model) of gefitinib and cetuximab- resistant colon cancer cell lines will be investigated. We hypothesize that SPRY2 suppression will sensitize gefitinib and cetuximab-resistant colon cancer cells to anti-EGFR therapy. Studies will be extended to analyze effect of SPRY2 deletion during gefitinib treatment in vivo SPRY2 LoxP/Vil-Cre ERT2 mouse model. Significance of SPRY2 with tumor recurrence and long-term survival is not clear. In AIM 4, we hypothesize that SPRY2 expression in primary tumors may correlate directly with tumor recurrence and long-term survival. Further, as SPRY2 is the key regulator of Ras-dependent pathways, we have extended our investigations to assess the association of SPRY2 expression with Ras mutations [KRAS (codon 12, 13) and NRAS (codon 12, 13)] in recurrence. Implication of concomitance of SPRY2 expression and Ras mutations in primary tumors to disease outcome will be investigated. For this analysis sporadic stage II-III archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumors (FFPET) that are linked to outcomes at 5 years will be utilized. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a cancer promoting role of SPRY2 in CRC. We have established hypotheses based on our preliminary data and publications. The proposed study is a multi-pronged approach to assess the effect of SPRY2 deletion on tumor growth, examine the role of SPRY2 in acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and evaluate the significance of SPRY2 and Ras mutations in identifying patients with increased risk of tumor recurrence."
"9404108","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have previously demonstrated that the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) plays an important role in inflammation in atherosclerosis. Studies from our laboratory suggest a role for monocyte MR activation in monocyte/macrophage inflammation. Further, we have demonstrated a key role for candidate microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of MR (NR3C2) gene expression in monocytes and in the prediction of atherosclerosis. These findings suggest that miRNA expression predicts response to MR blockade in patients. We propose a randomized double blind clinical trial to assess the effect of MR antagonism on atherosclerosis in type II diabetes (DM). In Aim 1, we will test the effect of the MR antagonist Eplerenone (Epl) or placebo on progression of atherosclerosis using high resolution MRI. Key secondary outcomes will include central aortic blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, and measures of insulin resistance while tertiary measures include novel makers of heart failure predisposition. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that expression of monocyte miRNAs and macrophage phenotype may serve as markers of risk, disease progression, and response to MR antagonist. We propose investigating this in three, linked sub-aims. In Aim 2a, we will investigate the functional significance of single or multiple miRNAs involved in the regulation of MR expression using a promoter- reporter-3'UTR construct of the NR3C2 gene in cultured human macrophages. In Aim 2b, monocyte polarization and inflammatory genes will be compared at 6-weeks in Epl/placebo patients. In Aim 2c, at baseline we will measure the expression of miRNAs in monocytes predicted to regulate NR3C2. In addition we will measure NR3C2 transcript and/or protein expression in the same cells. Differential regulation of miRNAs after 6 weeks of treatment will be measured and used to understand disease progression and therapeutic effects of MR blockade. Using state of the art methods to quantify atherosclerosis with the latest advances in vascular biology, this proposal will offer an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate whether MR blockade is effective in atherosclerosis and further provide much needed insights on pathophysiologically relevant mechanisms and predictors of response. The insights from this study may lead to appropriately designed outcome trials."
"9257592","Project Summary Transcription is a critical yet a complex process that requires precise regulation to ensure normal development. A large number of molecules and regulatory elements in the genome should interact in combinatorial manner to determine when and where a gene needs to be turned on and off. Such complex nature of the process makes it challenging to understand the comprehensive mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Recent studies with state-of-the-art live imaging techniques provide clear evidence that transcription activity is dynamic, consisting of a series of sequential and stochastic bursts. While it is suggested that transcriptional bursting is a general property of gene expression across many species, the underlying cause of transcriptional bursting remains largely unknown. The experiments described in the proposal explore the potential role of unstable enhancer-promoter interactions as a cause of the transcriptional bursting. This research project proposes to test two aspects of the relationship between enhancer-promoter interactions and transcription. First, it will be determined whether transcriptional bursts arise from unstable enhancer- promoter interactions. While some studies with cultured cells suggested that bursts might arise from unstable assembly of pre-initiation complex or competitive binding of nucleosomes, there has been no effort to investigate the role of enhancers in this process. Drosophila embryos will be used as a model system, since extensive studies have identified hundreds of enhancers, and live imaging permits the detailed visualization of de novo transcription in development. The system is ideally suited for testing the hypothesis that stochastic enhancer-promoter interactions influence the frequency, duration, or amplitudes of transcriptional bursts. Second, the traditional looping models of enhancer-promoter interactions will be explored. It is generally assumed that enhancers that are bound to their cognate activators somehow loop to the target promoter. This looping process recruits the pre-initiation complex and allows the release of Pol II to start transcription. The preliminary results, however, suggest that this physical looping might not be required for transcription. A plasmid construct where two target promoters are regulated by a single shared enhancer was used to show that both promoters exhibit coordinated transcriptional bursts, turning on and off with similar dynamics. This provides a counter-example to the traditional looping models, whereby two reporter genes would display sequential bursts due to separate enhancer-promoter looping interactions. With combination of transgenesis, live imaging, and optogenetics, this research project proposes to force interactions of single enhancer- promoter loops and analyze the effect on transcription dynamics with quantitative image processing. The accomplishment of the proposed studies will provide a dynamic view of the nature of enhancer-promoter communication and how it can contribute to transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes."
"9396157","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hypothesis of the original grant was that fucosylation increases with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and that fucosylated glycoprotein(s) will make sensitive and specific markers of HCC. This hypothesis has been confirmed and in our analysis of over 1000 patient samples, we have clearly shown that fucosylated glycoproteins can make sensitive and specific markers of HCC, either alone or in combination with other markers. However, in our analysis, we have determined that in addition to core fucosylation there are many other changes that occur with liver disease. Some of these changes are cancer specific and can be used to complement our existing markers, while others can occur with just liver disease (inflammation) and lead to false positives. Thus in aim 1, we will develop novel and unique reagents that will dramatically improve our assays and continue our discovery efforts to find biomarkers that can be used clinically for the management of HCC. In aim 2 we will utilize our new lectins and continue our discovery efforts in an effort to find new biomarkers in biomarker negative populations that can complement our existing markers and lead to 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Finally in aim 3, we will test our lead markers in a NCI sponsored study comprising of over 350 cases of HCC and which we pre-qualified for. At the end of this 5 year period we will have validated our biomarkers and definitively proved our hypothesis that fucosylated proteins can make sensitive and specific markers of HC."
"9164695","Project Summary My aim is to become an independent investigator leading a cutting-edge lab, in a leading microbiology department or medical school, and to become a leader in the field of Staphylococcal disease and antibiotic tolerance of persister cells. To further my progress toward this goal, I am proposing a multifaceted approach to determine the mechanism of persister formation under biologically relevant conditions and identify novel compounds to kill tolerant cells. I possess the skills, background and training in the key areas for this application. I have carefully designed this proposal and have recruited world class collaborators and consultants to facilitate the accomplishment of the project goals during the period of award and their progression beyond. This award will provide critical support and will facilitate my securing of a position in a leading research institute. The award will provide invaluable financial support in my early career as an independent investigator and will allow me to focus solely on research output for the duration of the award. Furthermore, the K22 will allow me to acquire skills that will aid in my progress as a unique interdisciplinary independent investigator and will allow me to achieve full separation from my current supervisor. Specifically, I will learn how to; 1) run Tn- seq experiments, 2) perform screens with P. aeruginosa to investigate how microbial interaction influences persisters 3) examine antibiotic tolerance in the intracellular environment 4) translate findings to drug-discovery pipelines and establish screens for anti-persister antibiotics. I will apply these skills, along with my current repertoire of capabilities to establish my independence and produce more ground-breaking research in the field of Staphylococcus chronic infection and novel drug therapies. I have created a network of exceptional scientists. Their hugely diverse skillsets and dedication to continued collaboration will allow me to produce multi-disciplinary research projects and will continue to be an invaluable learning experience. The diversification of skills that I develop while managing these collaborations will contribute to my development as an independent investigator with a unique insight and skillset. In this proposal, I will examine antibiotic tolerance under relevant conditions, elucidating the factors determining antibiotic tolerance in a multi-species environment and the intracellular environment. I have shown that under regular growth conditions, persisters are essentially equivalent to stationary phase cells and antibiotic tolerance of these cells is due to a decrease in ATP. I have also identified regulators regulators rex and mgrA and the clpP peptidase that control persister formation. I have developed a fluorescence based system for sorting antibiotic tolerant persisters from a heterogeneous population. I have also identified and optimized the acyldepsipeptides as anti-persister antibiotics due to their activation of ClpP and independence of ATP. I have also shown that co-culture with P. aeruginosa induces antibiotic tolerance in S. aureus. I hypothesize that the susceptibility to bactericidal action of antibiotics is determined by ATP levels, which are dependent on intracellular metabolic pathway activity, and extracellular stimuli encountered during infection, and that killing low ATP persisters will improve outcome of infection. This hypothesis will be tested by the following 3 aims: 1. Determine the mechanism of S. aureus persister induction by P. aeruginosa. 2. Determine the mechanism of S. aureus persister formation in the intracellular environment. 3. Identify novel inhibitors of persister formation. This is a multi-faceted, multi-disciplinary project based on the further development of high impact work. The project is realistic and comprehensive and promises to deliver a more thorough understanding of how bacteria can withstand antibiotic treatment under relevant conditions. This approach will lead to the identification of novel antibiotic targets. Finally, this project will validate screens and identify lead compounds for drug discovery projects. This approach will specifically identify compounds that decrease tolerance to conventional antibiotics. The mechanism of action will shed further light on the nature of antibiotic tolerance while also acting as the foundation of an antibiotic development project."
"9257542","Proposal Summary (Abstract) Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells work well in treating patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but much less so in other more indolent B cell malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Improved CAR T cells are necessary to enhance antitumor efficacy in the treatment of these cancers. Our lab has recently demonstrated that constitutive expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD154) improves cytotoxicity and antitumor efficacy of CAR T cells in vitro and in an immune- compromised xenograft mouse model. My hypotheses are that CD40L-modified CAR T cells promote an improved antitumor response through several mechanisms: (i) by enhancing the activation of CAR T cells resulting in improved cytotoxicity and functional CAR T cell persistence; (ii) by increasing the immunogenicity of tumor cells leading to their recognition by host immune effector cells; and/or (iii) via activation of host immune cells to mediate a sustained endogenous antitumor response. The long-term objectives of this proposed study aim to investigate the biology of CD40L-modified CAR T cells to provide mechanistic insights into how CD40L-modified CAR T cells achieve an enhanced antitumor efficacy when compared to T cells expressing the CAR alone. The first specific aim will be to transfer the CD40L-modified CAR T cell platform into a fully immune-competent syngeneic lymphoma mouse model and to determine its antitumor efficacy. Based on preliminary data, we anticipate that the results of these proposed experiments will validate the use of CD40L-modified CAR in this setting. The second specific aim will determine the effect CD40L-modified T cells have on the immunogenic phenotype of tumor cells and their clearance. The third specific aim will be to investigate the ability of CD40L-modified CAR T cells to change the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment and to induce an antitumor response by endogenous T cells. The implications of this work will extend beyond its application in indolent B cell malignancies, but also provide insight into how genetic engineering of T cells can alter the tumor microenvironment and provide a rationale for utilizing this CD40L- based CAR T cell approach in solid tumors."
"9211345","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal sympathetic signaling through adrenergic receptors is a major cause for many cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, which is one of the leading health problems around the world. Sympathetic control is mediated mainly through norepinephrine, which signals via adrenergic receptors present on the surface of cardiac cells. Consistent with this, drugs targeting the adrenergic signaling pathway have been the mainstay for managing cardiovascular diseases and cardiac failure for many years. Adrenergic receptor activation initiates important regulatory events that cause their removal from the cell surface, which reduces cellular sensitivity to sympathetic stimuli. A critical sortin step in the endosome, which either recycles receptors back to the cell surface or directs them to be degraded, then decides whether and how fast cells recover their sensitivity. Recent evidence suggests that the sorting of receptors to specialized domains on the endosome that mediate recycling also allow receptors to interact with specialized signaling complexes and initiate signaling pathways with discrete functions. Research using prototypical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (B2AR), has established that GPCRs require specific sequences on their C-termini, as well as a set of proteins that interact with thes sequences, to enter this pathway and recycle. Disrupting these interactions redirects B2AR to the lysosome. Why this is so, considering that many other proteins can recycle via a bulk recycling pathway without any apparent requirements, is a fundamental question that has not been answered. This proposal addresses how B2AR is excluded from the bulk recycling pathway, and why this is important in adrenergic signaling. The experiments test the hypothesis that specific endosomal machinery actively excludes B2AR from the bulk recycling pathway, and that this exclusion regulates the bias of B2AR signaling from the endosome vs. the plasma membrane. The approach taken is to first identify the machinery that excludes B2AR from the bulk pathway, and then disrupt it to determine the consequences on signaling. A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate adrenergic receptor recycling will provide a platform for developing new therapeutic strategies against heart failure by identifying potential entry points for intervention. Further, as B2AR is a prototypical member of the G protein-coupled receptor family of signaling receptors, whose members show strong structural and functional similarities, the techniques developed and the principles identified will be broadly applicable to other members of this clinically relevant family of signaling receptors."
"9382931","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this proposal, we will determine how key innate immune response pathways to viral infection are altered in human cancer cells, particularly by comparing primary innate immune sentinel myeloid cells to their transformed counterparts. We will investigate the mechanistic roles of virus sensing pathways and their linkage to downstream innate immune responses via inflammasomes and NF-?B signaling in determining the tropism and sensing of myxoma virus (MYXV), a rabbit specific poxvirus that also exhibits the capacity to infect a wide spectrum of human cancer cells. We will investigate MYXV sensing and infection of human myeloid cells, especially monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. We will examine the molecular mechanisms used by MYXV-encoded pyrin domain (PYD)-containing host range protein M013 to co-regulate two distinct innate immune pathways of human myeloid cells, particularly as mediated by inflammasomes and by the NF-?B-mediated inflammatory signaling responses. We have reported that M013 binds the cellular adaptor protein ASC-1 (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) of various inflammasome complexes and NF-?B1/p105 of NF-?B signaling pathway. Investigation of this unique co-regulation will have potential clinical utility for developing drugs having the capacity o target multiple inflammatory signaling pathways. Finally, we will take advantage of our knowledge of regulation of the inflammasome and NF-?B pathways to study the mechanism(s) of oncolysis by MYXV using myeloid leukemia models. Using knock-out mice for key innate immune pathways and MYXV constructed mutated at the M013 locus, we will study the role of these pathways in MYXV virotherapy for myeloid cancer. The three overlapping areas to be investigated in this proposal are: Aim 1. Study the alteration of sensing pathways due to transformation of human myeloid cells and its impact on MYXV tropism: We will determine the role of RLR and TLR signaling in inducing type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines in human myeloid cells that are permissive for MYXV (eg transformed myeloid cell lines like THP-1) or nonpermissive (eg primary human monocytes/macrophages); determine the role of NLRP3 inflammasome components and NF-?B1 in the synthesis of precursor IL-1ß and IL-18 and release of these mature cytokines in response to MYXV infection; study the co-ordinating upstream role of virus-induced MAPK, in particular the role of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 kinases, in co-inducing both the type I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways in response to MYXV infection; and identify specifically which cellular sensor/transducer components become dysfunctional in transformed human myeloid cells. Aim 2. Create engineered variants of the PYD-containing protein M013 that differentially regulate the inflammasome and NF-?B signaling pathways and test these M013 constructs in an in vivo caspase 1- dependent rat transplant vascular disease model: We will generate M013 mutants that selectively inhibit either the inflammasome or NF-?B pathways by interaction with only ASC-1 or NF-?B1 and exploit these mutants to construct recombinant MYXVs to test their effects in the myeloid cells described above; we will also test M013 variants engineered to allow intracellular penetration in a rat allograft transplant vascular disease (TVD) model that has been shown to be regulated by inflammasome-mediated activation of caspase 1. Aim 3. Elucidate the roles of host inflammasomes and NF-?B signaling in MYXV-induced oncolytic clearance of myeloid cancer in situ: We will compare the roles of key inflammasome and  NF-?B components (ie ASC-1, caspase-1, NLRP3 and NF-?B1) in MYXV-induced anti-tumor responses and clearance of human (eg THP-1) or murine (eg RAW426.7) myeloid leukemias in NSG immunocompromised mice and in C57BL/6-based immunocompetent mouse models, respectively; study the role of M013 variants in selective knockout mice using the M013KO vs wild-type MYXV, and the M013 variant-expressing viruses that selectively inhibit only the inflammasome or NF-?B pathways."
"9263692","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The scientific study of language comprehension has proceeded along two largely independent lines of research: experiments that examine online sentence processing using measures such as eye-tracking during reading and event-related potentials (ERPs) on the one hand, and experiments that probe readers' offline interpretation of what was read on the other. The current project aims to bridge these two areas by investigating the extent to which behavioral and neural measures of online sentence processing can be used to predict readers' offline comprehension of what was read. The project focuses in particular on temporary structural ambiguities (garden-path sentences; e.g., While Anna dressed the baby played in the crib), as previous work has shown that readers differ considerably with respect to their online processing and offline interpretation of these types of sentences. Further, the projec examines how individual differences in two key cognitive constructs-working-memory capacity and print exposure-mediate the relationship between online processing and offline comprehension. The project addresses three specific aims: (1) What are the online reading-time patterns that give rise to correct versus incorrect offline interpretations of temporarily ambiguou sentences? (2) What are the online electrophysiological signatures that give rise to correct versus incorrect interpretations of temporarily ambiguous sentences? (3) How are the relationships between online processing and offline interpretation mediated by individual differences in working-memory capacity and print exposure? The project addresses these three specific aims in two experiments that employ eye-tracking and ERPs to measure online sentence processing, as well as comprehension questions to measure offline interpretation. In addition, reading-span and spatial-span tasks will be administered to assess working-memory capacity, and the Author Recognition Test will be administered to assess print exposure. The knowledge gained from this project will contribute to theoretical models and methodological advancement in the fields of psycholinguistics and the cognitive neuroscience of language."
"9208172","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanism and biology of widespread distal 3'UTR utilization in the CNS  The 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are the predominant location of cis-regulatory sequences that mediate post-transcriptional gene regulation. 3'UTRs can impart profound positive or negative regulatory impact on gene function, via diverse RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and short RNAs termed microRNAs (miRNAs). In recent years, it has been appreciated that alternative polyadenylation (APA) can induce 3'UTR variation according to cell-state, tissue identity or environmental condition, providing a strategy for coordinate post-transcriptional regulation of hundreds of genes. However, the molecular mechanisms of APA are mostly unknown and only for a few genes have the consequences of disrupting APA been studied in intact animals.  We recently described broad tissue-specific APA trends in Drosophila, including substantial 3'UTR lengthening in the central nervous system. This included hundreds of unannotated extensions, ranging into lengths unprecedented for experimentally- validated 3'UTRs of stable transcripts detected by Northern analysis. Our ongoing unpublished efforts reveal that these principles are broadly conserved in the mammalian brain. Altogether, the existence of these unexpectedly broad and long 3'UTR extensions has strong implications for gene regulation in the nervous system. In particular, we hypothesize that they mediate critical aspects of the unique post-transcriptional needs of neurons, imposed by their unusual cellular architecture.  Our extensive preliminary data are the basis of diverse experimental strategies that we propose to elucidate the genomic breadth, the biological utility, and mechanistic underpinning to neural 3'UTR lengthening in Drosophila and mammalian systems. The proposed work exploits our established expertise with transcriptome analysis, miRNAs, post-transcriptional control, and neural development and function. We believe that the knowledge gained from our mechanistic and functional studies will have direct relevance for human disease. Dysfunction of the neuronal APA network may induce neurological conditions, while ectopic activation of the 3'UTR lengthening mechanism should severely distort gene regulatory networks outside of the brain. Our multi-faceted research program should illuminate these processes."
"9382528","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous B-cell malignancy with no association with carcinogens, viruses, radiation or underlying genetic defect identified to date. The disease is characterized by an accumulation of mature B-cells in hematopoietic tissues and it is incurable at present. Cytosine methylation of mammalian genomic DNA is critical for normal physiological processes due to its contribution to transcriptional regulation of large sets of genes. Recent genome-wide analysis of human CLL samples revealed a global hypomethylation of the coding portion of the genome, suggesting involvement of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) in the pathogenesis of the disease. To induce hypomethylation, we conditionally inactivated Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in hematopoietic lineages in mice. Loss of Dnmt3a but not Dnmt3b in hematopoietic cells induces cellular transformation of B-cells and CLL, suggesting a tumor suppressor function for Dnmt3a in CLL development. The cellular and molecular basis of this function remains unclear. We hypothesize that the tumor suppressor function of Dnmt3a depends on DNA methylase activity, whose loss results in promoter hypomethylation and up-regulation of genes functioning as epigenetic drivers of CLL. Three Specific Aims will address this: In Aim 1 we will identify and characterize cancer-initiating cells in CLL induced by Dnmt3a deficiency and analyze their biological and molecular properties. In Aim 2 we will determine whether Dnmt3a methyltransferases activity or rather methylation -independent repressor activity is responsible for its tumor suppressor function. In Aim 3 we will test the ability of selected Dnmt3a target genes to induce CLL in vivo and evaluate their roles in maintenance of the tumor phenotype in human CLL cell lines in vitro. A careful analysis of the tumor suppressor function of Dnmt3a will provide useful insight into biological and molecular events governing the development of mouse and human CLL."
"9214989","Abstract Delayed platelet recovery following cancer therapy is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. A better understanding of the mechanisms controlling thrombopoiesis may lead to the development of new strategies to treat patients with thrombocytopenia. Here we propose to investigate the role of type-2 Lactosaminyl structures (type2-LacNAc) synthesized by addition of galactose (Gal) to terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by the galactosyltransferase ?4GalT1 in the regulation of thrombopoiesis. We provide unequivocal evidence that ?4GalT1-dependent type-2 LacNAc synthesis is crucial for thrombopoiesis: 1) ?4GalT1-deficient mice are thrombocytopenic due to impaired megakaryocyte (MK) migration towards the bone marrow vascular niche in the absence of ?4GalT1. ?4GalT1 deficiency in MKs leads to increased ?1 integrin signaling and activity, thereby impairing MK migration. Deletion of the ?1 integrin subunit in ?4GalT1-deficient MKs restores thrombopoiesis, clearly showing that posttranslational modifications, specifically LacNAc decorations of the ?1 integrin, regulate its function and ultimately thrombopoiesis; 2) The chemokine CXCL12 signals via JAK2 and FAK activation to regulate integrin function to promote cell migration. Our results show that CXCL12 activates JAK2 signaling in MKs to upregulate type-2 LacNAc synthesis and ?1 integrin expression to promote MK migration; 3) Platelets isolated from patients with JAK2V617 activating mutation have increased expression of type-2 LacNAc and ?1 integrin subunit, and decreased phosphorylation of FAK. We therefore hypothesize that ?1 integrin signaling and function is regulated via CXCR4, JAK2 and type-2 LacNAc synthesis to promote MK migration and thrombopoiesis. We propose the following aims to investigate our guiding hypothesis: In Aim 1 we will investigate the role of ?1 integrin in MK and platelet function in the absence of ?4GalT1- dependent type-2 LacNAc synthesis. In Aim 2 we will determine the molecular mechanism of CXCL12- dependent type-2 LacNAc upregulation mediated by ?4GalT1 in MKs, with focus on JAK2 signaling. In Aim 3 we will define the role of ?4GalT1 dependent type-2 LacNAc in MKs with activating JAK2V617F mutation. This study will address the gap of knowledge on the role of glycans in thrombopoiesis and will lead to the development of approaches to treat patients with dysregulated platelet production, including patients with myeloporliferative proliferative disease."
"9241623","Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a US incidence rate of almost 150,000 cases encompassing over 10% of new cancer diagnoses. In 2006 Within the Veterans Administration Healthcare System there were 4500 new cases and of those 650 were at advanced stage with very limited treatment options. Understanding the basic biology of underlying malignant transformation is critical in identifying new therapeutic targets and implementable strategies. Epithelial junctional pathology is common in malignancy. BVES is a tight junction associated protein which when suppressed induces mesenchymal transformation in human corneal epithelial cells. Further, we found decreased expression of BVES in CRC with reduced levels observed as early as adenomas indicating that its loss is an early event, likely implicating BVES in regulating additional pro- tumorigenic programs in addition to potentially contributing to metastasis. We determined the mechanism of underexpression was via transcriptional silencing via promoter hypermethylation and that this occurred in a large fraction of clinical samples, and virtually all CRC cell lines surveyed. We, and others now, have demonstrated that restoring BVES expression attenuated protumorigenic phenotypes in a variety of cancer cell lines. Collectively, this data suggests that BVES functions as a tumor suppressor in epithelial malignancy, thus BVES may represent a new diagnostic marker and/or therapeutic target in cancer. In the prior funding period, we determined that BVES was underexpressed in colitis associated carcinoma (CAC. We demonstrated the loss of BVES was functionally relevant as BVES deficient mice had increased tumor burden, and more severe dysplasia in inflammatory carcinogenesis modeling. Mechanistically, we determined that BVES interacts with and regulates the activities of PR61?:PP2A in regulating cellular c-Myc levels. Bves-/- intestine demonstrates increased stem cell markers and Bves-/- mice crossed with Lgr5-GFP reporter mice demonstrate increased Lgr5+ stem cell numbers. This is functionally relevant as Bves-/- intestine, cultured using 3D enteroid techniques, has increased plating efficiency, stem cell markers, and morphologically phenocopies ApcMin/+ tumors cultured in this system. Lastly, we have established techniques to culture, genetically modify, and establish as orthotopic xenografts, human CRC, thus developing a platform for testing whether BVES can modify the growth of established CRC and to determine the relative contribution of BVES regulated PP2A activity in the process. Much remains to be known about BVES function in epithelial malignancy. In this proposal we structure three specific aims designed to understand the role of BVES in tumor biology. First we will further our understanding of the BVES:PR61?:PP2A axis and determine whether BVES is a global regulator of PP2A activity. In the second we will use murine genetic approaches to test for BVES cooperation with Wnt in promoting tumorigenesis and determine the role of BVES in adenoma biology ex vivo. In the last aim we will test the hypothesis that restoring BVES can attenuate the growth of human Stage IV CRC and test whether restoring BVES sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapeutics. Through these studies we will gain fundamental insight into how loss of BVES contributes to malignant progression, potentially providing evidence that supports developing BVES as a therapeutic target or diagnostic marker in colorectal carcinoma."
"9245104","Project Summary/Abstract Prenatal alcohol exposure can lead to devastating effects on the developing cerebral cortex, thereby causing a wide spectrum of neurological and psychiatric conditions after birth. One of the promising intervention approaches lies in enhancing intrinsic protective mechanisms to overwhelm the triggered pathological mechanisms. Therefore, understanding the defense mechanisms deployed by neural cells is imperative for the development of potential therapies for alcohol-induced neuropsychiatric conditions. The goal of the proposed study is to characterize a new pathway by which primary cilia could suppress the adverse impact of alcohol on developing cortical neurons. The primary cilium is a unique organelle which is known to be essential for a cell to sense and respond to environmental changes. However, the role of cilia during brain development, particularly, in harsh prenatal environment such as exposure to alcohol or other environmental stressors remains largely unknown. By combining a mouse model of cilia deficiency specifically in the cerebral cortex and alcohol exposure during the brain sprout stage, we found evidences that support our hypothesis; cilia may play a critical role in protecting cortical neurons from alcohol-inducible dendritic/spine degeneration or/and other permanent morphological alterations. We will test this hypothesis by characterizing cortical phenotypes of cilia-deficient conditional knockout mice exposed to alcohol (Aim1), and testing candidate molecular mechanisms which may mediate cilia-dependent inhibition of dendritic/spine degeneration in vivo (Aim2)."
"9381065","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-malarial acute febrile illness (AFI) causes greater morbidity and mortality world-wide than malaria. The burden of non-malarial AFI is underappreciated, because of overlapping clinical presentations and lack of and/or limited access to confirmatory diagnostic tests. The most frequent causes include dengue, typhoid and paratyphoid fever, leptospirosis, and rickettsial infections, which are particularly problematic fo several reasons. First, limited studies suggest rickettsial infections may be the most common cause of AFI in some regions of Southeast Asia. Second, confirming rickettsioses is particularly difficult because these intra-cellular bacteria infect endothelial cells and, therefore, are neithe readily-cultivable nor abundant in samples of blood. Finally, the broad-spectrum, antimicrobial agents used empirically for AFI, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, are ineffective against rickettsiae. Although scrub typhus was first recognized in Malaysia in 1912 and murine typhus is endemic in surrounding countries, almost no cases of rickettsial disease were reported by the Malaysian Ministry of Health over the last 2 decades. The paucity of cases is likely due in part to the lack of available tests to diagnose these infections acutely, since a study from the 1980s and more recent serosurveys confirm the frequent (2 to 9% of blood donors and 12 to 44% of febrile patients presenting to hospital) presence of anti-rickettsial antibodies in Malaysia. Although epidemics of dengue attract considerable attention, most patients enrolled in studies of dengue-like febrile illness (clinical criteria advocated by the Malaysian Ministry of Health) are found to not have dengue and the etiology of their illness often remains undetermined. We hypothesize that a substantial proportion of the non-malaria, non-dengue AFI in Sabah, Malaysia and surrounding regions results from undiagnosed rickettsial infections. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use serum, whole blood, buffy coat, and eschar specimens from a cohort of patients enrolled prospectively with acute undifferentiated febrile illness to identify ad characterize unsuspected rickettsial infections. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. To demonstrate the occurrence and describe the epidemiology of rickettsial infections among patients with non-malarial acute febrile illness in Sabah, Malaysia. Aim 2. To define the species or strain substructure of spotted fever and typhus group rickettsial infections and scrub typhus in Sabah, Malaysia. This work will document the occurrence of rickettsial infections in Sabah, Malaysia, delineate their associated epidemiological features, and define the species and strains that are now present in this region. Additionally, we will generate preliminary data needed for subsequent detailed prospective studies that can more fully define the incidence and prevalence of rickettsial disease versus other causes of AFI in Malaysia and, thereby, provide a rational scientific basis for managing non-malarial AFI."
"9244420","Tenofovir (TFV) and other nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors must be activated via phosphorylation by intracellular nucleotide kinases in order to become pharmacologically active. While the kinases that activate TFV in mucosal tissues in adults have been identified, studies have not been performed to determine which enzymes phosphorylate TFV in adolescents. Further, whether hormonal changes during development might impact the expression and activity of the kinases that have thus far been demonstrated to activate TFV hasn't been explored. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of the expression patterns and regulation of these nucleotide kinases across developmental stages in mucosal tissues is of particular importance within the context of using these drugs for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis since vaginal and colorectal tissues are putative sites of pharmacological activity in this setting. With this in mind, the goals of this proposal are to identify the nucleotide kinases that phosphorylate TFV in adolescent vaginal and colorectal tissue and to probe the effects of hormones that govern developmental maturation on TFV disposition. The aims are as follows: (1) determine which kinases activate TFV in adolescent tissue; the expression pattern of nucleotide kinases in adolescent vaginal and colorectal tissue will be established using proteomics-based approaches; knockdown of identified kinases will facilitate identification of those that exhibit activity toward TFV in tissue; (2) test whether TFV activation and TFV distribution in tissue are hormonally regulated; nucleotide kinase expression will be measured in response to developmental hormones and mechanisms of hormonal regulation will be probed; MALDI-mass spectrometry imaging will be employed in order to visualize the distribution of TFV as well as phosphorylated metabolites of TFV in adolescents versus adults. It is expected that the completion of the proposed studies will provide a mechanistic foundation for the rational selection and dosing of antiretrovirals for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in adolescents."
"9220154","Project Abstract The long-term goal of this work is to non-invasively evaluate regional changes in foot tissue perfusion following lower extremity revascularization to better predict efficacy of targeted treatment and future rates of wound healing and limb salvage. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is an atherosclerotic disease of the lower limbs that affects 8 to 10 million Americans, and is more prevalent and progresses more quickly in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). In addition to macrovascular complications, DM patients commonly present with microvascular disease of the lower extremities, which may contribute to high rates of foot ulceration, limb amputation, and poor treatment outcomes that exist in the setting of DM. Current imaging tools have limitations for assessing underlying microvascular disease and there is no standard non-invasive approach to evaluate changes in microvascular perfusion in three-dimensional (3D) vascular territories of the feet, or angiosomes, following medical treatment in PVD patients. We propose a novel approach for evaluating angiosome microvascular perfusion under resting conditions in DM patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) who are undergoing revascularization. Using hybrid SPECT/CT imaging, we will evaluate microvascular perfusion within 3D angiosomes of the foot that are targeted for direct revascularization due to pre-existing non-healing wounds, and relate changes in relative and absolute angiosome perfusion to rates of wound healing and limb salvage. The central hypothesis of this work is that radiotracer-based imaging of microvascular perfusion can detect sensitive changes in underlying pathophysiology of the foot in specific vascular territories, which can assist clinicians with targeted revascularization while also predicting treatment efficacy and limb salvage outcomes. In Aim 1 we will quantify relative changes in resting microvascular perfusion within 3D angiosomes of the foot using SPECT/CT imaging to evaluate revascularization procedures targeted at non-healing wounds in DM patients with CLI, and relate changes in angiosome perfusion to wound healing and limb salvage outcomes. Aim 2 will validate the utility of dynamic SPECT/CT imaging for quantifying serial changes in absolute skeletal muscle perfusion in a large animal model of peripheral artery occlusion. Finally, Aim 3 will translate dynamic SPECT/CT imaging into patients to evaluate the repeatability of this approach and to assess the value of absolute quantitative perfusion in 3D angiosomes in DM patients undergoing revascularization. We believe that radiotracer-based imaging will allow for high sensitivity detection of impaired foot tissue perfusion under resting conditions at baseline and following revascularization. Therefore, this imaging approach may help to identify patients at risk for wound progression or limb loss and assist in predicting treatment outcomes in PVD patients."
"9241077","Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans, and arthritis is the most common cause. Existing treatments for chronic arthritic pain are only mildly effective, and risks of medications used to treat pain are numerous and continue to be discovered. Treatment of chronic is a high priority research area for VA CSR&D. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that is FDA approved in an oral daily dose of 50 mg to prevent recidivism in alcoholics. At much lower doses of 4 ? 4.5 mg daily, however, it has been shown in small, blinded, randomized trials to improve pain in fibromyalgia, gastrointestinal symptoms in Crohn?s disease, and quality of life in multiple sclerosis. The only other published data are case reports in complex regional pain syndrome, low back pain, and scleroderma. However, advocacy of low-dose naltrexone (LDN) by internet-based MDs and patients is high, and since LDN can be prescribed off-label, its use greatly exceeds what is justified by evidence. The drug can be prescribed only via compounding pharmacies, so its use costs a patient ~$40/month. Among the many unproven treatments that are widely used, LDN is of particular interest because results of surveys of patients are particularly impressive, because it is quite safe, and because its benefit is plausible pharmacologically. There is evidence both for modulation of central pain-processing pathways and for down- regulation of inflammatory pathways in microglia. Considering the diversity of conditions proposed to benefit from LDN and the unequivocal need for better approaches to pain relief in chronic conditions, high-quality clinical trials are needed in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. This small but placebo- controlled study, powered to detect an effect size as small as that seen with NSAIDs or the most beneficial non-pharmacologic approaches, is proposed as a prerequisite for considering a pivotal trial through the VA Cooperative Studies Program. The proposed study is a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial in adults with osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis and persistent pain. Sixty patients will be enrolled for 12 weeks, during which they will receive LDN for 8 weeks and placebo for 4 weeks. Widely accepted patient-reported outcome measures will be used. The co-primary endpoints are reduction in pain severity or pain?s interference with function during 8 weeks of LDN compared to 4 weeks placebo, using the Brief Pain Inventory. Other patient- reported data will be used both as secondary outcomes and as covariates in analyzing determinants of response to treatment. Key inclusion criteria include diagnosis of OA or IA and pain rated at least 4 on a scale of 0-10, a widely accepted criterion. Key exclusion criteria, chosen conservatively for the purposes of safety, include opioid use or severe liver, kidney, or psychiatric disease. OA, IA, and inadequate control of pain are sufficiently common that the study can be completed in two years at a single center."
"9198561","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This grant proposal builds on our most important recent finding that the final cardiomyocyte population in mice is established during preadolescence, and not before birth, as previously believed. We showed that a precisely timed surge in circulating thyroid hormone (T3), occurring between postnatal day (P)10 and P12, precedes the P15 cardiomyocyte proliferation. In vivo inhibition of T3 biosynthesis in preadolescent mice prevents cardiomyocyte proliferation. Further, T3-treated cardiomyocytes show increases in DNA synthesis in vitro. An intriguing finding of these studies was that the potent cardiomyocyte mitogen IGF-1 and IGF-R/p-Akt signaling were increased at the time of the cardiomyocyte proliferation and, importantly, were suppressed by inhibition of T3 biosynthesis. Our new preliminary in vitro findings suggest that T3 increases the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that very low concentrations of H2O2 transcriptionally activate IGF-1 gene expression and protein release from cardiomyocytes in culture. Further, low dose H2O2 activates mitogenic IGF-1/pAkt/pERK signaling in cardiomyocytes. Inhibiting H2O2 or IGF-1 generation prevented T3-mediated increase in the expression of genes critical for cell cycle reentry and mitosis. Thus our preliminary findings suggest that T3-dependent H2O2-ROS generation activates mitogenic IGF-1/pAkt/pERK signaling. To our knowledge, this mechanism has not been proposed before in cardiomyocytes, or indeed any other cell type. Therefore, the proposed studies are highly innovative. We hypothesize that T3 causes IGF-1 induction via the generation of H2O2 in vivo and this increase in IGF-1, a potent cardiomyocyte mitogen, plays an obligate role in inducing cardiomyocyte hyperplasia during preadolescence. We now offer 2 Specific Aims, with multiple proposed experiments in each Aim, to examine how T3 activates cardiomyocyte proliferation. Our proposed in vitro and in vivo studies using pharmacologic and genetic strategies in Specific Aim 1 examine the novel hypothesis that by increasing mitochondrial respiration/biogenesis, T3 increases H2O2-ROS generation, which then transcriptionally activates IGF-1 production. In Specific Aim 2, we examine whether IGF-1 is obligatory for cardiomyocyte proliferation in vivo in preadolescent hearts using multiple genetic mouse models and pharmacological approaches. Although IGF-1 is a known mitogen for cardiomyocytes during fetal heart development and during cardiac regeneration, its role in preadolescent heart growth, particularly as it relates to cardiomyocyte hyperplasia has not been explored. Understanding how cardiomyocyte replication is regulated in vivo could have important implications for cardiac regeneration in juvenile hearts."

"9186419","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hedgehog (HH) signaling is essential for the specification and growth of a wide variety of organs and tissues during embryonic development and has a continued role in the maintenance and regeneration of adult tissues. Deregulation of the HH signaling pathway can lead to numerous developmental disorders, birth defects, and childhood and adult cancers. Neuropilins (NRPs), canonical receptors for the Semaphorin family of axon guidance molecules, can positively regulate HH pathway function through an unknown mechanism (Hillman et. al., 2011). NRPs require Plexin (PLXN) coreceptors to transduce semaphorin signals, but the role of PLXNs in HH signaling has yet to be explored. Using cell signaling assays, I have confirmed that NRPs promote HH signaling in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. Moreover, my preliminary data indicate that NRPs traffic through the primary cilium, a key platform for HH signal transduction. My data also suggest that both NRP-mediated promotion of HH signal transduction and NRP ciliary localization require the NRP cytoplasmic domain. I aim to elucidate the role of the NRP cytoplasmic domain in HH signal transduction as well as to determine the requirement for the NRP extracellular domains through a systematic structure-function approach. Strikingly, I have also observed that several PLXNs promote HH signaling. My initial findings suggest that only a subset of PLXNs promote HH signaling, specifically the PLXNA family subgroup, and that PLXNs require an intact transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain for this promotion. I propose to identify the specific PLXN subgroups involved in HH signaling and further characterize their mechanism of action in vivo. Importantly, I have found that PlxnA1;PlxnA2 double mutant mice exhibit sternal and cervical spine midline defects reminiscent of HH- dependent phenotypes, strongly implicating PLXNs as novel HH regulators. Overall, my data provide compelling evidence for crosstalk between multiple members of the Semaphorin and HH signaling pathways, which are coexpressed spatially and temporally during development. I hypothesize that the semaphorin receptors, NRPs and PLXNs, are novel HH pathway components that are required for proper HH signal transduction during embryonic development. This proposal will uncover fundamental insights into HH regulation at the cell surface and have therapeutic implications for a variety of HH-dependent disorders."
"9238827","Project Summary/Abstract:  Survivors of Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) suffer from long-term morbidity in the form of functional disability, cognitive impairment, major or minor depression, and anxiety. These complications negatively impact the quality of life of these ARF survivors, interfere with their recovery, lead to long-term disability, and cost the health care system $3.5 million per ARF survivor. These sequelae and attendant morbidity have now been designated as the post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Although there are community resources and rehabilitation services, but due to a fragmented healthcare delivery process, a meaningful recovery is unattainable.  Indiana University Center for Aging Research (IUCAR) has over 20 years of experience to provide interdisciplinary, collaborative care utilizing care coordinators integrated with primary care and other specialties. These care models have improved care of elderly with chronic disease states such as dementia, depression, and functional impairment by overcoming fragmented care through care coordination. The current proposal termed the Mobile Critical Care Recovery Program (m-CCRP) for Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) Survivors builds from the IUCAR's experience of delivering collaborative care. The m-CCRP aims to improve the recovery of ARF survivors through a randomized controlled trial utilizing a mobile care coordinator. The trial has the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the efficacy of m-CCRP in improving the health related quality of life of ARF survivors. 2) Evaluate the efficacy of m-CCRP in improving the cognitive, physical, and psychological function of ARF survivors. 3) Evaluate the efficacy of m-CCRP in reducing the health-care utilization by ARF survivors.  This research is innovative as it promotes a novel interdisciplinary intervention among ARF survivors with continuous feedback and rapid adaptability. The outcomes of this trial will be significant and foundational for dissemination/ implementation of the program across the US health care system to achieve the aims of better health, better care, and reduced health care utilization as promoted by the Institute of Healthcare."
"9198205","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vitamin A metabolite all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) displays potent anticarcinogenic activities and is used clinically for treatment of some cancers. I is well established that RA inhibits carcinoma cell growth by activating RAR, a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors. Activation of RAR by RA is supported by cellular RA-binding protein II (CRABP-II), a small soluble protein which, by delivering RA from the cytosol to nuclear RAR, facilitates the ligation of the receptor and enhances its transcriptional activity. Previous studies established that CRABP-II functions as a tumor suppressor in various cancers including mammary and prostate cancers. Intriguingly, our recent observations showed that, in addition to its established role as a carrier for RA, CRABP-II is involved in regulation of post-transcriptional gene silencing. The data demonstrated that CRABP-II directly associates with HuR, the best characterized regulator of transcript stability in animals from drosophila to man, and that it markedly augments the ability of HuR to stabilize target mRNAs. The observations showed further that the CRABP-II?HuR complex dissociates in response to RA. These findings reveal a novel RA-controlled activity of CRABP-II. The proposed studies aim to investigate the molecular basis for the cooperation of CRABP-II with HuR in stabilizing mRNA, and to explore the involvement of this cooperation in mammary carcinoma biology. The results of these studies will provide important insights into a previously unsuspected non-genomic function of RA as well as into a novel mechanism for regulating transcript stability in cells. The studies will also investigate the possibility that suppression o mammary carcinoma growth by CRABP-II is mediated in part through the ability of the protein to regulate mRNA stability."
"9208078","PROJECT SUMMARY  Transforming Growth Factor ? (TGF?) is a secreted protein and the first member of the TGF? su- perfamily of ligands to be described. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern TGF??s ability to switch between its paradoxical growth suppressing and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promoting functions remain to be fully elucidated. Since TGF? elicits pleiotropic functions during normal development, adult tissue homeostasis and pathophysiological processes such as cancer and fibrosis, it is essential that future research efforts focus on producing a complete mechanistic understanding of TGF? function. To this end, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which PEAK1 (pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase one) regulates TGF? signaling and mediates TGF?-induced EMT during disease progression. The proposed work is an extension of our recently published and compelling preliminary data showing that (i) PEAK1 mediates TGF?-induced EMT, migration, proliferation and cancer metastasis; (ii) PEAK1 localizes to membrane actin structures and regulates Src/Grb2/MAPK signaling in response to TGF?/fibronectin stimulation; and (iii) inhibition of PEAK1 translation blocks the pathophysiological effects of TGF? signaling. Thus, the central hypoth- esis of this proposal is that eIF5A-driven PEAK1 translation promotes the assembly of a Src/Grb2/PEAK1 complex in the context of membrane ITGB3 activation to enable TGF?-induced MAPK signaling, ZEB1 upregulation and EMT. The approach is innovative because it will employ a combina- tion of state-of-the-art cellular, molecular, biochemical, microscopy, proteomic and model organism methods to elucidate the mechanisms of action for the novel eIF5A/PEAK1 translation and Src/Grb2/PEAK1/MAPK cytoskeletal signaling nodes as novel regulators of TGF?-induced EMT. Furthermore, the proposed research is significant because it will address the following two major challenges and needs within the field of TGF? research: Specific Aim 1 will characterize translational and post-translational mechanisms of TGF?-induced EMT; and Specific Aim 2 will identify context- dependent spatiotemporal dynamics for molecular regulators of TGF? responses. The collective knowledge gained from these mechanistic studies will identify and characterize details of the cellular and molecular contexts in which TGF? is dysregulated to cause disease, and novel methods for block- ing the negative consequences of TGF? signaling."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demand for robust, reliable, and minimally invasive diagnostic technologies represents a pressing need in the early detection, stratification, and surveillance of aggressive cancers. Cell-free microRNAs (miRNAs) represent a novel class of biomarkers that have shown promise during initial studies and may have significant clinical utility. The ability to efficiently and accurately identify and quantify circulating miRNA populatins is challenging however, and current approaches fail to meet the requirements of high specificity, sensitivity, accessibility, and reproducibility necessary for widespread adoption in screening and monitoring applications. In this phase I SBIR application, RedVault Biosciences proposes to establish the feasibility of a novel multiplex diagnostic platform to characterize circulating cell free miRNA populations, specifically those miRNAs of immediate utility in pancreatic cancer diagnosis, stratification, and intervention. The broadly-enabling technology leverages novel advancements in advanced molecular genomics, synthetic biology, and digital nucleic acid analysis to significantly reduce current, complex laboratory workflows and provide quantitative, reproducible and clinically informative results. Successful development of this technology could provide fundamental information to positively affect miRNA research, disease management, and patient survival."
"9411500","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) account for ~25% of breast cancer deaths and lack targeted therapies. Drs. Sonenshein, Mineva and Romagnoli and their co-workers recently identified the non-essential, cell surface protein ADAM8 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 8) as a pivotal promoter of breast tumor growth and metastasis, and validated it as a target of antibody therapy for TNBC. ADAM8 mRNA was highly expressed in TNBCs, and its level correlated with poor patient outcome. ADAM8 protein was present in 34% of primary TNBCs, and half of all breast cancer patient-derived metastases, but absent in adjacent normal breast tissues. Orthotopic tumors from ADAM8 knockdown TNBC cells grew only to a palpable size and generated very few circulating tumor cells and brain metastases. The Metalloproteinase (MP) and Disintegrin (DI) domains of ADAM8 were critical in tumor growth and dissemination through release of pro-angiogenic factors and activation of ?1-integrin on cancer cells, respectively. Treatment with a reagent grade commercial anti-ADAM8 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) MAB1031 (R&D), with in vitro antagonist activity against both the MP and DI domains, reduced primary TNBC tumor burden by 70% at 1.5 mg/kg vs control isotype-matched IgG2B in an orthotopic model when started at the time of cell implantation. MAB1031 also profoundly reduced dissemination of pre-existing tumors to the brain and lungs, providing proof-of-concept that a dual antagonist mAb can be prepared and that both domains are accessible to antibody-based therapy in vivo. Thus, we hypothesize that ADAM8 antibody-based treatment constitutes an effective therapy for TNBC patients expressing this transmembrane protein. A PCT patent application PCT/US14/37857 was filed May 13, 2014 by Drs. Sonenshein, Mineva and Romagnoli, and Tufts University, with claims including the targeting of ADAM8 MP and DI domains for treatment of breast and other ADAM8-driven cancers, including pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In October 2014, Adecto Pharmaceuticals, Inc (AP) was founded by the three inventors with the goal of developing ADAM8-specific antibodies for the treatment of TNBC and metastatic breast cancer as the initial indications. In this Phase 1 STTR application, AP will work closely with the Sonenshein lab (SL) to prepare mouse mAbs specific for human ADAM8 that inhibit both its MP and DI domains and perform pilot preclinical testing in mice. The specific aims are to: (1) Isolate a panel of mAbs specific for HuADAM8 with MP and DI domain antagonist activity; (2) Identify the most effective antagonist mAbs using cell based assays; (3) Perform pilot in vivo testing of the ability of the two most effective ADAM8 antagonist mAbs to inhibit growth and metastatic dissemination of pre-existing luciferase-tagged MDA-MB-231 cell-derived tumors. We propose that ADAM8 antibody-based therapy has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of TNBC patients, and reduce the mortality associated with metastatic breast cancer and thus will become a new component of care for TNBC."
"9237838","Multiscale Predictive Modeling of Blood Cell Damage with Experimental Verification This proposal aims to develop a multiscale model to characterize blood cell damage under complex flow conditions. Blood damage is an important concern for various blood wetting medical devices. In literature, blood damage criterion is typically obtained through empirical fitting of experimental hemolysis data in a specific device, yet little is known about cellular scale process of blood cell damage which hinders the accurate evaluation of blood damage in a general medical device. The goal of this proposal is to study blood cell damage at molecular and cellular level using combined computational modeling and experimental approaches. Specifically, we will develop a multiscale model that links molecular scale pores formation to cell membrane damage and hemoglobin release. The multiscale computational modeling will be applied for the first time to study of cellular flow over various channel geometries and clinically relevant devices with consideration of both hydrodynamics and membrane damage dynamics. Specifically, we plan to: 1. Develop a multiscale red blood cell membrane damage model. A localized coarse-grained  molecular dynamics model at the high stress region will be concurrently linked with a network  based cellular membrane model. 2. Couple the cell membrane damage model with local fluid flow through Immersed Boundary  method to study cell deformation, pore formation and membrane rupture. Such computational  model will be applied to predict blood cell damages in a channels with different geometries  and flow conditions. A generalized cellular level blood cell damage model will be developed. 3. Verify the developed multiscale blood cell damage model using AFM measurements,  microfluidic tests, and Couette-type blood-shearing devices. A few designed tests will be  performed to evaluate cell damage based on hemoglobin analysis of individual cells under  controlled stress history and compared to the simulation results. Finally, the developed blood  damage model will be applied to study hemolysis in a ventricular assist device. The proposed multi-scale model can directly correlate the microscale state of the cell membrane to local stresses as well as predict cell damage in device with complex geometry and flow condition. Such model could serve as a predictive tool for hematologic biomedical device design and optimization."
"9211458","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Background: Irritability is: the most common reason children and adolescents are brought for psychiatric care, associated with significant impairment in childhood and subsequently in adulthood, a symptom found in many DSM-categorical disorders?yet we have no clinically useful, validated bio-behavioral marker or measure to guide clinician's diagnosis or treatment of children presenting with irritability. To address this problem, the 2014 NIMH Pediatric Irritability Workshop and the 2015 1st Congress on Pediatric Irritability heralded the need for greater research on brain/behavior mechanisms of pediatric irritability, including studies in trans-diagnostic samples drawn across the range of impairment, rather than a single DSM disorder and testing multiple dimensional irritability assessments. Previously, we have investigated the brain/behavior alterations underlying cognitive flexibility?defined as behavioral adaptation in response to changing rewards and punishments?as one potential mechanism underlying irritability in children meeting categorical definitions of bipolar disorder (episodes of euphoria and irritability) or severe mood dysregulation (chronic irritability) vs. controls. Now, we seek to take the next step in this line of research. The objective of this application is to define the brain/behavior mechanism-based sub-types of irritability and cognitive flexibility in a trans-diagnostic sample of children ages 8-12 drawn across the range of impairment. Our central methodology is to test how circuit and behavior alterations in cognitive flexibility identify different sub-types of irritability, using single time point irritability questionnaires/interviews and a novel multi-time point irritability ecological momentary assessment (EMA) Android app, and harnessing novel computational psychiatry analytic techniques to determine which model best explains brain/behavior-based clusters of irritability. Our central hypothesis is that all irritability does not result from a single mechanism; rather unique symptom clusters of irritability result from specific PFC- temporo-striatal circuit alterations mediating cognitive flexibility. The rationale for this proposal is that greater understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying cognitive flexibility and irritability symptoms will lead to novel brain-based classification and treatments for children suffering from irritability. Our study is innovative because we will be the first to identify the brain/behavior mechanisms underlying irritability and cognitive flexibility using (1) a trans-diagnostic sample of children drawn across levels of care and impairment, rather than DSM categorical disorder(s), (2) novel EMA-irritability app, (3) computational psychiatry analytic techniques, and (4) fMRI/behavioral tasks drawn from BD/SMD research plus the RDoC matrix. Our study is both significant and clinically meaningful because greater understanding of the brain/behavior mechanisms of irritability and cognitive flexibility is critical to achieving the ultimate goal of a precision medicine approach for irritability?whereby bio-behavioral markers (scans and tests) are used for more specific/earlier classification and diagnosis plus biologically-guided treatment (e.g., medications, cognitive remediation, and TMS/TDCS)."
"9210078","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have made significant progress in determining the role of ?-catenin in hepatic development, zonation, liver regeneration (LR) & liver injury. Wnt/?-catenin signaling is an important contributor in hepatic zonation regulating the expression of glutamine synthetase (GS) and cytochrome P450's like CYP2E1 & 1A2 in hepatocytes around central vein. We have shown ?-catenin signaling as one of the key mechanisms essential for initiation of LR. Hepatocyte-specific ?-catenin knockout mice (Hep?-cat KO) lack zonation and show delay in LR after partial hepatectomy (PHx) due to decreased expression of cyclin-D1. In addition, ?-catenin overexpression promotes LR in mice and in acetaminophen toxicity patients. Several additional key questions emerge from the previous studies & form the basis of current proposal. What are the upstream effectors and their cell sources that regulate ?-catenin activation in normal liver for zonation and during LR for hepatocyte proliferation and who is ?-catenin signaling turned off once LR is accomplished. Lastly, are there clinically relevant molecules that can be used to induce ?-catenin signaling to provide proof-of-principle that ?-catenin activation can have implications in treatment of end stage liver disease (ESLD). We hypothesize that Wnts from varying cell sources act in autocrine or paracrine mechanisms to direct ?-catenin activation to in turn instruct hepatic zonation and hepatocyte proliferation during LR, and their elucidation will have broad therapeutic impact. Based on our preliminary studies in mice where Wnt co-receptors LRP5/6 have been deleted from hepatocytes (Hep-LRP5/6 KO) that lack zonation and show delay in LR, ?-catenin appears to be under exclusive control of Wnt signaling in vivo in liver. Also, mice with hepatocyte-specific deletion of Wntless (Wls), essential for Wnt secretion from a cell, do not show impaired zonation or initiation of LR, but displayed prolonged LR after PHx. In specific aim 1, we will determine cellular origin & molecular identity of upstream effectors of ?-catenin in liver zonation and during LR process. This will be done by characterizing these two processes in mice that conditionally lack Wls in various cells of the liver including hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, Kupffer cells and stellate cells using cell-specific Cre transgenic lines and floxed-Wls mice that exist in our lab. n specific aim 2, we will determine the mechanism of termination of ?-catenin signaling following accomplishment of hepatocyte proliferation during LR after PH. Hep-Wls KO mice exhibit continued expression of cyclin-D1, cell proliferation at 72-96h after PHx & decreased Wnt5a, an inhibitory Wnt. We will investigate how Wnt5a inhibits ?-catenin signaling in hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo. We will also use Hep-Wnt5a KO mice to conclusively address if Wnt5a indeed terminates ?-catenin signaling and eventually LR after PHx. In aim 3, we propose to study the therapeutic efficacy of Wnt stimulation to augment LR in murine models of ALF. Our preliminary data shows that ?-catenin activation can promote LR. We identify triiodothyronine (T3) to stimulate ?-catenin signaling in PKA-dependent manner to induce hepatocyte proliferation. We will conclusively address the relevance of PKA-dependent ?-catenin activation in T3-induced hepatocyte proliferation using Hep-LRP5/6 KO mice. We will directly evaluate efficacy of T3 and its thyroid receptor-? selective analogue GC-1, in inducing LR in acetaminophen-induced liver injury and 90% PH models of acute liver failure. Thus our proposed studies will further our understanding of cellular and molecular basis of LR and investigate the utility of ?-catenin stimulation as a way to treat ESLD using clinically relevant agents."
"9240571","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Alcoholism and insomnia are highly prevalent in Veterans. Alcoholism is estimated to occur in about 6.4% of Veterans. More recent estimates of alcohol misuse range from 11.8% in OIF Veterans to 21.8% in OEF/OIF male Veterans. Insomnia is estimated to occur in about 28% of active duty military personnel (from the Millennium Cohort Study), and up to 77% of Veterans seen in a VHA primary care experience clinically significant levels of insomnia. Insomnia is also highly prevalent in patients recovering from alcoholism with as many as 70% of such patients complaining of sleep initiation and/or maintenance problems. These prevalence rates are 2-7 times higher than that of the general population. The direct consequences of insomnia include sleepiness, fatigue, irritability, diminished work performance and impaired interpersonal functioning. The long- term sequelae of insomnia include risk for new-onset and recurrent psychiatric illness, and in the context of alcoholism, greater intensity of alcoholism and increased risk for relapse in abstinent alcoholics. At present, there are nine studies which evaluate whether insomnia represents a modifiable risk factor for relapse of alcoholism (2 investigating trazodone, 3 investigating gabapentin, 1 investigating ramelteon, and 3 investigating a modified form of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia [CBT-I]). The results from these studies are variable. The CBT-I investigations show the most promise in terms of improved sleep, but there is no clear evidence that improved sleep has protective value against pathological drinking. Accordingly, CBT-I (n=30) will be evaluated and compared to the Quasi-Desensitization Therapy (QDT) (n=30) in a sample of veterans who have been sober for at least one month (but less than one year). The study cohort will be further stratified into those who do (n=30) and do not (n=30) have a first-degree family history of alcoholism. Familial alcoholism is taken into account, as this may represent a unique factor that contributes to insomnia severity and/or treatment outcome. All subjects will complete a 2-week baseline recording period followed by weekly CBT-I/QDT sessions for 8-weeks. CBT-I will be conducted according to a standard protocol. Weekly 1-hour sessions (individual format) will be used to deliver the four components of CBT-I (Sleep Restriction, Stimulus Control, Sleep Hygiene, and Cognitive therapy [sleep-related de-catastrophization]). Treatment will be followed up with two evaluations at 3 and 6 months post-intervention. All subjects will complete the Insomnia Severity Index, daily sleep diaries, and the alcohol-related measures for a 2-week baseline, for the intervention period, and for two follow-up intervals after treatment completion at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measures are insomnia severity (as assessed with the ISI) and percentage days abstinent (as assessed using the Timeline Follow Back measure). In addition, health and mood will be tracked using the Short Form-12 (SF-12) item scale, the BDI-II, PHQ9, STAI, and the GAD7. The combination of these measures serve to test the hypotheses that standard CBT-I can be applied successfully in patients recovering from alcoholism and that successful treatment of insomnia will be associated with better clinical outcomes in relation to alcoholism. Finally, family history data will be assessed on an exploratory basis to assess differences in baseline insomnia and objective sleep, as well as outcomes for the insomnia, alcoholism, treatment adherence, and/or treatment outcome. Objective sleep will be preliminarily assessed with in-laboratory polysomnograms of seven subjects with and without familial alcoholism (n=16). It is hypothesized that CBT-I in abstinent alcoholics will lead to 1) significantly superio sleep-related outcomes as compared to QDT, 2) pre-to-post treatment effect sizes that are comparable to the meta-analytic norms, 3) a larger percentage of days abstinent with at least a trend toward fewer relapses, and 4) better overall health and mood. If these findings are achieved and replicated, it will suggest that insomnia treatment should be a standard component in the management of alcoholism and that CBT-I is an ideal management approach for this co-morbid insomnia."
"9210114","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peptides form the majority of signaling systems in humans. These peptides, produced in the gut, brain, pancreas, skin and other organs have far-reaching effects-controlling food intake, metabolism, blood pressure, behavior, ovulation, and circadian rhythms as examples. These signaling peptides have, in many cases, common modalities traceable back hundreds of millions of years in evolution. However, the application of peptides as therapeutic signaling agents has not been fully explored. We have shown, through novel mass spectrometry-based peptidomics methodology, that over 500 peptides are produced in human milk within the mammary gland itself. These naturally occurring peptides represent a new class of food molecules that have as yet uncharacterized signaling functions within the mother and the infant. We have shown that over 10% are homologous to known peptides with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions. The rest have yet to be discovered functions. First generation assays have discovered that the peptides identified have antimicrobial actions-as an ensemble, these peptides inhibited the growth of several strains of pathogenic bacteria. The proposed research program will define the entire range of naturally occurring milk peptides, their diverse functions and also which specific sequences are responsible. Peptides will be examined for specific biological- context-relevant actions, including antimicrobial, antifungal, prebiotic, anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory actions. Investigating milk's peptides will unlock  dynamic and complex system of macromolecules that can be applied to infant and adult health.  My long-term goal is to leverage a Nutrition or Food Science tenure-track faculty position at a tier-one research university to establish a high-impact research program in human health. I am convinced that the core of this research program will be designed to understand the effects of human milk on infant health, particularly from the perspective of digestion, and use this understanding to guide the nourishment and health of all ages.  University of California, Davis, is the premier place to accomplish the aims of this proposal during the K99 phase of the award. The collaborators I have brought together during my Ph.D. and first year of post- doctoral work have made this project possible. UC Davis provides not only state-of-the-art analytical mass spectrometry in Dr. Lebrilla's and Dr. Barile's labs, but also the ability to obtain samples from te stomachs of infants through a collaboration with Dr. Mark Underwood, the head of the neonatal intensive care unit at the UC Davis Medical School. In addition, I have networked with a large number of collaborators to test the milk peptides for a variety of functions in assays."
"9244182","Project Summary Using mobile technology that most students already have in their pockets, we propose a novel use of SMS text messages to change campus drinking norms. We aim to correct exaggerated perceptions of drinking norms, and thereby reduce excessive drinking, by delivering push notifications representing accurate, campus-specific, pro-moderation descriptive norms (what others do) and injunctive norms (what others approve of). We predict that with repeated exposure over time, this information will compete with other sources of normative information to which students are exposed during their first year of college. In this exploratory R21, we will develop and refine message content and pilot test the delivery methods. First, with input from student advisors, we will survey a representative sample of 300 students about personal behaviors and attitudes, and perceived descriptive and injunctive norms, for a wide range of alcohol-related behaviors and protective strategies. Extending the range of behaviors previously studied in the norms literature, these data will yield campus-specific norms and identify items with the largest self-other discrepancies as potential sources of corrective feedback. Second, we will translate the content into a pool of text messages and solicit feedback, iteratively, from approximately 40 first-year students. Third, we will conduct a pilot test of the SMS-delivered pro-moderation norms intervention to evaluate the effect of receiving these text messages on perceived peer norms, and high volume drinking and consequences. First year students (N=120) who are underage but report risky drinking (>4/day or >14/week for men; >3/day or >7/week for women) will be randomly assigned to two conditions differing by text content: alcohol norms or control. All will receive 5-6 text messages per week over 12 weeks. Process measures, 3-month post-test, and 3-month follow-up assessments will yield feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcome data to inform future larger scale randomized trials. We predict that the experimental condition will be acceptable and interesting, will protect against increases in pro-drinking perceived norms, and will result in less risky drinking and fewer alcohol consequences, relative to control. This project has public health significance because high volume drinking has harmful consequences to self and others, and has proven to be hard to change on college campuses; individual-level interventions typically have limited reach, and environmental policy changes can be hard to implement. This mHealth intervention offers a novel approach to prevention during a period of transition, and this study will provide proof-of-concept that SMS text messages can be used over time to correct exaggerated alcohol norms, a mechanism known to reduce excessive drinking and its negative consequences."
"9191359","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In spite of decades of basic and clincial research, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death and the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American women . A major breakthrough for prevention and cure has been the appreciation that breast cancer is not one disease, rather a collection of cancer subtypes becoming better defined by improved methodologies based upon histopathologic, genetic and molecular signatures. Over time we have applied histological type, grade, tumor size, lymph-node involvement, and estrogen receptor (ER) and HER-2/neu receptor status to help define prognosis and probability of response to therapies, yet these alone have not fully captured the varied behavior of breast cancer. The field is now rapidly progressing with gene expression and proteomic signatures that will help personalize our interventions for individuals. This same concept is relevant to interventions for primary or secondary prevention and is the focus of our translational grant application. Our pre-clinical studies have demonstrated a strong benefit for dietary ?-3 fatty acid rich fish oil for the inhibition of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) mammary tumors in a transgenic mouse model showing decreased tumor incidence, multiplicity and glandular atypia. Thus, our central hypothesis is that the development of aggressive breast cancer sub-types such as of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(-) (i.e. triple negative) disease may be uniquely responsive to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the long chain ?-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) found in fish oil. As a first step towards a future definitive prevention trial in women, we propose to test the efficacy of an ?-3 rich fish il supplement to modulate breast biomarkers indicative of anti-carcinogenic action. We will randomize high risk survivors to a placebo-low dose or high dose ?-3 rich fish oil capsule treatment and employ our breast fine needle aspiration techniques to obtain cells and tissue for analysis of biomarkers of exposure and efficacy. Our multidisciplinary team has developed the following Specific Aims to: (1) Determine the effects of dietary ?-3 fatty acids on biomarkers of exposure and response in women at high risk for recurrent estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor breast cancer +/- HER-2/neu overexpression; and (2) Define the role of dietary ?-3 PUFAs in the epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory responses underlying mammary carcinogenesis as a novel mechanism for the effects of ?-3 PUFAs. Development of these biomarkers of ?-3 PUFA exposure and response will enable the assessment of this bioactive food component in future large-scale prevention trials for women at risk for recurrence of ERPR(-)HER-2/neu(+) or triple negative breast cancer."
"9193636","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) affect over a million people in North America. Many patients with IBD do not respond initially or lose response to even our most effective therapies (anti-TNF antibodies). Thus, there is an unmet need for novel therapeutics. Blocking leukocyte traffic is a proven therapeutic option in IBD. This pathway might be targeted by monoclonal antibodies, such as natalizumab/vedolizumab or alternatively by orally administered small molecules, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor. Indeed, a drug that interacts specifically with S1P receptor-1 (S1P1) (i.e. RPC1063) has entered the clinical trial stage in IBD, while another is already FDA-approved for multiple sclerosis (i.e. FTY720). However, a critical need remains to understand the mechanism/s through which these drugs modulate chronic inflammatory diseases. Our long- term goal is to understand how to manipulate the S1P pathway for therapeutic purposes in IBD. Our immediate objective is to understand the mechanism of action of novel S1P1-selective agonists with proven efficacy in preclinical therapeutic studies. Based on the predominant expression of S1P1 on lymphocytes and endothelial cells, we hypothesize that S1P1-selective agonists act both on leukocytes, (by promoting T cell egress, Aim 1) and/or on endothelial cells (by modulating endothelial function, Aim 2). This hypothesis stems from our preliminary data that demonstrates that chronic inflammation alters S1P synthesis and degradation (promoting T cell retention) in IBD mouse models and human IBD and that S1P1-selective agonism degrades S1P1, increases recirculation of effector T cells and ameliorates inflammation in clinically-relevant IBD mouse models. Our innovative approach takes advantage of 1. Chronic mouse models of IBD that recapitulate many of the characteristics of the human disease, 2. New drugs with distinct downstream actions and 3. Cutting edge microscopic techniques that allow us to directly visualize the effects of these drugs on a living animal. Our inter-institutional studies bring together our extensive expertise in lymphocyte traffic/IBD models at UCSD with that of The Scripps Research Institute: S1P pharmacology/endothelial cell biology, which allows us to consolidate valuable infrastructural and mouse model resources. Our rationale is that understanding the mechanism of action of these novel anti-inflammatories will lead to optimized drug design and minimize the risks related to the pleiotropic effects of non-selective S1P receptor agonists (e.g. FTY720) on cellular processes. The proposed research is significant as this pathway is evolutionarily conserved in mice and humans. Therefore, our results might directly translate to human IBD, enabling us to elucidate the mechanism of action of S1P1-selective agents. Furthermore, we may uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention within the S1P pathway (kinases, lyase) to be modulated pharmacologically with oral drugs, at reduced cost of production and administration, compared with current antibody-based biologic strategies."
"9198780","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The interplay of transcription regulation and chromatin organization is essential for normal tissue development and function, and maintenance of cellular differentiation. Loss of the normal differentiated state is a hallmark of many malignancies. A better understanding of all the mechanisms that regulate and maintain the differentiation state of a tissue will enable the development of strategies to maintain, enhance and induce differentiation to improve cancer outcomes and functional-differentiation-dependent outcomes such as milk production in the mammary gland. Transcription factors binding to regulatory elements and regulating chromatin states whilst enabling transcription initiation of target genes is one of the main processes underlying differentiation- dependent (tissue- and developmental stage specific) gene transcription. Recent genome wide studies have indicated that developmental gene expression is also regulated through transcription elongation control following promoter-proximal pausing. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of which cell-specific transcription factors interact with the elongation complex to regulate cell differentiation and function in vivo. We have shown that Singleminded-2s (Sim2s; expressed from Sim2), a member of the bHLH/PAS family of transcription factors, plays a major role in expression of differentiation-associated genes in the mammary gland, not as a classical DNA-binding transcription factor, but by interacting directly with the transcriptional elongation complex. Based on these exciting new results, we hypothesize that a subset of differentiation- dependent genes are regulated through enhancement of elongation in conjunction with changes in chromatin organization, mediated in the mammary gland by Sim2s. To address this hypothesis we propose two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will couple Global Run On (GRO)-seq with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis for Sim2s binding and histone modifications associated with active gene expression during mammary gland development using WT and Sim2 mammary gland knockout and over-expressing mice. In Aim 2, we will define the physical basis for, and functional outcomes of interactions between Sim2s and P-TEFb components involved in transcription factor recruitment, elongation control and chromatin alterations associated with time- dependent hormone-dependent activation of the Csn2 gene. In addition, we will also determine the effect of over and under expression of elongation factors on hormone-induced Csn2 expression in WT and Sim2s over and under-expressing HC11 cells. These studies will better define mechanisms by which differentiation is regulated through selective gene expression and give new insight into the regulation of differentiation- dependent gene transcription in the mammary gland and functionally differentiated tissues in general."
"9240765","After more than 30 years of using ?-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs) in the treatment of patients, pressing questions still remain at the forefront of our clinical efforts. Although, the value of ?-lactam/BLI combinations (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam) was well-established by the 1990s, the rapid emergence of ?-lactamases that hydrolyzed expanded spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and were resistant to inactivation by BLIs created a global crisis in antimicrobial chemotherapy and propelled the quest for a novel class of inhibitors, the diazabicyclooctanes (DBOs). In addition to the extended spectrum ?-lactamases (ESBLs), the major challenges to overcome in Klebsiella pneumoniae are the serine carbapenemases (e.g., KPC-2, OXA-48) and the metallo- ?-lactamases (MBLs) (e.g., NDM-1, VIM and IMP). Fortunately, avibactam (AVI), a DBO BLI, inactivates KPC-2 and OXA-48; the efficacy of AVI against MBLs is absent.  Our investigations in the previous grant cycle awarded us with unprecedented and frightening insights. We were painfully reminded that we cannot anticipate ?-lactamase evolution; the diversity in amino acid sequences that nature can yield and their impact on catalytic activity and resistance are unpredictable. We found to our dismay that KPC-2 ?-lactamase variants expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B with the amino acid substitutions, S130G, K234R, and R220M conferred resistance to ampicillin-AVI. Moreover, we discovered that a single amino acid substitution in VIM-24 (R228L) confers enhanced resistance to ceftazidime and cefepime. We came to the inevitable conclusion that: i) resistance to AVI was present before this BLI was released; and ii) MBLs can expand their substrate profile and enhance cephalosporin resistance much like the class A and C extended-spectrum ?-lactamases (ESBLs). In this Merit application, our goals are to: 1) continue to probe the structural and mechanistic basis for resistance to AVI in KPC; 2) learn how novel substrate specificity evolves in KPC and NDM carbapenemases. We will apply for the first time complementary structural methods (x-ray crystallography, NMR, and Double Electron Electron Resonance, DEER) to help us understand how structure activity relationship are defined in carbapenemases with the intent that these new insights will lead to new approaches in BLI design. In addition, recent computational analyses of KPC-2 ?-lactamase molecular dynamics predict that ?hydrophobic networks? contribute to the structural integrity and allosteric signaling of KPC-2 and other class A ?-lactamases. This novel insight defines our third goal: 3) if these hydrophobic networks contribute to allosteric signaling, can allosteric inhibitors offer new opportunities for BLI design. The unrelenting pace of resistance makes it imperative that we understand fundamental biochemical interactions in order to find BLIs that act by novel mechanisms.  Our multidisciplinary approach to studying carbapenemases will allow us to anticipate how new mutations will effect BLI and cephem catalysis and anticipate novel resistance phenotypes. We also propose that we will discover important conformational changes upon AVI binding and uncover networks that may be involved in allosteric signaling. If this is confirmed, disruption of these ?hydrophobic networks? will open an alternative approach to overcoming resistance and lead to new BLIs."
"9187817","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks support jointly for the 2016 Photosensory Receptors & Signal Transduction Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), to be held January in 23-29, 2016 at Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas and in the spring of 2018, most likely in April at the GRC site Renaissance Tuscany Il Ciocco Resort, Lucca, Italy. This biennial meeting is one of the most prestigious forums for participants to discuss topics at the frontiers of photobiological and biomedical research. Since it began 15 years ago, this GRC series has regularly brought together leading researchers and developing scientists from across the world. About half of the participants will be from the USA and half from Europe, Asia, Oceania and South America, reflecting the active international community in this scientific area. The 2016 and 2018 conferences will continue to provide a unique platform to unite researchers from a diverse range of subfields and disciplines to discuss and share new results and emerging approaches on natural and synthetic photosensory systems. Although photobiology largely originated in the plant sciences and is still strongly represented there, it now embraces a multitude of other experimental organisms such as bacteria, fungi and mammals. Researchers working on fundamental aspects of hot sensory biology will be united with those focused on developing new technologies in the applied field known as optogenetics. This fast-moving field spans the range from molecular to clinical, with practitioners developing methodologies aimed at directing gene expression, modifying the transmission of nerve impulses and restoring vision. A key to extending such tools is harnessing the diversity of photoreceptor systems that are available in nature. The continued efforts of this GRC/GRS series will ensure that the breadth of these disciplinary interactions is maintained and further developed through vigorous discussion and collaboration. Other unique features of this conference include: a 2:1 (talk versus discussion) time for oral presentations; the sheltered meeting venues where participants dine and socialize together outside of the sessions, afternoon social activities planned to promote networking, and poster displays accessible throughout the day and following evening sessions to maximize exposure, as well as space reserved within the main GRC program for short oral presentations to promote talented graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty poster presentations. The closely associated GRS will also allow students and postdoctoral researchers to bring forth their latest developments in the field, lay the scientific groundwork in areas these junior scientists may be less familiar with, and offer explicit mentoring led by senior scientists in informal, round-table discussions aimed at broad aspects of career development. In each case, the breadth of topics and the diversity of techniques employed in this highly multidisciplinary field will attract a diverse group of scientists with a common interest in photosensory function and application."
"9225290","We have identified a spontaneous mouse mutant (now maintained on an A/J inbred strain) that develops eosinophilic vasculitis in multiple organs. As disease progresses, the heart develops eosinophilic myocarditis, extensive fibrosis and right ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy, with mutant mice dying of heart failure (HF) by 14 weeks old. These pathologies overlap those for patients diagnosed with eosinophilic granulomatosis and polyangiitis, EGPA (also known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome). EGPA is a rare vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels, typically associated with asthma, peripheral and tissue eosinophilia, upper respiratory symptoms, and clinical signs of systemic vasculitis. Cardiac involvement is well-known, with prevalence ~60%. In fact, heart disease is linked with poor prognosis, accounting for ~50% of EGPA-related deaths. Delayed diagnosis can lead to rapid health decline, but patients identified early in the disease respond well to steroids and immunosuppressant drugs. Consequently, knowledge gained from this mouse mutant line has potential not only to improve quality of life for these patients, but to radically impact morbidity and mortality. The etiology of EGPA is unknown, but is expected to involve many genes. Besides preliminary work on the pathology of this mutant, we sought to map chromosome regions for genes linked to EGPA/HF. HF seen in maintenance lines of the mutant was consistent with 2 genes segregating for the trait. But results of our initial mapping attempts with C57BL/6J mice indicated one or more additional genes were segregating. To explain a disparity in the number of genes involved, we posited that a de novo mutation in an immunoregulatory gene, together with existing A/J- variants, leads to disease. Two aims are proposed: 1) Critically assess the mutant mouse line to establish as a valid model of EGPA/HF. We will characterize the line to differentiate features of EGPA from those for the hypereosinophilic syndromes or two similar vasculitides with overlapping clinical characteristics. And, since EGPA is highly associated with allergic asthma, we will further test the hypothesis that allergen inhalation can trigger disease development. 2) Map the EGPA/HF trait in this mutant line; identify and begin to evaluate top candidate genes. A backcross breeding strategy was selected over F2 crosses to increase the rate of affected mice, and DBA and SJL strains will be used to test a role for natural A/J mutations in hemolytic complement (C5) and/or dysferlin (Dysf) in EGPA, respectively. The proposed backcross strategy will markedly increase the rate of affected mice generated for mapping. We expect 3-4 dozen affected recombinants from different strain? pair combinations will allow us to map the key loci to high resolution and, with available exome and RNA-Seq data already in hand, to quickly find excellent candidate genes. When validated as a model for EGPA, this mutant will provide an invaluable research tool to understand the molecular and pathogenic mechanisms of eosinophil-related vasculitis and its related organ damage. And, as the genes for this complex disease are not known, this mutant also affords a unique opportunity to delineate the multi-gene interactions causing EGPA."
"9197320","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The epidemic of toxicity related to prescription opioid use among U.S. adults is thought to be related to drug abuse. Thus, the public health response has focused on programs to reduce non-medical uses. However, little attention has been given to the possibility of a parallel epidemic among children, particularly vulnerable to opioid toxicit. Preliminary Tennessee Medicaid data suggest this epidemic now possibly affects children: the proportion of children 2-17 years old prescribed opioid analgesics increased from 5% in 1996 to 11% in 2007, with a comparable trend in medical care possibly consistent with opioid toxicity. What is the appropriate public health response to this potential threat to the safety of children? Because children's prescriptions must be filled by a parent or guardian, non-medical use is less plausible, particularly for young children. For this reason, pediatric opioid toxicity is most likey to be an unintended consequence of therapeutic use, which would need to be considered as part of prescription risk-benefit evaluation. Thus, there is an urgent need to quantify the incidence of opioid toxicity in children to inform pediatric practitioners' decision-making. Furthermore, opioid prescribing practices associated with elevated risk need to be identified so these can be avoided when possible. Potentially hazardous practices include higher doses, high-potency opioids such as oxycodone, and concurrent central nervous system depressants. To address this unmet public health need, we will conduct a large retrospective cohort study in an estimated 500,000 Tennessee Medicaid children 2-17 years of age with 1,000,000 filled opioid prescriptions and 1400 confirmed cases of opioid toxicity. There are two specific aims: Aim 1. Quantify the incidence of toxicity related to prescription opioid use according to a) the child's age, b) toxicity severity, and c) whether or not the toxicity was related to therapeutic use. Aim 2 Test the hypothesis that opioid toxicity risk increases with: a) increased opioid dose, b) high-potency opioids, and c) concurrent use of other CNS-depressant drugs. These data on the risks of opioid medications increasingly used by children will provide a sound basis for altering pediatric practice to address a novel threat to the safety of this vulnerable population."
"9278077","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Prostate cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in men, responsible for more than 33,000 deaths in 2011. However, most prostate cancers have a relatively slow rate of growth and progression and are ideal candidates for non-toxic pharmacological or nutritional interventions that could reduce the incidence of clinically relevant disease, delay cancer progression, and modify a malignant process into a chronic, manageable disease. The central hypothesis of this grant application is that vitamin D3 supplementation will benefit Veteran subjects diagnosed with early-stage, low-risk prostate cancer, who elect to have their disease managed through active surveillance. Specifically, we hypothesize that Veterans who take 4000 international  units (IU) of vitamin D3 per day (intervention group) will show an improvement in the number of positive cores  and in Gleason score at repeat biopsy, and a decreased likelihood of undergoing definitive treatment  (prostatectomy or radiation therapy), compared to Veteran subjects taking placebo (control group). To test this  hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine whether vitamin D3 (4,000 IU per day for  at least one year) will result in a significant improvement of the pathology status at repeat biopsy in Veteran  subjects taking vitamin D3, compared to Veteran subjects taking placebo. This hypothesis will be tested through a randomized clinical trial, which will enroll 136 Veteran subjects (68 participants per arm), diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score d6, PSA d10, clinical stage T1C or T2a). The pathology status will be measured by the change in Gleason score and the number of positive cores in prostate needle biopsy specimens between baseline and the end of the study. Pre- and post-study biopsies will be performed as part of the standard medical care for active surveillance. 2) To determine whether vitamin D3 supplementation,  compared to placebo, will result in a significant decrease in the number of Veteran subjects who will undergo  definitive treatment (prostatectomy or radiation therapy), following the outcome of repeat biopsy. 3) To analyze changes in the serum levels of cholecalciferol, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at  baseline and at the end of the study, and to estimate the associations between changes in these measures  and pathology outcomes. 4) To compare the expression of molecular biomarkers, which are prognostically relevant to prostate cancer progression, in pre- and post-treatment biopsy tissue specimens. Paraffin- embedded sections will be processed to assess by immunohistochemical techniques the expression of the following biomarkers: vitamin D receptor (VDR), p21, tumor growth factor beta (TGFbeta), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-  2), and NFkappaB. All of these protein products impact growth control and chronic inflammation in prostate cancer progression and are specifically affected by vitamin D status.  Vitamin D3 supplementation may not only provide a welcome addition to active surveillance, but also help us avoid over treating low-risk disease in subjects who respond to an intervention strategy that is extremely cost-effective and easy to implement. At the same time, Vitamin D3 supplementation would help us identify those patients (non-responders) who are affected by potentially aggressive disease and should consider definitive treatment."
"9177692","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I earned a Ph.D. in Sociology from UCLA in 2006, and an M.S. in statistics from UCLA in 2008. As a student affiliate of the California Center for Population Research, I received a comprehensive education in social demography and social stratification, and rigorous training in research methodology and statistical techniques for analyzing large-scale survey data. During this time, I also developed a technique for linking empirical estimates of individuals' preferences for neighborhoods with agent-based models to explore the segregation dynamics implied by individuals' residential mobility decisions. While this work is at the vanguard of social research, it relies on a primitive and highly unrealistic conception of individuals' residential choice behavior. This is not unique to my research. The statistical models used in quantitative social science and public health research are rarely (if ever) a plausible model of the underlying behavior or decision-making process that gave rise to the social phenomenon under investigation. Over the past year, I have learned that researchers in departments of Marketing at business schools have highly sophisticated statistical models of how people navigate their environment and make decisions, which draw on insights from cognitive science and decision theory. But these methods have never been applied in population health, for example, to how people choose among neighborhoods, schools, jobs, or entrees in a cafeteria.  Based on my initial forays into this area, I have found marketing choice models are orders of magnitude more difficult to master than techniques I have taught myself in the past. There is no standard statistical software, and the programs are usually written from scratch; there is no single model or methodological approach, but rather a loose toolkit of techniques or strategies that are customized to a specific application. In addition, the models often require Bayesian estimation techniques (which require significant expertise outside of standardized software packages). The K01 Mentored Research Scientist Award would provide protected time for me to: (1) master the statistical skills involved in estimating these models, an gain a formal understanding of the underlying theories of decision-making; (2) adapt the marketing statistical models to new substantive applications-the study of residential mobility and mate choice (as observed on an online dating site); (3) develop a methodological framework for linking these cognitively plausible models of individual decision-making with agent-based models to understand the implications of decision strategies for aggregate population dynamics; and (4) explore how this statistical framework may be applied to a broader range of decision-making applications relevant to health research. I have developed a course plan to provide more formal training in the statistical techniques and theoretical frameworks that underpin the statistical models of decision-making used in marketing research. In addition, I intend to get a comprehensive overview of the decision literature in psychology to supplement what has up to now been self-study. I will supplement the coursework in statistical modeling with frequent interactions with my primary mentor, Fred Feinberg. The bulk of my training will take place at the University of Michigan, where Feinberg and Diez Roux are also in residence. I will have access to the data management, computing, and administrative resources of the Population Studies Center, the Department of Sociology, and the Center for the Study of Complex Systems. Both Sociology and Population Studies have provided me with office space for the duration of the grant period.  My short-term goals are to master the statistical skills involved in estimating these models and gain a formal understanding of the underlying theories of decision-making; and also to adapt the marketing statistical models to new substantive applications-the study of residential mobility and mate choice (as observed on an online dating site). In the longer term, my goals are to develop a methodological framework for linking these cognitively plausible models of individual decision-making with agent-based models to understand the implications of decision strategies for aggregate patterns of social integration or separation; and to explore how this statistical framework may be applied to a broader range of decision-making applications relevant to health research. My proposed research projects apply the choice-modeling framework in two areas of research: mate choice (as observed on an online dating website) and neighborhood choice. These are two specific instances of a general class of choice problems where people choose-with varying degrees of habit or deliberation- from a moderate to large number of potential options. When confronted with this sort of choice problem, decision theorists have repeatedly shown that people tend to invoke screening rules to simplify the choice problem. I will use data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey to estimate cognitively plausible choice models to capture these screening rules at multiple stages. My mate choice project makes use of a rich dataset I recently acquired from an online dating. I will first estimate a multi-stage choice model aimed at identifying the rules used at each stage, and explore how strategies for mate search and mate choice differ across demographic areas. I will later extend our models to allow for learning and adaptive responses. In both the neighborhood and mate choice case, the cognitively plausible choice models will be coupled with realistic agent-based models to explore the co-evolution of individual behavior and the social environment."
"9210575","Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) the predominant histologic subtype of lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma the major subset of NSCLC. Despite recent clinical progress with the use of specific targeted therapies, drug resistance remains a problem that limits patient survival. A promising strategy to combat cancer drug resistance is to deploy rational upfront polytherapies that suppress the survival and emergence of resistant tumor cells. However, in most tumors with oncogenic receptor kinases, the optimal initial polytherapy strategy is unclear because receptor kinases typically engage multiple effector pathways, and which of these individual pathways, if any, is most critical to tumor cell survival is poorly defined. We recently demonstrated in models of NSCLC harboring the recurrent oncogenic ALK receptor kinase fusion (EML4-ALK or ALK+) that the RAS-MAPK pathway, but not other known ALK effectors, is required for tumor cell survival. We revealed that EML4-ALK drives RAS-MAPK signaling by engaging all three major RAS isoforms (H, N-, K-RAS) via the HELP domain of EML4. MAPK pathway reactivation via either genomic amplification of KRASWT (wild-type) or downregulation of the MAPK phosphatase DUSP6 promoted resistance to ALK inhibition. Accordingly, upfront ALK and MEK co-inhibition enhanced both the magnitude and duration of initial response in EML4-ALK NSCLC in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, genomic amplification (or gene duplication) of KRASWT or downregulation of DUSP6 was observed in ALK+ lung adenocarcinoma patients with acquired ALK inhibitor resistance. Together, our findings provided new insight into the function of RAS-MAPK signaling in EML4-ALK NSCLC and the rationale for upfront ALK + MEK inhibitor co-treatment to improve patient outcomes, a novel clinical trial we are leading. Moreover, the findings indicated an unanticipated role of the EML4 partner in EML4-ALK oncogene function and RAS signaling. Here, we will further extend our initial discovery to test the overall hypothesis that RAS activation and signaling is a hallmark of oncogenic ALK function in NSCLC. In Aim 1, we will define the biological basis of RAS-MAPK signaling and dependence in EML4-ALK NSCLC, dissecting the molecular and cell biological control mechanisms governing RAS activation and signaling in ALK+ tumors. In Aim 2, we will define the mechanism(s) that may limit curative response to ALK + MEK inhibitor polytherapy in ALK+ NSCLC patients, levering cutting-edge CRISPR-based genetic screening studies and patient tumor samples from our ALK + MEK inhibitor clinical trial. Overall, these multi-disciplinary, collaborative, patient-focused studies spanning biochemical, genetic, pharmacologic, cell biological, and patient cohort and tumor molecular analysis will provide fundamental insight into the function and control of RAS and oncogenic ALK signaling in cancer and further enhance our novel rational polytherapy strategy. Our ultimate goal is to ensure we transform ALK+ NSCLC from a lethal disease into a chronic or curable condition through biologically-based precision medicine."
"9210257","Project Summary Bladder nociceptive afferents play an important role in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC). Although extensive research has been conducted to understand the involvement of parasympathetic pelvic C- fiber afferents in bladder nociception, very few studies have investigated the role of sympathetic hypogastric afferents. Previous animal studies have shown that sympathetic hypogastric afferents respond to bladder distension and/or irritation. Clinical evidence also supports the role of sympathetic afferents in bladder sensation/pain because blockade of the sympathetic afferent pathway can significantly relieve visceral pelvic pain including PBS/IC symptoms and bladder sensation/pain can still be elicited in human subjects with destroyed sacral spinal cord or transected sacral spinal roots. Since both sympathetic hypogastric nerves and parasympathetic pelvic nerves innervate the bladder, bladder distention/irritation always activates both pathways, causing significant difficulty in separating the functions of these two pathways in bladder nociception. Currently it is still unknown how sympathetic hypogastric afferents interact with the parasympathetic pelvic afferents in the CNS to modulate bladder function. It is also unknown if sympathetic hypogastric afferents alone can trigger bladder reflex activity and what role the sympathetic hypogastric nociceptive afferents play in bladder nociception/overactivity. Without this basic knowledge, our understanding of bladder nociception is certainly incomplete, which is evident clinically when diagnosing and attempting to treat PBS/IC. Therefore, in this grant application we propose to determine the functions of both parasympathetic nociceptive pelvic C-fiber afferents and sympathetic nociceptive/non-nociceptive hypogastric afferents in the control of bladder reflex activity and to determine the central convergence/interaction between sympathetic hypogastric afferents and parasympathetic pelvic nociceptive/non-nociceptive afferents. The success of our project will provide the basic scientific knowledge of bladder nociception and will benefit millions of Americans suffering from PBS/IC."
"9210552","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders are common among youth, with prevalence estimates around 13%. Though these disorders can occur alone, they are often comorbid and are associated with a variety of adverse outcomes. Anxiety disorders in childhood put individuals at greater risk for educational underachievement, substance abuse, anxiety, and depression later in life. These disorders rarely remit on their own, making understanding their treatment a priority of great public health importance. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well- established empirically supported treatment for childhood anxiety, typically achieving response rates of 60% in clinic-based trials. However, there remains a large portion of youth who do not respond to CBT interventions and little is known about the mechanisms of change in CBT for youth anxiety. Thus, there is a need for research examining what factors may differentiate treatment responders from nonresponders, as well as the mechanisms through which CBT for childhood anxiety achieves its effects. Existing research aimed at understanding these factors has tended to take a nomothetic approach to analyses, aggregating information from large samples to understand what predicts outcome for the average youth. However, it is unlikely that many youth present to clinics similarly to the average youth, which may explain why the results of current studies have been inconclusive. The present study uses a dynamical systems framework to examine mechanisms of change in CBT for childhood anxiety both idiographically (individual level) and nomothetically (group level). We propose to collect ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data via a smartphone application (app) at pretreatment (Time 1), midtreatment (Time 2), and posttreatment (Time 3) from 80 youth aged 11 - 17 receiving treatment at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic. At Time 1 and Time 3, youth and their families will also undergo a diagnostic interview to assess for psychopathology, as well as complete a variety of independent-evaluator administered, parent-, and self-report measures of anxiety severity, coping, emotion regulation, and depressive symptoms. A dynamical systems framework will guide the analytical approach and will allow the simultaneous examination of the relationship between and across variables to model potential mechanisms of change. Results from the present study will inform the mechanisms of change of CBT for childhood anxiety, as well as inform the personalization of treatment, ultimately reducing costs of mental health care."
"9278102","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Overview: Prevalence of PGD in returning Veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation New Dawn (OND) appears to equal that of PTSD (Bolen et al., 2007). This is not altogether surprising, given that loss of life is widespread in most combat theatres. Moreover, combat Veterans experience a 'Dual Burden' of (a) loss and (b) trauma exposure (Iverson et al., 2005; Papa, Neria, & Litz, 2008) in which the potentially added negative impact of repeated significant life threat combines with loss of close attachment and support to cause impairment. Indeed, fully 21.3% of a sample of OIF/OEF Veterans reported significant difficulty coping with grief over combat death; and those who reported difficulty coping with grief were 2.4 times as likely to report health problems, and significantly more likely to report both missing work and increasing medical care use. Even more striking was the finding that effects of grief were independent of either PTSD or Depression, in that, after controlling for both PTSD and MDD, risk of reporting poor health was doubled among those reporting high grief (Toblin et al., 2012).  Unfortunately, treatments for grief in Veterans remain understudied. Our research group has recently completed pilot work on an innovative, technology-leveraged treatment protocol for PGD that combines Behavioral Activation with Therapeutic Exposure and appears readily applicable to the Veteran and Military populations. We propose to evaluate this intervention through a repeated measures randomized controlled trial design (pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3 & 6 month follow-up) in order to compare it to the treatment most commonly offered to Veterans with PGD: Cognitive Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling (as outlined by the VA / DoD Iraq War Clinician Guide, 2nd ed.) (Pivar, 2007). Both treatments will be delivered over 5 sessions in which sessions 2, 3, and 4 of both treatments will be delivered via televideo to Veterans' homes to increase contextual relevance of treatment components. Measures will cover clinical outcomes, process outcomes, and cost outcomes in order to assess relative effectiveness of treatment across multiple parameters. Participants will be Veterans of OIF/OEF/OND who meet PGD cutoff criteria but do not meet criteria for PTSD (as a 5 session intervention is not considered appropriate for this diagnostic group).  This study has the following Specific Aims: (1) To compare the efficacy of BATE-G vs. Cognitive Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling in terms of PGD and psychological outcomes in 140 OIF/OEF/OND Veterans, aged 21 years and older, who meet criteria for PGD. (2) To evaluate BATE-G with respect to its relative effects on increasing the frequency of community based reinforcing activities. (3) To evaluate BATE-G with respect to its relative effects on distal treatment targets, including perceived social support and health-related functioning.  The following are the study Hypotheses: (1) BATE-G will be more effective than Cognitive Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling in reducing symptoms of PGD, both at post-treatment and follow-up. Moreover, BATE-G will be more effective in reducing acute emotional distress and preventing long-term emotional distress in terms of general depression and anxiety symptoms. (2) BATE-G will result in increased frequency of completed positively reinforcing, community-based events when compared to Cognitive Restructuring and Supportive Grief Counseling. (3) BATE-G will result in greater improvements in perceived social support and health. Note: this project is the first evidence-based treatment for PGD in military populations, thus addressing a significant service gap."
"9204318","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project seeks to increase the availability of detailed research data about a person's neighborhood and individual characteristics, behaviors, and health outcomes, information which is crucial for research on critical national issues, such as health disparities. However, a delicate balance must be struck between providing easy access to these data and protecting the anonymity of study participants. Responding to the rising demand for contextualized microdata, large national surveys typically collect meticulous information about their subjects' personal and geographic attributes. When data are prepared for public-use files, however, much of this important detail is either suppressed or coarsened to protect the anonymity of respondents. These limitations reduce opportunities for important scientific research and impose costly burdens on producers and distributors who must implement restrictive data use agreements.  Little is known about how the ability to protect a respondent's identity (i.e., disclosure risk) is affected by releasing microdata files that contain the contextual attributes of counties, tracts, blockgroups, and 1/2-mile geographic areas surrounding each subject. Considering factors that are determined at the outset of a study, it is not known how disclosure risk of contextualized microdata is affected by varying levels of sensitive information, or different sampling designs and analytical purposes. Turning to factors that are usually addressed after data collection when research files are prepared for dissemination, it is not known to what extent that disclosure risk and the scientific value of data is affected by the selection of different variables for release or application of various statistical techniques to limit disclosure. With a priori knowledge of these determinants, data producers will be able to anticipate how many and which respondents are at risk of disclosure, and adapt their data collection methods to protect them. Such adjustments will preserve and enhance the utility of the data for broad dissemination. Also, factors that affect data collection efficiencies can then be measured, allowing for the estimation of survey costs associated with modifying sampling designs to meet disclosure goals.  Hence this project seeks to incorporate disclosure risk into the conceptual and empirical frameworks used in the evaluation of survey designs. In so doing, we first develop and validate models that predict the composition of survey data under different sampling designs. Next we develop measures and methods used in the assessments of disclosure risk, analytical utility, and disclosure survey costs that are best suited for evaluating sampling and database designs. Lastly we conduct simulations to gather estimates of risk, utility, and cost for studies with a wide range of sampling and database design characteristics."

"9242271","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide Emily McGowan, MD with the skills, knowledge, and mentored research experience that are essential for an independent career as a clinician scientist in the field of allergy and immunology. Food allergy (FA) is a common childhood disease that appears to have increased in prevalence over the past two decades. The interplay between genes and the environment likely plays a key role in the development of FA, and DNA methylation is one possible mechanism by which environmental influences may affect gene expression. Several nutrients, including folate, vitamin B12, and choline, are involved in the one carbon metabolism pathway (OCMP), in which a methyl donor is transferred to DNA. In two separate cohorts, our group has shown an association between higher serum folate levels and the development of allergic sensitization, leading to our central hypothesis that differential exposure to folate, B12, and choline is associated with the development of food sensitization (FS) and FA, and that this is mediated by changes in DNAm. Dr. McGowan proposes to explore this hypothesis by examining 1) whether pre-natal or post-natal exposure to these OCMP micronutrients is independently associated with FS and FA; 2) whether differential exposure to these OCMP micronutrients is associated with DNA methylation; and 3) whether differentially methylated genes are associated with the development of FS and FA. In order to address these questions, Dr. McGowan will use two study populations: 1) a nested case-control study of children within the well-characterized Boston Birth Cohort (BBC) and 2) a new prospective cohort of 100 children at high risk for developing FA. Given the widespread exposure to methyl donors through formula and supplements in infancy, the results of this study could have major public health implications. In addition, this K23 award will provide Dr. McGowan with opportunities for advanced training in epidemiology, including the completion of a PhD in Clinical Investigation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHBSPH). She will also pursue training to develop new skills in the analysis and interpretation of epigenomic data. Dr. McGowan plans to achieve these goals through formal coursework, workshops, national meetings, and mentored research. Her primary mentor for this award is Dr. Xiaobin Wang, a molecular epidemiologist who studies genetic and environmental predictors of childhood health. Her mentoring team further includes Drs. Robert Wood, Elizabeth Matsui, Corinne Keet, Daniele Fallin, and Kasper Hansen, experts in food allergy, epidemiology, epigenetics, and statistics. This training plan, and the data generated from this proposed project, will provide the foundation needed to successfully transition to the role of an independent clinician scientist studying the epidemiology and treatment of food allergy."
"9197333","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods have disproportionately high rates of obesity and obesity-related morbidity, including increased risk for physical role limitations and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Studies of potential mechanisms linking neighborhood disadvantage with health outcomes have primarily focused on daytime health behaviors, including diet or physical activity. However, sleep is a critical health behavior that is associated with neighborhood disadvantage, and may play a causal role in explaining the links between neighborhood disadvantage and health. However, the extant research on neighborhood disadvantage and sleep is based exclusively on cross-sectional data, using self-reports of sleep and neighborhood characteristics. Building on the existing research infrastructure developed by our team's previously funded, ongoing studies, we have a unique and important opportunity to study whether changes in the built and social environment, stimulated by substantial economic investment improves sleep, and in turn, reduces obesity-related health disparities. The study cohort includes a randomly selected cohort of 1100 low- income, African American adults, from two urban neighborhoods, one of which is undergoing a dramatic revitalization over the next 5 years (i.e., the intervention neighborhood), and the other (the sociodemographically-matched control neighborhood) is not undergoing any such changes. We will add longitudinal assessments of sleep using actigraphy, self-reports, and in a subsample of 300, objective, in-home monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea, to provide a rich characterization of sleep profiles before, during, and, after neighborhood changes. Evidence gained from this study would have substantial scientific and policy implications for identifying novel individual-level and neighborhood level factors that contribute to striking and pervasive racial and socioeconomic disparities in health."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this renewal of my mid-career award is to enhance my ability to train, mentor and support the career development of fellows and junior faculty in patient-oriented research in immunologic lung disease, in particular chronic beryllium disease (CBD) and HIV-induced lung disease. This proposal will insure that Dr. Fontenot continues to have adequate protected time to provide more opportunities for teaching and mentoring fellows and junior faculty. In addition, this protected time will allow Dr. Fontenot to participate in coursework that will enhance his leadership abilities, hone his skills in team science and enhance study design. During the previous funding period, my trainees have received 10 grants, including two R01s and a multi-PI U01 award, emphasizing my ability to successfully train mentees towards independence. With the support of my present K24, I have expanded my research portfolio to include the investigation of HIV-induced lung disease, and this renewal builds on my recently renewed R01 investigating pathogenic T cells in beryllium-induced disease and two U01s focused on the HIV-infected lung. For this renewal, the newly proposed research will consist of two specific aims focusing on CBD and HIV-induced disease in order to highlight the breadth of options that are available to trainees The first specific aim ill determine the peptide repertoire of HLA-DP2-expressing antigen-presenting cells before and after Be exposure and will investigate the hypothesis that Be2+ cations alter the repertoire of peptides capable of binding to HLA-DP2. In the second aim, we will investigate the hypothesis that Tropheryma whipplei is a true lung pathogen in HIV-infected subjects and contributes to loss of lung function. The mentoring plan will expand Dr. Fontenot's role in mentoring physician-scientists and other trainees in patient-oriented research. In addition, the research and mentoring plan will continue to leverage the resources and infrastructure present at the University of Colorado, including the Clinical Science Program and K12 Program in the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, an outstanding Department of Medicine with a long track record for successfully training physician-scientists, and long-standing collaborations that bridge basic immunology and patient-oriented research, to improve the quality of our patient's lives. With the continued support of this award, Dr. Fontenot will continu to lead translational lung immunology research and train the next generation of physician-scientists in lung immunology and pulmonary medicine."

"9198842","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My goal is to become a uniquely qualified, highly productive, independent biomedical investigator of abusive head trauma (AHT) in children. Specifically, I am interested in studying lesion evolution in children and modeling this type of injury in piglets to develop age- and injury-specific treatments that will translate to effective therapies for infants and children. Successful interventions to lessen the burden of morbidity and mortality after injury require understanding the pathophysiological cascades that lead to the extensive injury patterns observed. Currently, the pathophysiology of AHT in children is poorly understood, though clues exist from clinical, radiologic, biomechanical, and pathologic observations. I will initially focus on investigating the age-dependent pathophysiology after injuries and insults characteristic of AHT in our unique immature large- animal model. Though I have considerable basic neuroscience experience and have studied accidental pediatric head trauma in Dr. Duhaime's translational lab, it has only been through recent increasing clinical exposure that I have become aware of this pervasive and understudied public health problem that garners more controversy than data and answers. In order to accurately model AHT in my future independent career, I request additional multidisciplinary training in clinical abusive head  trauma through coursework at Harvard Medical School, national and international meetings, a forensic pathology observership, and training by Drs. Duhaime, Newton, and McGuone who are clinicians treating and studying children with AHT. Focused training in what is known about this injury (clinical presentation, injury evolution, and outcome metrics via MRI or autopsy) will allow  me to more accurately model, characterize, and interpret this complex injury in our piglets and to translate this to the pathophysiology in children. As one important component, subclinical and clinical seizures are common after AHT and are highly likely to contribute to the pathophysiological cascades due to unique features of the developing brain. In order to study the potential role of seizures in exacerbating damage after AHT, I request training from Dr. Staley who is a world leader in electrographic seizure detection, ion transport, and basic pathophysiology of cytotoxic cerebral edema in the immature brain. I will gain additional in- depth knowledge of developmental differences in the immature brain through coursework at Harvard University. In vivo imaging is a powerful tool to study injured children and observe the parallel injury in our model. Therefore, I seek training through coursework at MIT and the Martinos Center for Bioimaging and with Dr. Hunter who is a world authority in the use of MRI to study head injury in children. With my previous experience in the field of accidental pediatric brain trauma, my team of mentors and collaborators, and the educational opportunities at MGH/ Harvard/ MIT/ The Martinos Center, I believe this training will help me optimize my career goal of shedding light on these mysterious and unfortunately common injuries.  Traumatic brain injury is THE leading cause of death and disability in children. In children under the age 2, the majority  of severe TBI is due to AHT. Though the injury event is usually occult, there is often evidence of an impact and a subdural hematoma (SDH), the most common intracranial abnormality resulting from inflicted injury. Children with severe injuries typically present with seizures and apneic episodes. Tissue damage is not restricted to the zone immediately underlying the SDH, but patches of damaged parenchyma develop remotely. In severe cases, the injury can evolve into profound damage of the entire hemisphere associated with the subdural hematoma, termed hemispheric hypodensity for its appearance on acute computed tomography. Hemispheric delineated damage underlying the SDH with striking sparing of the other hemisphere is an injury pattern unique to immaturity. Infants often exhibit injury in both hemispheres, while toddlers more commonly exhibit relative sparing of the hemisphere contralateral to the SDH. Infants have immature chloride gradients that can result in subclinical seizures that may play a role in exacerbating the extent of tissue damage. No medical treatments currently exist that can halt the progressive evolution of this injury. A significant barrier to understanding the pathophysiology in AHT is a lack of an animal model that replicates these injuries. Here we propose to test the effect of subject age in our unique model of AHT which combines cortical impact, unilateral subdural hematoma, midline shift, apnea, and seizures in order to illuminate the pathophysiology. We have a long history of studying age-dependent differences in response to TBI using piglets developmentally comparable to human infants (PND 7) and toddlers (PND 30). Here we propose to determine the effect of age on 1.) the pattern of tissue injury after AHT injuries determined by MRI and pathology and 2.) the development of seizures after injuries typical of AHT. Our central hypothesis is that combined insults act synergistically to overwhelm the inherent compensatory abilities of the immature brain, leading to more widespread damage in patterns that are age-dependent. Determination of age-dependent patterns in pathology after injury and identification of key components that lead to tissue damage, such as seizures and edema, will produce targets for directed therapies. Therapeutics that abort the cascades set in motion after AHT may reduce the severity of neural injuries and reduce the number of children that die or are permanently disabled from inflicted injuries."
"9392325","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks to transform the current paradigm for blood metal analysis through the development of a sensor that will provide rapid and accurate point-of-care measurement of blood metals in susceptible pediatric populations. Biomarkers of pediatric, low-level, mixed exposures to lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), and cadmium (Cd) are essential. There is a clear need for improved technology to quantitatively assess and identify adverse consequences of these exposures. Current approaches suffer from high costs including extensive labor, equipment and time-consuming laboratory procedures, and often demonstrate long turnaround times. This project addresses this need by developing a novel sensor technology for simultaneous and swift measurement of heavy metals in whole blood. Our approach is to integrate anodic stripping voltammetry with our deep expertise in lab-on-a-chip and microfluidics. Our multidisciplinary team of engineers, chemists, and clinical/environmental health experts has already taken the first steps towards developing such a device and has demonstrated feasibility of the sensor through pilot tests. We are now poised to fully develop the sensor system for point-of-care application. This project will be the first to develop an environmentally-friendly lab-on- a-chip sensor for point-of-care multi-metal analysis, which will provide real-time analysis of metals for susceptible populations, in national and international research and clinical settings. Collaboration with our commercialization partner will position the multi-metal sensor for wide-spread use in clinical and research settings."
"9234928","  Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex, multifactorial autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy in skin and various internal organs such as the lungs, kidneys and heart disease with no specific treatment. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a common complication of SSc, and compared to other subgroups of PAH patients, responds poorly to currently approved vasodilators. Oxidative damage is a well- defined component of lung disease in SSc as well as in other organs and pathology studies have shown evidence of oxidative damage in SSc lungs. Dimethyl fumarate (DMF), recently been approved as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, triggers the general response to oxidative damage through Nrf2, resulting in the induction of multiple enzymes designed to counteract the oxidative process. DMF reduces inflammation driven by the NF?B pathway, especially in endothelial cells. Preclinical studies by our group as well as other groups have shown that DMF inhibits PAH in murine models. In addition multiple markers of oxidative stress are elevated in patients with SSc and SSc-PAH, suggesting that this is an important pathway mediating vascular damage in SSc-PAH. On the basis of these studies, we propose a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of DMF added to stable background, standard of care PAH therapy in SSc?PAH patients, comparing the change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 24 weeks to baseline in DMF compared to placebo treated patients. We will recruit 34 patients from three centers with large SSc and PAH patient populations at University of Pittsburgh, Boston University and Johns Hopkins Medical Centers to account for up to 20% dropout, leaving 28 patients for analysis. We will also study safety to ensure no unexpected adverse effects are related to DMF in these patients  To provide further information about target engagement and reinforce potential clinical efficacy, we will examine biomarkers of oxidative stress and of PAH. To assess the effect of DMF on markers of SSc-PAH, we will compare changes from baseline to 24-weeks in levels of B-type natriuretic peptide, Endostatin, Endothelin- 1, Endoglin, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, von Willebrand Factor, and Vascular Cellular Adhesion Molecule 1, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cell RNA expression biomarkers: IL13RA1, CCR1, JAK2 and MRC, comparing DMF to placebo treated patients. We will examine the performance of each of these markers as potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers by comparing their levels longitudinally to changes in 6MWD. To assess the effect of DMF treatment on markers of oxidative stress, we will measure markers of lipid, DNA, and prostaglandin oxidation, comparing changes after treatment to baseline levels in DMF compared to placebo treated patients. In addition, we will measure markers of NF?B activation, IL-6 and CCL2, again comparing changes in levels in DMF to placebo treated patients. These studies should provide strong clinical support for larger phase 2/3 studies of DMF for SSc-PAH in the future. They should also provide new insight into the mechanism of action of DMF in humans."
"9235035","With increased participation of women in the military there is an increased need to effectively diagnose, manage and cure breast cancer in the veteran population. The invasive and metastatic nature of this cancer poses a formidable challenge. Our long term goal is to identify therapeutic avenues to effectively treat metastasis of breast cancer. The objective of the proposed work is to understand the mechanistic and functional consequences of the loss of a gatekeeper protein NMI, on breast cancer metastasis. We hypothesize that loss of NMI unleashes unwarranted activation of Hh signaling and enhances the propensity of breast cancer cells to metastasize. As our first Aim, we will employ thorough investigation using innovative experimental approach to elucidate the mechanistic and functional consequences of NMI loss on Hh driven metastatic progression of breast cancer. We will use a unique reagent created by us, to determine whether the modulation of Hh signaling is via classical Hh ligand-dependent or non-classical Hh ligand-independent mechanisms. We will characterize the molecular events that lead to activated Hh signaling and interrogate the outcomes on cancer cell attributes of stemness, drug resistance and mesenchymal phenotype. We also will employ in vivo assays that encompass xenograft studies and investigations with genetically engineered mouse models that will enable us to specifically query activation of Hh signaling in situations of NMI loss. In the second Aim, we will develop an understanding of the correlative expression between NMI and molecular signatures of metastasis in tumor specimens derived from Stage IV breast cancer patients. We will follow upon our findings that NMI expression is compromised in hypoxic conditions, a finding with profound implications for metastasis; and test an innovative pre-clinical pharmacological inhibition strategy to reduce metastasis of breast cancer that is devoid of NMI. Collectively, this Aim will allow us to strengthen the clinical (translational) applicability of our observations and lay the foundation to move towards a future clinical trial."
"9392278","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence suggests that impairments in self-regulatory control may contribute to the development and persistence of bulimia nervosa (BN). Loss of control over eating and compensatory behaviors in BN may result, in part, from deficits in inhibitory control and associated brain-based dysfunction in corticostriatal circuits. In additin, recent models of BN pathology suggest that impairments in self-regulation of emotion may relate to disorder-specific behaviors. Deficits in the ability to exert self-regulatory control may  also allow repeated binge eating and purging to become an entrenched behavioral pattern. Identification and characterization of brain-based abnormalities in BN, which could inform novel interventions that target these abnormalities, is imperative. A main objective of the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan includes promoting discovery of brain-behavior processes that contribute to mental illness. Consistent with this strategic objective and the need to develop new and targeted treatments for BN, the proposed Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) is a three-year program of research and training focused on the overlapping corticostriatal neural circuits mediating multiple self-regulatory capacities in adult BN. Prior studies of control-related deficits in BN have been limited by their use of a singl task to study a single neurocognitive process. The proposed study assesses, among women with BN (n = 30) and group-matched controls (n = 30), the behavioral and neural determinants of three forms of self-regulation (motor inhibition, emotion regulation, and goal-directed action control) and examines relations among these capacities and BN symptoms. The project combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), eating disorder symptom assessment, and well-validated neurocognitive tasks. The project aims to test the hypotheses that: 1) women with BN will demonstrate decreased corticostriatal activation and impaired performance during motor inhibitory control and emotion regulation tasks, 2) women with BN will demonstrate deficient goal-directed control abilities, and 3) BN participants with more severe symptoms will demonstrate the greatest impairments in corticostriatal activation, and a model including self-regulatory abilities in all three domains will best predict BN severity. To our knowledge, this project is the first to examine brain activation during negative and positive emotion regulation in  BN and the first to investigate a potential relative imbalance in goal-directed control and habit-based responding in BN. This NRSA will lay groundwork for future investigations of the neural substrates of eating disorders by providing the applicant with the advanced skills and research experience needed to collect, analyze, and interpret fMRI and behavioral data, along with introductory training in neurodevelopment. The project's novel integration of multiple, non-symptom-specific probes of motor, affective, and goal-directed behavioral control within the same sample permits distinction of the relative contributions of these self- regulatory control capacities to BN pathology."
"9317839","Summary Abstract Pneumonic plague is the deadliest form of disease caused by Yersinia pestis and the basis for its classification as a Tier 1 Select Agent. In the absence of antibiotics, mortality rates approach 100% within a week of inhalation of Y. pestis. The progression of pneumonic plague begins with an extended ?pre-inflammatory? phase, featuring no disease symptoms despite a rapidly increasing number of bacteria in the lung. After 36-48 hours, there is an abrupt switch to a ?pro-inflammatory? phase characterized by the rapid onset of symptoms, the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the dramatic accumulation of neutrophils in the airways. Progression into the pro-inflammatory phase of disease leads to the severe necrotizing pneumonia that is the hallmark of pneumonic plague, but the factors influencing this biphasic disease progression are poorly defined. The objective of the work proposed here is to characterize the pulmonary factors/conditions that control the onset of inflammation and the neutrophil-related processes that contribute to host damage. The first Aim probes the regulation of inflammation during the pre-inflammatory phase. We have previously shown that virulent Y. pestis triggers early production of a pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1?) in the lung, and we have preliminary data suggesting that this is due to simultaneous induction of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). We will test that theory by selective addition/depletion experiments, coupled with evaluation of the kinetics of neutrophil influx and other parameters of disease progression. The second Aim focuses on neutrophil-mediated damage in the pro-inflammatory phase. We recently reported that depletion of neutrophils prior to pulmonary infection with Y. pestis significantly diminishes inflammatory lung pathology. We will utilize currently available knockout mouse lines to implicate neutrophil-related functions that contribute to the inflammatory damage in the lung. Furthermore, we will use commercially available inhibitors to suppress host innate immune functions and enhance antibiotic efficacy for treating pneumonic plague."
"9299765","Viruses have co-evolved with their hosts for centuries and as a result have developed mechanisms of immune escape. The simplest mechanism is mutation of surface epitopes recognized by antibodies. However, hosts have countered with cytotoxic CD8 T cells that can recognize mutated viruses via conserved, internal proteins. These CD8 T cell epitopes are less susceptible to immune pressure as they are essential for viral fitness. Importantly, once activated, a portion of the anti-viral T cells will persist long-term, some within non-lymphoid tissues as tissue-resident memory cells (TRM) poised to respond rapidly after subsequent infections. Unfortunately, however, not all TRM are created equal. TRM derived from respiratory infection are not stable, and as their numbers diminish, cross-protection against related viruses is also lost. Thus, understanding the mechanisms which prevent the development of durable TRM is essential for designing interventions to extend their protective capacity. The goal of this application is to determine how the early T cell programmatic events unique to viral infections of the lung and the ensuing respiratory immune response promote a developmental divergence from the archetypical memory program associated with long-lived memory. In preliminary data, we identified a population of transitional CCR2+ monocyte/dendritic cell (moDC) which emigrate to the lung draining lymph node coordinate with T cell activation and only after respiratory infection. These moDC develop in response to type I IFN signaling and express high levels of the inhibitory molecule PD-L1. Importantly, selective depletion of moDC early after infection modifies the phenotype of the resultant TRM to resemble conventional, long-lived TRM, suggesting that these moDC suppress the conventional TRM program. Here, we will extend our preliminary studies to define the pathogen-driven signals which elicit the development and recruitment of these suppressive cells to the site of priming. Additional studies will define mechanistically how moDC interface with anti-viral CD8 T cells in the lymph node and whether release of the moDC suppression prolongs TRM survival in the lung and concomitantly extends heterologous protection. Together, these studies will provide a clear picture of the complex relationship between virus and host where specific pathogen-driven immune responses in place to temper local immunity may also divert the responding CD8 T cells towards a short-lived respiratory TRM fate. Translation of this knowledge will improve vaccines against respiratory viruses which remain a public health concern."
"9306661","Immune responses triggered by oral antigens can have significant clinical consequences. Dendritic cells (DCs) are among the most important cellular determinants of oral tolerance, as they are tasked, in a mucosal environment that also contains antigens and pattern stimuli derived from vast commensal microbiota, with deciding whether adaptive immunity should be mobilized or tolerized to given antigens. We have recently generated a DC-specific mouse model of spontaneous Th2-associated disease of the small intestine (SI) called TRAF6?DC, which initially appeared to be microbiota-dependent because antibiotic treatment is ameliorative. However, germ-free (GF) TRAF6?DC mice surprisingly exhibit exacerbated disease compared to mice housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions, suggesting a trigger other than microbiota. We now have preliminary findings that TRAF6?DC disease is completely ameliorated in mice fed antigen-free (AF) diet, suggesting the driving stimulus of disease is food antigen. The TRAF6?DC model may be employed to reveal novel mechanisms underpinning DC-mediated oral tolerance, and thus we propose the following specific aims: 1. Investigate the immunological mechanisms of TRAF6?DC oral antigen sensitivity. We propose to further characterize the immunologic abnormalities of TRAF6?DC mice in the context of oral antigen sensitivity to elucidate novel immunologic mechanisms linking development and maintenance of oral tolerance to TRAF6-mediated signals in DCs. In this respect, we will examine the relevant cellular actors, as well as regulatory and effector molecules to determine how homeostasis is disrupted in the presence of oral antigen. We will use diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) transgenic mice to examine the effects of temporal ablation of various types of DCs in the context of both DC-specific TRAF6 deficiency and oral tolerance maintenance to begin to determine whether TRAF6 provides key pro-tolerance signals to certain cell types versus creating dysfunctional DCs in its absence. Model oral antigen will also be utilized in TRAF6?DC mice to better define the mechanism(s) of disease development. 2. Investigate the independent effects of microbiota and antibiotics on TRAF6?DC oral antigen sensitivity. Mitigation of TRAF6?DC disease by antibiotics in the absence of microbiota suggests potential biologically relevant direct effects of antibiotics on immune cells which we propose to investigate in the context of TRAF6?DC oral antigen sensitivity in the presence or absence of microbiota and/or food antigens. While we typically employ a broad-spectrum cocktail of four antibiotic drugs from different classes for the purpose of microflora depletion, our hypothesis in these studies will initially focus on the role of ampicillin, which belongs to the ?-lactam class that has been previously reported to have direct biotic immunomodulatory activity. Additionally, we will examine the effects of antibiotics on oral antigen sensitivity in TRAF6?DC neonates under SPF and GF conditions to determine temporal relationships between antibiotic treatment, commensal microbiotic colonization, and oral antigen sensitivity."
"9259231","Project Summary  Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) represents a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. ICB is effective against several cancer types, including particularly aggressive cancers such as metastatic melanoma. Remarkably, some patients treated with ICB experience durable responses previously unseen in metastatic disease, lasting upwards of 10 years. However, the majority of patients do not respond to ICB or relapse after therapy necessitating a deeper understanding of the molecular determinants of ICB response.  Through the proposed work, I will characterize the role of the T cell repertoire in determining response to immune checkpoint blockade. Clinical studies have established a positive correlation between tumor-specific ?neo-antigen? (Ag) burden and response to ICB therapy, suggesting that ICB response is limited by the ability of T cells to recognize tumors. However, these studies also suggest that patients with low neo-Ag load will not benefit from ICB therapy, necessitating sensitizing therapies. I have found that treatment with a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) blocking antibody reduces tumor burden in models with limited neo-Ag repertoires; furthermore, RANKL blockade sensitizes these tumors to ICB therapy, resulting in complete remissions. My collaborator has shown that RANKL blockade inhibits central tolerance by depleting AIRE-medullary epithelial cells (mTECs), leading to the release of self-reactive T cells usually depleted in the thymus. Based on these observations, I hypothesize that temporary inhibition of central tolerance resulting from the depletion of AIRE-expressing mTECs mobilizes self-reactive T cells in the thymus to promote effective T cell-dependent responses against tumors that are otherwise ICB-resistant and/or harbor few somatic mutations (SM-low).  In Aim 1, I will determine if the depletion of AIRE-expressing mTECs caused by RANKL blockade is responsible for the resulting decrease in tumor burden and restored sensitivity to ICB. To do this, I will use a genetic model of AIRE depletion to determine if temporary ablation of AIRE-expressing mTECs is sufficient to recapitulate the anti-tumor effects of RANKL blockade with and without ICB therapy against ICB-resistant and SM-low tumors. I will then characterize the effect of mTEC depletion on the activation and function of the T cells using multi-parameter flow cytometry and deplete T cells in vivo to establish that the anti-tumor effects observed after mTEC depletion are T cell-mediated. In addition, I will use previously characterized tetramers4,5 and peptides6 to determine whether depletion of mTECs mobilizes T cells reactive to known self-Ag epitopes.  In Aim 2, I will characterize the fate and function of T cells that are generated during the period of mTEC depletion after RANKL blockade. Using Rag2-GFP mice, I will isolate GFP+ recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), and adoptively transfer them to congenic recipients to establish the extent to which the transferred RTEs participate in tumor responses. I will concurrently determine if these transferred RTEs are enriched for self- reactive T cells. In addition, I will use bioinformatic approaches to test if either self-Ags, neo-Ags, or both are depleted as a result of RANKL blockade with and without ICB therapy. If these Ags are depleted, I will functionally validate their depletion in future studies to establish novel antigen prediction pipelines.  These studies will provide key insight into the role of the T cell repertoire in cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, RANKL blockade therapy (Denosumab) is already clinically approved; therefore, I expect that this work will directly contribute to improved patient outcomes."
"9198576","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 20% of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis cases (IPF) are familial, comprising a syndrome known as Familial Interstitial Pneumonia (FIP). Short peripheral blood telomere length has been associated with sporadic IPF and FIP, and rare loss of function mutations in telomerase complex genes have been found in 15-20% of FIP families, however, investigations to date regarding the mechanisms linking telomerase dysfunction and telomere shortening with lung fibrosis have been largely unrevealing. Using whole-exome sequencing, we have recently identified loss-of-function mutations in regulator of telomere elongation helicase (RTEL1) that segregated with disease in 15 FIP families, and our preliminary data suggest impaired RTEL1 function leads to inefficient repair of DNA-damage in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), leading to activation of p53 mediated cell- cycle arrest signalin programs that may contribute to AEC dysfunction in the context of pulmonary fibrosis. Using bioinformatics approaches, we identified a large group of FIP families (>50%) that carry rare variants in other genes related to cell cycle, DNA damage-repair, and p53 signaling, suggesting that abnormalities in these interrelated pathways may underlie genetic risk for a large subset of FIP families. In this proposal, we hypothesize that loss-of-function genetic variants in FIP-associated genes (including RTEL1) predispose to pulmonary fibrosis by altering DNA-damage repair and activating p53-mediated cell-cycle checkpoint arrest signaling in alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in impaired re-epithelialization following injury and progressive fibrotic remodeling. Our specific aims are: (1) To determine the role of Rtel in experimental lung fibrosis. (2) To determine the mechanisms through which RTEL1 regulates DNA damage-repair and cell survival/proliferation in response to injury, and (3) To determine whether DNA damage-repair capacity is altered in a large subset of FIP families and patients with sporadic IPF. To accomplish these aims, we will utilize Rtel deficient mouse models, RTEL1 deficient cell lines, primary cells from Rtel deficient mice, and primary cells from FIP and IPF patients. Together, these studies hold the promise of elucidating the role of DNA-damage repair and signaling in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, thus adding important new insights into disease pathogenesis."
"9198580","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary means by which nerve cells communicate is via the release of neurotransmitter at chemical synapses. The function of the brain and the ability of the brain to store and process information depend on these synaptic connections forming precisely and reliably. This proposal is directed towards developing a molecular understanding the mechanisms that regulated this process of synaptogenesis and synapse maintenance. We propose to use a combination of genetics, cell biology, molecular biology and live imaging to identify and characterize the role of molecular components of the signaling pathways that coordinate synaptic development by studying the specific assembly of a set of nerve-nerve synapses. In previous work, we described the order of cellular events in nascent synapse formation by visualizing the recruitment of fluorescent-tagged components to newly forming synapses. Furthermore, we isolated mutants that disrupt the formation of these synapses. Cloning of a subset of these identified an F-box protein that selectively targets proteins for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, regulators of both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton, a transcriptional regulatory protein and a novel conserved protein. Using a variety of molecular, genetic and protein interaction studies we now propose to determine at a mechanistic level how these proteins function to regulate synapse assembly. In addition, we will use genetic approaches to isolate and characterize additional genes that disrupt signaling between mechanosensory neurons and their synaptic partners in C. elegans to extend our molecular understanding of the process. Together these approaches will help define mechanisms that cells use to identify and communicate with one another during the process of synapse formation and synaptic maintenance. While synaptogenesis is undoubtedly less complex in C. elegans than in vertebrates, it is already clear that similar pathways operate in both systems. Thus, analysis of the molecules participating in the process in C. elegans should help define a set of general and likely conserved principles that are common to synaptogenesis mechanisms in general."
"9397605","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation is a biologically significant protein modification system found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The modification of proteins through this process can induce a broad range of effects on protein function, and ultimately alter cellular processes such as cell signaling, protein complex assembly and adherence. Given that this pathway targets a diverse, but specific, group of proteins, it has become evident that cellular mechanisms are in place to direct this specificity. A major determinant of acceptor protein selectivity in eukaryotic N-linked glycosylation is the tight coupling of this process with protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. In this process, proteins are glycosylated in an unfolded state, making the glycosylation consensus sequences available as they emerge from the Sec translocon complex. In contrast, many fundamental questions remain for the N-linked glycosylation pathway in bacteria, specifically pertaining to the structural state - folded or unfolded - of acceptor proteins and whether glycosylation and protein translocation to the periplasm are coupled. Therefore, characterization of this glycosylation process at a molecular level is required. For this analysis, we will utilize  previously identified N-linked glycosylation system, pgl, and a protein targeted by this system, PEB3, from Campylobacter jejuni. This study aims to identify the structural conformation of acceptor proteins, the relative position of the glycosylation consensus sequence and the protein-protein interactions that contribute to glycosylation efficiency. In the first part of this study, we plan to focus on the conformational state that PEB3 adopts during the glycosylation process using in vitro and in vivo glycosylation assays. Next, we propose to investigate the structural context of the glycosylation consensus sequence using a site-directed mutagenesis approach to generate PEB3 mutants containing the glycosylation consensus sequence in selected structured and unstructured regions of the protein. Glycosylation efficiencies of the PEB3 mutants will be measured quantitatively in vitro and in vivo to assess the structural requirements of acceptor proteins. We will also address the spatial localization of components of the N-linked glycosylation pathway with the Sec translocon in an effort to identify the mechanisms that permit efficient glycosylation of acceptor proteins in vivo. This will be achieved through both protein-protein interactions studies and an analysis of the subcellular localization of the oligosaccharyl transferase and Sec translocon by fluorescence microscopy. In addition to elucidating the basic molecular mechanisms for N-linked glycosylation efficiency in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, these studies will be useful for understanding how glycan modifications alter protein stability and function, and for the development of recombinant glycoproteins for therapeutics such as hormones, antibodies and cytokines."
"9397303","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The pathways that promote prostate cancer survival downstream of the androgen receptor (AR) remain unknown and that lack of knowledge is a critical barrier to the progress of treating prostate cancer. The goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms which promote prostate cancer survival in vivo and use this knowledge to test the feasibility of therapeutically targeting those survival pathways. Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix via integrins is critical for the survival of prostate cells. The mechanism by which integrin ?6ß1 is preferentially expressed in prostate cancer, to the virtual exclusion of other integrins, and the extent to which ?6ß1controls cell survival in prostate tumors are not known. A new prostate cancer survival pathway in which AR directly controls ?6ß1 expression was recently identified and published. This pathway functions independently of the PI3K pathway, such that inhibition of both ?6ß1 and PI3K is required to effectively induce prostate cancer cell death. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the mechanisms by which the AR/?6ß1 pathway drives prostate cancer survival and test the feasibility of using combined inhibition of ?6ß1 and PI3K as a therapeutic approach. The hypothesis is that AR-dependent stimulation of integrin ?6ß1 expression is required for NF?B /Bcl-xL/c-FLIP to promote survival of prostate cancer cells, and simultaneous inhibition of the ?6ß1 and PI3K pathways is required to induce death of PI3K-dependent prostate cancer cells. In Aim 1, AR-expressing cell lines will be used to decipher the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms by which AR, Erg/Etv, and laminin-10 control integrin ?6ß1 expression in prostate cancer. In Aim 2, AR-expressing cells will be used to delineate the specific signaling pathways downstream of  AR/?6ß1 that control prostate cancer survival. In Aim 3, human tissue and cell line xenografts will be used to test a new PI3K inhibitor, PX866, currently in phase I trials in combination with ?6ß1 inhibition to suppress tumor survival and growth, and determine the contribution of integrin ?6ß1 and PI3K to tumor survival in vivo. The proposed studies will significantly improve scientific knowledge in the fields of cell adhesion and survival signaling, b delineating the mechanistic basis behind a novel relationship between a nuclear hormone receptor and integrin ?6ß1. Through these studies a more in-depth understanding of how steroids and integrins cooperate to control cell survival will be gained, which will further our knowledge of how the extracellular matrix impacts tumor cell survival. The prostate cancer field will be advanced by linking the prostate-specific Erg/Etv fusion oncogenes with a new AR/?6ß1-dependent, but PI3K-independent, survival pathway that could be part of a strategy for treating prostate cancer patients. Assessment of this pathway in human patient xenografts will help to determine the feasibility of targeting these pathways in vivo and shift current paradigms by demonstrating the importance and contribution of AR to prostate tumor survival through the extracellular matrix."
"9235752","PROJECT SUMMARY Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease mediated by T cell entry into pancreatic islets and the subsequent destruction of insulin-producing ? cells. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a critical inhibitory population that prevents autoimmunity in most individuals, but ultimately fails to prevent disease onset in patients with T1D. However, the mechanistic basis for this ?Treg insufficiency? remains poorly understood. We have recently identified a neuropilin-1:semaphorin-4a (Nrp1:Sema4a) axis that is required to maintain Treg stability, survival and function in mouse models of human cancer and inflammatory bowel disease. Treg-restricted loss of this pathway in mice leads to profound resistance to tumor growth, due to an inability to restrain anti-tumor immunity, but did not lead to loss of homeostatic Treg function that might have led to systemic inflammation and autoimmunity. This suggested that Tregs only require the Nrp1 pathway in inflammatory lesions, although it is not known if this pathway is used by Tregs in autoimmune diabetes. Surprisingly, while Treg-restricted loss of Nrp1 did not impact autoimmune diabetes, but enhanced Nrp1 signaling induced by ectopic ligand expression on islet ? cells reduced diabetes by ~50%. Further preliminary analysis of intra-islet Tregs revealed a progressive and selective loss of Nrp1, which limited the capacity of Tregs to use this pathway. In this competitive renewal application, we will determine if the Nrp1 pathway impacts autoimmune diabetes, and if enforced utilization limits Treg insufficiency and autoimmune diabetes. AIM 1: On the molecular basis of Treg insufficiency in autoimmune diabetes. In this Aim, we will ask: (A) Does enhanced intra-islet Nrp1-Treg ligation mediate protection from autoimmune diabetes? (B) What is the functional impact of Nrp1 loss on intra-islet Treg function? (C) What is the mechanism of Nrp1 shedding? (D) What drives Nrp1 shedding? AIM 2: Approaches to negate Treg insufficiency in autoimmune diabetes. In this Aim, we will ask: (A) Can Treg function be enhanced by nanoparticle-mediated delivery in vivo? (B) Can Treg function be enhanced in vivo using HSV-mediated gene delivery? This project will have a significant impact on our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie Treg insufficiency in autoimmune diabetes, and determine if two translational proof-of-concept approaches can boost Treg function/survival and limit autoimmune diabetes. Given that we discovered and elucidated the Nrp1 pathway and its physiological impact on Treg function/survival, and have many unique tools to probe its function, we are in the best position to conduct this research."

"9245220","Abstract Humans are frequently exposed to seasonal influenza viruses like H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B viruses. However, infections with avian influenza viruses like H5N1 or H7N9 are rare. So far it is unclear how the human immune system reacts to exposure to these viruses, specifically in the context of pre-existing immunity to seasonal influenza virus strains. Preliminary data has shown that in these rare cases antibodies to epitopes that are conserved between human seasonal and avian influenza viruses are boosted. In this collaborative effort between the Xu laboratory (Fudan University, Shanghai, China) and the Krammer laboratory (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, USA) we propose to investigate the human antibody response after natural infection with avian influenza viruses. Antibody responses will be characterized at three levels. Initially we will assess the reactivity and functionality of polyclonal serum responses of humans naturally infected with H7N9 viruses. Then, on an epidemiologic level, we will assess the cross-reactivity of 'at risk' cohorts (wet market vendors, bird handlers, farmers etc.) to get insights into the prevalence of exposure to avian influenza viruses. Finally, we will zoom in to characterize the epitope usage of monoclonal antibodies induced after infection with avian influenza viruses. The data obtained from this study will guide the design of novel broadly protective and pandemic influenza virus vaccines and will significantly enhance our pandemic preparedness."
"9254830","Project Summary: Hyper inflammation induced by bacteria or bacterial products through toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) leads to sepsis and hence current approaches are directed towards blockade of such receptors. While many such candidate antagonists have shown promise they also result in induction of inappropriate innate immune responses thus increasing risk of development of shock leading to death. We have described a novel approach to treat endotoxemia associated with sepsis, fundamentally different from other reports. AyuV-1, a small molecular weight polysaccharide by virtue of its ability to bind to active sites of TLR4 inhibited LPS induced production of inflammatory mediators by human monocytes. AyuV-1 reversed inflammation and protected mice even 24/48 h after onset of LPS induced endotoxemia. Apart from competitively inhibiting LPS induced inflammation AyuV-1 also activated alternate pathway of macrophages (Arginase-1, and IL-10). Such macrophages are known to display increased phagocytic activity, are resistant to LPS induced activation and associated with resolution of inflammation and tissue repair. The company?s overarching goal is to develop and commercialize a small molecular weight, water soluble, non-toxic natural oligosaccharide useful in adjunctive and/or in combination therapy for sepsis, severe sepsis via intravenous (IV) dosing. In the preliminary data, we have designed, synthesized a novel oligosaccharide analog AyuV-25 as potent TLR4 antagonist. Compound AyuV-25 has demonstrated high in vivo efficacy (high survival rate, organ protection) in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis mouse model and downregulated the inflammatory cytokines. During Phase-I of this proposal, aim-1: We will monitor the hemodynamic changes in inflammatory biomarkers of sepsis pathogenesis such as iNOS, MIP-1(Macrophage inflammatory protein), MIF (Macrophage migration inhibitory factor) as well as the markers of alternate activation pathways i.e. IL-10, arginase, and MCP-1 in mice CLP model after dosing AyuV-25. We will also do the microbiology studies to monitor the septicemia (CFU) and effect of AyuV-25 at different time points. Aim-2: Our second goal is to evaluate AyuV- 25 in CLP model in aged mice via IV dosing and study the survival and organ protection. A mortality score of >40% will be indicative of an efficacious end point as protective effect of AyuV- 25 to aged mice. This result will be a very important finding to progress to our future phase-II project where preclinical formulation, PK, ADME/TOX will be done in collaboration with UNTHSC pre-clinical service."
"9273247","SUMMARY Learning disabilities (LD) are among the most common types of disabilities in juvenile offenders that have been linked to delinquency. Nationwide, children and youth with special education needs are overrepresented in the US justice systems. Reports estimate delinquent juveniles with a disability to comprise about 30% to 60% of the entire delinquent population. A national survey in the US states an average prevalence rate of 33.4% of incarcerated juveniles with disabilities in correctional facilities. Moreover, concerns have long been raised on the recidivism rates of youth with disabilities and special education backgrounds. In general, regarding educational performance, academic deficits such as a lack of basic skills in reading, writing, and mathematics have been associated with recidivism. However, these studies largely neglect the dynamic nature of delinquent and criminal behavior that has been documented within the field of developmental criminology with a focus on the onset, continuity, and extinction of deviant behavior. In light of this research, the identification and remediation of LD as a risk factor for repeat offending has been a persistent challenge given the accumulation of and overlap with other risk factors such as poverty, familial patterns of criminality, influence of delinquent peers, and the differential impact of risk factors across an individual?s developmental trajectory. Altogether, there is a challenge around the implementation of sophisticated methodology to model the complex longitudinal and reciprocal links between juvenile delinquency and educational problems such as learning disabilities, and how they relate to other risk factors over time. This challenge is intensified by the required large samples to detect robust and interpretable patterns and predictive relationships for groups of youth with severe LDs that, by definition, are small in size and censored with regard to various educational outcomes (e.g., academic performance). This Hub is conceived to contribute to the field?s understanding of the connection between LD and delinquent behavior. Through its organizational and administrative activities (ADMINISTRATION CORE), the Hub will serve as a source of expertise to elucidate the etiology of the empirical overlap between severe LD and juvenile delinquency. Through its research activities (RESEARCH PROJECT), the Hub will generate unique findings capitalizing on the availability of the relevant big data, the clinical strengths of its members and their capacity to develop and administer educational therapy to juvenile offenders, and its embeddedness within communities empowering the creation and processing of multi-level longitudinal datasets, merging sociological (i.e., criminological), behavioral, neurophysiological, and genetic/genomic data."
"9273248","SUMMARY Pursuant to the Specific Aims (SA) of the OVERALL section for the Hub, the RESEARCH PROJECT focuses on the OVERALL SA2, i.e., (1) identifying a subgroup of juvenile offenders placed in residential settings who are characterized by severe learning disabilities (LD) using big data approaches; (2) carrying out a novel mixed media (person-to-person plus person-to-computer) educational therapy; and (3) differentiating responders from nonresponders to academic therapy by tracking neurophysiological and epigenetic markers. Each of these SAs, in turn, unfolds into a network of research aims. Specifically, using historical (i.e., generated by a freeze from a historical dataset) big data from the Connecticut Court Support Services Division and the Harris County Juvenile Probation Department (estimated n of ~100,000 individual cases), we will initiate three interrelated inquiries: (1) to rigorously evaluate data quality and the statistical assumptions underlying the models that are applicable to big data; (2) to enable valid descriptive and causal inferences from large-scale algorithms applied to heterogeneous samples; and (3) to gain an understanding of the complexities of learning disabilities (LD) among delinquent youth through the statistical methods that capture developmental processes on multiple levels. The last inquiry will result in the development of an algorithm that will be applied to current data maintained on juveniles in the Harris County Juvenile Probation Department, to assist in the identification of, in total, 192 individuals (48 each year of the Hub) with severe LD. These individuals, in a nonconcurrent multiple baseline design, will be offered an educational therapy designed to address severe reading problems in juvenile detainees using a novel mixed media intervention in which the person-to-person intensive 1:1 component is completed while youth are in residential settings (24 sessions, delivered in 90 minute settings 3 times a week) and a ?gamified? educational iPad learning tool follow-up completed upon release (with appropriate network fidelity monitoring and participant reinforcement). The person-to-person component is developed specifically for juvenile offenders with severe LD, combining two well-established and highly- regarded intervention programs designed to systematically build students? repertoire of grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules as well as develop comprehensive reading skills, from beginning reading to proficiency. We anticipate, based on the literature, that the intervention, although its components have been convincingly demonstrated to be effective, will generate a spectrum of outcomes, with youth being more or less responsive to the intervention. To differentiate these outcomes, we will trace two sets of biomarkers thought to be associated with learning, i.e., neurophysiological and epigenetic markers, sampled throughout the intervention delivery. To evaluate the generalizability and durability of the intervention, we will also administer the intervention to 6 children per year in Years 1-4 of the projects (i.e., to 24 youth) in detention and probation centers in the state of Connecticut."
"9258441","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biofilms are associated with hundreds of thousands of infections each year and greatly increase treatment costs and mortality. These adverse effects are caused not only by increased resistance of bacteria living in the biofilm matrix but likely also by adaptive evolution of mutants into different, recalcitrant forms. To study this evolutionary process in biofilms we devised a method enabling long-term selection of populations of the opportunistic pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia that undergo a cycle of attachment, biofilm assembly, and dispersal. Selection repeatedly favored mutations in loci commonly mutated during chronic infections, suggesting that biofilm adaptation recapitulates aspects of evolution during infections. This proposal focuses on two genetic loci that coordinate the sensing of a secreted signal (BDSF) with internal regulation of a switch governing biofilm production (cyclic-di-GMP). Mutations in different protein domains led to different ecological strategies and together different mutants produced a more robust biofilm. The overarching goal of this project is to precisely define the selective advantages of mutants with different strategie of signaling, adhesion, and dispersal in diverse biofilm environments. To tackle this complex problem we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in molecular genetics and evolutionary biology, biochemistry and mass spectrometry, and biophysical structure-function analysis. Our objectives are to 1) quantify how mutants that vary in sensing BDSF and producing cyclic-di-GMP are adaptive in biofilm communities, 2) determine how BDSF mechanistically controls the activity of the primary locus under selection, and the effects of adaptive mutations on this process, and 3) to develop an ecological model of how these processes operate in mixed-mutant and mixed-species communities. We expect to learn how this system may be manipulated to induce dispersal from biofilms and increase their susceptibility, which could be broadly relevant for developing novel antimicrobials."
"9270852","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The risk of anal cancer in HIV-infected individuals has markedly increased following the advent of anti-retroviral therapy, especially in HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM). 90% percent of invasive anal squamous cell carcinomas are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, of which 80-90% are associated with HPV type 16. Although anal HPV-16 infection is common in HIV-infected MSM, only a small fraction of infected men ever develops anal cancer. Why this occurs in some but not others is unknown.  Recent advances in technology have made it feasible to sequence and study the genetic composition, or ?microbiome?, of the community of microbes that colonize different parts of the human body. The expansion of otherwise commensal bacteria within the gastrointestinal tract is postulated to contribute to inflammation and carcinogenesis via a variety of pathways including the production of superoxide radicals and toxins. These imbalances have been associated with disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.  This study will determine whether a similar association exists between the anal canal microbiome and high- grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), the precursor to invasive anal cancer. We will determine whether enrichment of the anal canal with pro-inflammatory bacteria and depletion of anti-inflammatory bacteria is associated with anal HSIL, particularly because long-term chronic inflammation has been proposed as a key mediator in HPV cancer pathogenesis. Accordingly our specific aims are: 1) To characterize the differences in ? and ?-diversity of the anal microbiome in HIV-infected, anal HPV-16 infected, MSM on effective ART with and without anal HSIL; and 2) To identify specific differences in the composition of the anal microbiome between HIV-infected, anal HPV-16 infected, MSM on effective ART with and without anal HSIL. Our results will contribute to our understanding of HPV carcinogenesis and may potentially provide new approaches to diagnosis and treatment of anal HSIL."
"9252824","Asthma, a chronic illness affecting all ages, is increasing in prevalence. In the USA, ~ 18.9 million adults and 7.1 million children currently have asthma ? 1/12 the population. Asthma, which significantly affects the quality of life with no available cure, is managed mainly by symptomatic treatments with corticosteroids and ?2- agonists which, while effective, exert significant adverse effects. Improved, targeted therapies are needed for this allergic disease. Genetic and environmental factors, e.g, allergens and respiratory infections, trigger and exacerbate asthma. Immune responses differentiate CD4+ T cells into effector T cells that secrete inflammatory cytokines. In particular, asthma is characterized by increases in TH2 and TH17 effector cells that mediate influx of eosinophils and neutrophils, which produce the airway inflammation-related symptoms of asthma. Thus, suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines is an attractive therapeutic approach to dampen allergic responses in asthma. Protein ubiquitylation is a key regulatory mechanism of innate and adaptive immune systems mediating inflammation. Nedd4-family E3 ligases, including Itch, negatively regulate inflammatory immune responses by suppressing TH2 and TH17 differentiation and cytokine production. Genetic disruption of Itch leads to the development of multi-system immune disorders and lung inflammation. Itch exists in an auto-inhibited state with no ligase function; activation is achieved by binding of proteins such as Ndfip1, which restores its E3 ligase activity. Ndfip1 mice develop asthma-like lung inflammation linked to TH2 and -/- TH17 T-cells, and Ndfip protein activates Nedd4-family E3 ligases in cells, attenuating TH2 and TH17 cell functions. Finally, SNPs in Ndfip1 are linked to asthma and atopic dermatitis. Thus, Ndfip is a master suppressor of T-cell mediated inflammatory responses. The therapeutic hypothesis of the successful Phase I project was that that small molecule mimics of Ndfip1 can be used to selectively activate ubiquitylation cascades to limit TH2 and TH17 cytokine production and to dampen allergic inflammation. In the Phase I project a novel TR-FRET based homogeneous E3 assay was used to identify, in high throughput screening, small molecule mimics of Ndfip1 that selectively activated Itch in vitro and in cells. Selected activators induced Treg differentiation of CD4+ T-cells, and treatment of Ndfip1-/- cells with the Itch activator P0057892 suppressed production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-4. In Phase II, lead optimization and additional preclinical studies (ADME/PK, efficacy in animal models) will be performed with selected agonists to ascertain their ability to modulate Itch functions and to dampen inflammation in relevant mouse models."
"9207090","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DHA intake of US adults is low and conversion of ?-linolenic acid (18:3n-3) to DHA (22:6n-3) is also low. As a result US women enter pregnancy with lower DHA status than other countries in the developed world suggesting a potential deficiency of an important nutrient that has been shown to reduce inflammation. The goal of this Phase III Clinical Trial (randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled) is to test the primary hypothesis that supplementing US women with 1000 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 800 mg above the amount currently in many prenatal nutritional supplements (~200 mg) during the half of pregnancy can reduce early preterm birth (ePTB) (<34 wk. gestation). This was a favorable secondary outcomes of a US trial (RO1 HD047315, Clinical Trials.gov ID: NCT00266825) conducted at one of the proposed study sites on which the current proposal is modeled. Secondary outcomes include birth weight <1500g and pregnancy outcomes (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, C-section delivery). We propose a Bayesian Adaptive Design with 90% power to detect the hypothesized outcomes with an estimated 938 subjects that allows the study to stop early if strong results (probability >0.995) are observed before the study is scheduled to end and places 60% of the participants on the better DHA dose. Conventional equal randomization with 90% power would require 1200 subjects, be longer, and place only 50% of the participants on the better DHA dose. The proposed study has the potential to determine if nutritional supplementation with DHA during pregnancy can reduce the incidence of ePTB, a serious public health problem with large societal and family costs. The randomization design has the potential to significantly expedite findings to the research community and clinical practice."
"9391769","PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is the third competitive renewal of this Institutional National Research Service Award (T32 AI07637) that was previously entitled ?Training in Sexually Transmitted Diseases Including HIV?. With this application we are expanding in the breadth of pathogens addressed which has resulted in a change of the title to ?Training in STIs and Other Infections of Global Health Significance? (TSTI-OIGHS). The program proposes to train 3 post- doctoral Trainees (MD and PhD) per year. The primary mission of this multidisciplinary training program remains the training of well qualified MD and PhD scientists for productive and sustainable careers in research. With increasing globalization it is imperative that we develop investigators who have the tools necessary to develop prevention and treatment strategies directed at infections of global health significance. This requires individuals trained in the spectrum of research skills ranging from the bench to the field. The foundation of the TSTI-OIGHS is practical training in Molecular Biology, Immunology, Clinical Trials Design, Biostatistics, Behavioral Science, Global Health, Epidemiology and Implementation Science within established and productive research programs. Formal didactic training through the Career development, Education and Research Training (CERT) Center affiliated with the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI) and the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI complements the practical training. This training program draws on the skills of 17 full faculty mentors and 11 resource faculty from six Departments for training our fellows. Training within the TSTI-OIGHS is structure around three tracks: 1) Basic Science, 2) Behavioral and Clinical Science and 3) Global Health, Epidemiology and Implementation Science. As team science is rapidly becoming the primary mode of operation for biomedical scientists addressing complex questions related to human health, our training particularly emphases training investigators who are familiar with the practices, procedures, and languages of collaboration necessary for creating and working within a productive scientific team. This training program leverages the infrastructure and expertise of the Indiana University Center for Global Health which supports the Academic Model of Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) in western Kenya, a partnership that has been recognized as a model for international collaboration by the NIH. Of the 12 fellows graduating from this program since 2006, 83% remain in academic medicine and/or research. One third of graduated fellows old positions outside of Indiana University School of Medicine. In addition, this training grant is a highly valued pipeline for Indiana University School of Medicine Faculty. All of these factors make Indiana University an ideal place to train the next generation of experts in infectious of global health significance."
"9391727","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metals are ubiquitous in the environment and have long been recognized to pose significant threats to hu- man health. Blood lead (Pb) has been consistently associated with deficits in IQ and academic achievement in numerous controlled studies. Manganese (Mn) is an essential element, yet neurotoxic in excess, capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier and accumulating in the brain. Current approaches for measuring such exposures suffer from high costs including extensive labor, equipment and time-consuming laboratory procedures, and often, demonstrate long turnaround times. Hence, there is a critical need for improved technology to quantitatively assess levels and identify adverse consequences of these exposures. Our preliminary data show feasibility of measuring of Mn and Pb metals with point-of-care sensors. We therefore propose to demon- strate rapid, point-of-care, multi-analyte assessment of Mn and Pb metals in a finger prick of blood from children. In the R21 phase, we will demonstrate sensor validity and usability for metal analysis in whole blood. The feasibility of the sensor has been established in our prior work. In Aim 1, we will firs demonstrate ability to ac- accurately and reliably measure Mn and Pb metals in blood under real-world conditions with appropriate specific- ty and sensitivity. Then, we will demonstrate ability to scale-up manufacturing of sensors for the study in the R33 phase. In Aim 2, we will develop a streamlined, user-friendly software interface. Finally, we will assess usability of the sensor and supporting documentation by seeking feedback from experts and study staff. We will demonstrate the ability for sensors to be used with minimal oversight and establish strategies for data analysis and deployment. The R33 phase will further demonstrate the added scientific value. In Aim 3 we will deploy the sensor in longitudinal cohort of adolescent children to evaluate the relationship between traditional and novel internal dose markers of metals (Mn and Pb) and neuromotor performance. We will evaluate the novel hypothesis that Mn and Pb will significantly impact functional gait and static and dynamic balance in an adolescent cohort. Additionally, we propose a high risk/high benefit aim to evaluate the clinical significance of unbound or free Mn in whole blood as a novel biomarker for Mn. In Aim 4 we will develop effective participant report-back mecha- nisms to return blood metal results. The R33 phase will culminate with the development of ethical strategies for effective mechanisms for reporting measurement results back to study participants. A relatively swift, simultaneous assessment of heavy metal exposure, which ultimately reduces costs and turnaround times, would benefit pediatric public health nationally and internationally. Indeed, our long-term goal is to use sensors to move blood analysis from the laboratory to the clinical setting, providing results within minutes."
"9233344","ABSTRACT PI- Phillip B. Hylemon, Ph.D. Title: ?Bile Acids and Clostridium scindens Inhibit C. difficile: Role of Secreted Antibacterial Compounds?  Clostridium difficile, the cause of antibiotic associated diarrhea and colitis, is a growing health threat for patients taking broad spectrum antibiotics. It has been estimated that C. difficile may be responsible for almost a half a million infections per year and 29,000 deaths in the US at an annual cost of $4.8 billion dollars. Patients on broad-spectrum antibiotics markedly decrease the levels of protective gut microbiota and allows proliferation of C. difficile normally found in low levels in some individuals. Patients treated with antibiotics, especially in hospitals, are also at risk for colonization by C. difficile spores, which germinate in the GI tract (stimulated by specific bile acids) producing vegetative cells that secrete toxins A and B causing diarrhea and colitis. Patients with antibiotics associated diarrhea and/or colitis are routinely treated with either metronidazole or vancomycin to kill C. difficile vegetative cells colonizing the colon; however, up to 30% all patients successfully treated with these antibiotics will relapse following cessation of antibiotic therapy. Fecal transplants, using gut microbiota from healthy donors, have been highly successful in treating relapsing patients. Recent studies, published in Nature, were undertaken to determine which members of the gut microbiota are responsible for resistance to C. difficile infection. It was reported that Clostridium scindens, a human gut bacterium that converts the primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), respectively, is strongly associated with inhibition of C. difficile infections in both animal models and in human patients. This past year, our laboratory made two important discoveries that may explain how C. difficile is able to colonize the human GI tract, when patients are treated with antibiotics, and how C. scindens inhibits the growth and colonization by C. difficile. Aim 1: Confirm the structure and characterize the mechanism of action of a cyclic 6 amino acid antibiotic peptide secreted by C. difficile that inhibits the growth of C. scindens and other human gut bacteria. Subaim 1a. Determine if clinical strains of C. difficile secrete the same compound. Aim 2: Purify, characterize, and determine the structure of a CA inducible antibacterial compound(s) secreted by C. scindens ATCC 35704 and VPI 12708 that inhibits the growth of C. difficile and other pathogenic bacteria in vitro. Subaim 2a. Determine the spectrum of different bacteria inhibited by this compound(s). Subaim 2b. Identify the bile acid inducible genes encoding the enzymes(s) involved in the synthesis of this antibacterial compound using RNAseq technology. Subaim 2c. Characterize the mechanism of inhibition of C. difficile growth by this compound(s). Aim 3: Screen multiple strains of C. scindens for antibacterial compounds that inhibit C. difficile. Subaim 3a. Develop a ?cocktail? of C. scindens strains producing different antibacterial compounds to use in the treatment of patients with infections. Subaim 3b. Develop strains of C. scindens resistant to the 6 amino acid cyclic antibiotic peptide secreted by C. difficile. Long Term Objective: Find safe and effective ways to prevent and treat C. difficile infections using different strains of C. scindens and inhibitory compounds secreted by C. scindens. Determine how bile acids and antibacterial compounds, secreted by different species of the genus Clostridium, regulate the gut microbiome community structure."
"9405702","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for the five-year continuation of our NIMH-funded institutional training grant, Clinical and Translational Research Training in Late-Life Mood Disorders (T32 MH019986), Years 16-20. The primary goal of this two-year fellowship (three years in selected case) is to provide rigorous training in the basic foundations and methodologic tools necessary for successful clinical and translational investigation in geriatric mental health and psychiatry. The fellowship is designed for post-residency psychiatrists and PhDs in the behavioral sciences (four post-doctoral fellows annually). Consistent with NIMH priorities, the focus of training in the new funding period will continue to be translational and treatment development research, as well as interventions and mental health services research. Research training in designed to be broadly multi disciplinary. The most important component of the training program continues to be an apprenticeship with an academically successful mentor which, in most cases, leads to faculty appointments and successful competition for extramural funding. Trainees develop core skills and knowledge in grant writing and research project management by participating in a weekly research survival skills seminar. A wide range of didactic offerings is available and is prescribed on an individual basis. All fellows participate in ongoing training in the responsible conduct of research. The proposed training activities take place within the Advanced Center for Interventions and Services Research for Late-Life Depression Prevention (ACISR/LLDP, P30 MH090333); C.F. Reynolds, PI) and the John A. Hartford Foundation Center of Excellence in Geriatric Psychiatry (Reynolds, PI). The second goal of the program is to provide research training opportunities, in the form of a summer research elective, to rising second-year medical students, in order to attract a diverse and talented group of medical students into psychiatric research careers. We propose to continue funding four summer research elective slots annually through this training program, as well as a one year-long medical student fellowship to the most promising student in each summer's program. Both components of the program, pre- and post-doctoral, are part of a broad research training strategy at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Psychiatry, to respond to a national shortage of researchers in geriatric mental health. The Department fosters many research career development activities for students and faculty at all levels. This training grant both contributes to and benefits from this developmental strategy."
"9201336","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by demyelination and degeneration of axons in the central nervous system (CNS). Compelling evidence suggests that breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and angiogenic remodeling occur at an early stage of MS as well as in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and is central to the initiation and maintenance of disease pathogenesis by affording leukocyte infiltration into the brain parenchyma. This vascular remodeling, in turn, is strongly influenced by the interaction between extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and their endothelial integrin cell surface receptors. In particular, the ?5?1 integrin and its ligand fibronectin are strongly upregulated on remodeling cerebral vessels in animal models of ischemic stroke and MS, and transgenic mice lacking this receptor in endothelial cells (?5-EC-KO mice) show delayed and reduced angiogenic remodeling in response to hypoxia. Furthermore, our recent studies in an experimental stroke model showed that ?5-EC-KO mice are profoundly resistant to BBB breakdown, resulting in dramatic reductions in size of ischemic infarct. Pharmacological blockade of ?5?1 integrin in wild-type (WT) mice achieved similar protection. As BBB breakdown and angiogenesis occur at an early stage of MS and EAE, and current evidence suggests that the ?5?1 integrin is an important trigger of cerebrovascular remodeling, we hypothesize that inhibition of endothelial ?5?1 integrin stabilizes the BBB and reduces leukocyte infiltration in demyelinating disease. In support of this hypothesis, new preliminary results suggest that pharmacological blockade of ?5?1 integrin in cultured WT brain endothelial cells stabilizes their barrier properties in presece of the barrier-disrupting inflammatory cytokine TNF-?. These studies also suggested that protection may be a result of increased expression of claudin-5, a tight junction protein and critical component of the BBB. Armed with these results, we propose the following specific aims: (1) determine whether genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of ?5?1 integrin on endothelial cells stabilizes the BBB, resulting in reduced neuroinflammation and demyelination in the EAE model, and 2) determine the molecular mechanism whereby ?5?1 integrin inhibition promotes BBB integrity and subsequent resistance to EAE. We expect to demonstrate that inhibition of ?5?1 integrin in endothelial cells confers robust resistance to EAE by increasing BBB integrity through stabilization of tight junction proteins and suppression of the leukocyte- homing adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Successful completion of these studies will further our goal of developing endothelial ?5?1 integrin as a novel MS therapeutic target."
"9412604","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application outlines plans for the establishment of the NIDDK Interconnectivity Network Coordinating Center (INCC) to expand and enhance the current NIDDK Consortium Interconnectivity Network (dkCOIN) community and infrastructure. The current dkCOIN was established in recognition of the need to interconnect research communities, both basic and clinical, by providing seamless access to large pools of data relevant to the mission of NIDDK. The aims of the dkCOIN project are similar in scope to those of the existing Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF), a project established in 2008 by the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research Institutes to provide a landscape analysis of the myriad of tools and data available via the web, and to create a portal where these resources could be collectively accessed. The NIF was designed to break down silos of information through its novel data federation technology and its concept based search. NIF takes a global view of resources such that there are no neuroscience resources or metabolic resources, only biomedical resources that contain information of more or less relevance to different communities. Thus, while the NIF user interface is domain-specific; the NIF information system and the resources it federates are broadly applicable to biomedical science. In this proposal, we outline plans to extend and enhance dkCOIN through the use of the NIF infrastructure, data federation and expertise.  Through this merger, we can immediately add considerable value to the current dkCOIN by bringing in NIF's expansive data federation, resource catalog and semantic search services. The portal will continue to present the data and tools according to the needs and customs of the NIDDK community, but the backend will tap into an expanded resource pool that cuts across all domains of biomedical science, rather than a restricted set. New development will focus on the creation of workflows using tools in use by the NIDDK community with this vast array of integrated data. These tools and workflows will link to cloud computational and storage resources, in order to ensure that the network is sustainable. New development will also focus on more effective means to connect NIDDK researchers with resources that are available to them to support their research projects. Development will be driven by use cases supplied by NIDDK-supported researchers to ensure that it meets NI DDK's objectives. We believe that the strategy outlined here provides a cost effective and innovative means to ensure that researchers have access to the data and tools they require regardless of where they reside, and provides a sustainable model for future similar efforts."
"9218746","Project Summary - eDecídete: Mobile Cessation Support for Latino Smokers  Latinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have access to health, to have knowledge of existing smoking cessation resources, to receive advice to stop smoking, and to participate in smoking cessation programs. Mobile technologies can dramatically enhance the reach of effective smoking cessation interventions. However, the reach of mobile interventions among Latinos remains minimal despite the fact that Latinos utilize smartphones at a higher rate. The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of eDecídete (Spanish for ?you can choose?), an innovative 12 week mobile smoking cessation intervention based on this work that incorporates two elements: 1) a tablet-based e-health educational session that collects personal smoking-related information to develop an individualized quit plan and guide automated and interactive text messaging; and 2) a text messaging program that includes educational information, behavioral strategies, motivational and supportive messaging, and prompts to use pharmacotherapy to support smoking cessation. Aim 1. To evaluate the impact of the culturally accommodated eDecídete program versus standard care on smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. At Month 6, smokers in eDecídete will have significantly higher cotinine-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence (no cigarettes in the past 7 days) than smokers in the control arm. Aim 2. To assess therapeutic alliance, pharmacotherapy utilization, and self-efficacy as mediators of the presumed treatment effect on cotinine-verified 7-day smoking abstinence at Month 6 among Latino smokers. Our hypothesis is that eDecídete will have greater efficacy for smoking cessation than standard care by increasing therapeutic alliance, utilization of pharmacotherapy, and self-efficacy to quit. Aim 3. To conduct a process evaluation that can inform findings and future improvements. The evaluation will assess 1) satisfaction with the program and its components; 2) text-message system utilization patterns and common content themes in text message interactions among eDecídete participants."
"9188086","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a revised PPG application to build a better understanding of T cell mechanisms in autoimmunity that has stemmed from the discovery of critical regulators of both T effector and T regulatory cells. We have discovered that IL-27 and the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) play central roles in immune responses in animals and humans and these pathways impinge on all aspects of immune function, both adaptive and innate and include Tregs, Th17 cells and dendritic cells. Little is known about these new pathways, which appear crucial in CNS inflammation and have direct relevance to diseases such as multiple sclerosis.          The primary goal of this program project grant (PPG) is to identify molecular mechanisms of how IL-27 inhibits effector T cells and induces regulatory Tr1 cells with a focus on two transcription factors cMaf and AhR, both of which are induced by IL-27 in responding Tr1 cells. The investigation of the inter-relationship of cytokines and transcription factors in both animal models and MS patients will allow a better basic understanding of immune abnormalities in MS and allow both the development of more specific immunomodulatory therapy and a mechanistic understanding of current therapies being used to treat MS.  IFN¿, a widely used first line therapy in MS has been shown to act in part by the induction of IL-27, underscoring the importance of studying this pathway in CNS autoimmunity.          This PPG brings together four investigators, each with unique strengths and expertise to investigate this new area. Project 1: (Kuchroo) Transcriptional regulation of effector and regulatory T cells in EAE; Project 2: (Littman) Transcriptional network analysis of Tr1 cells. Project 3: (Quintana) Role of AhR in the control of the innate immune response during the development of EAE. and Project 4: (Weiner) Role of IL-27 and AhR in the regulation of human effector and regulatory T cells in healthy subjects and MS patients.          The revised PPG will establish a Multi-tiered Expression Analysis Core consisting of two components:  Project 2 will undertake expression analysis using RNA-seq and ChlP-seq technologies and Core B will undertake multiplex expression analysis using the latest digital Nanostring technology to analyze the expression of transcripts in subsets and rare populations. The core will service all projects. An Administrative Core will coordinate the various administrative aspects of the PPG and a Scientific Advisory Board has been assembled to provide scientific oversight."
"9225468","PROJECT SUMMARY It is known that breast cancers with high tumor interstitial pressure (TIP) respond poorly to chemotherapy because of poor drug delivery (i.e., the high pressure prevents the drug from entering the tumorous tissue). Recent data suggests TIP is a potentially useful parameter for assessing whether a particular breast cancer will in fact ever respond to systemic anticancer treatment. Moreover, our group has exciting data that would suggest noninvasive pressure estimation in breast cancer tissue can be performed in real-time using a novel contrast agent and custom technology we have termed TIP estimation using US (TIPE-US). The first aim of this project is to develop a monodisperse phase-change contrast agent (PCCA) that is a stabilized liquid nanodroplet under ambient conditions but can be triggered using US energy to undergo a phase transition into a highly echogenic microbubble (MB). Importantly, this phase transition is sensitively governed, and linearly related to, the surrounding hydrostatic fluid pressure. We will then determine the optimal US parameters (energy) required for activating these PCCA while precisely varying the surrounding fluid pressure across a range of physiologically relevant values. A programmable US scanner will be customized to initiate and detect PCCA activation and then convert the US energy used into a corresponding pressure value via lookup tables. In the second aim, we will evaluate the potential of TIPE-US for monitoring early tumor response (or lack thereof) to anticancer therapy using an animal model of breast cancer. The outcome of the proposed experiments will establish whether TIPE-US is a viable new method for measuring intratumoral pressure in cancerous tissue. This innovative technology may ultimately be utilized to both measure TIP in cancer patients and for monitoring treatment in the neoadjuvant setting to differentiate between responders and non-responders, which in turn will allow for better, individualized treatment options to be selected."
"9204434","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K01 Award for Dr. Pushkarskaya, a clinical neuroeconomist at the Yale School of Medicine. Her research focuses on the neurobiology of decision-making under uncertainty in clinical populations, which has implications for diagnostics and treatment development. This line of research is interdisciplinary in nature, requiring expertise in economics, psychology, cognitive and systems neuroscience, neuroimaging, and clinical sciences. Dr. Pushkarskaya already has a strong background in behavioral economics. To gain additional necessary expertise she has assembled a strong and diverse mentoring team. Her primary mentor, Dr. Godfrey Pearlson (NIMH Merit Awardee), is a leading scholar in the neurobiology of major psychiatric disorders. Her co-mentors, Drs. Ifat Levy (neuroeconomics), Christopher Pittenger (neurobiology of obsessive compulsive disorder; OCD), and Douglas Rothman (neuroimaging methods), are world-renowned scholars in their fields. Her collaborators, Drs. David Tolin (psychology of OCD) and Daeyeol Lee (neurobiology and systems neuroscience) are both well-known scholars in relevant disciplines. This K01 will (1) provide required training in (i) the biological bases of behavior, (ii) cognitive and systems neuroscience, and (iii) clinical sciences; and (2) increase Dr. Pushkarskaya's versatility as a clinical neuroeconomist by introducing her to (i) advanced neuroimaging methods (including functional and structural MRI data collection and analysis techniques) and (ii) psychodiagnostic assessment. Training in these new fields of study and methodologies is essential to Dr. Pushkarskaya's success as a clinical neuroeconomist. Profound uncertainty avoidance is a well-recognized characteristic of OCD. Behavioral economics quantifies uncertainty attitudes using three distinct parameters that vary across subjects, are uncorrelated, and predict activation patterns in distinct neurobiological networks in healthy subjects. These parameters are: (i) Risk attitude, which reflects a trade-off between the probability of gains or losses and the magnitude of those gains or losses, (ii) Ambiguity attitude, which reflects the subject's sensitivity to an unknown probability of an uncertain payoff; and (iii) Conflict attitude, which reflects the subjects sensitivity to conflicting information about a probability of an uncertain payoff. To understand th neurobiology of uncertainty intolerance in OCD, it is imperative to study these parameters in OCD concurrently. The proposed study will compare risk (Specific Aim 1), ambiguity (Specific Aim 2), and conflict (Specific Aim 3) attitudes between healthy subjects and OCD patients; will contrast functional and structural correlates of uncertainty attitudes in these groups; and will correlate revealed neuro-behavioral profiles with OCD severity and OCD symptom dimensions. A comprehensive understanding of neurocognitive abnormalities in uncertainty attitudes in OCD and/or OCD symptom dimensions would represent a major conceptual step forward in the analysis of a core aspect of the phenomenology of this disease and may have implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection."
"9383261","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1, the predominant cause of AIDS in humans, is unable to replicate in most non-human species. Therefore, the most practical animal model of human AIDS consists of infection of rhesus macaques with SIVMAC or chimeras derived from SIVMAC. However, the usefulness of these models is limited by the fact that HIV-1 and SIVMAC are distinct viruses. Based on an understanding of species-specific restriction factors, we have generated recombinant viruses, named simian tropic HIV (stHIV), that are almost entirely derived from HIV-1 but can replicate in pigtailed macaques. During the last funding cycle we have used animal adaptation to develop stHIV isolates that cause AIDS in pigtail macaques. Additionally, we have studied the effects of known restriction factors on stHIV replication and unveiled the activity of novel, as yet unidentified, inhibitors that are induced by IFN? and limit lentiviral replication in a species-specific manner in primary cells. The aims of this proposal are to further develop stHIV by generating infectious molecular clones that are consistently pathogenic following mucosal challenges in both pigtail and rhesus macaques and are based on HIV-1 strains circulating in humans. To achieve these aims our studies will include a more detailed characterization of restriction factor polymorphism and activity in macaques and how these drive virus evolution in animals. Additionally, we will identify novel IFN?-induced inhibitors that limit stHIV replication in macaque cells and generate stHIV variants that can overcome them. Our preliminary data suggest that these goals are feasible and will lead to the successful development of stHIV, an advance that has the potential to transform non- human primate models for HIV-1 drug and vaccine development."
"9258570","PROJECT SUMMARY: This new F30 application proposes preclinical research to examine interactions between opioid pharmacology and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIPN) produced in male and female rats by the commonly administered antineoplastic drug paclitaxel (PTX). PTX is known to cause a CIPN frequently associated with behavioral depression that cannot be fully reversed by treatment with mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists. Recently, clinical studies have demonstrated an increased vulnerability to opioid abuse in patients treated with MOR agonists for chronic cancer pain, finding a high rate of abuse in this cohort. This application will test the hypothesis that PTX is able to alter MOR functioning in different regions of the central nervous system (CNS) resulting in depression of behavior, reduced efficacy of MOR agonists to produce analgesia, and increased sensitivity to abuse-related effects of MOR agonists. To evaluate this hypothesis, this proposal includes novel studies to investigate a sustained, neuropathy-associated depression of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) and of increase in mechanical allodynia in male and female rats. Behavioral studies will investigate the impact of PTX on the effectiveness of acute and repeated morphine to produce analgesic and abuse-related effects. Finally, complementary neurochemical studies will examine the effect of PTX on MOR signaling using the functional assay of agonist-stimulated [35S]GTP?S binding in regions of the CNS associated with pain, analgesia, and abuse. Completion of this project will provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms of CIPN-associated depression of behavior and the behavioral and neurochemical implications of PTX-treatment for MOR functioning and opioid abuse."
"9374350","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The preparation of pharmaceutical agents used to treat human disease is enabled by advances in catalytic science. This project has the long-term goal of developing a broad class of inexpensive nonmetal catalysts that promote atom transfer and bond activation processes via formal oxidation state cycling in much the same way that late transition metal catalysts operate. Within this overarching goal, the primary focus of this proposal is the design and evaluation of phosphorus-based catalysts that function in the PIII?PV redox couple. While phosphines are well-established in catalysis as spectator ligands for transition metal catalysis and as nucleophilic catalysts, this research will investigate phosphorus-based catalysts of novel composition and structure that explore the structural and electronic conditions required to enable new catalytically-relevant reactivity via reversible PII?PV oxidation state cycling. The first major effort is the development of phosphine-catalyzed O-atom transfer methods that result in reductive difunctionalization of carbonyl compounds. The second major effort is the development of amine functionalization reactions that are initiated by phosphorus-mediated bond activation. The proposed research is expected to yield new practical catalytic methods for the construction of pharmacologically-relevant small molecules that meet the challenges of sustainable synthesis, and an improved fundamental understanding the interplay between structure and reactivity in the p-block that will underpin future development of nonmetals for atom transfer, bond activation, and catalysis. Taken together, these outcomes will advance a new and powerful modality in nonmetal-based catalysis."
"9379898","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of novel lung cancer therapeutics targeting the DNA damage response. Abstract Lung tissue is constantly exposed to a wide variety of inhaled chemical agents. While the majority of these maybe innocuous, those that damage DNA have severe consequences. Thus, the DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair in these tissues is extremely important. The vast majorities of lung cancers are diagnosed in older individuals and can be attributed to complications from tobacco smoke exposure where it has been estimated that one mutation is generated for every 15 cigarettes smoked. While we have made significant strides in treatment options for non-smoking lung cancer patients with identifiable driver mutations, there have been relatively few advances in treatment of smoking-induced lung cancers. The research in this phase I STTR application exploits two important, novel findings. The first is data we recently obtained demonstrating that lung cancer patients treated with adjuvant cisplatin chemotherapy after surgery with high XPA (xeroderma pigmentosum group A) expression correlates with a decrease in overall survival. This correlation is unique to XPA and not observed with other DNA repair genes, consistent with XPA being the limiting factor in nucleotide excision repair (NER). These preliminary data serves as the rationale for targeting XPA for adjuvant combination therapy in this patient population. The second advance driving this research is our recent development of novel XPA inhibitors (XPA inhibitors). We originally identified XPA inhibitors with modest activity (IC50's of 50-100 µM) an have recently developed derivatives with IC50's in the nM range. In a single aim, we will exploit our recently discovered structure activity relationships (SAR) to complete lead optimization to maximize bioavailability, potency and specificity of XPA inhibitors. We then will interrogate the i vivo effects including PK/PD, toxicity and efficacy. Completion of these studies will provide essential information for IND enabling studies towards the development of a novel therapeutic treatment for smoking- induced lung cancer."
"9406657","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria is a disease caused by infection with Plasmodium parasites, of which P. falciparum is the deadliest. Half of the world's population is at risk of infection. Increased access to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) and mosquito vector control initiatives have saved an estimated 3.3 million lives since the year 2000. Despite this substantial progress, malaria remains a major burden to human health with approximately 627,000 deaths in 2012. There is no effective vaccine. Alarmingly, artemisinin resistance has emerged in Southeast Asia. It is imperative that we understand the mechanism and extent of resistance to help prevent a regional crisis from becoming a global disaster. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses of artemisinin-resistant parasites have recently implicated mutations in the K13 gene, with secondary contributions from genes involved in iron transport and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. We used zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), a transformative genetic editing tool, to show that removing K13 mutations from artemisinin-resistant Cambodian parasites ablates resistance. Inserting K13 mutations into artemisinin-sensitive parasite lines conferred variable degrees of resistance, indicating the influence of a permissive genetic background. We believe that our combination of ongoing evaluation of parasites from Southeast Asia and the ability to swiftly add or remove candidate mutations from isogenic, well-characterized parasites will allow a comprehensive dissection of the resistance mechanism. We will use ZFNs to study the function of K13 and the influence of genetic background on the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance. Emergence is tied to the mechanism of resistance, whereas spread is tied to transmission. We will use ZFNs to add or remove potential resistance mutations into isogenic parasite lines alone or in combination. To study emergence, we will use both the ring-stage survival assay (RSA0-3h) and a modified [3H]-hypoxanthine incorporation assay to determine artemisinin sensitivity, and explore K13 function through identifying changes in the parasite redox metabolome, ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, the definition of interacting partners, and K13 subcellular localization. Given current data, we hypothesize that K13 functions as a negative regulator of oxidative stress responses that respond to iron-mediated redox damage. We posit that resistance-associated mutations in K13 reduce function, leading to increased antioxidant capability. To study transmission, we will perform pairwise fitness comparisons of parasites in both asexual blood stages and sexual mosquito stages. An improved understanding of artemisinin resistance will help guide the targeted geographical use of non-artemisinin-based second-line or novel therapies to reduce the burden of malaria."
"9259362","PROJECT ABSTRACT  Retroviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that cause cancers and immunodeficiency diseases in humans and animals. Our laboratory studies Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), an avian retrovirus that causes solid tumors in domesticated fowl, as a model for dissecting the molecular underpinnings of retroviral assembly. Our discovery that the RSV structural protein Gag transiently travels through the nucleus in a Crm1-dependent fashion challenged the traditional view of retroviral assembly. Treatment with a Crm1 inhibitor or mutation of the nuclear export signal (NES) effectively traps RSV Gag in the nucleus, allowing us to further study the role of Gag in the nucleus. Recent studies have revealed additional retroviral Gag proteins that undergo nuclear localization, suggesting there may be common functions of Gag within the nucleus.  Retroviruses are unique in that they package two copies of their genome as non-covalently linked genomic RNA dimers. Genome dimerization is facilitated by cis-acting sequences located in the 5?UTR of the viral RNA. Dimerization of the genome is conserved in orthoretroviruses and is required for viral replication. Despite its critical importance in replication, the mechanisms underlying genome dimerization within infected cells remains poorly understood. RSV affords a unique opportunity to investigate genome dimerization using our extensive toolbox of genetic, biochemical and imaging methods because we can readily manipulate the subcellular localization of Gag with our well-characterized collection of viral mutants. In recent work, we have developed methods to visualize fluorophore-tagged RSV Gag proteins co-localized with viral genomic RNA in the cell. Our experiments suggest nuclear trafficking of Gag is required for the efficient packaging of retroviral genomic RNA. This proposal thus aims to understand the mechanism governing genome dimerization in RSV, and we will test the hypothesis that nuclear trafficking of Gag plays a role in facilitating genome dimerization.  In these studies, we will utilize the MS2 and Bgl RNA labeling system to visualize two distinct viral RNA populations to examine genome dimerization. This approach will allow us to determine the subcellular location of dimerization; whether there is preferential formation of heterodimers, which contain two genetically distinct viral genomes, or homodimers, composed of two identical viral genomes; and whether dimerization occurs in a co-transcriptional manner. We will also examine the role of nuclear Gag in genome dimerization and determine whether RSV Gag initially binds monomers or dimers. Studies that express the viral RNA and Gag in trans will investigate whether Gag facilitates genome dimerization within different compartments of the cell. The findings from this proposal will greatly contribute to the understanding of this critical step in the replication cycle and may provide support for future anti-retroviral therapeutics. Overall, this program is designed to provide a comprehensive experience consisting of opportunities in laboratory-based research, scientific career development, educational seminars, and mentoring to advance physician-scientist training."
"9091802","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 5.7 million women in the US meet criteria alcohol use disorder (AUD). While this figure remains significantly lower than men, the traditional gender gap is rapidly converging as a result of sharp elevations in women drinking patterns due, in part, to socioeconomic gains within the labor force. As gender- specific risk factors for AUD place women at a considerable disadvantage in terms of clinical health outcomes, this sharp increase in alcohol consumption urgently necessitates the development of interventions that have been specifically tailored to women. In view of this, preliminary data from  our laboratory has shown that the alpha2 adrenergic agonist, guanfacine, attenuates the negative reinforcing effects of alcohol and enhances cognitive regulation in the face of stress, preferentially in early abstinent women compared with men. We suggest that this may be due to gender-specific variation in sympathetic sensitivity. Thus, we propose a double blind, placebo-controlled, 10-week randomized clinical trial to examine the preliminary effects of guanfacine extended release (GXR, 3mgs/daily) in 60 women with AUD. A parallel 2-day experimental study using a stress versus neutral imagery exposure paradigm will also be conducted following 4 weeks of treatment (when at full dose), to examine the stress-related subjective and biological markers of change underpinning guanfacine's efficacy. Sixty women with AUD will be recruited to take part in the 10-week outpatient trial for GXR (3mgs/daily) versus placebo (PLA). This will include twice weekly appointments comprising medical management and contingency management protocols, collection of urine, breathalyzer screens, and vitals. Measures of craving and mood will also be assessed. Participants who maintain abstinence for 4 weeks will take part in 2 laboratory challenge sessions, where they will be exposed to a personal stress versus relaxing imagery condition, 1 condition per day, in a randomized order. Craving, anxiety, mood, cognitive control, HRBP, and biological stress system markers will be assessed at baseline, following imagery and at various recovery time- points. A follow-up interview will be conducted 30 days following outpatient completion. In view of prior research, we anticipate that GXR will be safe and well tolerated in women with AUD (H1); lead to greater abstinence and treatment adherence compared with the PLA group (primary outcome measures) (H2a) as well as greater attenuation of withdrawal symptoms and improved regulatory function (secondary outcome measures) both during outpatient treatment (H2b) and following stress exposure in the laboratory (H3a). We also anticipate that GXR-related changes to stress response in the laboratory will predict improved primary alcohol use outcomes (H3b). Findings will help to elucidate unique stress-system mechanisms which support attenuation of drinking in women with AUD prior to further assessment in larger randomized clinical trials. This is of paramount importance to developing medications that are integral to the health and well-being of an increasingly vulnerable sub-population of drinkers."
"9406373","PROJECT SUMMARY We have recently published our research that characterizes eCD4-Ig. eCD4-Ig is an antibody-like HIV entry inhibitor that fuses a sulfated CCR5-mimetic peptide to the C-terminus of CD4-Ig. Based on neutralization assay data, eCD4-Ig is broader than and equally potent as some of the best described HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies to date. eCD4-Ig neutralized all isolates tested including 38 HIV-1 isolates resistant to 3BNC117 or NIH45-46, HIV-2, SIVmac239, SIVmac251, and isolates that use CXCR4 as their coreceptor. The addition of the CCR5-mimetic peptide allowed eCD4-Ig to have higher affinity for cell surface-expressed HIV-1 Env and also limited viral enhancement caused by sub-neutralizing levels of CD4-Ig. Using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, we have shown that a rhesus form of eCD4-Ig can be expressed in four rhesus macaques for over one year with no harm to the animals. The rh- eCD4-Ig protein titers were at levels that protected all four macaques from multiple SHIV-AD8 challenges up to 16-times the AID50 (Animal Infectious Dose 50). We did observe a measurable anti- transgene response to the expressed rh-eCD4-Ig protein, but the response was not near the levels seen against AAV-delivered HIV-1 antibodies. Yet, even a relatively modest immune response to the delivered transgene can limit the inhibitor?s efficacy in vivo. With these encouraging data, this proposal seeks to answer two main questions: (1) Can AAV-expressed eCD4-Ig be used as a therapy to maintain viral suppression in SHIV infected macaques? (2) Can interferon-induced miRNAs regulate transgene expression from AAV vectors to limit the host immune response to the transgene? With the primary goal of using eCD4-Ig as an alternative to antiretroviral therapies, answering these two questions will continue to build on the safety and efficacy of AAV-delivered eCD4-Ig as well as realizing the complete potential of AAV vectors used for gene therapy."

"9244943","Despite significant advances in identifying genes implicated in ASD, the neural circuit mechanisms that contribute to impaired social behaviors and communication in ASD remain elusive. This lack of knowledge represents a critical gap in the development of circuity-based treatment. Social interactions demand complex neural computations, including sensory processing of social cues, decisions to determine appropriate behavioral responses, and planning and execution of the motor programs necessary to enact these behaviors. Using neuroimaging studies, the general structure of neural networks involving amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and ventral hippocampus have been associated with ?social circuitry?. However, their exact neuron ensembles and how they mediate social behaviors remains poorly defined. Our overarching hypothesis is that the functional connectivity of these circuits is altered in ASD. The neural process responsible for social behaviors most likely results from the emergent properties of transiently active neural ensembles in social behavior circuits. In this application, we propose, for the first time, to use novel and innovative tools that enable neurons in these ensembles to be permanently tagged and subsequently manipulated in the living animal. Combining recent advances of Dr. Yong-hui Jiang (PI) and Dr. Fan Wang?s (Co-investigator) groups creates a unique opportunity to explore this direction. Jiang?s group recently produced an autism model with Shank3 complete deficiency by deleting exon 4-22 (?e4-22) that has strong ?construct? and ?face? validity for SHANK3-related ASD. Shank3?e4-22-/- mice recapitulate the ASD-like behaviors with impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as aberrant functional connectivity. Wang?s group developed a highly innovative technique: Capturing Activated Neuronal Ensembles (CANE). This novel technique ?captures? and ?manipulates? neuronal ensembles in mouse brains during behavior interaction. Combining the best autism model and innovative techniques provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore the most important question in modeling autism. We hypothesize that the complete deficiency of Shank3 leads to altered neural ensembles in social circuitry that underlie the observed impaired social behaviors. Our objective is to use the CANE method to identify the neural ensembles that underlie autism behavior in Shank3 mouse model. The causality between impaired circuit and behaviors will be investigated by in vivo recording and optogenetic manipulation. Our study is first application of the CANE method to dissect the social circuity in a genetically modified ASD mouse model and represents the first step toward the development of circuit specific treatment for ASD. More importantly, the success of this project will support a paradigm shift in how we model autism, as well as delineate the circuitry for other behaviors."
"9402671","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for fuzzy diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic."
"9259607","Project Summary/ Abstract  Training with robot-applied forces and virtual reality technologies has potential to restore motor functions in stroke rehabilitation, yet the optimal dosage of robotic therapy remains unclear. A fundamental principle in the motor learning literature is that neuroplasticity can be stimulated using distortions to the visual or mechanical environment where exaggerated mistakes (augmented error-feedback or EA) can accelerate and increase learning. However, robotic training using the error-augmentation methods have achieved only modest gains over conventional therapy. One explanation could be that stroke patients exhibit heterogeneous motor deficits and thus require more focused and individualized robotic rehabilitation. We propose a novel model-based approach that explores joint human-system performance by modeling dynamics for error-guided motor learning and recommends the optimal dosage schedule of EA to best enhance motor skill acquisition and retention. This proposal explores computational models of how various forms of EA affect motor learning and evaluates how the optimal EA dosage could be customized to healthy individuals and to chronic stroke patients. Research indicates that training specificity (i.e., training on the tasks you actually want to improve) is important to recovery of activities of daily living (ADL). Here we also test whether customized visual feedback based on optimal EA dosage can recover functional skills in 3D for stroke survivors. This work utilizes a data-driven modeling method in order to control and customize learning of novel motor skills using robotic technologies. This proposal will contribute to neuroscience knowledge by uncovering relationships between motor learning and error-feedback modulation. This proposal will improve engineering methods to optimize motor skill acquisition for the users operating intelligent-machines such as robotic tools, robot guided neuro-rehabilitation and prosthetics/assistive technologies.  "
"9259482","This proposal focuses on examining the mechanism of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis with documented anti-seizure effects in several pre-clinical studies(1, 2) and a recent double-blinded, multicenter phase III clinical trial in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy(3, 4). Despite centuries of clinical usage, the mechanism of action of CBD remains ambiguous. Further exploring the pharmacology of CBD may provide benefit to the 1/3 of epilepsy patients with seizures resistant to current treatments (10).  In one leading hypothesis, CBD acts as a competitive antagonist at the G-protein coupled receptor, GPR55, inhibiting binding of a membrane phospholipid, lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). CBD blocks LPI- mediated increases in presynaptic Ca2+ and vesicular release, thus reducing excitability at axon terminals (12). However, the function of LPI-GPR55 signaling at inhibitory synapses, as well as potential postsynaptic effects, remains to be explored.  Using a multidisciplinary approach with ex vivo whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, and in vitro immunocytochemistry and molecular biology, I discovered that LPI had unique effects at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, both at the pre- and postsynapse. At 5-10 minutes post application, LPI increased the frequency of vesicular release in CA1 hippocampus, consistent with previous reports of presynaptic locus of GPR55 action(12). However, contrary to prior studies, I identified prominent GPR55 staining in the cell bodies of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and a postsynaptic LPI effect of increased GluA1 AMPAR expression at 50-60 minutes post application. I also determined that LPI reduced inhibitory postsynaptic strength, in part by reducing GABAAR ?2 subunit expression. Taken together, these results suggest that LPI increases the excitatory / inhibitory ratio in hippocampal neuronal networks by a dual mechanism: enhancing excitatory transmission and attenuating inhibition. This predicts that CBD, by opposing LPI action, may exert its beneficial anti-seizure effects on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses through actions at GPR55. I plan to explore these possibilities by repeating these experiments with CBD pre-treatment and GPR55-/- mice as controls.  To supplement these experiments at the circuit level, I plan to investigate how LPI and CBD regulate evoked transmission and short-term plasticity in CA3-CA1 hippocampal circuits. At the in vivo level, I will use both acute and chronic seizure models to determine seizure susceptibility in GPR55-/- mice. Based on surprising preliminary results, I discovered that seizure activity upregulates GPR55 membrane expression, producing a biomarker for prolonged seizures and potentiating the effects of LPI. In all, as part of this fellowship, I propose to combine my clinical training and scientific experience to elucidate the mechanisms of this intriguing therapeutic target for epilepsy, and help stratify subpopulations for targeted treatment."
"9385122","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway plays an essential role in several critical steps of embryonic development and tumor progression. It also controls critical cellular functions such as apoptosis, motility and differentiation. Kinases and phosphatases of this pathway have been extensively studied and targeted therapeutically. However, the mechanisms that determine the signal specificity and orchestrate the diverse biological outcomes of ERK1/2 signaling are still poorly understood. Scaffold proteins are key players in the ERK1/2 signaling pathway that are thought to integrate incoming signals and deliver signaling specificity, and yet their role in signal propagation and the mechanisms of their action are still unknown. The long-term goal of our research is to reveal how scaffold proteins are involved in the biological processes regulated by the ERK1/2 cascade. In this way, new therapeutic strategies can be developed to more specifically target this cascade without affecting other essential biological functions.  The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms underlying the ability of the key scaffold protein, Shoc2, to regulate ERK1/2-mediated cell motility. Shoc2 is essential for embryonic development and a critical regulator of ERK1/2 activity. We have shown that depletion of Shoc2 in zebrafish results in defects in hematopoiesis. We also found that Shoc2 integrates endocytic and ubiquitin machineries to regulate ERK1/2 signaling. Based on this preliminary data, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that Shoc2 creates a signaling hub that regulates ERK's developmental signals in a spatio-temporal manner.  Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the spatio-temporal organization and dynamics of Shoc2 scaffold complexes. Aim 2 will reveal the molecular mechanism by which the E3 ligase HUWE1 controls Shoc2 function and assembly of the Shoc2 scaffold complexes. Aim 3 will determine the signaling events mediated through the Shoc2 scaffold complexes that control embryonic development. The proposed Aims therefore are expected to provide a detailed understanding of how Shoc2 is involved in determining the specificity of ERK1/2 signaling outcomes. These studies will employ state-of-the-art innovative microscopy, genetic, molecular, and cellular techniques and will provide critical insights into our understanding of the spatial-temporal control of signaling by scaffold proteins. This research has significance for contributing to the advancement of novel therapeutic strategies and biomarker innovations for developmental disorders and cancer progression. Thus, the proposed studies are relevant to the NIH's mission to increase understanding of biological processes and to lay the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention."
"9197257","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a growing epidemic that afflicts aging men and women across the globe. Osteoporosis-related fractures cause dramatic morbidity and mortality. Current therapies fall vastly short of rehabilitating osteoporotic skeleton to halt fractures. Intermittent daily parathyroid hormone (PTH) injections are the only FDA-approved therapy that is anabolic to bone and improve bone quality. Its dosing is, however, limited to a low level and a short duration due to potential adverse effects -- hypercalcemia and induction of osteosarcoma. Our proposal aims to delineate mechanisms underlying the osteoanabolic actions and the hypercalcemic effects of PTH in order to devise new strategies to enhance PTH therapy. Because raising [Ca2+] and allosteric CaSR agonists (i.e., a calcimimetic) activate the extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptors (CaSRs) in osteoblasts (OBs) to promote their survival and differentiation and in osteoclasts (OCLs) to inhibit their survival and bone- resorbing functions, we propose to use a calcimimetic (i.e., NPS-R568) to activate CaSRs in those cells to promote osteoanabolism of PTH and prevent hypercalcemia. We hypothesize that the activation of CaSRs in the OB and OCL lineages are essential steps in producing osteoanabolic responses to intermittent PTH and that combined treatment with a calcimimetic will prevent hypercalcemia and enhance the osteoanabolic effects of intermittent PTH by simultaneously potentiating CaSR activities in OBs, and OCLs. Aim 1 will determine (i) whether activating CaSRs in OBs and OCLs by co-administration of NPS-R568, abrogates the hypercalcemic effects of PTH and promote osteoanabolism by increasing bone-forming capacities and/or prolonging the anabolic window in various mouse models of bone loss; and (ii) whether drug intermissions allow for the repopulation of osteoprogenitors and enhance osteoanabolic effects of the combined treatment. Aim 2 will determine whether the activation of CaSR in OBs is required for the osteoanabolism of the combined PTH/NPS-R568 treatment in vivo; and delineate the underlying mechanisms by examining the effects of the compounds on the differentiation and functions of OBs in vitro. Aim 3 will determine whether the activation of CaSR in OCLs is required to prevent the development of hypercalcemia and enhance osteoanabolic effects of the combined PTH/NPS-R568 treatment in vivo; and delineate the underlying mechanisms by examining the effects of the compounds on the differentiation and functions of OCLs in vitro. Our preliminary studies showed that co-injections of intermittent PTH with NPS-R568: (i) prevented hypercalcemia, (ii) enhanced anabolic effects on trabecular bone by 2-3 fold, (iii) promoted osteoanabolism and increased bone strength at cortical sites, (iv) extended the anabolic window, and (v) permitted uses of higher doses of PTH; and that knockout of CaSR gene in OBs completely ablated the anabolic effects of PTH. The successful completion of this proposal will establish a new paradigm for the anabolic actions of intermittent PTH and establish a robust regimen to restore osteoporotic skeleton."
"9400828","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Candidate, a veterinarian with Master's and PhD degrees in immunology, has a long-standing interest and expertise in generating and phenotyping transgenic mouse models for inflammatory diseases. A major stumbling block in moving potential therapeutic approaches for rare diseases from the laboratory bench to human clinical trials involves obtaining pre-clinical data in mouse models of human disease. There is currently no mouse phenotyping and drug screening facility in the USA that is capable of screening large numbers of drugs or other experimental therapeutics particularly for rare inflammatory muscle diseases. The Candidate has established a state-of-the-art murine phenotyping and drug testing facility for neuromuscular disease mouse models at the Children's National Medical Center and is currently leading international efforts to develop standard operating procedures to define preclinical endpoints for evaluating therapeutic interventions in murine models of neuromuscular disorders. This award will help establish 1) a structured training and mentoring program for junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, technicians, and trainees from around the country that is focused on the molecular and functional pathobiology of muscle diseases in mouse models; and 2) help the Candidate develop and extend his research and training related to evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of modern drugs in these models of rare human diseases. Glucocorticoids (GCs) have been successfully used in the treatment of many acute and chronic inflammatory diseases for several decades. The main reason that these drugs are very effective in multiple disease conditions is due to their ability to simultaneously block the inflammatory cascade at multiple stages. The major limitation of steroid prescription is that these desired anti-inflammatory effects are generally accompanied by drastic side effects such as diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer, Cushing's syndrome, osteoporosis, skin atrophy, psychosis, glaucoma, and many others upon chronic use. Therefore there is an urgent need for the development of compounds with the anti- inflammatory potency of standard GCs but with reduced side effects. It has been proposed that beneficial effects are due to GC-glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mediated transrepressive (NF-kB inhibition) activities in cytoplasm and side effects (metabolic and hormonal) are thought to be predominantly mediated by transactivation via GC response elements in the nucleus. Thus, ligands that preferentially induce the transrepression and not transactivation function of the GR are ideal for treating chronic inflammatory conditions. Our group, in collaboration with Validus Biopharma (VBP), has identified and tested several GC analogues that efficiently block inflammation by inhibiting NF-kB activity in skeletal muscle cells. In this proposal we hypothesize that these novel non-hormonal steroids significantly reduce inflammation and improve muscle function, arthritis and asthma phenotypes without causing significant adverse effects. Aim.1. Test efficacy and toxicity VBP-3 and VBP15 in mouse model of LGMD2B using well-characterized functional, behavioral, immunological, imaging, and histological assays. Aim.2. Assess the efficacy and toxicity of VBP-3 and VBP15 in this arthritis mouse model using clinical, histological and imaging assays. Aim 3. Evaluate efficacy of VBP3 and VBP15 systematically using immunological and histological endpoints. Study Design: All aims use murine models and normal mouse strains. Relevance: These experiments could provide the basis for future human clinical trials with non-hormonal steroids, not only for dystrophies but also for arthritis, asthma and several human immune and inflammatory diseases. This program will help the Candidate to train and develop scientists interested in drug development in academic settings. These efforts in the long term will help us to develop specific drugs for inflammatory diseases."
"9292990","Ankle osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating and mobility limiting condition. It can commonly stem from the result of a traumatic injury ? such trauma has a high prevalence in military service. If cartilage is not severely damaged in that trauma, the stability and alignment of the joint may be. Over time, an unstable or misaligned ankle joint can experience abnormal rates of cartilage wear and tear due to aberrant kinematics. While OA may take decades to develop, the resulting arthritic state from this trauma will ultimately require ankle replacement or fusion, consequences with a tremendous financial burden and quality of life impact.  With regards to alignment, particularly in the coronal plane, current clinical diagnosis relies on static X- ray of the ankle joint. Static images may not indicate dynamic misalignment during gait. Further, the effect of wedged insoles, a potential conservative treatment, on the restoration of ankle function is undocumented.  This proposal aims to use biplane fluoroscopy, an X-ray based dynamic imaging approach, to measure ankle kinematics in OA subjects (with varus, neutral and valgus ankle alignment) and controls. With this method, tibio-talar kinematics during gait can be measured. Furthermore, subjects classified as neutral from their static radiograph, but that exhibit ankle varus or valgus alignment during gait, will be identified. Improving the accuracy of a diagnostic outcome provides a patient group with additional avenues for treatment. We will investigate correlations between our 3D kinematics and clinical 2D imaging ? to the benefit of clinical diagnostics. We will also be able to measure the effect of wedged insoles on the restoration of ankle function. With this in mind, the following aims and methodology are proposed.  Specific Aim 1: To investigate ankle kinematics in controls and subjects with OA. In support of Specific Aim 1, 90 ankle OA subjects will be recruited (30 each of varus, neutral or valgus aligned ankles). We will also recruit 20 control subjects. Subjects will receive CT scans of their feet to quantify bone geometry (a step necessary for biplane fluoroscopy). Subjects will then be imaged in the biplane system during gait trials and while wearing neutral study shoes. This will yield tibio-talar kinematics during gait for these populations. Specific Aim 2: To identify dynamically misaligned ankles in OA subjects who are currently classified as neutrally aligned using static analysis. We will compare the static X-ray and the gait kinematics of OA subjects, particularly those with clinically determined neutral alignment. We will determine what proportion of neutral OA subjects actually exhibit misalignment during gait and are thus improperly categorized. We will also re-create 2D clinical X-ray views from our 3D data in an attempt to translate our improvement (with 3D fluoroscopy) to more accurately classify alignment to clinical 2D diagnostics. Specific Aim 3: To evaluate the potential of lateral or medial wedging to restore alignment in misaligned ankle OA subjects. OA subjects will be imaged wearing shoes with wedged insoles which correspond to their type of misalignment. Neutral OA subjects, who demonstrate misalignment during gait, will be recalled for a wedged insole session. This yields conservative treatment kinematics.  This study will generate baseline data describing the kinematics of control and ankle OA subjects. This data is not currently available in the literature, and represents a novel contribution to the field. Second, this proposal determines how accurate current 2D X-ray methods are at detecting dynamic misalignment. This information can inform clinicians about the accuracy of their diagnostic tools, and may lead to improvements. Third, this proposal will generate data to evaluate the utility of wedged insoles for the conservative management of ankle misalignment. In Summary, this study has immediate impact potential on the diagnosis and treatment of ankle OA. Last, there are numerous additional avenues of classification, diagnostic, and preventative research for the benefit of the veterans which will stem from this Career Development Award."
"9197641","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cocaine has been shown to have profound positive and negative actions that adhere closely to the classic opponent process theory of motivated behavior. That theory postulates that dual and opposing systems work in tandem to maintain emotional homeostasis. Indeed, cocaine administration in both humans and animals has been shown to produce an initial euphoric/rewarding action followed in time by an aversive crash that is characterized by states of anhedonia and anxiety. The underlying hypothesis guiding the proposed research is that a thorough understanding of the factors that underlie the initiation, maintenance and reinstatement of cocaine abuse must include an understanding of how these dual and opposing properties of the drug interact to motivate drug-seeking behavior. In this context, three specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1 involves studies intended to assess the relative roles of positive and negative drug-cue associations, and the drug's own direct positive and negative actions, in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior in both addicted and non-addicted animals following varying periods of drug abstinence. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that individual differences in the positive and negative responses to cocaine and cocaine-paired cues predict an animal's risk for drug self-administration. Specific Aim 3 describes research intended to extend previous results showing that functional lesions of structures within the extended amygdala can prevent the expression of cocaine's negative/anxiogenic properties. Studies will examine the roles of NE, 5-HT and CRF systems within these structures to identify the substrates responsible for cocaine's negative properties, and immunocytochemical studies are planned to link cocaine's dual behavioral effects to patterns of neuronal activation in select brain regions associated with reward and aversion. Each of these aims logically builds upon and extends previous findings from the Principal Investigator's laboratory and each is based upon the view that a) cocaine- seeking behavior (in both addicted and non-addicted animals) ultimately depends upon the balance between the inherent positive and negative properties of the drug, or stimuli associated with the drug, b) that this balance determines the vulnerability for the acquisition and relapse of cocaine-seeking behavior, and c) that the dual actions of cocaine are mediated by separate and identifiable neuronal systems. Two behavioral methods will be employed: a runway model of cocaine self-administration that is uniquely sensitive to cocaine's mixed positive and negative actions in the same animal on the same trial (animal's exhibit approach-avoidance conflict about entering a goal-box associated with cocaine administration) and a modified conditioned place test that permits for the dissociation of the positive and negative properties of the drug (animals come to prefer distinct locations paired with the immediate effects of cocaine while avoiding places associated with the effects present 15-min post IV injection). When used in tandem, these two tests provide a unique and powerful behavioral toolkit for dissociating whether an experimental manipulation alters the positive and/or the negative properties of IV cocaine. The proposed research will therefore employ behavioral, pharmacological and immunocytochemical methodologies to elucidate the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the dual opponent properties of cocaine that ultimately interact to motivate rats to seek cocaine and to reinstate cocaine-seeking after a period of drug abstinence."
"9296244","Abstract The 2014-15 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa highlighted the urgent need for the development of antivirals to treat or prevent filovirus infections. The outbreak was associated with nearly 30,000 suspected or confirmed cases and more than 11,000 documented deaths. While pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease (EVD) is complex and incompletely understood, high levels of virus are found in the blood throughout the course of the disease, indicating that viral load plays an important role in pathogenesis. This suggests that antivirals targeting viral proteins could have a significant therapeutic effect, even at late stages. While some attempts have been made at screening for small molecule EBOV inhibitors, these efforts have been hampered by the lack of detailed biochemical and molecular knowledge required for design of target-specific HTS assays. Another obstacle is the low throughput of BSL-4 viral assays that otherwise could be used to screen large libraries for compounds with antiviral activity. Particularly lacking are direct-acting antivirals that inhibit viral protein function, making this an understudied area of investigation considering the severity of the disease and the potential for devastating outbreaks. In this application it is proposed to address four important potential viral targets, and test the hypothesis that they can be targeted with small molecule inhibitors. In Aim 1, inhibitors of VP24, VP35, VP40 and NP will be identified using a yeast-based platform that identifies chemical suppressors of viral protein activity. These compounds will also be tested for antiviral activity using two independent assays. In Aim 2, antiviral compounds will be tested for direct binding to their target using TSA and ITC, in order to identify the most attractive, direct-acting inhibitors for future medicinal chemistry and structure based development."
"9337068","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Human male reproductive development is a highly organized and regulated process that is susceptible to environmental toxicants such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals and medical treatments. Environmental influences and insults by reproductive toxicant exposure during early development or post-puberty can lead to impaired spermatogenesis or, at worst, infertility. Understanding how certain chemicals disrupt spermatogenesis during various Windows of Susceptibility (WOS) is critical for determining how environmental and industrial toxicants contribute to impaired fertility. Furthermore, these toxicants can potentially induce epigenetic alterations that contribute to disease phenotypes in offspring and thus have transgenerational consequences such as increased risk of producing offspring with neurological disorders, cardiac malformations, limb defects, and other developmental deficiencies that lead to debilitating disorders. To date, the most widely used models for exploring the effects of environmental factors on reproductive toxicity and multigenerational defects are rodent models. While informative, these models poorly recapitulate human spermatogenesis as rodent spermatogenesis proceeds in a distinctly different fashion compared to human spermatogenesis. Thus, developing human in vitro models for reproductive toxicity testing is paramount for advancing the field and for understanding WOS as well as the cellular and molecular mechanisms that may underlie these disruptions in human spermatogenesis. This proposal seeks to utilize my recently published, novel in vitro model of human spermatogenesis to examine the effects and identify sub-cellular mechanisms of known and unknown/predicted reproductive toxicants on various windows of susceptibility during spermatogenesis."
"9229890","The problem. The last decade has seen unprecedented progress in understanding the immune processes that drive atherosclerotic lesion initiation, maturation and complication. In particular, macrophages emerged as key cells that promote disease progression. If the number of inflammatory macrophages in plaque increases, atherosclerosis advances towards life-threatening complications. Plaque macrophages derive from circulating monocytes, which in turn arise from myeloid progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells. When released into circulation, monocytes follow chemokine gradients towards atherosclerotic plaque, where endothelial adhesion molecules aid their extravasation into the vessel wall. Once in plaque, inflammatory macrophages destabilize matrix via proteases and may die locally. Alternatively, if the local environment permits, macrophages may obtain less inflammatory phenotypes promoting cholesterol removal and tissue repair. These insights have been difficult to translate into clinically useful therapeutics, partly because broad anti-inflammatory therapy may compromise beneficial functions of immune cells and host defense. The goal. In this application, we aim to create a new class of macrophage-targeted atherosclerosis therapeutics using in vivo RNA interference (RNAi). We will design small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting discrete proteins which are key decision nodes for macrophages' fate. We propose to interfere with the life cycle of macrophages with the goal to support inflammation resolution in atherosclerotic plaque. We will test the central hypothesis that RNAi can be harnessed to design precision therapeutics for inflammatory atherosclerosis. We will test this hypothesis by targeting proteins that are essential for macrophage birth (silencing transcription factors MTG16 and PU.1 that influence activity of hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial targets in the hematopoietic niche), migration (silencing chemokine receptors in monocytes and adhesion molecules in endothelial cells), maturation (silencing the M-CSF receptor essential for differentiation of monocytes into macrophages) and polarization (silencing the essential transcription factor IRF5 that gives rise to M1 macrophages with inflammatory functions). Innovation. We will use new nanomaterials for delivery to myeloid, progenitor and endothelial cells, newly and yet-to-be identified siRNA sequences, and target innovative biological targets important in the macrophage life cycle. Impact. We will develop new therapeutics to dampen inflammatory macrophage activity in the arterial wall. We will identify a winning therapeutic strategy in mice with post-MI acceleration of atherosclerosis, a scenario that simulates the vulnerable patient in need of aggressive therapeutic intervention. Our ultimate goal is to bring these materials into the clinic, improving the currently insufficient standard of care by enabling better secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke."

"9241924","Vitamin D deficiency (VitD-) is commonly encountered in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (and other autoimmune diseases). Some studies show VitD levels impact expression of RA, but the mechanism(s) have not been well explored and have received scant attention in rodent models of RA. Interestingly, like VitD levels, in studies looking at only plasma gelsolin (pGSN), it was observed that pGSN levels also inversely correlate with C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with RA. Gelsolin (GSN) has been shown to be protective in the TNF? transgenic (tg) mouse model of RA. It is known that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (acting through G protein- coupled receptors on T cells, B cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells) affect immune and inflammatory responses and has been found to be elevated in RA synovial fluid but not osteoarthritis synovial fluid. Furthermore, pGSN binds to S1P, thereby regulating its ability to engage S1P receptors. We found humans, in addition to converting vitamin D3 (VitD3) to 25(OH)D3, also generate a noncalcemic analog, 20(OH)D3, with a serum concentration 1/20th of that of 25(OH)D3. In the type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), we found surprisingly that 20(OH)D3 treatment elevates pGSN levels and increases S1P levels in splenocyte cultures from these 20(OH)D3-treated mice. We discovered that supplementing VitD in humans elevates pGSN in sera and that 25(OH)D levels in normals and in RA and OA correlate fairly well with pGSN. Also, we found both 20(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 increased sphingosine kinase (Sphk)2 mRNA in mouse splenocytes and increased GSN mRNA in cultured mouse myoblasts and pGSN production by explant cultures of mouse skeletal muscle. Knocking down GSN or Sphk2 worsens arthritis in mouse models of RA. Both GSN and Sphk2 regulate S1P levels in plasma or lymphoid tissue, which is important in immune function, including lymphocyte trafficking, Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine expression, and control of FoxP3 regulatory T cells (Tregs). No studies have evaluated levels of 25(OH)D, S1P, and pGSN in the same RA population. We find 25(OH)D serum levels correlate fairly well with pGSN levels in RA patients, although concordance is not 100%. We further hypothesize that RA patients who have both high 25(OH)D and pGSN will have less RA disease activity score, while those with low pGSN and low 25(OH)D will have higher RA disease activity scores. Our overarching hypothesis is that there are interactions amongst VitD, GSN, and CD4+ T cell Sphk2, CD4+ T cell S1P receptor subtypes, and/or S1P that may be important in the modulation of autoimmunity and inflammatory arthritis. Whether administering VitD to humans with VitD deficiency/insufficiency will raise pGSN levels and modulate S1P, is unknown, and is the topic of Specific Aim 3. The three highly translational Specific Aims of this proposal are the following: Specific Aim 1A: Assess the association of serum levels of 25(OH)D, pGSN, and S1P separately, in patients with RA with measures of RA disease activity. Specific Aim 1B: Assess whether a clinical prediction model or models containing serum 25(OH)D, pGSN, and/or S1P levels provide more reliable prediction of the selected markers or measurements of RA disease activity than any single predictor alone. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that VitD replacement therapy in humans with OA or RA with VitD- will elevate levels of pGSN, reduce levels of S1P in plasma, and change lymphocyte expression of Sphk2. Specific Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that high dose VitD replacement therapy in patients with OA or RA and VitD- will reduce Th1, Th9, and Th17 effector T cells, increase Th2 and CD4+Tregs in peripheral blood, and whether there is interaction with existing plasma levels of pGSN and S1P. We also found that serum 25(OH)D levels correlate with pGSN in patients with RA and (in a small pilot study) that VitD supplementation in humans [healthy volunteers (HV) and patients with RA] raised 25(OH)D levels from insufficiency to normal range and was also associated with increases in pGSN. This suggests that (in both mice and humans) pGSN is partially regulated by VitD."
"9242973","PROJECT SUMMARY Research: There is a growing body of literature showing an association between childhood obesity and asthma morbidity. For reasons not fully understood, overweight/obese children with asthma are at an increased risk for worse asthma, particularly those with lower socioeconomic status and living in inner-city areas. This proposal details a five-year plan to provide the candidate, Perdita Permaul, MD, with the training and expertise to evaluate the role body mass index plays in the relationship between allergic inflammation and asthma morbidity in an established cohort of inner-city children with asthma enrolled in the School Inner-City Asthma Study (PI: Phipatanakul). This important and unique study involves the collection of extensive allergic phenotypic and outcomes data and potential biomarkers linking these two chronic diseases. Moreover, she has included an innovative and novel translational piece to examine leptin receptor expression on human basophils across BMI percentiles and the role that leptin plays in basophil activation, uniting basophil biology with phenotypic and functional data. Candidate: Dr. Permaul's long-term goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in pediatric asthma, and more specifically, in studying the association between childhood obesity and asthma morbidity. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, clinical and translational research, advanced biostatistics, as well as practical skills in cohort building, exposure assessment, laboratory techniques and biomarker analysis. This will be accomplished with formal classes, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork, attendance at institutional/national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will successfully position her for her first R01 application and an independent career as a physician-scientist. Environment: Dr. Permaul will perform her research training and career development activities at world- renowned major academic institutions. She will work under the mentorship of Dr. Phipatanakul, an expert in environmental epidemiology and asthma, in addition to an extraordinary team of researchers, including Drs. Wayne Shreffler, Carlos Camargo, and Brent Coull, who have committed their time, resources, and expertise to facilitate Dr. Permaul's career development and the successful completion of the proposed project. During this award period, Dr. Permaul will complete the Program in Clinical and Translational Science through the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center and formal coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health. The academic environment created by the mentor, the institution, Harvard University and its affiliates provides a fertile ground for learning and collaborating specific to her research."
"9243842","Three highly related genes, Gata4, Gata5, and Gata6 (referred to here as Gata456) regulate essentially every aspect of cardiac biology, from generation of precardiac mesoderm, specification and differentiation of endocardial, epicardial, and myocardial progenitors, heart tube formation, growth and morphogenesis, septation and valve formation, cardioprotection and hypertrophy, and regeneration. How the three genes regulate the spatial, temporal, and tissue-specific genetic and epigenetic networks that underlie all of these disparate programs is poorly understood. Furthermore, mutations in each of the genes have individually been associated with human cardiomyopathies, including atrial and ventricular septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, bicuspid aortic valve syndrome, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Other transcription factor genes, and some terminal differentiation markers are known to be regulated by Gata456, but a major gap in understanding is the identify of the key target genes that control intermediary functions such as lineage specification, growth, morphogenesis, and cardio-protection. We propose a new program as a ?Pipeline of Discovery? to identify these downstream genes and probe their function in cardiogenesis and cardiac biology. The overall goal is to define the function of each Gata456 gene throughout development and adult life in various cardiac tissues including endocardium, myocardium, and epicardium. We seek to break the code for how the relative timing and location of expression for each gene impacts cell fate and survival, and organ morphogenesis and function. Complementary model systems exploit specific advantages and resolve species-specific distinctions: the zebrafish for understanding cardiogenesis including morphogenesis, and human pluripotent stem cells for understanding human cell identity and disease modeling. We have compiled a ?toolbox? of zebrafish and hESC lines and an expert team of investigators to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of gain-and loss-of-function phenotypes, with a strong track record for such analyses and discovery of novel downstream targets. A breakthrough is needed to understand how Gata456 controls all the various aspects of cardiogenesis. We are finally in a position to define this code, by a systematic manipulation of each factor in different developmental and tissue contexts, leading to discovery of specific key downstream target genes that carry out these diverse functions. This project will not directly develop therapeutics for cardiac disease, but it will likely enhance development of cellular therapies. Chiefly, it will break ground beyond current descriptions of regulatory networks in two areas: 1) Defining the impact for loss or gain of individual Gata456 alleles at specific developmental stages and in specific tissues to precisely define functions in developing animals (zebrafish) and human cells (derived from human pluripotent cells). 2) Identifying the key downstream Gata456 target genes that are responsible for stage and tissue-specific functions, recognizing these as ?lead hit? therapeutic targets for treating cardiac disease. !"
"9402900","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year millions of Americans are concussed from sport-related incidents, accidents or military service. While extensive research has been done to identify biomarkers for diagnosing concussion, a specific biomarker for concussion recovery has yet to be identified. Concussion is a brain injury with physiological effects on cerebral blood flo (CBF) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. These effects may be why exercise exacerbates concussion symptoms. Thus, exercise intolerance is a physiological sign of concussion. Ergo, normal exercise tolerance indicates physiological recovery. Our long-term goal is to better understand the systemic physiological disturbance of concussion to develop reliable methods for the differential diagnosis of concussion and of post-concussion syndrome, to establish objective markers of recovery, and to develop novel treatments to speed recovery. The overall objective of this application is to identify the physiological mechanisms of exercise intolerance in concussion. The rationale for the proposed study is that our work could show that systematic determination of return of exercise tolerance is a specific biological marker of recovery from concussion. This would help patients and clinicians know with confidence when it is safe to return to activity. We developed the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test to systematically evaluate exercise tolerance in concussed athletes. We have found abnormally elevated CBF during exercise after concussion in association with altered sensitivity to the effects of CO2 that blunts ventilation. We have also detected that cardiac output (CO) is low after concussion. A fundamental question is whether exercise tolerance after concussion is limited centrally (brain) or peripherally (cardiovascular/muscle). We will examine this by pursuing the following two specific aims: (1) Identify the source (central or peripheral) of exercise intolerance in concussion and (2) Identify the mechanism of central exercise intolerance in concussion. Concussed male and female participants will have measures of CO2 sensitivity, ventilation, CBF (by arterial spin labelling in the MRI), blood lactate, and CO at res and during simulated exercise (head down tilt, HDT) in the MRI machine and during the Buffalo treadmill exercise test soon after concussion and upon recovery. We will also measure DTI to evaluate for injury to the brainstem and corpus callosum. Values will be compared to those in healthy controls. The work is expected to identify that the physiological mechanism of exercise intolerance in concussion is central from abnormal control of CBF. The work is expected to establish that return of normal physiology (and of normal exercise tolerance) is a functional biomarker of recovery from concussion. The work is significant because a physiological biomarker will impact how patients are judged clinically to be recovered from concussion, i.e., physiologically ready to return to sport, work and military duty. Our work is innovative because we are using exercise intolerance as a clinical measure of abnormal physiological control of CBF as a result of concussion."
"9385776","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sleep serves essential biological functions, and is conserved from flies to humans. Sleep disturbance is a common health problem that impinges on quality of life, workplace productivity, and public safety. Sleep usually occurs at specific tims of day and lasts for certain amounts of time. These two features of sleep are controlled by distinct molecular mechanisms. Whereas the molecular and anatomical basis of the circadian clock, which controls when we sleep, has been investigated extensively, the molecules and neural circuits underlying sleep homeostasis that regulates sleep duration are not well understood. Identification of novel genes and circuits that control sleep duration would facilitate elucidation of this mysterious biological process. The Drosophila model for sleep is well suited for discovery of new sleep-modulating genes through unbiased genetic screens. Using a forward-genetic screen for short-sleeping mutants, we isolated a novel sleep gene, taranis (tara). Mutations in tara result in a marked (up to 80%) reduction of sleep duration. [[Importantly tara mutants exhibit decreased levels of REDEYE (RYE), whose expression is regulated by homeostatic sleep drive. Thus isolation of TARA provides an exciting opportunity to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis, a critical process that is poorly understood. Previous findings suggest that TARA and its mammalian homologs are involved in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression, and contain a Cyclin A (CycA)-binding homology domain. Notably, CycA, another cell cycle protein, was recently shown to be a sleep-promoting factor, but the molecular function of CycA in sleep is not well understood. Our preliminary studies suggest that TARA promotes sleep by two complementary pathways: 1) by upregulating protein expression of CycA and inhibiting Cdk1 (a Cyclin-dependent kinase that binds CycA and negative regulator of sleep), and 2) by upregulating transcription of dawdle (daw), an Activin-like signaling molecule and positive regulator of sleep. Further, our data identify ~14 CycA expressing cells in the pars lateralis (PL), which is analogous to the mammalian hypothalamus, as a novel sleep center. Building on these preliminary data, we propose to (Aim 1) determine how TARA interacts with other cell cycle proteins to regulate sleep, (Aim 2) how TARA interacts with daw to regulate sleep, and whether DAW acts as a sleep-inducing homeostatic signal, and (Aim 3) determine where and when TARA is required for sleep, and how the PL neurons connect to other sleep centers. The proposed experiments will yield significant mechanistic insights into sleep homeostasis.]]"
"9023329","Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation."
"9199086","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting in motor nerve degeneration and death. Both familial (FALS) and sporadic (SALS) forms exist; the latter greatly predominate. Its cause is unknown. Overstimulation of glutamatergic function - excitotoxicity - with increased Ca2+ and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays an important, if not integral role, though other mechanisms likely contribute to ALS pathogenesis. Interaction of motor neurons (MNs) and astrocytes (ASTs) appear to contribute to disease development. Environmental contribution to ALS has been postulated often, but to date not systematically tested. We propose to examine the interaction of the environmental toxicant methylmercury (MeHg) with two genetic mutations found in humans with ALS. Chronic postnatal MeHg exposure of mice with a mutation in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1G93A, G93A) hastens the onset of ALS phenotype compared to untreated G93A mice or wt mice exposed to identical MeHg concentrations. We will now test the hypothesis that chronic, low dose, MeHg exposure beginning postnatally enhances development and progression of ALS phenotype in the G93A and G85R SOD1 mutants by increasing [Ca2+]i, generating ROS and inducing mitochondrial toxicity secondary to enhanced release of glutamate (Glu) or actions on AST Glu transporters (EAAT1-2). The two SOD1 mutant strains differ in their time course of development of ALS phenotype and in their primary toxic focus. The G93A mice develop phenotype in ~4 mos and disease is MN-directed. G85R mice develop ALS phenotype over 7-9 months and disease is AST-based. This design will allow us to compare the roles of ASTs and MNs to MeHg induced responses. Specific Aim 1: Examines the development of ALS phenotype and relative role of MNs and ASTs during chronic adult MeHg exposure. Specific Aim 2: Examines oxidative stress as a contributor to MeHg-induced enhancement of ALS phenotype. Specific Aim 3: Examines the cell autonomy of MN function in response to MeHg. Interactions between ASTs and MNs will be examined in chimeric cultures of wt and SOD-1 cells to assess their potential roles in the development of excitotoxicity in MeHg-induced enhancement of ALS phenotype. Early onset effects preceding development of ALS phenotype will be examined using spinal cord slices and co-cultures of MNs and ASTs, from the G93A and G85R strains. Glu-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and elevation of [Ca2+] i and levels of ROS will test for MeHg-induced excitotoxicity. Steady- state mRNA expression levels for EAAT1-2 and proteins involved in [Ca2+] i regulation will be measured during development of ALS phenotype to correlate with studies done in cells in culture. MNs in culture derived from SOD1 mice or wt will allow examination of early effects of MeHg on Glu function, [Ca2+] i oxidative stress or mitochondrial damage in isolation. Results of the proposed study should permit assessment of the role of MeHg-induced Glu- mediated excitotoxicity in facilitating development of MN dysfunction and provide verification for the postulate that environmental exposure to metals is a potential risk factor for susceptible populations in development of ALS."

Breast cancer is among the most feared diseases; current screening technologies raise multiple anxieties, fueled by a high rate of false positive results. Recently funded by PCORI (the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Initiative) the WISDOM trial is significant because it is the first effort to target breast cancer screening according to individual genomic risk, as opposed to population characteristics. Based on a partnership with Color Genomics, the WISDOM trial creates a personalized risk score based on mutations in nine highly penetrant cancer genes (BRCA1/2, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2), as well as 157 SNP variants that are associated with increased risk. The final score also incorporates standard risk assessments such as family history and breast density. The proposed ELSI investigation builds on preliminary work conducted by investigators at UCSF's ?Center of Excellence in ELSI Research? who received a pilot award to create a multi-disciplinary research team; the team formed (a breast surgeon, an anthropologist/bioethicist, and a molecular pathologist) developed this proposal. Our collaborative project ?embeds? a comprehensive ELSI study within the Athena Breast Health Network's WISDOM study. The ELSI project has 4 specific aims. We seek to: 1) examine how ELSI concerns are addressed throughout the implementation of the WISDOM trial via ethnography and key informant interviews with stakeholders. 2) elucidate the experience and meanings of risk-based screening for trial participants and their primary care providers (PCPs) via qualitative interviews with women stratified by risk level, focus groups with PCPs, and a survey of the full trial cohort. 3) explore the consequences of receiving a positive result for one of the nine high penetrance cancer susceptibility genes via observations of genetic counseling sessions, qualitative interviews at two time points, a survey, and focus groups with WISDOM study breast health specialists. 4) convene an Ethics Working Group that offers advice to WISDOM stakeholders in real time. Research across all the aims will be guided by an overarching theme: the intersection of precision genomics and known cancer health disparities. The outcomes of this project will inform the Precision Medicine Initiative, particularly efforts to improve cancer surveillance and early detection."
"9297898","A pharmacological screen for `inactivating antagonists' at an essential parasite GPCR. PROJECT SUMMARY: Over a third of the world's population is infected with parasitic worms. One of the most burdensome infections underpins the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis (Bilharzia) caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma, which afflicts ~200 million people worldwide. The mainstay pharmacotherapy for schistosomiasis, and several other parasitic helminth infections, is the drug praziquantel (PZQ). However, several features of PZQ are less than ideal. These include an inability of PZQ to kill all stages of the parasitic life cycle, clinical reliance on PZQ as a monotherapy in light of sub-optimal cure rates and field reports of PZQ resistance, as well as an inability to improve upon the PZQ pharmacophore or define mechanistically how this drug works. Consequently there is a need to develop next generation anthelmintics, ideally active against a broad spectrum of PZQ-sensitive helminth parasites. Our team has brought new insight to this problem from a serendipitous basic science discovery. Using regenerative screens in planarian flatworms, we have been able to dissect the pathways engaged by PZQ in vivo and our work has culminated in the identification of a parasite serotonergic G protein coupled receptor (GPCR, Sm.5HTR7) that is abundant, conserved and critical for helminth regeneration, mobility and viability. As GPCRs have proved imminently druggable targets (1/3rd of currently approved medications), the purpose of this proposal is to perform the first high throughput screen of any flatworm GPCR to discover parasite-selective ligands. To do this we have successfully optimized heterologous expression of Sm.5HTR7 and miniaturized a real time biosensor assay for monitoring Sm.5HTR7 activity. Pilot screening data has revealed that a subset of Sm.5HTR7 antagonists cause a persistent inaction of receptor signaling and parasite paralysis that persists for days after ligand removal. This curious piece of receptor phenomenology ? where a single drug dose effects a `pharmacological knockout' of receptor function ? is an ideal property for single dose clinical therapy in disadvantaged healthcare scenarios and enhances the appeal of a drug screen of this receptor. Our goal therefore is to characterize the pharmacological profile of Sm.5HTR7 through the following activities.  AIM 1: to perform an unbiased drug screen (20,500 compounds) to identify `inactivating antagonists' at this  receptor, and as a foil to this unbiased screen,  AIM 2: to explore the SAR properties of a single class of serotonergic ligands (dimethoxyisoquinoline  containing compounds) that are suggested by pilot screening data (~250 compounds) to exhibit  high affinity and selectivity for Sm.5HTR7 If successful, these activities will provide new leads for subsequent development of novel antiparasitic agents."
"9219801","Project Summary  Vascular homeostasis plays an important role in maintenance of normal vessel and organ function. Recent studies from our and other laboratories have established that continuous endothelial fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling input is critical for the maintenance of vascular integrity, permeability and cell fate. One particularly important consequence of the loss of FGF input is the development of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) that represents a fate transition from endothelial to a mesenchymal-like (smooth muscle cell (SMC), fibroblast) phenotype. Induced by chronic inflammation and other poorly understood stimuli, EndMT leads to formation of neointima that consists of a combination of different cell types, SMCs, fibroblasts and various inflammatory cells as well as remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM).  We have observed extensive EndMT in atherosclerotic coronary arteries in patients and in mouse atherosclerosis. These data suggest that EndMT may make a major contribution to disease progression in illnesses associated with chronic inflammation, such as atherosclerosis, and transplant arteriopathy. If correct, this hypothesis would open a possibility to fundamentally change the natural history of these illnesses with considerable clinical impact.  To this end, we aim to test whether suppression of EndMT will inhibit will inhibit initiation, progression and regression of atherosclerotic lesions, and to unravel the signaling and gene expression pathways that connect EndMT, ECM remodeling and inflammation that mediate these effects."
"9188091","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):     MS is a chronic autoimmune disease of the CNS in which pro-inflammatory T helper 17 (Thi7) cells are increased. Tri type regulatory T cells (Tregs) are important in peripheral tolerance, act via IL-10, and are deficient in MS. The basic immune mechanisms underlying abnormalities in Teffector/Tregulatory networks in humans and patients with MS are not well understood. We found an important role for IL-27 and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in these networks and the focus of this portion of the Program Project Grant is to investigate these pathways in humans and MS patients. In this revised application we have included the study of other disease controls and the study of cells within the CNS. We will address the following aims: Aim 1: Role of IL-27 in the regulation of Th17 and Tr1 cell differentiation in humans. IL-27 plays an important role in inducing IL-10 from murine and human T cells. In addition, we found that AhR activation induces regulatory Tri-like cells both in mice and humans. Furthermore, we found that IL-27 derived Tri cells produce IL-21 which acts as a autocrine growth factor for both Tri and Th17 cells in mice. We will investigate the role of AhR/cMAF signaling in the differentiation of human Tri cells triggered by IL-27 or IL- 27 plus TGFB. We will also study the production and role of IL-21/1L-2 in IL-27 or IL-27 plus TGFB induced Tri cells. Aim 2: Role of AhR in innate immunity. We have shown that AhR induces tolerogenic DCs in mice that promote regulatory T cell differentiation and that IFN-p increases expression of IL-27 in murine DCs which increases the expression of AhR in murine T cells. We will investigate the effect of AhR activation in DCs in humans and determine the synergistic effect of AhR activation in the presence of IFN-p on the function and activation of human mDCs. Aim 3: IL-27 and AhR in Th17/Tr1 cells and DCs in Multiple Sclerosis. Both AhR and IL-27 signaling are involved in induction of Tri cells and tolerogenic DCs. We will investigate AhR /IL-27 signaling and how it influences Th17 responses in MS, its role in the differentiation of naive T cells to Tri cells and in the induction of tolerogenic DCs in MS patients. We will also investigate how these pathways differ in the various stages of MS and how are they are affected by response to immunotherapy in MS patients."
"9206525","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   There is a shortage of biostatisticians. The goal of this proposal is to develop a training program to remedy this shortage by introducing undergraduate students to biostatistics. A diverse group of undergraduates committed to quantitative training will be recruited into the introductory program. This introduction will inclue instruction on the basics of biostatistics, epidemiology, genetics and statistical computing. In addition to instruction in this basic material, trainees will be exposed to how biostatisticians collaborate with other researchers as members of research teams working on exciting problems in pulmonary and cardiovascular health. Trainees will also have an opportunity to hear about interesting methodological problems that arise in the course of conducing collaborative research by participating in seminars with cutting edge methodologists. To help ensure that trainees are knowledgeable about the specific requirements for graduate work in biostatistics, multiple training sessions will provide career counseling and practical advice on how to prepare to be a competitive applicant for biostatistics graduate programs. To best achieve these goals, the training program will engage in self-evaluations guided by solicited feedback from trainees. These evaluations will include reflections on the extent to which the pool of trainees reflects current demographic realities. These objectives will be fulfilled by using a group of faculty known for their excellent teaching and mentoring. The faculty assembled for this proposal includes award winning teachers whose careers are focused on developing techniques for facilitating instruction in biostatistics and world class researchers who can share fascinating stories from decades of interdisciplinary research. A detailed curriculum has been developed that includes instructional lectures, seminars presenting research findings from a variety of studies and active learning computer laboratory sessions where trainees will gain instruction in the use of SAS and R. Many of the planned training activities utilize innovative approaches to ensure that trainees get hands on experience designing an experiment (through protocol development), collecting and analyzing data (using a virtual population), and presenting the findings. These training activities will be complemented by field trips where trainees will have the opportunity to see how biostatisticians contribute to research teams in a variety of settings and recreational activities that will provide a fun break from the rigors of the training schedule. The shortage of well-traine biostatisticians has been identified as a major impediment to the success of research aimed at improving public health. The factors contributing to this lack of expertise are varied but include  lack of visibility of the profession and a perception that biostatisticians are not potential scienific leaders. This training program is designed to not only increase the visibility of biostatistics, bu through careful selection of seminars and field trips, to demonstrate to trainees that biostatisticians can contribute at the highest level to the advancement of science."
"9241626","Ectopic Lipids in the Pancreatic Alpha Cells Link Insulin Resistance to Hyperglycemia  Just as insulin insufficiency can lead to elevated glucagon secretion, preliminary data suggest that impaired insulin action within the ?-cell can also promote hyperglucagonemia, hyperglycemia, aberrant gluconeogenesis, and excess glucose efflux from the liver. Pancreatic perfusion with anti-insulin serum causes marked hyperglucagonemia, and ablation of insulin receptor from ?-cells prompts fed hyperglucagonemia and glucose intolerance. Sphingolipids, such as ceramides and glucosylceramides, are an important class of bioactive lipids which may impair insulin signal transduction in the ?-cell. Most recently, it has been demonstrated that ceramide is sufficient to impair insulin-induced suppression of glucagon from ?-cells. The levels of these lipids change as a function of adipose tissue mass and functionality, and are partially driven by cellular availability of palmitoyl-CoA. Aberrant accumulation of sphingolipids has been implicated in a multitude of metabolic processes, including atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, lipotoxic heart failure, ?-cell apoptosis and ?-cell dysfunction. The adipose-derived secretory factor adiponectin promotes an increase in ceramide catabolism, which is dependent on adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1/R2). The associated ceramidase activity promotes ceramide degradation and correlates with the suppression of hepatic glucose efflux. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21, a reported glucagon suppressor), rapidly stimulates adiponectin secretion and improves glycemia by harnessing adiponectin?s ceramide-lowering potential. Preliminary results suggest that novel small molecule mimetics of adiponectin (currently in pharmaceutical development) may offer the same potential therapeutic benefits of adiponectin to improve glucose homeostasis by decreasing ceramide excess and glucagon secretion.  We hypothesize that: 1) Preventing ceramide excess within ?-cells enhances suppression of glucagon by 3 of its endogenous attenuating signals (insulin, leptin, and GABA-all repress glucagon via Akt/FoxO1) A portion of adiponectin?s glucose-lowering effects are mediated by inhibiting glucagon secretion which is directly triggered by adiponectin receptor-driven lowering of sphingolipids in ?-cells; 3) The glucagon-suppressive effects of FGF21 are mediated by ceramide-lowering within the ?-cell in an adiponectin-dependent manner; and 4) Limiting glucagon secretion or glucagon receptor activation improves insulin signal transduction by preventing glucagon-induced activation of PP2A. In essence, we believe that the insulin-desensitizing effects heavily studied in muscle, liver and adipose can also occur in the ?-cell, triggering hyperglucagonemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic sequelae of diabetes. As such, many potential therapeutic agents currently under development (including FGF21 analogs, adiponectin mimetics, and ceramide synthesis inhibitors) may function as glucagon suppressors via sphingolipid-mediated actions and may require glucagon-suppressive actions in order to achieve full anti-diabetic efficacy. Newly-available imaging mass spectrometry techniques make these studies feasible for the first time."
"9203067","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 31/2 year training program for developing a career focused on mechanisms regulating postnatal distal lung morphogenesis. I completed a residency in pediatrics at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and a fellowship in pediatric critical care medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Since accepting a position at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, I have risen from Instructor to Assistant Professor, and I have developed a nascent research program defining the mechanisms of stretch- regulated matrix remodeling in lung development and regeneration. Dr. Jeffrey Whitsett, an accomplished neonatologist and developmental biologist, has a track record of mentoring over 30 successful physician- scientists and has served as my mentor since my arrival. He along with an established scholarship oversight committee will advise me in my transition to a successful, independent research career with R01 funding. The proposed research focuses on the role of stretch-regulated matrix remodeling in septation. Although lung stretch and matrix remodeling are critical factors impacting distal lung morphogenesis, we do not understand how these processes are coordinated or how they regulate alveolar septation. During development and compensatory lung growth stretch induces lung elastin remodeling and regulates fibroblast expression of chymotrypsin-like elastase 1 (Cela1). Cela1 binding to lung matrix increase exponentially with strain, and Cela1 is largely bound to Serpina3 in the extracellular matrix. This proposal tests the overall hypothesis that stretch-regulation of Cela1 activity is critical to alvelar septation. Aim 1 of this proposal tests whether Serpina3 is the putative inhibitor of Cela1 in the lung matrix by pull-down and mutation of the Serpina3 reactive center loop. To define the stretch-dependent mechanism by which Cela1 binds lung tropoelastin, Aim 2 measures the extent to which specific tropoelastin peptides quench the binding of Cela1 to lung matrix with increasing strain. It then tests the critical Cela1 amino acids mediating this interaction by site directed mutagenesis. Aim 3 first defines the lung phenotype of the Cela1 knockout mouse and quantifies Cela1's contribution to lung elastase activity. Subsequently, it tests the importance of Cela1 in the physiologic matrix remodeling of regeneration and the pathologic matrix remodeling of emphysema. The career development portion of this proposal is foundational for my transition to research independence. It provides training in bio-mechanical model generation and testing. When combined with dynamic imaging of ex vivo lung sections and methods for quantifying different cellular and matrix-remodeling processes, this knowledge will permit mechanistic insight into how stretch and strain regulate distal lung morphogenesis. On a molecular level, this proposal also will provide training in molecular model generation and the methods testing these models. This training and the associated collaborative relationships will be key in developing a multidisciplinary, transformative research program focused on improving lung health in children with BPD."

"9198885","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite many years of discussion, research, and efforts to promote change, a great disparity remains between the presence of black, Hispanic, Native American, and other underrepresented minority (URM) faculty at US research universities and their representation in the American population. This reality is no less true in te neurosciences than in other disciplines. Moreover, URMs who do achieve faculty status appear to achieve traditional measures of success at a lower rate than do their majority counterparts. Although data on publications and funding rates appear to be lacking, there is a striking absence of URMs in visible positions of prominence as full professors or chairs at research universities and as symposia speakers, journal editors, or societal officers. We believe that these two problems are related - that if those URMs who are faculty become more successful in regard to those measures, this in turn will stimulate an influx of other URMs into faculty ranks. Our evaluation of available programs in the United States strongly indicates that there are limited opportunities to adequately assist early career URM faculty in overcoming these difficulties, and it is this problem that we seek to address through the establishment of a nationa Early Career Institute (ECI) to promote the advancement of junior faculty members in the neurosciences at research universities. Defining success for such faculty in terms of quality and quantity of manuscripts published and research grant proposals submitted, scored, and funded, we propose to establish an ECI based on the following hypothesis: The success of early career URM faculty members in neuroscience can be increased substantially by an intensive individualized educational program focused on (1) exposure to cutting edge research in basic neuroscience, (2) increased background on the neurobiology of disease, (3) instruction in professional skills and the responsible conduct of research (RCR), (4) development of an expanded network, and (5) frequent mentoring by established faculty. To test this hypothesis we wish to establish a national Early Career Institute (ECI) to advance the development of URM faculty. We will begin by identifying 10 URM faculty members in the neuroscience each year who are early in their career and have great promise for success. We will then develop individualized career development programs for each participant selected and together the participant and mentoring team will develop a career development plan. To facilitate that plan we will establish a one- year educational program consisting of (a) workshops, (b) mentored attendance at professional scientific meetings, (c) assistance in the expansion of their network, and (d) a listserv to promote communication among the participants. The impact of our efforts will be carefully evaluated and the results disseminated at meetings and in published articles. We believe that this approach will have a significant impact on the success of early career URM faculty in the neurosciences and will also serve as a model for programs in many other areas of academia."
"9198996","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is a chronic and complex metabolic disease. Chronic high glucose exposure produces impaired angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis during wound healing resulting in skin ulcerations of the lower extremities (leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputation) and making diabetes a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR2/3) are critical regulators of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Importantly, VEGFR2/3 is significantly reduced in the vascular endothelium of diabetic patients. However, the mechanisms responsible for the VEGFR2/3 loss remain poorly understood. Prolonged high glucose exposure reportedly induces ligand-independent degradation of Golgi-localized VEGFR2; however the degradative pathway has not been defined. Intriguingly, we unveil that diabetic conditions elevate autophagosome components, Ulk1 and LC3B and induce VEGFR2/3 targeting to autophagosomes. Given that VEGFR2/3 depletion drives impaired diabetic wound healing, whether autophagosomes mediate degradation of Golgi-localized VEGFR2 is a highly significant and open question. Our latest data show that epsins, endocytic adaptor proteins critical for ligand-induced VEGFR2/3 internalization and degradation in physiologic conditions, are upregulated and interact with Ulk1/LC3B and VEGFR2/3 in autophagosomes in diabetes. Epsin deficiency inhibits diabetes-induced loss of cell surface VEGFR2/3 independent of VEGF. Thus, we hypothesize that epsins promote the degradation of cell surface VEGFR2/3 by targeting VEGFR2/3 to autophagosomes, and autophagic degradation downregulates both new synthesized Golgi-localized and cell surface VEGFR2/3 to effectively decrease VEGFR2/3 levels in diabetic endothelium. Lastly, we hypothesize that disrupting epsins and Ulk1 to protect VEGFR2/3 from diabetic-induced autophagic degradation may offer a new therapeutic strategy to combat retarded diabetic wound healing. In Aim 1, we will determine mechanisms underlying diabetes-induced degradation of intracellular VEGFR2/3. The proposed studies will identify novel mechanisms by which LC3B and Ulk1 mediate degradation of Golgi-localized VEGFR2/3 in the diabetic endothelium. In Aim 2, we will determine mechanisms of diabetes-induced cell surface VEGFR2/3 autophagic degradation. These studies will provide novel information on how epsins and Ulk1/LC3B cooperatively regulate ligand-independent cell surface VEGFR2/3 degradation. In Aim 3, we will examine the therapeutic potential of epsins and Ulk1 null animals in diabetic angiogenesis using in vitro angiogenesis assays and in vivo diabetic wound healing and Matrigel plug assays in our novel db/db and Akita diabetic mouse models with combinatorial conditional depletion of endothelial epsins and Ulk1. These studies will shed light upon the beneficial effects of epsins and Ulk1 loss in diabetes, and test the combinatory therapeutic potential of epsin and Ulk1 inhibition in the treatment of defective diabetic peripheral angiogenesis."
"9231898","LMAN1 mutations in colorectal cancer development Abstract  Every year over 50,000 people die of colorectal cancer, making it the third most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Identification and functional characterization of new pathways associated with oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are important in understanding the disease mechanism and the development of targeted treatment approaches. A recent report identified frequent biallelic mutations that result in the loss of LMAN1 expression in microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) adenomas and carcinomas, suggesting that LMAN1 mutations occur early in tumor development and are positively selected in MSI-H colorectal tumors. Our group has shown that LMAN1 is a mannose-binding lectin that functions as a cargo receptor for the transport of glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. To determine whether LMAN1 mutations contribute to tumor development, we tested LMAN1 expression in human microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer tissues, and found complete or partial loss of LMAN1 expression in 40% of them. Using mouse models and colorectal cancer cell lines that are deficient in LMAN1 expression, we have obtained strong preliminary data suggesting that LMAN1 functions as a novel suppressor of colorectal cancer. Initial studies of 65 MSS colorectal cancer patients revealed that those lacking LMAN1 expression had significantly worse prognosis than those with normal LMAN1 expression. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which LMAN1 deficiency contributes to formation and development of colorectal cancers; 2) to identify the underlying mechanisms for the loss of LMAN1 expression in human MSS colorectal cancer tissues. This study will uncover previously unknown links between protein secretory deficiency and carcinogenesis in the colorectal cancer suppression by LMAN1. Results may lead to effective personalized medical care for a subset of patients whose cancer is deficient in LMAN1. Knowledge gained from these studies may be applicable to other types of cancer."
"9242514","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prior studies suggest that women with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their infants are at elevated risk of having adverse obstetric health outcomes. Yet, there is no research on pregnancy or infant health outcomes with a population-based sample of US women with intellectual and developmental disabilities or their infants. As a result, many questions remain unanswered about the unmet perinatal health care needs and health outcomes of women with intellectual and developmental disabilities. In the proposed study, we plan to address this gap in the literature and use our findings to develop perinatal care recommendations to improve care for women with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The specific aims of this study are to (1) Investigate pregnancy and childbirth complications, outcomes, and inpatient costs among women with intellectual and developmental disabilities and women in the general US obstetric population, (2) Examine longitudinal health outcomes and health care utilization and costs of women with intellectual and developmental disabilities around the time of their pregnancy and for their infants (up to 1 year of age) compared to other women, and (3) Identify unmet needs and barriers to perinatal care for women with intellectual and developmental disabilities through in-person interviews with pregnant women and new mothers with IDD and telephone interviews with the health care professionals who provide their health care. The study will be conducted using nationally-representative population-based data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) and the Massachusetts Pregnancy to Early Life Longitudinal-All Payer Claims Database (PELL-APCD) linked data system to determine differences in perinatal health care utilization, outcomes, and costs between women with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities and their infants. Finally, the study will develop perinatal care recommendations, providing clinicians with practical tools to address the unique needs of this highly vulnerable population of women with IDD."
"9197702","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS) and secondary neurodegeneration. Currently, it is believed that an MS episode is initiated by autoreactive T-cells and then further exacerbated by an inflammatory milieu created by the resident and peripheral myeloid cells. After an MS inflammatory episode, inflammation is resolved, but the mechanisms that promote the return to homeostasis remain elusive. Key events involved in the resolution of inflammation are the removal of cellular debris and the termination of the inflammatory program. Our long-term goal is to shed light on the mechanisms that control the resolution of inflammation in the CNS, which will facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for neuroinflammatory disorders such as MS.  Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) is scavenger receptor that is highly expressed on myeloid cells, including the CNS-resident microglia. LRP1 promotes the phagocytosis of debris such as degraded myelin and dying cells, which are present during MS inflammatory episodes. The foundation of this proposal is our discovery that LRP1 also functions as an inhibitor of inflammation, as cells lacking LRP1 display increased and sustained inflammatory responses following stimulation. Furthermore, mice with the deletion of LRP1 in myeloid cells have increased disease severity in a mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Functions of LRP1 in debris clearance and inhibition of inflammation put this receptor at the center stage as a potential regulator of the resolution of inflammation in MS. Our hypothesis is that LRP1 in myeloid cells limits tissue damage during MS by enhancing the removal of cellular debris and by shutting down the inflammatory response. Guided by strong preliminary evidence, this hypothesis will be addressed by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Test if LRP1 inhibits inflammation by promoting phagocytosis of tissue debris. 2) Test the contribution of myeloid LRP1 to the phagocytosis of degenerated myelin in vivo. 3) Test the functional role of LRP1 during EAE, using mouse model systems with the conditional deletion of LRP1 in microglia or myeloid cells. Under the first aim, we will study the cross-talk between LRP1 mediated phagocytosis and inflammation using primary cultures of myeloid cells. In the second aim, we will use two-photon live imaging of LRP1 mediated myelin phagocytosis. In the final aim, we will study the contribution of microglial and inflammatory macrophage LRP1 during EAE pathology. Our approach is innovative because we will investigate the function of a scavenger receptor, LRP1, during the return to homeostasis after neuroinflammation using new animal models combined with the state of the art live imaging in the CNS. Our proposal is significant because these studies will provide the basis for understanding the function of LRP1 in MS with the ultimate goal of developing novel anti-inflammatory treatments for MS patients."
"9205229","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is little doubt that we are in the midst of a worldwide epidemic of diabetes. Insulin resistance is recognized as a characteristic trait of the disease, defined by the inability to respond to normal circulating levels of insulin, and is usuall closely associated with obesity. Recent data suggest an inflammatory link between obesity and insulin resistance. We hypothesize that the induction of a counter-inflammatory program downstream of NF?B plays a key role in preserving energy storage, reducing energy expenditure and ensuring that insulin resistance is maintained during obesity. To this end, we have searched for inhibitors of the noncanonical IKK's TBK1 and IKK?, and plan to develop these as new therapeutic modalities. We will pursue this plan with three aims: 1) We will development analogs of the newly discovered inhibitor amlexanox with increased potency and metabolic stability, using both medicinal chemistry and structure- based design approaches; 2) We will develop novel inhibitors of IKK? and TBK1 that represent new chemical entities, driven by increased potency, improved pharmaceutical properties and in vivo activity in mouse models of obese type 2 diabetes; and 3) In order to support the clinical development of these new compounds, we will develop in vivo biomarkers for IKK?/TBK1 inhibition."
"9305626","ABSTRACT  In cancer patients, determination of whether a malignancy has spread is the single most important factor used to develop a therapeutic plan and to predict prognosis. In most cases, cancer cells initially spread through regional lymph nodes. Therefore, clinical evaluation for the presence of regional lymph node metastases is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, there are no real-time, non-invasive clinical methods that can reliably detect and diagnose micrometastases in lymph nodes. Therefore, there is an urgent clinical need for an imaging technique that is widely available, is non-invasive and simple to perform, is safe, and can reliably detect and adequately diagnose lymph node micrometastases in real time.  The overall goal of our research program is to develop an advanced, in-vivo, noninvasive, molecular specific imaging technology, i.e., integrated ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging combined with targeted plasmonic nanosensors, capable of immediate and accurate assessment of sentinel lymph node micrometastases in real time. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that photoacoustic imaging integrated with widely used clinical ultrasound imaging is possible and both ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging can be performed in real time, yielding an immediate diagnosis and allowing early implementation of treatment.  A wide range of scientific and engineering, biomedical and clinical problems must be addressed to fully explore the capabilities of molecular specific ultrasound and photoacoustic lymphatic (MS-USPAL) imaging in detection and characterization of sentinel lymph node micrometastases. The current application is focused on important aspects of clinical translation of MS-USPAL imaging. We will develop and validate clinically translatable plasmonic nanosensors for MS-USPAL. We will use ultra-small gold nanoparticles to target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed in squamous carcinoma and in many other epithelial neoplasms. For highly sensitive detection of cancer cells, we will explore EGF receptor mediated endocytosis and the effect of plasmon resonance coupling between closely spaced molecular specific nanoparticles. The ultra-small size of nanoparticles will be highly favorable for rapid clearance from the body which will allow safe transition into clinical practice. Additionally, 5 nm ligand capped gold nanoparticles will greatly reduce nonspecific interactions and reduce the uptake of nanoparticles by immune cells such as macrophages present due to lymph node inflammation, thus diminishing false positive results. Furthermore, we will design and construct a prototype of the clinical MS-USPAL imaging system capable of imaging 5 nm nanoparticles in-vivo."
"9385373","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this training program is to develop burgeoning scientists into future leaders in translational rehabilitation research who are specifically equipped to test and disseminate novel rehabilitative strategies that will alleviate functional impairment and compromised life quality in the face of chronic disease management. This goal will be met by taking advantage of an exceptionally rich institutional environment that offers myriad resources and a complementary and collaborative team of basic and clinical research mentors committed to training and career development. Predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees will benefit from two years of interdisciplinary training that carefully meld three core levels of scientific inquiry: i) cellular and molecular pathobiology of disease; ii) rehabilitation science and exercise physiology; and iii) rehabilitation medicine (i.e. clinical trials). Training ill occur in one of two areas of concentrated strength: 1) Neuromusculo- skeletal and Movement Disorders; or 2) Cardiopulmonary and Metabolic Diseases. Cross-cutting themes with training opportunities include cancer and aging. Predoctoral trainees will be selected from a highly competitive and diverse national pool of students admitted to either the Graduate Biomedical Sciences program or Rehabilitation Science program. Nationally recruited postdoctoral trainees will gain invaluable clinical and translational research training and career development via structured programs and courses sponsored by the Office of Postdoctoral Education and the Center for Clinical and Translational Science. Each trainee's primary mentor and Translational Mentoring Team will be drawn from expert program faculty in the Schools of Medicine (physiology, physical medicine & rehabilitation, neurology, cell biology, pathology, genetics, cardiology, geriatrics), Health Professions (physical therapy, occupational therapy, and nutrition sciences), Public Health (epidemiology), and Arts & Sciences (psychology). Together the trainee, mentor, and Translational Mentoring Team will craft an individual development plan, which will be approved and monitored semi-annually by the Executive Committee. The plan will include required and elective didactic courses, laboratory and clinical research, journal clubs, seminars, scientific presentations locally and at national meetings, and training in the responsible conduct of research. Learning to conduct and publish high-impact research will be a primary focus of the training program. Postdoctoral trainees will also profit from courses on grant writing and laboratory management. The program will grow from mentoring two predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees in the first year to four of each annually, and will take advantage of well-established best practices for successful recruitment of underrepresented minorities and individuals with disabilities. As a top 25 NIH-funded academic medical center with over 80 state-of-the-art scientific core facilities and 25 University-wide, interdisciplinary reseach centers, the University of Alabama at Birmingham is remarkably well-positioned to cultivate truly translational scientists equipped to drive the field of rehabilitation medicine with cutting edge research."
"9240436","The title of this grant asks a question that most sleep researchers might think has been answered. Our paper and Mignot?s group?s paper, both appearing in September 2000, showed that human narcolepsy is linked to a loss of hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) cells. We reported a 90% loss, with all narcoleptics having surviving cells, a finding that has been repeatedly replicated. We know that, whereas the animal models of narcolepsy are caused by genetic changes, the human disorder is not. HLA (human leukocyte antigen) linkage to narcolepsy suggests that it is an autoimmune disease. The HLA, DQB1*0602 genotype is present in 85-95% of human narcoleptics, but is also present in 20-30% of the general population. The incidence of narcolepsy is about 1 in 2,000. In most cases, identical twins living in the same household are discordant for narcolepsy. Various correlations, much weaker than the HLA relation, have been reported between human narcolepsy and T cell subtypes, antibodies to Tribbles, antibodies to the Hcrt receptor-2, strep infection and insect bites. But, despite many attempts, no one has convincingly shown that narcolepsy can be induced in animals by immune system manipulation. Recently, we and Scammell?s laboratory simultaneously reported a peculiar and massive increase in the number of detectable histamine (histidine decarboxylase) cells in human narcoleptics. This finding has important implications for the regulation of neurotransmitter expression and brain histamine function in general, and may provide an insight into other disorders where inflammation has been linked to pathology, such as Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s. It also resonates with some earlier work we did showing greatly increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), indicative of inflammation, in the histamine cell region of human narcoleptics. Although the peripheral role of histamine in inflammation is well understood, hence the widespread use of antihistamines, it is also known that histamine is involved in CNS inflammation and toxicity. Histamine opens the blood brain barrier. Furthermore Hcrt cells have been shown in in vitro studies to be much more likely to die from insult than adjacent hypothalamic cells. This suggests that the apparent selectivity of Hcrt cell loss that we and others have reported may be a reflection of the sensitivity of these cells to inflammation, rather than evidence for specific immunological targeting. We propose that the greatly increased number of histamine cells in human narcoleptics may mediate the destruction of Hcrt cells that causes narcolepsy. The mouse genetic work focusing on Hcrt may have discouraged a more comprehensive investigation of whether other regions of the brain are damaged or altered in human narcolepsy. We propose to investigate this hypothesis by looking for other evidence of damage explainable by histamine attack in narcoleptics. We will compare the damage present in human narcolepsy to that present in 4 animal genetic models of narcolepsy. We will further test the alternate ?compensatory hypothesis? by determining if other arousal related neuronal groups are increased in human narcoleptics. We are uniquely suited to do this study because we are in possession of the world?s largest collection of human narcoleptic brains (and matched controls) and because of our experience in working with these tissues as evidenced by our published results characterizing human narcolepsy."
"9242978","PROJECT SUMMARY  I am an analytical chemist committed to developing new methods to study how infant nutrition influences health trajectories in early life. In consultation with my mentors, I have developed a training plan to gain additional skills that will enable me to become an independent transdisciplinary researcher in Nutritional Epidemiology. The proposed research project will facilitate necessary training and develop a new biomarker that can quantify breast milk vs formula intake and composition, thereby overcoming a major limitation to the study of long term impacts of infant nutrition and lay the foundation for future grant applications.  I have assembled an expert panel of mentors with complementary expertise, covering pediatrics, child development, epidemiology, nutrition, exposure biology and advanced statistics. Through mentorship, formal coursework and didactic seminars I will gain knowledge of children's health and nutrition and skills in exposure biology and advanced statistics. With these new skills, I can follow my long-term career goal of establishing a competitive, independently funded research program to study infant nutrition and associated long term impacts on health. While this study focuses on children's neurodevelopment, it is important to note that the knowledge and skills obtained will be applicable to multiple child health outcomes that may be linked to nutrition (e.g. obesity, immunological function, allergies and diabetes) and lays the foundation to later include prenatal nutrition as the biomarker can capture the prenatal period. Specifically, I will 1) gain comprehensive training in the application of biomarkers to study the association of chemical and dietary factors and health outcomes; 2) learn the measures used to assess neurodevelopment in children; 3) learn the role of nutrition in infant health; and 4) learn and gain experience with the statistical tools required to analyze complex multidimensional data.  There is growing evidence that some adult diseases are programmed through infant diets but studies are hampered by the lack of a reliable, objective marker that can accurately reconstruct infant diet. The proposed research project will develop the first objective, temporal biomarker of infant nutrition and will demonstrate its application to study the effect of infant nutrition on children's neurodevelopment. This biomarker will reconstruct past diet objectively and quantitatively. We will use state-of-the-art analytical techniques to determine the distribution of multiple elements in children's teeth. Like trees, teeth contain growth rings that can be aged and the elemental content of each ring reflects the dietary intake at that time. Our preliminary results show that specific element signatures can be used to determine diet transitions from exclusive breastfeeding to infant formula. We will expand upon this work to develop a more robust index that can be used to determine the duration, dose and composition of breast milk or formula intake. We will apply the biomarker to study the effect of infant diet on neurodevelopment. This study is highly cost-effective as we will leverage the resources of an existing longitudinal birth cohort where all supporting data has been collected."
"9228307","ABSTRACT: Statistical and Data Services (SDS) Core The Statistical and Data Services (SDS) core will serve as the primary source of biostatistical consulting, analysis, methodological training, and database management support for the proposed 2016-2020 National Alcohol Center. Continuing the SDS core from the 2011-2015 National Alcohol Center, an organized system for consolidating biostatistical and database management services is proposed which will draw resources from a formal Alcohol Research Group (ARG) department structure designed for handling requests for biostatistical support from within the Center as well as from other ARG research projects. The current Statistical Services Department within ARG has 3 biostatistical support personnel with varying levels and areas of expertise and includes the addition of a new Ph.D.-level biostatistician with advanced methodological training and several years of experience working and publishing with ARG Center scientists. For this Center application, the SDS core has brought on as consultants some of the leaders in several areas of statistical analysis including the analysis of spatial data, latent variable methods, data from repeated cross-sectional panel surveys, analysis of clustered data including multilevel modeling, and the analysis of statistical mediation. Through the efficient consolidation of biostatistical and data management resources, the SDS core proposes to support the Center's research goals in the following three ways. First, the biostatistical staff in the SDS core will provide cutting edge biostatistical and analysis support services to each of the Center's research projects and cores. This support will be provided throughout the entire research process including hypothesis generation, survey design and monitoring of sampling progress, database development, analysis formulation and implementation, and research manuscript preparation as well as for Center-related grant development. Second, a continuing biostatistical methodology training aim is proposed to further the goal of increasing the methodological sophistication of Center researchers through the development and implementation of a series of statistical methods courses aimed at providing in-depth training for the motivation, theory, implementation, and inferential interpretation of a wide range of cutting-edge biostatistical methods currently being applied in the alcohol research field including analytic methods proposed in research projects in this Center application. As part of this training, Center researchers will also be trained in the use of several key statistical packages that implement these state-of-the-art-methods. These courses have already been offered over the 2001-2014 period by ARG biostatistical personnel as part of the aims of the current and previously funded Centers and have been found to be extremely valuable in raising the overall level of technical functioning of ARG researchers in their continually evolving field. As the final aim, the SDS core will serve to provide database management and development services to Center research projects. These services will include support for data security and training for data analysts in proper ARG programming and data analysis syntax protocols."
"9233088","The Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program of the Diabetes Research Center at the University of Washington  promotes the development of new and innovative research directed at basic, clinical and translational  aspects of diabetes. The specific objectives of the Program are to: (1) Provide initial research support for  junior faculty who have not yet had independent peer-reviewed NIH funding; (2) Provide pilot funding for  established faculty entering the field of diabetes research for the first time; (3) Support pilot projects by  established diabetes investigators proposing to pursue a novel direction in their diabetes related research;  and (4) Foster mentorqd training in research related to diabetes by offering postdoctoral and graduate  fellowships. The P&F Program annually awards $200,000 ofthe Center's NIDDK direct funds (a minimum of  20%) for P&F research projects. In addition, funds provided by the University are used to support new  investigator research, training of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, and service grants for junior  investigators to use the Center's resources. Applications are peer-reviewed by external and internal  reviewers and the Center's Executive Committee, with awards being made based on scientific merit and  qualifications ofthe applicant, including the potential for subsequent external peer-reiviewed funding. During  the last decade (two funding cycles), NIDDK funds to the Diabetes Research Center at the University of  Washington supported 33 P&F awards, the majority of which were awarded to junior faculty. Of these P&Ffunded  investigators, 27 remain active in research related to diabetes, obesity and related disorders (82%  success). Ofthe six that are no longer doing diabetes-related research, four are still in academic medicine  doing research. Thus, the P&F Program continues to be a highly successful component of the Diabetes  Research Center that utilizes funds provided by NIDDK and the University of Washington to support new and  innovative research in the area of diabetes, obesity and related disorders, and in this manner also fosters the  career development of junior investigators.

"9206495","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes is a disease of enormous health significance in the US and is also the most common cause of kidney disease. The NIDDK plays a crucial role in efforts to better understand and treat these diseases by fostering and supporting innovative basic and applied research projects. However, converging lines of evidence indicate that NIDDK's future success will be limited by the paucity of students entering careers in biomedical research. This five-year project is a component of our long-term goal of stimulating US students to consider careers in science. The objectives of this project are to create and rigorously evaluate curricular materials that utilize an innovative combination of high quality 3-D animations and videogame engine technologies to engage students in the pathophysiology of kidney disease and the research models used to study the renal effects of diabetes. In this project, we will develop scaffolded, inquiry-based curricular materials that will engage today's technology-savvy undergraduate students, cultivate scientific habits of mind, and encourage students to consider careers in biomedical research. The inquiry-based learning activities created in this project will expose students to the processes that underlie normal renal function and the changes that occur as the result of diabetes, particularly those that result in the development of systemic hypertension and kidney failure. The opportunities for students to explore the fundamental aspects of kidney function in health and diabetes will be further enhanced by the creation of two interactive case studies. The case studies that will be developed and evaluated in this project include a clinical case study highlighting the clinical effects of diabetes-induced kidney disease, and a research case study in which the students will simulate experimental models of diabetes. These case studies will be designed to promote the development of the habits of mind that characterize scientists, namely making observations, developing and testing hypotheses, collecting, analyzing and interpreting data, and drawing conclusions. The integrative curricular materials and interactive case studies will be rigorously evaluated to assess their impact on student achievement and interest in biomedical research as a possible career. In doing so, we will contribute to NIDDK's core mission by improving student understanding of these disease processes and encouraging students to consider careers in disease-oriented biomedical research."
"9242993","Abstract Pneumonia biology should be the focus of an R35 from the NHLBI. Pneumonia is a leading global burden of disease in every analysis. It kills more children worldwide and hospitalizes more US children than does any other disease. Older adults are even more affected. The incidence and risk of death from pneumonia increase throughout adulthood until becoming orders of magnitude greater than for young children. But the idea that adults have to be old and frail to get pneumonia is a counter-productive misconception. Pneumonia susceptibility is pronounced in middle age, with the median age of non-immunocompromised US adults hospitalized for pneumonia being 57 years. In addition to the directly attributable immediate morbidity and mortality, pneumonia also accelerates unhealthy aging, including exacerbations and more rapid decline of chronic pulmonary diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and more. A wide ranging assortment of viruses, bacteria, and other microbes causes pneumonia, with no one organism responsible for as much as a tenth of cases. It is not about the microbe. These are pathobionts, not pathogens. They circulate among us repeatedly or live on us continuously, growing in the lung to cause pneumonia only under exceptional circumstances. Whether pneumonia ensues depends on the quality and quantity of the host response. Pneumonia results from failures of lung defense more than from microbial virulence. We need to understand the lung defenses that normally prevent pneumonia in young healthy adults before we can identify, prevent, or reverse what goes wrong to make individuals susceptible to pneumonia. Our ongoing research program is addressing the question of lung defense against pneumonia with a long-standing and continuing focus on pulmonary inflammation and innate immunity that is now coupled with a newer emphasis on naturally acquired heterotypic adaptive immunity against respiratory pathobionts. This research program includes 2 ongoing NHLBI R01s that are defining roles of lung epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in mediating protection against pneumonia. These 2 grants together total 26 R01-years of support from the NHLBI, and we propose unifying these distinct components of our mature and productive research program into a more integrated R35 award. During the coming years, we envision our research program (i) advancing mechanistic understanding of lung defense against pneumonia by functionally integrating the activities of lung constituents and adaptive immunity, (ii) leveraging discoveries in lung defense to generate new approaches to preventing and curing pneumonia, and (iii) forwarding the concept that pneumonia susceptibility is a chronic disease of aging, and attacking the mechanisms of susceptibility rather than (or in addition to) the acute infection has the greatest promise for diminishing the burden of this lung disease."
"9198583","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our poor understanding of the genetic and environmental factors and the mechanisms by which they produce the cognitive and behavioral impairments that characterize Alzheimer's disease stands as a critical barrier to identifying effective preventative measures and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. This project seeks to address this gap in our understanding by examining the ability of the serine/threonine protein phosphatase, PP2A, to control sensitivity to the pathological actions of beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. PP2A is regulated by multiple mechanisms including post-translational methylation of the C-terminus of the catalytic subunit. This methylation is controlled by a dedicated methylesterase, PME-1, and a dedicated methyltransferase, LCMT-1. To perform these studies, we will alter PP2A activity in vivo by manipulating PME-1 and LCMT-1 expression using multiple lines of genetically modified mice. By altering PP2A methylation, the subunit composition and substrate specificity of the mature enzyme will be altered, thereby increasing or decreasing its ability to dephosphorylate Alzheimer's disease relevant substrates. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1) Test the hypothesis that reduced PP2A methylation promotes the development of Alzheimer's disease related impairments by increasing sensitivity to beta- amyloid. 2) Test the hypothesis that over expressing LCMT-1 or reducing PME-1 expression protects against Alzheimer's disease related impairments by decreasing sensitivity to beta- amyloid. 3) Test the hypothesis that PP2A controls beta-amyloid sensitivity by regulating APP phosphorylation at Thr668. These aims will be addressed through a combination of behavioral, electrophysiological, and biochemical techniques. In summary, findings derived from these studies will identify the mechanisms whereby PP2A and its downstream targets may affect the development of Alzheimer's disease by controlling sensitivity to beta-amyloid. Furthermore, they will suggest developing interventions that target this pathway as an effective new therapeutic approach for the disease."
"9238314","Project Summary This project will overcome a main obstacle impeding progress to fully exploit marine natural products (NPs) for health applications. Currently, there are no efficient genetic methods to interrogate and modify endogenous NP biosynthetic pathways from marine filamentous cyanobacteria, and no robust platforms for heterologous expression and genetic engineering of cyanobacterial NP pathways. This project will develop methods and tools for engineering cyanobacteria for the heterologous expression and manipulation of NP gene clusters identified in organisms that are not amenable to genetic methods, or orphan NP gene clusters that are identified in environmental DNA sequences. The project will use the synthetic-biology strain Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 and the marine filamentous cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya (ISB-3N94-8PLP) to provide two distinct but complementary genetic platforms for the expression and engineering of NP pathways. The long-term objectives of this project are to provide efficient platforms for the production of NPs in quantities suitable for studying their biological activities and for chemical modifications to enhance those activities for health applications. Although a few relatively simple marine cyanobacterial NPs have been produced in heterologous hosts such as E. coli, difficulties remain for the expression certain enzymes and of large complex pathways in phylogenetically distant hosts. We hypothesize that expression of these cyanobacterial genes and gene clusters in cyanobacterial hosts will overcome this obstacle. The 3 specific aims of this research are as follows. (1) Establish Leptolyngbya as a broadly applicable genetic platform for identification, expression, and interrogation of NP pathways. (2) Develop improved genetic tools to enable the transfer, refactoring, and overexpression of large biosynthetic pathways in platform strains of cyanobacteria. (3) Express two orphan pathways from the marine cyanobacterial genus Okeania in S. elongatus and Leptolyngbya. New genetic tools and methods will be created for S. elongatus and Leptolyngbya that will include TAR cloning vectors, shuttle plasmids, chromosomal integration sites, constitutive and regulated promoters, reporter genes, and antibiotic-resistance markers to facilitate manipulation of endogenous NP pathways and for the heterologous expression of pathways from other organisms. This project will combine state-of-the-art approaches in genomics, transcriptomics, bioinformatics of secondary metabolite pathways, cyanobacterial genetic engineering, and NP chemistry to address knowledge gaps related to medically important NP biosynthesis in marine cyanobacteria. The project will develop Leptolyngbya and S. elongatus into broadly useful expression hosts for cyanobacterial secondary-metabolite enzymes and entire NP biosynthetic pathways, and these hosts and genetic tools will be made available to the NP research community."
"9193903","PROJECT SUMMARY  Human infants are understood to begin life with a complex of brain mechanisms and sensitivities to environmental and social factors that, together, appear to contribute to our species' unique ability to learn language. However, we are only beginning to understand the nature and development of these brain mechanisms and sensitivities, especially as they contribute to the central question posed here: How does the infant discover the finite set of phonetic units in their native language from the infinite combinations of sensory stimuli around them?  One hypothesis proposes that infants are born with sensitivities to specific rhythmic-temporal patterning at the nucleus of human language phonology in both spoken and signed language, which permits segmentation and categorization of the continuously varying linguistic stream. We suggest that the superior temporal gyrus (STG) is a key neural site that governs this capacity and is the brain mechanism that enables infants' sensitivity to the rhythmic-temporal patterning from which it will build all the words and sentences of its native languages. While it has been suggested that babies are born with sensitivity to rhythmic-temporal patterns in maximal contrasts at around 1 to 1.5 Hz, the precise frequencies to which babies are biologically attracted to remain unknown. In addition, we do not know if this sensitivity is linked to only the pure timing of the signal (the temporal-general property), or also requires the alternation of maximally contrastive units present in both signed and speech phonology (the phonology-specific property). We use integrated functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Tobii eye tracking to examine deaf and hearing infants' response to sign phonetic-syllabic units and moving point-light scenes presented at different frequencies (.5, 1.5, 3 Hz) at a key developmental age, 5-6 months to adjudicate whether infants are sensitive to the temporal-general property or also to the phonology-specific property within rhythmic-temporal patterning.  [[The proposed study addresses if humans are born with neural tissue dedicated to acquisition of phonology, and clarifies on a modality-free level how this tissue may interact with auditory or visual functions.]] Discovering the properties of rhythmic-temporal patterning to which babies are biologically attracted will advance our knowledge about how babies discover the core parts of their languages. The use of signed language stimuli allows us to determine whether infants are sensitive to general temporal patterns or to specific linguistic phonetic contrasts, [[advancing our knowledge of]] language acquisition universals. We will gain insight into how experience-dependent brain changes provide infants with the neural circuitry necessary for learning [[the phonology of their]] language(s), allowing us to support clinicians in identifying infants at risk for phonology-based language and reading disorders. Finally, this first-ever developmental neurobiological investigation of signed language perception will permit new understanding of the importance of early visual language experience for learning and reading outcomes in deaf children, and indeed, all children."
"9409104","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting in motor nerve degeneration and death. Both familial (FALS) and sporadic (SALS) forms exist; the latter greatly predominate. Its cause is unknown. Overstimulation of glutamatergic function - excitotoxicity - with increased Ca2+ and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays an important, if not integral role, though other mechanisms likely contribute to ALS pathogenesis. Interaction of motor neurons (MNs) and astrocytes (ASTs) appear to contribute to disease development. Environmental contribution to ALS has been postulated often, but to date not systematically tested. We propose to examine the interaction of the environmental toxicant methylmercury (MeHg) with two genetic mutations found in humans with ALS. Chronic postnatal MeHg exposure of mice with a mutation in superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1G93A, G93A) hastens the onset of ALS phenotype compared to untreated G93A mice or wt mice exposed to identical MeHg concentrations. We will now test the hypothesis that chronic, low dose, MeHg exposure beginning postnatally enhances development and progression of ALS phenotype in the G93A and G85R SOD1 mutants by increasing [Ca2+]i, generating ROS and inducing mitochondrial toxicity secondary to enhanced release of glutamate (Glu) or actions on AST Glu transporters (EAAT1-2). The two SOD1 mutant strains differ in their time course of development of ALS phenotype and in their primary toxic focus. The G93A mice develop phenotype in ~4 mos and disease is MN-directed. G85R mice develop ALS phenotype over 7-9 months and disease is AST-based. This design will allow us to compare the roles of ASTs and MNs to MeHg induced responses. Specific Aim 1: Examines the development of ALS phenotype and relative role of MNs and ASTs during chronic adult MeHg exposure. Specific Aim 2: Examines oxidative stress as a contributor to MeHg-induced enhancement of ALS phenotype. Specific Aim 3: Examines the cell autonomy of MN function in response to MeHg. Interactions between ASTs and MNs will be examined in chimeric cultures of wt and SOD-1 cells to assess their potential roles in the development of excitotoxicity in MeHg-induced enhancement of ALS phenotype. Early onset effects preceding development of ALS phenotype will be examined using spinal cord slices and co-cultures of MNs and ASTs, from the G93A and G85R strains. Glu-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and elevation of [Ca2+] i and levels of ROS will test for MeHg-induced excitotoxicity. Steady- state mRNA expression levels for EAAT1-2 and proteins involved in [Ca2+] i regulation will be measured during development of ALS phenotype to correlate with studies done in cells in culture. MNs in culture derived from SOD1 mice or wt will allow examination of early effects of MeHg on Glu function, [Ca2+] i oxidative stress or mitochondrial damage in isolation. Results of the proposed study should permit assessment of the role of MeHg-induced Glu- mediated excitotoxicity in facilitating development of MN dysfunction and provide verification for the postulate that environmental exposure to metals is a potential risk factor for susceptible populations in development of ALS."
"9198940","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases caused by insufficient or abnormal blood vessel growth affect a wide range of tissues, and include heart and brain ischemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, and osteoporosis. At the heart of angiogenesis lies the inflammatory response, orchestrated primarily by macrophages. Changes in the behavior of macrophages have major effects on angiogenesis and vascularization of tissue engineering scaffolds that are designed to replace damaged tissues. The proposed work has two major goals: 1) to define the relationship between macrophages and angiogenesis, and 2) to develop a novel biomaterial platform to control macrophage behavior in order to encourage vascularization by the body's own cells. In normal wound healing, macrophages first exhibit a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, and then switch to an alternatively activated M2 phenotype. Although angiogenesis is a part of normal wound healing, the relative contributions of M1 and M2 macrophages to angiogenesis are not well understood. M2 macrophages can also be subdivided into two different phenotypes, M2a and M2c, each with distinct but poorly understood effects on angiogenesis. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that M1 and M2 (both M2a and M2c) macrophages function synergistically and sequentially to promote the growth of new blood vessels. Co-culture experiments between polarized macrophages and endothelial cells will be used to investigate how their crosstalk affects both the M1-to-M2 transition of macrophages and the phenotypic changes in endothelial cells that lead to sprouting and stabilization of new blood vessels. A 3D model of angiogenesis that tracks the behavior of endothelial cells and pericytes over 5 days will be used to probe the effects of changing the timing, duration, and sequence of signals secreted by the different macrophage phenotypes. Finally, macrophage regulation of angiogenesis will be evaluated in vivo using novel immunomodulatory drug delivery systems designed to recapitulate the normal sequence of M1 and M2 macrophage activation. This project will investigate the mechanisms of macrophage regulation of successful blood vessel growth, which will enhance our understanding of how it goes awry in pathological conditions. In addition, this project will result in a novel and biomimetc approach to direct scaffold vascularization by controlling the actions of host macrophages."
"9244113","Abstract Research in my laboratory has made critical findings related to the molecular, cellular, and genetic basis of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), a complex and poorly understood hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) failure syndrome. The complexity and heterogeneity of MDS, and the lack of mouse models, remain as major obstacles to understanding and effectively treating this disease. A major focus of my lab has been the intersection of immune biology and MDS. Namely, we have uncovered and characterized genetically-driven aberrant activation of the Toll- like receptor (TLR) (i.e., innate immune) pathway in MDS HSC, and now have evidence that TLR signaling is a major unifying driver of MDS pathogenesis. While dissecting the role of TLR signaling in MDS HSC, we identified a critical function of TLR signaling in normal HSC, a finding that has broader implications in chronic immune-related disorders and hematopoietic processes. As such, my research program has developed transformative and innovative approaches to investigate the intersection of TLR signaling, hematopoiesis, and MDS, which serve as the foundation for this proposal: (i) to dissect the genetic, molecular, and cellular underpinnings of MDS, with an emphasis on genetically-driven activation of TLR signaling (Research Focus 1); (ii) to evaluate the developmental requirement of the TLR signaling hub, TRAF6, in normal HSC function and MDS (Research Focus 2); and, (iii) to use the knowledge gained by our basic research to identify and develop novel therapeutic modalities for the treatment of MDS (Research Focus 3). The proposed research will impact our understanding of the initiation, progression, and treatment of MDS."

What?s more, cocaine use, compared to other drugs, is particularly driven by social stress, and cocaine is associated with hyperreactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Preclinical and pilot clinical findings suggest that administration of oxytocin, a mammalian neuropeptide, may have a multitude of direct anti-addiction effects, improve engagement in psychosocial treatments, and attenuate hyperreactivity of the HPA axis in patients with cocaine use disorder. This is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of fifty Veterans with active cocaine use disorder, also receiving MMT in an opioid treatment program, randomized to receive either oxytocin 40 IU or placebo intranasally twice daily for six weeks. The primary outcome measure will be oxytocin?s effectiveness at reducing cocaine use as measured by quantitative levels of the cocaine metabolite, benzoylecgonine, in weekly urine samples. Potential mechanisms of treatment response will be evaluated by measuring oxytocin?s effectiveness at a) improving therapeutic alliance with treatment providers (Working Alliance Inventory, client and therapist forms) and attendance in existing clinic-run treatment components and b) attenuating social stress-reactivity by measuring self- reported cocaine craving, psychophysiological stress measures, and salivary cortisol in response to a Trier Social Stress Test. In sum, discrepancies between Veterans and civilians in addiction prevalence, severity, and successful intervention are largely driven by higher rates of social avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptoms among Veterans. This study will uniquely combine psychopharmacological and evidence-based psychosocial interventions targeted at reducing cocaine use, improving treatment engagement, and preventing stress-related cocaine use among Veterans with co- occurring cocaine and opioid use disorders receiving MMT."
"9402888","Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a silent epidemic, which recently has been labeled the signature injury of current combat operations, a population often exposed to stressful stimuli and emotional trauma. While TBI is typically known to impair learning and memory for neutral events, traumatic fear memories are enhanced after TBI, consistent with increased prevalence of comorbid TBI and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mechanisms that underlie the complex TBI-PTSD comorbidity and associated emotional consequences are poorly understood. Although categorized separately from the emotional consequences of TBI, common physical symptoms including phonophobia, hyperacusis, and sensory sensitivity in other modalities may interact and influence emotional and stress responses. Given the highly conserved and redundant connectivity between auditory and limbic networks, and their vulnerability to TBI, alterations in sensory processing after diffuse TBI may result in otherwise neutral stimuli adopting aversive properties and impacting the encoding of traumatic memories. Our findings demonstrate that diffuse TBI causes dynamic changes in plasticity within amygdala neurocircuitry known to underlie stress, emotion, and fear learning processes and that TBI-induced changes within auditory fear circuitry correspond to robustly enhanced contextual fear when footshocks are paired with white noise auditory stimuli, but not low frequency pure tones. This proposal will test the hypothesis that auditory sensitivity following diffuse TBI underlies enhanced fear learning to white noise. We will first determine whether diffuse TBI heightens sensitivity in emotional-auditory networks in a series of convergent and novel anatomical, immunohistochemical, and behavioral approaches. Second, using novel viral mediated technology that allows direct manipulation of activity in specific target projections, we will causally determine the involvement of auditory-amygdala network function during white noise fear conditioning on the observed enhanced fear phenotype after TBI. Findings from these studies could uncover a novel interaction between common TBI sequelae that has not been considered previously. Translational research on the underlying contributing mechanisms of posttraumatic stress after TBI is a critical line of work in need of immediate investigation to determine targets for treatments and preventions for human patients in both military and civilian contexts."
"9127459","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The proposed Phase III study follows a promising Phase I/II double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of CoQ10 in 46 veterans with Gulf War illness (GWI) who met both the Kansas and CDC case definitions who were treated with 100mg or 300mg of a high bioavailability CoQ10 (ubiquinone) product or placebo. The study, performed by Dr. Beatrice Golomb and her team at the San Diego VA, found a significant improvement in men with GWI vs. placebo using their selected primary outcome variable, the general self-rated health, in a sex-stratified analysi which showed a response in men with GWI, but less so in the 7 women included in the study. The investigators concluded that CoQ10 conferred benefit to physical function and symptoms in Veterans with GWI and that examination in a larger sample was warranted. Since there is currently little to offer GWI that is evidence based, it is a stated VA research priority to move promising Phase II work to Phase III study; thus, initiating a Phase III treatment trial of CoQ10 a this time is of the utmost importance to providing some relief to ailing GW Veterans. A double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-site trial with 200 Veterans with GWI is proposed with sufficient men and women in the sample to perform sex stratification analyses. The clinical and laboratory testing will be performed without knowledge of the subjects' group membership, drug or placebo condition, and will remain blinded throughout the study until its conclusion. The subject schedule includes 5 on-site assessments which include the screening visit with informed consent, the drug initiation visit, an 8 week visit and 16 and 24 week visits, with collection of blood, saliva,  and urine and neurocognitive testing. In addition, there is a web-based self-report assessment given every 4 weeks throughout the treatment period and at 4 weeks after completion of the study drug. Subjects will also utilize an activity monitor device to assess activity and sleep throughout the study period through 7 months. The primary analysis to evaluating the efficacy of CoQ10 in GWI will compare treatment groups on SF-36 physical function score over time in a repeated measures setting using a two-sided 0.05 level of significance. Other clinical efficacy end points will be the self-report assessment measures across the domains of fatigue, pain, sleep, and the SF36 subscales of function and severity. Objective measures will include neurocognitive testing, activity data, and laboratory data that could reasonably be considered a surrogate for illness severity (e.g. measures of immune activation, inflammation, and cell function). In addition to the primary objective (efficacy and safety of ubiquinol in GWI), this stuy will offer a platform for the much needed analysis of outcome variables in a well characterized longitudinal cohort, both biomarkers and clinical measures will be analyzed for their utility in future studies. We will also have developed the framework of a much needed clinical trials group for future studies of GWI. If the study proves efficacy, the clinical trials group will work with the VHA to add ubiquinol to the national formulary and update GWI care guidelines. Research findings will be disseminated to key decision-makers, including both the clinical and research leadership of the VA. The medical, academic, and research communities will be reached directly through traditional means of dissemination through publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at national conferences as well as updates to Veteran groups and to policymakers who have an interest in the health of GW Veterans."
"9393544","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sortases act as transacylases that accept a wide range of substrates. Staphylococcus aureus sortase A and its derivatives recognize an LPXTG motif in their substrates, cleave it between the Thr and Gly residues with concomitant formation of a covalent thioacylenzyme intermediate, and then resolve the intermediate in a nucleophilic attack by a stretch of exposed NH2-terminal Gly residues as part of a modified short peptide or even a protein. Such modification of proteins, referred to as sortagging and further developed in the PI's laboratory, has enabled the installation of a variety of different chemical modifications, including fluorophores, nucleic acids, lipids, click handles, and radioisotopes. This application exploits the unique properties of sortase to address two major unsolved questions in immunobiology at a molecular and at an organismal level, the solutions to which have wide biological and biomedical implications. The dynamics of the B cell receptor for antigen (BCR) have been difficult to explore for lack of reagents that track the BCR without eliciting activation. Cas9/CRISPR genome editing experiments have yielded mice in which the immunoglobulin C? locus has been modified with an in-frame COOH-terminal LPETG motif, so that its ? light chains can be modified site-specifically in a sortase-catalyzed reaction with fluorophores suitable for Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). Site-specific modification of the BCR at sites away from its antigen binding sites provides an unprecedented opportunity to analyze the nanoscale organization of the BCR on the surface of living B cells, both at rest and in response to antigen. Our model will enable us to explore the fate of the BCR and B cell responses and reconcile published findings that support seemingly contradictory models. Resolving this issue is of fundamental importance to understand how the BCR works. This will be pursued in Aim 1. Non-invasive imaging of an immune response in an intact mouse or human is a key goal to track sites of incipient and ongoing inflammation, to visualize an anti-viral response, or to follo initiation, execution or suppression of an anti-tumor immune response. Camelid-derived single domain antibodies (VHHs) possess a short circulatory t1/2 and superior tissue penetration. Owing to their small size (~15 kDa), VHHs are ideal vehicles for non-invasive imaging of their targets by positron emission tomography (PET). Synthetic routes to the installation of 18F and 64Cu applied to sortase-tag equipped Class II MHC-specific VHHs have yielded the first PET-imaging-ready labeled VHHs. These clearly reveal sites of inflammation, and based on these encouraging preliminary data, this approach will now be extended in Aim 2 to imaging T cells in the course of an immune response both in influenza and tumor models, using newly developed T-cell specific VHHs, labeled with either 18F or 64Cu."

"9239952","ABSTRACT  The major cause of death from breast cancer is metastatic relapse, which most commonly occurs first in the bone. Bone marrow (BM) biopsies performed on women with early stage breast cancer have shown that small, clinically unapparent ?micrometastases? are actually present at the time of diagnosis in many patients. These micrometastases can survive in the face of adjuvant chemotherapy and lay dormant for years before they become proliferative, causing overt metastatic disease. At this stage, disease becomes incurable.  Our increasing understanding of breast cancer biology has revealed to us the importance of the host tissue in creating a receptive and protective environment for metastases. Preliminary data from our lab using mouse xenograft models show that breast cancer cells (BCCs) metastasize to and lay dormant in unique perivascular hematopoietic progenitor and stem cell (HSPC) niches. The blood vessels in these regions are distinguished by their sinusoidal morphology and their high basal expression of the adhesion molecule E- selectin, and the cytokine SDF-1. Using highly specific E-selectin and CXCR4 inhibitors, we have identified that E-selectin and SDF-1 orchestrate opposing roles in BCC trafficking. While E-selectin interactions are critical for allowing BCC entry in BM, SDF-1/CXCR4 anchors BCCs to the microenvironment and its inhibition induces mobilization of dormant micrometastases into circulation. Moreover, our immunohistochemical studies of biopsies performed on patients with micrometastatic BM involvement show that dormant metastases reside adjacent to SDF-1+ vasculature. Based on these data, we hypothesize that dormant BCCs shelter within unique peri-sinusoidal vascular BM niches from which they are able to dynamically transit back-and-forth to the peripheral circulation as well as to alternative, pro-proliferative microenvironments within the bone. We also hypothesize that interventions such as CXCR4 and E-selectin inhibition can flush dormant BCCs from the protective sinusoidal niche, making them susceptible to cytotoxic or hormonal therapies. To test these hypotheses, we will use single cell resolution, video rate in vivo microscopy in mouse xenograft models to track BCC migration through BM in real time. In combination with in vitro molecular and cellular biology approaches, we will 1) Investigate the signals that critically regulate BCC metastatic entry in bone; 2) Study the molecular mechanisms that regulate BCC exit from bone metastatic sites into peripheral circulation and the impact of mobilization on BCC signaling and viability; and 3) Understand how cross talk with the peri-sinusoidal BM vascular niche mediates BCC dormancy and sensitivity to chemo- and hormonal therapies. Knowledge gained from this work will identify fundamental mechanisms governing the dynamic movement of micrometastatic BCCs and will suggest therapeutic methods to target supportive crosstalk between BM and dormant breast cancer."

It supports six predoctoral students and two postdoctoral fellows per year in the highly interdisciplinary environment of Michigan. Training takes place both in the laboratory with well-qualified and committed research mentors and within the larger Department in courses, seminars, journal clubs and career development activities. Students are recruited to Michigan through a common mechanism called the Program in Biomedical Sciences (PIBS) an interactive confederation of 14 degree-granting programs based in the UM Medical School. Students matriculating through PIBS participate in a first year program that focuses them on individual career development as young scientists and on identifying and selecting one of the 14 programs from which to obtain their degrees. At the end of their first year of training, they can b nominated for support by MMMP based on evidence of a strong interest in research into the roles of microbes in health and disease. Coursework requirements for the program is aligned with that of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, and MMMP trainees also have the opportunity to participate in the course Science in the Clinics, the centerpiece of the MMMP curriculum. In this course, MMMP trainees explore the infectious diseases from a translational perspective, learning to connect the basic research and training they are receiving with clinical and therapeutic features of infectious disease medicine as it is practiced on the wards. Over the years the course has been attractive to fourth year medical students as well as students in the Medical Scientist Training Program, who gain an appreciation for the most recent science behind infectious diseases problems and the mechanisms of pathogens that may serve as new therapeutic or vaccine targets they might one day use in their careers as physicians. MMMP trainees also have the opportunity to host and visit extensively with visiting scientists in the Young Investigators program, which brings investigators to campus for seminars on their research and meetings with trainees to discuss career path choices they were faced with as trainees themselves. Recent efforts to recruit postdoctoral trainees to the UM Medical School through a common mechanism similar to how students are recruited have already been successful in identifying strong candidates for the MMMP Program. New efforts for the upcoming funding period of the MMMP Training Program include incorporating significant new research training in microbiome and bioinformatics and working closely with the Office of Student Success at the Rackham Graduate School on a program of career engagement and development."
"9198916","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regenerative therapies using stem cells are being explored for treatment of advanced lung diseases such as emphysema. We recently identified an undifferentiated fibroblast-like multipotent stromal cell (LMSC) from lung tissue that expresses the same surface markers (CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105) as multipotent bone marrow stromal cells and displays regenerative capacity following transplantation in mice and sheep with experimental emphysema. LMSCs from adult human lung tissue have elastogenic capacity in vitro, spontaneously form alveolar-like structures in matrigel and secrete growth factors including FGF2, FGF7, FGF10, and HGF that can promote remodeling. In collaboration with the Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies (PACT) group at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, we have developed procedures for manufacturing clinical grade LMSCs from biopsy specimens, and designed a biopolymer scaffold to promote lung engraftment of LMSCs following endobronchial administration. These technological advances make autologous LMSC transplantation feasible for human applications, addressing problems of rejection and the need for immunosuppression that are associated with allogeneic transplantation. The objectives of this project are: 1) to complete the preclinical pharmacotoxicology testing required to begin human trials.  2) Initiate Phase 1 trials of autologous LMSC transplantation in emphysema patients awaiting lung transplantation. This trial design will allow us to recover the LMSC-treated organ for histological analysis to characterize responses to LMSC treatment at the cellular level."

The native proteins and complexes can also be investigated by a  variety of activation methods to determine structural information. These methods include collisionally  activated dissociation (CAD), electron capture/transfer dissociation (ECD/ETD), and infrared multi-  photon dissociation (IRMPD). Among the systems we will interrogate using these methods are: (1)  Lipoprotein complexes, such as high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) whose heterogeneity is of interest.  HDL is an important indicator of cardiovascular health. (2) Membrane-embedded proteins play key  roles in cell biology and are pharmaceutical targets (e.g., in anesthesia).

"9197607","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis and bone/cartilage wounds are currently difficult or impossible to treat. The ability to generate specific skeletal progenitor cells may provide the basis for new treatment therapies using a regenerative medicine approach. In order for this to occur it is essential to understand how skeletal progenitors arise during development. Appendicular skeletal progenitors, in particular, are generated when lateral plate mesoderm undergoes an epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition to generate mesenchymal skeletal progenitors that migrate away from the body axis to form the limb buds. Deciphering the mechanism that stimulates the generation of limb skeletal progenitors is important for understanding and treating appendicular skeletal defects. Recent studies have shown that retinoic acid (RA), an active metabolite of vitamin A, is required specifically for generation of forelimb skeletal progenitors: studies on RA-deficient mutant mouse embryos demonstrated a blockage of forelimb but not hindlimb budding. RA signaling is controlled by RA-synthesizing enzymes, including retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) that metabolizes retinol (vitamin A) to retinaldehyde, followed by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2; ALDH1A2) that metabolizes retinaldehyde to RA. Interestingly, a forelimb-specific role for RA was shown by a recent genome-wide association study showing that severe osteoarthritis of the hand (the most common form of arthritis), but not hip or knee osteoarthritis, is associated with human ALDH1A2 gene variants that exhibit lower expression in articular cartilage. RA directly regulates gene transcription by functioning as a ligand for nuclear RA receptors that bind RA response elements near target genes. During development, Raldh2-/- embryos (that lack RA activity) fail to induce expression of Tbx5, the earliest known marker of forelimb development, whereas Rdh10-/- embryos (with greatly reduced RA activity) exhibit delayed Tbx5 expression limited to a smaller domain. Preliminary studies suggest that one mode of RA action may be repression of trunk FGF signaling to permit onset of Tbx5 expression. However, alternative mechanisms of RA action may exist including direct RA regulation of Tbx5 or RA regulation of Hox4/5 genes that may be required for induction of Tbx5 in the forelimb field. We will use a genetic loss-of-function approach to uncover the mechanism through which RA interacts with Tbx5, Hox genes, and FGF signaling to stimulate differentiation of lateral plate mesoderm to a forelimb skeletal progenitor fate. This project will generate important basic information on the signaling mechanisms needed for generation of appendicular skeletal progenitors that may aid in the treatment of skeletal disorders."

"9243845","PROJECT SUMMARY Breathing is a remarkable behavior fundamental to life that mediates gas exchange to support metabolism and regulate pH. A reliable, non-stop, robust rhythmic pattern of respiratory muscle activity is essential for breathing in mammals. Failure to maintain a normal breathing pattern in humans suffering from sleep apnea, apnea of prematurity, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, hyperventilation syndrome, Rett syndrome, and perhaps Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, leads to serious adverse health consequences, even death. Various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple systems atrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are associated with sleep disordered breathing that we hypothesize results from the loss of neurons in brain areas controlling respiration. If breathing is to be understood in normal and in pathological conditions, the mechanisms for respiratory central pattern generation must be revealed. We focus on two brain sites essential for generation of the normal breathing pattern, the preBötzinger Complex and the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group. We propose a broad series of experiments both in vivo and in vitro in rodents using advanced techniques including: viral delivery to express genetically encoded opsins or DREADDs in key subpopulations of neurons in these regions; advanced optical techniques to determine the contributions of the preBötzinger Complex microcircuit to rhythm generation; state-of-the-art neuroanatomical techniques to establish, in appropriate and necessary detail, the interconnectivity of the brainstem respiratory pattern generator. The data from these experiments will provide an extraordinary window into the mechanisms underlying respiratory rhythm and pattern generation."
"9235002","ACCESS (Access for Cancer Caregivers to Education and Support for Shared decision-making) Abstract We have designed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to test an intervention for a population seldom studied?hospice family caregivers?targeting an identified need (decision-making), and measuring a core set of caregiver outcomes (anxiety, pain knowledge, and patient pain). This innovative proposal will be the first shared decision making intervention in the hospice setting. This project proposes an intervention for hospice family caregivers called ACCESS (Access for Cancer Caregivers to Education and Support for Shared decision-making). Our preliminary work (R01NR011472) found that it is feasible to use web-based conferencing to facilitate family caregiver attendance at the hospice care plan meetings. Qualitative feedback indicates this attendance is beneficial to family members. However, we conclude that simply enabling attendance at these meetings is not sufficient to change clinical outcomes. For caregivers anxiety to be changed they need to be prepared for these encounters and actively engaged with the hospice staff in shared decision-making. There is a critical need to arm Hospice family caregivers with necessary information and a strengthened their emotional state so they may become decision-makers. We propose using the Facebook platform to improve emotional support and caregiver knowledge to better prepare caregivers for participation and decision-making. The proposal is based on a conceptual model that combines collaboration with shared decision-making. A pragmatic randomized controlled trial (P-RCT) design will randomly assign subjects to one of three groups: 1) Group 1 will serve as the control and receive usual hospice care enhanced by hospice staff training in shared decision making, 2) Group 2 is one intervention group and will receive usual care as well as participate in a private Facebook support group to increase their knowledge and social/emotional support, 3) Group 3 will receive enhanced usual care, participate in the Facebook support group, and participate in hospice team meetings with a shared decision making process. We will use qualitative and quantitative methods in parallel and equal status to measure the efficacy of the intervention. Our overall hypothesis is that ACCESS will improve hospice cancer family caregiver knowledge (via YouTube videos) and emotional state (via Facebook), facilitating a shared decision making process, which will result in improved caregiver anxiety and knowledge and improved pain control for patients. We have three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the effect of ACCESS on hospice FCGs anxiety, pain knowledge, and patient pain; 2) Evaluate the effect of social media as a decision aids and decision support for pain management for FCGs; 3) Evaluate the satisfaction of staff and FCGs with a SDM process for pain management."
"9379813","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by painful vasoocclusive crises that occur on top of a chronic, progressive vascular disease. Advancement towards new treatment modalities for SCD has been significantly hampered by the lack of biomarkers that can effectively monitor the underlying pathophysiological processes. We have previously shown that SCD subjects have marked dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and that sigh and pain can cause vasoconstriction. We hypothesize that physiologically-based biomarkers reflecting regional perfusion and ANS balance report the collective effects of all molecular and cellular pathologies secondary to the gene defect in SCD. To study this hypothesis, we have assembled a group of skilled investigators from multiple disciplines (pain and behavioral research, biomedical engineering, cardiology, chemistry, hematology, physiology and biophysics, pulmonology, and radiology) to develop and calibrate biomarkers reflecting 1) cardiac ANS imbalance, peripheral and pain-triggered vasoconstriction; and 2) peripheral vascular function and regional cerebral flow and oxygenation. Another goal is to provide standardized measurement/processing tools for use by others. Our unique approach involves sampling multiple physiological variables simultaneously and using computational modeling to account for the complex interactions and isolate the biophysical biomarker of interest. Measurements will be made in human subjects with selected hematological disorders that differ in degree of anemia or blood rheology. We will also study SCD patients on chronic transfusion with varying percent hemoglobin S in order to separate the measurement components due to altered blood rheology and cardiac output from the components reflecting vascular status and the autonomic function of interest. The translation of these biomarkers and derived tools to the SCD research community will fulfill a need and be invaluable for stratifying risk, monitoring disease status, and measuring the effects of therapeutic interventions in patients with SCD. In the course of validating these biomarkers, we will improve our understanding of vascular disease in SCD and other hemoglobinopathies, as well as in normal subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Sickle cell disease, an inherited hemoglobin disorder, causes suffering and early death throughout the world. Progress for new therapy has been limited. We propose to develop/validate biomarkers of blood flow and autonomic nervous system dynamics that regulate vasoconstriction, and to translate these biomarkers into tools that other basic science or clinical investigators can use to provide objective assessments of therapies."
"9242247","PROJECT SUMMARY  Parkinson?s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and ~60,000 veterans currently receive care for PD from the VA Health Care System annually. PD is characterized by progressive motor decline and cognitive impairment. Despite significant medical burden, our understanding of the pathogenesis of PD and therapies remain limited.  Mutations in the gene glucosidase, beta acid 1 (GBA1) are the strongest genetic risk factor for developing idiopathic PD, increasing risk by ~5-fold in GBA1 mutation carriers compared to controls. However, most individuals with GBA1 mutations do not develop PD, suggesting that additional genetic modifiers influence PD susceptibility. Identification of these modifiers would provide insight into the pathogenesis of PD, and reveal novel targets for disease-modifying therapies. The proposed work focuses on identifying genetic modifiers of GBA1-mediated neurodegeneration using a Drosophila GBA1 deficient model, using these modifiers to understand the pathogenic mechanisms causing PD, and determining whether modifiers identified in Drosophila translate to clinically relevant modifiers of human disease.  Candidate modifiers will be identified through a genetic screen using a GBA1 deficient Drosophila model that I have developed (Aim 1). Two candidate modifiers, brainwashing (bwa) and glucosylceramide transferase 1 (GlcT-1) have already been identified in preliminary work. The function of these modifiers in ceramide metabolism suggests that decreased levels of ceramide may be responsible for GBA1-mediated neurodegeneration. I hypothesize that decreased ceramide levels impair fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes, causing neurodegeneration. I will test this hypothesis by identifying alterations of lipid abundances in GBA1 mutant and control flies with overexpression or loss of function of bwa and GlcT-1, and examining resulting effects on autophagy flux and autophagosome morphology (Aim 2). I will also test whether increasing levels of ceramide directly through dietary supplementation can ameliorate GBA1 mutant phenotypes, including impaired autophagy. These studies will elucidate the mechanistic link between lipid metabolism and pathologic protein aggregation in GBA1-mediated pathogenesis, which has remained elusive. In Aim 3, I will test whether bwa and GlcT-1 are also modifiers of human disease, by analyzing human homologs of these modifiers for association with rate of progression of symptoms in a longitudinal cohort of GBA1 carriers and noncarriers with PD (Aim 3).  The proposed work uses several innovative approaches, including a novel invertebrate model of GBA1 deficiency manifesting phenotypes suggestive of PD, testing the role of lipid metabolism on autophagy through genetic perturbations and dietary supplementation, and attempting to translate findings from a Drosophila model to PD patients. This work will significantly advance our understanding of PD pathogenesis, and could reveal novel therapeutic targets and new lipidomic biomarkers.  I plan to use the proposed methodologies in Aims 2 and 3 to investigate the mechanisms of additional modifiers identified through the proposed work. This will provide exciting avenues for new discoveries, elucidate pathogenic mechanisms responsible for PD, and form the basis for a Merit Award proposal, to be submitted during the CDA2. My interests in lipid metabolism alterations contributing to neurodegeneration, and translation of findings from a Drosophila model to a cohort of PD patients already differentiate me from my mentors, and the additional training in these areas will allow me to successfully transition to an independent researcher combining mechanistic experimental work in Drosophila with clinically relevant findings in humans."
"9258623","Project Summary Francisella tularensis is a facultative intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of the zoonotic disease tularemia. Inhalation of as few as 10 bacteria is sufficient to cause a lethal pneumonia in humans. Due to its high morbidity and mortality, as well as ease of dissemination, there are concerns that F. tularensis could be used as a bioterrorism agent. As an intracellular pathogen, F. tularensis must evade cellular innate immune detection; however, the molecular details governing the subversion of the host response during infection are poorly understood. Our research has identified TolC as critical for the virulence of F. tularensis. TolC is the outer membrane-spanning portion of both bacterial drug efflux pumps and the type I secretion system, which secretes a wide range of bacterial toxins. Together, our data demonstrate that F. tularensis delays programmed host cell death responses during infection in a TolC-dependent manner, providing extended time for bacterial replication within the protected intracellular niche. Our data suggest that F. tularensis secretes effector molecules via TolC to execute these host suppressive functions. This proposal will characterize the TolC-dependent modulation of programmed host cell death by F. tularensis. The first aim of this proposal will define the contribution of TolC to the virulence of the F. tularensis Schu S4 strain, a human pathogen. The second aim of the proposal will analyze the cellular signaling pathways that are subverted during F. tularensis infection. The third aim will identify virulence factors secreted via TolC that are important for innate immune evasion. Data generated by this proposal will lead to a detailed, mechanistic understanding of TolC function in F. tularensis. The identification of toxins secreted by F. tularensis would represent a significant advance for the field. In addition, the proposed research will provide new insights into strategies used by intracellular pathogens to manipulate host responses."

"9197697","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Increases in local blood flow accompany almost all increases in neuronal activity in the healthy brain. These dynamic changes in local blood flow are essential for normal brain function, while also providing the contrast detected in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Understanding neurovascular coupling is therefore important both for interpretation of fMRI data, and to understand how the brain regulates its energy supplies in health and disease. While a number of different cellular models of neurovascular coupling have been proposed, our work during the first funded period of this R01 project revealed a new component involved in neurovascular coupling in the brain: the vascular endothelium. Our experiments demonstrated that the vascular endothelium serves to propagate stimulus-evoked dilatory signals along blood vessels in the brain, making it an essential part of healthy neurovascular coupling. Based on our findings to date, we propose that involvement of the vascular endothelium could explain anomalies in earlier astrocyte and / or pericyte-based models of neurovascular coupling, as well as spatiotemporal non-linearities observed in the fMRI BOLD response. In addition, since endothelial dysfunction is involved in a range of systemic pathologies, from cardiovascular disease to diabetes, our findings suggest that these same conditions could directly affect dynamic neurovascular coupling in the brain, providing a possible direct link between systemic microvascular dysfunction and neurodegeneration. In this renewal application we propose to build upon our recent findings, and further explore the role of endothelial signaling in neurovascular coupling. In aim 1 we will investigate how endothelial signaling is initiated in the intact, in-vivo brain. By isolating the location and properties of initiation of endothelial signaling we will explore novel pathways by which neuronal activity could drive vasodilation, while also defining the role of astrocytes and pericytes in our new model. In aim 2 we will determine the types of endothelial signaling pathways involved in the propagation of vasodilation in the brain. These studies will define the sensitivities of neurovascular coupling to endothelial dysfunction caused by disease or pharmacological agents. Mathematical modeling will be used to assimilate mechanistic findings and validate whether they predict the spatiotemporal non-linearities of the hemodynamic response, and thus the fMRI BOLD signal. Finally, we will perform studies to assess the impact of impaired endothelial function on neuronal function, behavior and long-term neurodegeneration. While a causal link between impaired neurovascular coupling and neurodegeneration is to be expected, these effects have never been quantified either acutely or longitudinally, and are of heightened significance if systemic endothelial dysfunction is a risk factor. All experiments will involve the co-development of innovative new in-vivo optical imaging, microscopy and photo-manipulation techniques along with mathematical modeling, image analysis and novel transgenic models of neurovascular control and dysfunction."
"9298140","Project Summary and Abstract  Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by inflammation, mucus production, airway remodeling, and hyper-responsiveness resulting in severe bronchoconstriction. These processes involve interplay among resident airway cells and infiltrated inflammatory cells. Allergic inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors act on resident airway cells including airway smooth muscle (ASM) resulting in structural and functional changes. However, knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of the molecular factors and mechanisms by which inflammatory mediators modulate ASM phenotype. Inflammatory mediators change gene expression and contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma. Transcriptional regulation of gene expression in resident airway cells has been studied extensively. However, protein function in a target cell can be regulated at multiple levels starting from transcription followed by post-transcription, translation and post-translation steps. In this context, small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including the ones derived from transfer RNA (tRNA) have evolved as one of the key regulators of gene expression post-transcriptionally.  We propose that tRNA halves, a major subgroup of tRNA-derived ncRNAs, play important roles in asthma pathobiology and can be targeted as asthma therapy. In preliminary studies, we found that mouse lung expresses specific tRNA half species whose levels are significantly upregulated during allergic inflammation caused by inhaled challenge of house dust mite (HDM). Furthermore, human ASM cells express tRNA halves and their expressions are promoted by treatments with pro-inflammatory and Th2 cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?) and interleukin 13 (IL-13). These results allow us to define the tRNA halves as a novel class of cytokine-dependent tRNA halves, termed proinflammatory tRNA-derived RNAs (pit-RNAs). Importantly, siRNA-directed depletion of pit-RNAs significantly impaired the proliferation of ASM cells, suggesting that pit-RNAs are not just accumulated as degradation by-products of tRNAs but are expressed as functional RNAs promoting ASM cell growth. These results have led us to hypothesize that inflammatory mediators accumulate pit-RNAs in ASM cells, which enhance ASM growth in the molecular pathogenesis of asthma. We propose to comprehensively identify pit-RNA expression profiles (Aim 1) and investigate molecular mechanisms of the pit-RNA-mediated modulation of ASM cell function (Aim 2), which will reveal a novel tRNA-engaged small RNA pathway in the pathogenesis of asthma and support the exploration of biomarkers and efficacious therapeutic applications targeting tRNA halves. ."
"9406033","Project Summary Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Typically, lung cancer is diagnosed at a late stage of disease since inexpensive, non-invasive and accurate screening methods are not available. Low-dose CT screening in high risk smokers reduces lung cancer mortality by ~20% by identifying small lung nodules, but at a 95% false positive rate. For lung cancer screening to be effective, the sensitivity and specificity to detect lung cancer must be improved. We have created a hybrid blood biomarker platform that identifies proteomic, glycomic and autoantibody changes with high sensitivity and specificity in multiple cancer types, including lung. Here, I propose to use our novel platform to identify and validate hybrid biomarkers to detect lung cancer early either as a pre-screen or after CT to guide follow-up treatment (e.g., bronchoscopy, continued CT surveillance or surgical biopsy). I have already identified and validated proteomic markers that show utility in lung cancer early detection in two pre-diagnostic plasma sample sets. These proteomic markers will be further analyzed for glycomic and autoantibody changes (Aim 1). Additionally, hybrid plasma biomarkers will be examined in diagnostic plasma samples from our Fred Hutchinson Lung Cancer Early Detection Clinic (Aim 2). In a multi-disciplinary collaboration, my identified biomarkers will be integrated with pulmonary nodule features to create a risk prediction model that distinguishes malignant from benign nodules identified on CT imaging. I will also delve further into biomarker biology by exploring the mechanism of intracellular glyco- protein export for our best peripheral biomarkers (Aim 3)."
"9389141","Mammalian cells utilize multiple mechanisms to recognize and respond to invading bacteria. This includes inflammasome-mediated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines to promote recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection and LC3-associated phagocytosis of entering bacteria to promote pathogen elimination. Inflammasome components and LC3 are recruited to the human pathogen Shigella flexneri soon after entry into host cells, yet a subpopulation of intracellular bacteria avoids association with these markers. How this subpopulation escapes recognition by these innate immune factors is incompletely understood. We observed the subpopulation that does not associate with LC3 universally associates with the host protein Toca-1. We discovered that Toca-1 forms a complex with a small subset of proteins translocated into cells by S. flexneri via a type three secretion system. Among the ~30 proteins translocated by S. flexneri, I observed that Toca-1 specifically interacts with IpaB, IcsB, OspC3, and IpgD. We have shown that IcsB represses LC3-associated phagocytosis, and others have demonstrated that OspC3 inhibits caspase activation, raising the possibility that this complex functions in aggregate to inhibit innate immune responses. Specifically, I hypothesize that (1) the Toca-1, IcsB, IpgD, OspC3, and IpaB complex forms in a defined arrangement; (2) that the Toca-1-S. flexneri secreted protein complex is assembled on the vacuolar membrane or on vacuolar membrane fragments via the membrane-embedded translocon protein IpaB; and (3) that complex formation per se coordinates restriction of LC3-associated phagocytosis with OspC3-mediated inhibition of caspase activation. The following specific aims are designed to test aspects of this hypothesis:  1. To define the dependency of complex formation between Toca-1 and S. flexneri type three secreted proteins that precipitate with Toca-1. 2. To test whether the Toca-1-S. flexneri secreted protein complex per se restricts innate immune responses in host cells. This proposal will generate mechanistic insights into how S. flexneri evades the innate immune response in host cells early during infection. The results obtained in these studies are likely to have important implications for our understanding of the innate immune response to intracellular pathogens in general. "
"9198739","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last decade, Makerere University (MU) in Kampala, Uganda, has become one of the principal academic institutions worldwide for collaborative research on TB. Currently NIH, CDC, Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, British Medical Research Council and the European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership provide substantial support to TB research in Uganda, including evaluation of new diagnostics; drug treatment regimens; vaccines and translational studies of pathogenesis and correlates of immunity. NIH has supported training in epidemiology; immunology and microbiology related to HIV, while Wellcome Trust funds a capacity-building program in the immunology of tropical diseases. Despite these efforts, training in basic and translational research on TB lags far behind the pressing need. For example, the development of improved TB diagnostics, vaccines and therapies requires the discovery of biomarkers. Uganda is a leading site for research on biomarkers but relies on expatriate scientists for developmental research and often on shipment of specimens for off-site analysis. With development of advanced laboratory infrastructure at MU and other sites in Uganda, the lack of well-trained independent Ugandan scientists conducting basic and translational research at MU is neither necessary nor appropriate. This training program is the product of a needs assessment by academic leaders of MU and Boston University (BU). It is time to provide basic research training to qualified Ugandan scientists equivalent to that available to American graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. As there is growing infrastructure to support independent Ugandan-led research, we have organized this program so that following training, trainees will return to MU as academic faculty and will have the opportunity to establish valuable research programs on tuberculosis and other emerging infectious diseases in Uganda. The Aims of this Program are tailored to address the current and future needs of MU. The capacity-building program helps fill the gaps identified in the needs assessment and addresses priority developmental goals of MU School of Medicine."
"9259097","Abstract  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects 400 thousand Americans. In MS attacks, peripheral blood leukocytes gain access to the brain parenchyma and attack white matter structures. Effective therapies for MS target the steps by which these leukocytes gain access to the brain, called the leukocyte adhesion cascade. These therapies, while effective, can cause rare infectious complications and exhibit variability in response between individuals. A more complete understanding of the leukocyte adhesion cascade may lead to therapies that are safer and effectively treat disease in patients that do not respond to current treatment.  Crawling of leukocytes within the blood vessels towards sites of inflammation is an important part of the leukocyte adhesion cascade and is the least understood of its steps. Chemokines may guide the directed intravascular crawling of leukocytes, but proof and mechanistic detail are lacking. Most current knowledge about crawling comes from in vivo studies which are limited in scope due to low throughput. An in vitro model to enable the dissection of this process in fine detail and with high throughput would advance the field.  To address this, I designed a microfluidic device that uses principles of laminar flow to allow careful studies of the mechanisms underlying directed leukocyte crawling for the first time in vitro. This device allows high resolution live video imaging of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and their adhesion cascade interactions with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMEC). Production of this device and cell culture within it are now routine, allowing us to pursue the objective of establishing whether endothelial cells guide leukocyte intravascular crawling via chemokines.  The project has two specific aims. Aim 1 will answer whether intraluminal chemokine gradients can plausibly direct intravascular crawling by testing whether an acellular chemokine gradient is sufficient to induce directed crawling of leukocytes. This will be extended by quantifying leukocyte crawling behavior on a directionally-stimulated endothelium in the device. Finally, the contribution of chemokine receptors to these phenomena will be assessed, using drugs to block downstream signaling and antibodies to block ligation.  Aim 2 seeks to shed more light on an alternate pathway that has been proposed: direct signaling of endothelial cells to leukocytes via Golgi-derived vesicles laden with chemokine. To do so, we will use lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM) to quantify chemokine-laden vesicle trafficking with a high degree of spatiotemporal resolution. We will use this information to test whether the trafficking of these vesicles is influenced by fluid flow, proximity to endothelial-endothelial boundaries, and the presence of adherent leukocytes.  The proposed experiments will significantly advance our understanding of leukocyte intravascular crawling, as well as provide refined models for future studies of this phenomenon, which has implications for cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as MS."
"9197212","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the most exciting advances in biomedical research is the discovery of small RNA- mediated gene regulation mechanisms. Our research supported by this R01 since 2002 has contributed significantly to this advancement: In the previous funding period, we discovered and characterized the function of mammalian Piwi/Argonaute proteins that are central to small RNA mechanisms. In the beginning of the current funding period, we further discovered that Piwi proteins bind to a complex class of more than 60,000 small non-coding RNAs that we called PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Most piRNAs are encoded by intergenic junk DNA that is mostly heterochromatin. The discovery of piRNAs reveals a new and surprisingly complex dimension of biology, and was voted by the Science magazine as one of the ten Breakthroughs of 2006. Remarkably, Piwi proteins and piRNAs are abundantly expressed only in spermatogenic cells. We and others have shown that Piwi proteins play key roles in spermatogenesis in Drosophila, C. elegans, zebrafish, and mice. We have also shown that the overexpression of the human piwi gene (hiwi) is highly correlated to seminomas. To explore the mechanisms underlying the spermatogenic functions of Piwi proteins, we have recently demonstrated in Drosophila that Piwi proteins regulate the epigenetic state and transposon activity and in mice that MILI also binds to chromatin. Despite this exciting progress, the function of piRNAs has not been directly demonstrated in any system. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate the function of piRNAs during spermatogenesis. Our working hypothesis is that piRNAs guide nuclear PIWI proteins to specific genomic loci for epigenetic regulation, which, in the case of transposons, lead to their silencing. To test this hypothesis and to explore the function of piRNAs, we propose to: (1) Determine the biological function of piRNA clusters during spermatogenesis. (2) Investigate the epigenetic effect of specific piRNAs to the genome. (3) Determine whether piRNAs are required for PIWI-targeting to genomic sequences. (4) Determine whether piRNAs are required for suppressing transposition."
"9240563","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Alcohol abuse disorders are highly prevalent particularly in military combat veterans, with yet to be fully  elucidated molecular biological underpinnings. Human and animal studies indicate that the stable  downregulation of genes protective against the reinforcing effects of ethanol, such as brain derived  neurotrophic factor (BDNF), may result in increased alcohol consumption. BDNF is a known regulator of  synaptic plasticity that may play a significant role in ethanol's addictiv and neurodegenerative properties.  DNA methylation is one component of epigenetic gene regulation. Its ability to endure an animal's lifespan, and even across generations, indicates its potential utility as a means for encoding information.  Hypermethylation of the BDNF promoter has been shown to decrease its expression. Studies suggest active  DNA demethylation in neurons results from GADD45 proteins (GADD45a, b, g) recruiting cytidine deaminases  (CDs) and thymidine glycosylases (TGs) to gene promoters. Recently, we reported decreased BDNF IXabcd  mRNA expression in psychotic subjects' postmortem brain samples associated with decreased GADD45b  BDNF IXabcd promoter binding and increased 5-methylcytosine (5MC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5HMC).  Our principal objective is to determine the role of DNA demethylation in alcohol-drinking behavior utilizing two  separate animal models. In the first approach, we will utilize one of the most frequently used murine models in  alcohol studies, the C57BL/6 (C57) and DBA/2J (DBA) strains. On average C57 mice voluntarily consume 10-  fold more ethanol than DBA mice. Our preliminary data indicate, by comparison to DBA mice, C57 mice have  lower BDNF expression in the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as well as less BDNF IXa mRNA  expression in the NAc as a whole. Additionally, prior studies show divergent responses in BDNF expression  between C57 and DBA mice in reaction to acute ethanol. Taken together, these data suggest that BDNF  dysregulation in the reward circuitry may, in part, contribute to high ethanol consumption in C57 mice. We will  validate that BDNF accounts for this difference by determining if the infusion of BDNF protein into the NAc  shell of C57 mice reduces voluntary ethanol consumption. We will also determine if deficient BDNF expression  in the NAc in C57 mice may be explained by altered expression of DNA methylating (DNMT1, DNMT3a, and  DNMT3b) or DNA demethylating genes, such as CDs, TGs, or the GADD45s. We will measure mRNA  expression of these transcripts, as well as GADD45b and BDNF protein in the NAc and ventral tegmental area  (VTA). We will focus on GADD45 proteins because they appear to be the lynchpins of the demethylation  process. We will determine whether there is reduced GADD45b binding and increased 5MC and 5HMC at  BDNF promoters in these brain regions in C57 mice. In addition, we will test if the C57 strain's inability to  increase BDNF in relation to acute ethanol is due to dysfunctional demethylating machinery. We will attempt to  induce the alcohol-drinking phenotype of C57 mice in the DBA strain by in vivo knockdown of GADD45b in the  NAc shell via siRNA strategy. In our second approach, we will use a GADD45b knockout (KO) mouse  because GADD45b is responsible for activity-dependent demethylation of BDNF. We will evaluate whether  acute ethanol increases BDNF expression and promoter demethylation in the NAc and VTA in mice lacking  GADD45b. Finally, we will test whether the BDNF-deficient GADD45b KO mice have increased alcohol  preference. Ultimately, these studies will identify novel molecular targets in the actions of ethanol and ethanol  drinking behavior, and promote the development of pharmacotherapy for alcoholism."
"9208059","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The first years of life are the most dynamic and perhaps the most critical phase of postnatal brain development. Abnormalities in early childhood brain development have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia, though very little is known about this crucial time period. In the previous grant cycle, we studied brain development in a unique cohort of normal children longitudinally followed and scanned at birth, 1 and 2 years of age, including 386 neonates, 297 one year olds and 251 two year olds. In addition, we have developed the innovative image analysis tools necessary to study brain development in very young children. Our studies found rapid gray matter development and white matter maturation in the first 2 years of life, with marked regional differences in the cortex and in white matter tracts, consistent with temporal patterns of sensory/motor and higher integrative function development. We also found significant relationships between white matter maturation and working memory. Preliminary data indicates that regional gray matter volume and white matter tract diffusivity in neonates is predictive of subsequent gray matter volume and white matter structure at ages 1 and 2 years. These findings indicate that neonatal brain structure, reflective of prenatal brain development and the rapid growth trajectories of the first two years of life, likely play an important role in longer trm outcome. In this competitive renewal, we will extend follow-up of our cohort to 6 years of age and focus on structure/function relationships and the predictive value of early brain structure for later childhood brain structure and cognitive function. MRIs, including structural and diffusion tensor imaging, will be done at ages 1, 2, 4, and 6 years. Cognitive development, including general cognitive function and working memory will also be assessed. Developmental trajectories of cortical gray matter (including cortical thickness and surface area) and white matter (including tract-based spatial statistics and quantitative tractography) will be studied. We predict that neonatal brain structure and developmental trajectories in the first two years of life are critical for, and predictive of, subsequent structural and cognitive development. Relevance New knowledge gained in this study will provide a dramatically improved framework for understanding abnormalities of early childhood brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia and will provide the fundamental information critical for developing preventative strategies for these disorders."
"9405682","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This proposal is for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of montelukast (a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 antagonist) combined with hydroxyurea (HU) for the prevention of vaso-occlusive pain episodes in adolescents and adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). The  investigative team has generated clinical and pre-clinical data implicating cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) in the pathogenesis of vaso-occlusion. In separate cohorts of children and adults with SCD, baseline levels of CysLTs were associated with the rate of hospitalizations for pain. Further, murine models of SCD treated with montelukast showed decreased vascular congestion and lower levels of the inflammatory marker soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) compared to untreated SCD mice. Montelukast is an FDA-approved therapy that is already used in individuals with SCD who also have asthma.  The hypothesis to be tested is that montelukast adds efficacy to HU therapy for improving vaso-occlusion when compared to HU alone.  In this proposal, participants treated with montelukast and HU will be compared to those treated with placebo and HU for a total of 8 weeks. The following specific aims will be tested in adolescents and adults with SCD: Aim 1. To determine whether montelukast versus placebo added to HU will improve markers of vaso-occlusion-associated tissue injury in adolescents and adults with SCD, and Aim 2. To evaluate physiologic effects of montelukast versus placebo added to HU in adolescents and adults with SCD, specifically (Subaim 2A) to determine if montelukast versus placebo added to HU will improve lung function in adolescents and adults with SC; (Subaim 2B) to determine if montelukast versus placebo added to HU will improve forearm microvascular blood flow in adolescents and adults with SCD, respectively. Anticipating a 20 percent dropout rate, 63 participants will be enrolled with the expectation that 50 participants will receive montelukast or placebo therapy for 8 weeks."
"9243587","How inflammation and thrombosis fuel disease and aging: Focus on NETs This R35 0IA application is an extension based on two recently funded NHLBI RO1 grants entitled ?NETS in thrombosis and inflammatory responses? and ?NETs and their modulating enzymes in age-related inflammatory diseases.? For many years, we have conducted a successful research program studying thrombosis and inflammation. Our current emphasis is on newly discovered neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Upon neutrophil activation, peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) translocates to the nucleus to citrullinate histones. This decondenses chromatin, which is released as NETs. NETs trap microbes but we have shown a dark side of NETs, i.e., they promote thrombosis, inflammation and age-related heart and lung fibrosis. The central hypotheses of our program are: NETs are involved in the formation of a stable organized and vascularized thrombus and breaking up NETs is necessary for thrombolysis. Thrombosis promotes deposition of NETs in the adjacent vessel wall and also in distant organs leading to post-thrombotic syndrome and an increased systemic pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory state. Aging promotes NET formation and NETs in turn escalate chronic inflammatory and thrombotic diseases. We believe that inhibition of the process of NET formation or destruction of NETs would be beneficial to the host. Finally, we hypothesize that genes regulating NETosis, such as peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), impact aging. The work by the ?Wagner Lab? is considered innovative and solid; an objective measure is its high citation. The lab has always been funded by more than one NHLBI grant and for 15 years I was also the PI of a large PPG in Transfusion Biology. However, in the recent difficult funding period too much of my time was spent on securing support for my group. Obtaining prolonged funding would free my time for more mentoring, writing reviews, and collegiate activities. In addition, we now study chronic inflammatory diseases and their impact on aging. These experiments take time and the extended duration of support would assure that we could pursue this exiting research effectively."
"9228212","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Nonsyndromic sagittal craniosynostosis represents the most common cause of cranial vault deformity, with an estimated incidence of 0.4-1/1000. The premature sagittal suture fusion can lead to increased intracranial pressure and impairment in the neurocognitive development. The cost associated with the management of the condition is substantial. Despite an obvious strong genetic base, the etiology of non-syndromic sagittal craniosynostosis remains obscure, therefore only symptomatic treatment modalities currently exist. Recently it has been shown that an important fraction of de-novo mutations presumed to be germline in fact occurred either post-zygotically in the offspring or were inherited as a consequence of low-level mosaicism in one of the parents. We put forth the hypothesis that a loss-of-heterozygosity, two-hit, recessive model is responsible for the development of nonsyndromic sagittal craniosynostosis. One genetic mutation is germline transmitted and the other occurs in somatically, in mosaic fashion, very early in development at the level of the tissues that form the sagittal suture. The first aim of the proposal is design to identify the de-novo mutations in genes regulating bone fusion at the level of the sagittal suture that are responsible for the premature suture closure. Exome sequencing of paired blood and bony tissue from the fused sagittal suture of affected individuals will be done to identify such mutations. Data analysis and directed sequencing of samples from multiple additional individuals for validation of findings will be performed. The second aim will address the genetic germline contribution to the development of sagittal synostosis. Taking advantage by the unique resource represented by the Utah Population Database, multiplex families from our clinical practice that show aggregation of nonsyndromic sagittal synostosis will be expanded. Whole genome sequencing of blood samples and data analysis will be performed in affected and unaffected individuals from these high-risk expanded pedigrees. Success in identification of genetic variation in patients with sagittal synostosis will create the opportunity for understanding the pathophysiology of the disease process. This significance of the study is that understanding the genetic etiology of craniosynostosis will allow personalized genetic counseling and implementation of therapies specific to the mechanism of disease."
"9311694","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children, elderly and immunocompromised hosts, for which no effective treatment or vaccine is available. Children who develop RSV-induced bronchiolitis are also at increased risk for recurrent wheezing and development of asthma in later life. Although the pathogenesis of RSV-induced disease remains a matter of intense scientific debate, increasing evidence from experimental models and studies in naturally acquired infections suggest that severe LRTIs are indeed associated with increased viral ?load? and delayed viral clearance due to an innate immune response that fails to restrict viral replication, yet causing inflammation and tissue damage. The endogenously-generated gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is implicated in a variety of inflammatory and vascular disorders, associated with both pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling. Recently, our group has gathered important new data, reagents and animals models that demonstrate a key role of H2S in mediating antiviral and anti-inflammatory responses in the lung. In particular, we have shown that H2S potently inhibits viral replication, exerts anti-inflammatory activity, and controls airway hyperresponsiveness in RSV-infected mice. At the cellular level, we have shown that RSV is capable of inhibiting the expression of cystathionine ?-lyase (CSE), the key enzyme that generates H2S is the lung, reducing the ability to generate cellular H2S. We propose that dysregulation of the H2S pathway affects host antiviral response and plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of severe RSV infections. Our findings indicate an important cross-talk between H2S and the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-dependent pathways, which control the cellular redox balance, each of them exerting a positive influence on the other, and both of them being downregulated in the course of RSV infection. Thus, in this project, we will test the central hypothesis that inhibition of cytoprotective H2S generation, due to decreased NRF2-dependent gene transcription, leads to clinical manifestations of RSV infection. We will employ a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to test this hypothesis, by the use of cells and mice genetically deficient in either NRF2 or H2S generating enzymes, and the access to our ongoing cohort of infants and young children with primary RSV infections. This project will elucidate innate pathways by which respiratory viruses modulate lung disease, with strong implications for developing novel antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies for RSV-induced LRTI and possibly long-term consequences, such as recurrent wheezing or asthma. Our long-standing clinical and research expertise in the area of pathogenesis of viral bronchiolitis and RSV infections, strong preliminary data, and UTMB's outstanding resources in the area of lung disease make us ideally suited to pursue this innovative project."
"9261690","PROJECT SUMMARY The bacteria that live in our body (microbiota) help us metabolize different nutrients and chemicals from our diet, including the medications we take. Thus, these bacteria can influence our response to treatments, like chemotherapy, by converting drugs into more or less toxic forms. Understanding the mechanisms by which bacteria influence our response to drugs is critical to design better treatments that maximize therapeutic effects and minimize adverse effects. The nematode C. elegans and its bacterial diet provide a suitable model to explore host-microbe drug interactions because both host and microbe are amenable to high throughput drug screening and genetic screening. I propose to use the nematode C. elegans as a model to study host-microbe-drug interactions in cancer chemotherapy drugs. In Aim 1, I will test ~ 200 cancer chemotherapy drugs for developmental or fecundity phenotypes in C. elegans animals fed two different bacteria. Additionally, I will test the role of active bacterial metabolism in the observed host-microbe-drug interactions. Then, I will use genetic screening and metabolomics, in the host and in the bacteria, to characterize the mechanisms responsible for the observed drug response. In summary, this project will generate a set of host and bacterial genes that contribute to the response to cancer chemotherapeutic agents."
"9264282","Organ to organ communication is important in the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance and blood pressure (BP) homeostasis. The gastrointestinal tract and the kidney are major organs involved in this process. The natriuresis following the ingestion of a certain amount of sodium, with or without food, may be due to an enterokine, gastrin, secreted by G-cells in the stomach and duodenum and released into the circulation. Abnormalities in stomach sodium sensing and impaired generation of gastrin, gastrin-mediated increase in renal dopamine production, gastrin-mediated natriuresis, or interaction with D1-like receptors cause hypertension. The sodium sensor in the stomach is not known but new data show that sodium sensor in the stomach, specifically in G-cells, is Scn7a. Scn7a colocalizes with gastrin in mouse stomach. Stomach/ duodenum-selective silencing of gastrin impairs the renal response to a salt load and increases BP. Stomach /duodenum selective silencing of Scn7a prevents the increase in serum gastrin following ingestion of sodium (independent of chloride or osmolality) that is also associated with impaired sodium excretion and increased BP in salt-resistant BALB/c mice fed a high sodium diet. However, BP is not increased in patients who have had gastric bypass. Indeed, the high BP can be normalized by gastric bypass. Sleeve gastrectomy actually enhances the increase in plasma gastrin following a mixed meal. By contrast, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery prevents the increase in plasma gastrin following a mixed meal but either type of bypass surgery increases plasma levels of natriuretic enterokines, such as GLP-1. GLP- 1 from L-cells that is secreted via gastrin-dependent and -independent (e.g. sodium) mechanisms may also participate in this gastro-renal communication. Therefore, this competitive renewal will test the overall hypothesis that the sodium sensor that is responsible for increasing the secretion of gastrin from stomach G-cells and GLP-1 from intestinal L-cells, in response to an oral sodium load, is the sodium channel, Scn7a. Gastrin, acting on renal CCKBR, GLP-1, acting on its receptor GLP-1R, also in the kidney, and dopamine produced in the kidney, acting on renal D1R, interact to negatively regulate renal sodium transport and keep the BP in the normal range."
"9394187","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are approximately 1.3 million US child care workers, most of who are hourly employees and classified as low-wage earners. In North Carolina, half of these workers are African American or Hispanic. Many have no health insurance, putting them at increased risk for many serious and chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Regular physical activity (PA) is known to decrease risk of many chronic diseases; unfortunately, most Americans, especially low-income individuals and minorities, fail to meet PA recommendations. A multi-level worksite-based PA intervention offered in child care is an innovative strategy to reach these low wage workers and address health disparities among this high-risk population. While the primary target of our intervention is worker PA, we expect that healthier and more physically active workers will be better role models and promoters of healthy lifestyles for children in their care. This two-arm, cluster RCT (n=104 centers, with 4 workers/center) will test the efficacy of a 6-month Care2bWell (CARE) intervention in increasing workers' PA compared to a Financial Empowerment (FE) control arm. The CARE intervention will include a kick-off workshop, where participants get tailored feedback about their health risks and set behavioral goals, followed by three 2-month long wellness campaigns, during which workers monitor PA, receive tailored feedback, and compete in teams for prizes. Center directors will take part in monthly webinars focused on improving the work environment to support PA and wellness. Within a social ecological framework, Perceptual Control, Social Support, and Diffusion of Innovation theories guide intrapersonal, interpersonal, and center- level intervention components. Participants in the FE arm will receive a parallel intervention to enhance financial health at the individual and center levels. The primary outcome will be accelerometer-measured minutes of moderate to vigorous PA. Primary and secondary outcomes (diet, anthropometrics, psychosocial variables, & center wellness environments) will be assessed at baseline, follow-up (6 mo), and maintenance (18 mo). Detailed process evaluation, cost-effectiveness, and meditational analysis will be used to assess mechanisms of behavior change at the individual and center levels."
"9195082","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a fundamental gap in knowledge of the role of oxidative stress in the extracellular environment in the etiology of breast cancer. Our long term goal is to elucidate the role of extracellular redox signaling in promoting mammary tumor-fibroblast interactions. Our preliminary data suggest that loss of an extracellular antioxidant enzyme, extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD) is a frequent event in clinical breast cancer tissue and there is an inverse correlation between its expression and clinical stage. We also observed that re- expression of EcSOD in c-Met expressing breast cancer cells strongly attenuated oncogenic stimulation by mammary fibroblasts that overexpress the c-Met ligand, HGF. These findings led us to our hypothesis that loss of EcSOD expression contributes to breast cancer progression and metastasis through oxidative-mediated tumor-fibroblast interactions, via activating the HGF/c-Met axis. The objectives of this study are to identify the mechanisms involved in deregulating the expression of EcSOD in breast cancers and the consequences of the loss of EcSOD expression (and the resulting increase in extracellular oxidative stress) in promoting HGF/c- Met-mediated oncogenesis. We will first determine the involvement of aberrant DNA promoter methylation in regulating EcSOD gene silencing in clinical breast cancer tissues. Next, we will test a novel idea that oxidative tumor microenvironment is one of the key factors that promotes HGF/c-Met signaling. It has been well established that Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is often overexpressed and secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts. This paracrine factor activates its receptor, c-Met on the surface of cancer epithelial cells. In the second aim, we will determine whether loss of EcSOD promotes tumorigenic transformation of normal mammary epithelial cells by HGF-overexpressing mammary fibroblasts. Conversely, we will evaluate whether re-expression of EcSOD in breast cancer cells will attenuate oncogenic stimulation induced by fibroblast- derived HGF. We will further examine whether NADPH oxidase-generated oxidative stress on the plasma membrane is involved in HGF/c-Met activation. We will utilize a 3-dimensional co-culture model that includes both the cancer epithelial cells and their oncogenic 'partner', fibroblasts. In addition t determining the tumorigenic stimulation of fibroblasts on cancer epithelial cells, we will also examine how cancer cells reciprocally alter the phenotype of fibroblasts. We will next investigate the effects of EcSOD on tumor growth and metastasis of c-Met expressing breast cancer cells using a syngeneic mouse model as well as using an orthotopic tumor-fibroblast model. Overall, our multi-pronged study will utilize overexpression, knock-down, inactive mutant protein expression, pharmaceutical SOD mimetic and chemical inhibition approaches to validate the role of extracellular oxidative stress in promoting progression and metastasis of breast cancer. Positive outcome will help in expanding our understanding of the role of extracellular oxidative stress in fueling cancer epithelial-fibroblast interactions, towards development of novel therapeutic interventions."
"9261762","Idiosyncratic, drug-induced liver injury (IDILI) causes morbidity and mortality in affected patients and necessitates the withdrawal of otherwise efficacious drugs from the market. There is a need for more effective preclinical screening of drug candidates to avoid developing and marketing drugs with IDILI liability. Although mechanisms underlying IDILI reactions are not fully understood, available evidence suggests that adaptive or innate immune responses are involved. A role for cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) has been proposed. Published studies as well as our preliminary results suggest that drugs that cause IDILI in humans sensitize hepatocytes to killing by this cytokine in vitro. Accordingly, the overall hypothesis to be tested is that the abilities of drugs to sensitize hepatocytes to injurious effects of TNF can classify them according to their potential to cause IDILI. In preliminary studies, we exposed HepG2 cells to noncytotoxic concentrations of 24 drugs having either high or no/low IDILI liability in humans. The cells were coexposed to TNF at a concentration that was by itself noncytotoxic. Almost all of the drugs with IDILI liability became cytotoxic in the presence of TNF. In contrast, drugs without IDILI liability showed no such response. Detailed drug concentration-response curves were generated in the absence and presence of TNF, and curve characteristics (EC50s, maximal responses, etc.) were used singly or in combination as covariates to develop statistical classification models. Several models showed superb ability to classify the 24 drugs according to their IDILI liabilities, some yielding areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of > 0.95, indicating remarkably high sensitivity and specificity. This approach has numerous qualities that make it attractive for screening new drug candidates; however, it requires validation and refinement before it would be acceptable as an assay for IDILI prediction in a preclinical, drug development setting. Accordingly, the aim of this proposal is strictly focused to validate and refine promising statistical classification models for development as assays that predict IDILI potential of drug candidates. We will begin by adapting this in vitro approach to a high throughput format. Next, using a larger set of drugs, detailed concentration-response curves obtained in the absence and presence of TNF will provide covariates for evaluating (ie, validating) the most promising of the statistical classification models that resulted from our preliminary study. Finally, the results will be used to refine the models and to select one or more with extraordinarily high performance. Results from the proposed studies have the potential to lead to a robust yet simple, high-throughput, in vitro assay capable of markedly improving preclinical strategies for identifying drug candidates with IDILI potential."
"9195135","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Helicases are molecular motor proteins that use energy from hydrolysis of ATP to manipulate DNA and RNA in all phases of nucleic acid metabolism. Numerous mutations have been identified in many different helicases that are associated with human diseases including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders. The Pif1 family of helicases has been identified in all eukaryotes and is involved in maintenance of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Mutation in Pif1 can increase the risk for some forms of breast cancer. The primary function of helicases is to unwind duplex DNA, but other critical functions have been discovered for which biochemical mechanisms are unknown. Helicases can displace proteins from DNA in reactions that are critical for maintaining genomic stability. One of the overall goals of this proposal is to determine the mechanism(s) by which helicases push other proteins from DNA. Helicases not only unwind duplex DNA, but also unfold other forms of DNA such as G-quadruplex DNA (G4DNA). G4DNA is made up of guanine-rich sequences that have been implicated in gene expression, DNA replication, telomere maintenance, and mitochondrial DNA metabolism. Another goal of this proposal is to characterize the mechanism of G4DNA unfolding. We will use the prokaryotic helicase Dda and its eukaryotic homolog, Pif1 to determine the mechanisms for helicase- catalyzed protein displacement and unfolding of G4DNA. Based on preliminary data, we propose that mechanisms for Pif1-catalyzed unfolding of G4DNA and protein displacement are tightly regulated by cooperative binding to DNA. Within this overarching framework, more detailed hypotheses will be tested. In Aim 1, we will examine the role of a putative protein displacement loop in removing proteins from DNA. We will test the hypothesis that a stepwise mechanism is used to push proteins from DNA. We will determine the importance of cooperative binding of Pif1 to DNA during removal of proteins from telomeric DNA. In aim 2, we will determine the mechanism for unfolding of G4DNA using a combination of chemical perturbation along with single molecule Förster energy transfer (smFRET). We will use mutagenesis to examine the Pif1 signature sequence for binding to G4DNA. Using a proteomics screen, we discovered that Dbp2 helicase binds tightly to G4DNA. We will investigate Dbp2-catalyzed unfolding of G4RNA and G4 RNA-DNA hybrid molecules. In Aim 3, we will determine how single-stranded binding proteins Rim1 and RPA regulate the G4DNA unfolding activity of Pif1. We will determine whether Pif1 stimulates the polymerase activity of mitochondrial polymerase Mip1. We have developed a CRISPR-based method to isolate any desired gene segment and analyze that DNA for protein complexes. We will target chromatin that contains G4DNA sequences to identify proteins and chromatin markers that regulate these structures. This work will establish the mechanisms used by helicases to unfold G4DNA, displace proteins from DNA, and thereby regulate genomic stability."
"9224240","PROJECT SUMMARY  Organ transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with end-organ damage. Nearly 300,000 individuals die each year awaiting transplant. Despite tremendous advances, long-term graft survival remains disappointing because current immunosuppressive regimens are unable to prevent chronic rejection and require life-long treatment, placing patients at risk for infections, cancer, and heart disease. B cells are central to the development of antibody-mediated rejection and chronic rejection. However, B cells have also been shown to play a protective role. Five large independent studies unexpectedly revealed a ?B cell signature? in tolerant transplant recipients, uncovering a key regulatory role for B cells. Yet very little is known about how regulatory B cells (Breg) suppress the alloimmune response, or how they differ from pathogenic B cells. Currently there are no phenotypic, transcription factor, or lineage markers that are unique to Breg. Furthermore, Breg appear to inhibit inflammation and disease through multiple distinct pathways involving cytokines and cell surface markers. Thus, our current challenge is to comprehend the diversity of B cell subsets that possess regulatory capacity and the key decision points that determine their fate as regulatory versus pro-inflammatory.  TIM-1 is an important physiological receptor of Breg, providing a crucial checkpoint to ensure peripheral tolerance is maintained. Recognition of apoptotic cells by TIM-1 promotes B cell IL-10, and a loss of function mutation of TIM-1 leads to a defect in Bregs, and heightened auto- and allo-immunity. TIM-1+, but not TIM-1-, B cells can transfer allograft tolerance, and their suppressive capacity is dependent upon TIM-1 signaling. We have now found that in addition to IL-10, TIM-1 signaling promotes the expression of many molecules with known coinhibitory activity. Our data further reveals AhR to be a key putative transcriptional regulator of Breg, downstream of TIM-1. The objective of this proposal is to map the regulatory network that controls Breg development and function, focusing on TIM-1 and AhR as key regulators. Our central hypothesis is that Bregs are a functionally and phenotypically diverse set of cells that are controlled by a common core network.  Dr. Melissa Yeung is a transplant nephrologist at the Brigham & Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School (BWH/HMS) with a strong commitment to the field of transplant immunology. Her long- term career goal is to become an independent investigator with a specific focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms governing B cell-mediated transplant tolerance. The support of the K08 award will allow Dr. Yeung to achieve the following training objectives: 1) investigate the mechanisms by which the TIM-1/AhR axis mediates Breg in alloimmunity; 2) acquire proficiency in transcriptomics research; and 3) become an expert in B cell immunoregulatory pathways.  In order to accomplish these objectives and investigate our hypothesis, Dr. Yeung will first examine the role of TIM-1/AhR in regulating the function of Breg upon physiological induction and through ligation of a ?tolerogenic? anti-TIM-1 antibody (Aim1). She will do this using a network-based, transcriptomic approach to construct a model of key immunoregulatory circuits controlled by TIM- 1/AhR. To validate her model, she will then examine the functional roles of nodal regulators. Lastly, she will investigate the in vivo mechanisms by which Bregs suppress the alloimmune response (Aim2). Completion of the proposed research will provide fundamental insights into the signals involved in the ontogeny, reactivity, diversification and function of Breg, and how these pathways differentiate them from pathogenic B cells. Potential clinical applications that could result from this work include the use of Breg for cell therapy, the design of therapeutics to target pathogenic B cells whilst sparing Bregs, and the use of a Breg signature to guide immunosuppressive therapy.  Dr. Yeung will be closely guided by her primary mentor Dr. Vijay Kuchroo, Professor of Neurology at BWH, Director of the Evergrande Center for Immunologic Disease at HMS and Associate Member of the Broad Institute, who has vast experience in transcriptomic and immunology research. To complement his expertise, we have formed a multi-disciplinary team of scientific advisors and collaborators: 1) Dr. David Rothstein, Professor at the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute, University of Pittsburgh, who is an expert in regulatory B cells and transplant immunology; and 2) Dr. Joseph Bonventre, Professor and Chief of the BWH Renal Division, who has extensive knowledge in KIM-1/TIM-1 biology. Dr Yeung will also draw upon the wealth of the BWH/HMS research environment, including the Evergrande Center for Immunologic Disease, the Broad Institute, the Renal Division, and the Transplantation Research Center. Dr. Yeung's proposed K08 study, mentorship team, career development plan, and collaborative research environment will catalyze her scientific productivity and provide her with a strong foundation as a future independent investigator and leader in transplantation."
"9384961","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal seeks support for the training of Dr. Supriya Saha, a medical oncologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center, toward his goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist with a focused clinical practice in hepatobiliary cancers and a research laboratory dedicated to the study of cholangiocarcinoma. Dr. Saha will be mentored by Dr. Nabeel Bardeesy, a leader in mouse models of gastrointestinal cancer, and Dr. Andrew Zhu, a clinical expert in hepatobiliary cancers. Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has an average survival of < 1 year and has been increasing in incidence for several decades. With no effective targeted therapies or methods for prevention or early detection currently available, there is an urgent need for a greater focus on basic and translational ICC research. Recent studies have identified missense mutations in the metabolic enzymes isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2) as the most common genetic alterations in ICC. Mutant IDH (IDH*) has been proposed to contribute to tumorigenesis through an intriguing mechanism whereby the IDH* enzyme produces an `oncometabolite', 2-hydroxglutarate (2HG), that inhibits a family of enzymes requiring alpha-ketoglutarate as a co-factor. Unfortunately, the lack of animal models of IDH*-driven ICC or human cell lines with endogenous IDH mutations has hindered elucidation of the oncogenic mechanisms and of effective therapies against IDH* disease. Over the last 3 years, Dr. Saha has worked in Dr. Bardeesy's laboratory to overcome these hurdles by defining the mechanism by which IDH* promotes ICC and generating the first genetically engineered mouse model of IDH* ICC. Simultaneously, Dr. Saha designed and implemented a clinical protocol to obtain fresh patient samples to generate a rich panel of human ICC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. In collaboration with Dr. Cyril Benes, these tools were subjected to a high-throughput drug screen to identify a class of kinase inhibitors with potent and specific efficacy against IDH* ICC. During the award period, Dr. Saha will complete studies required for the effective translation of his work into an early phase clinical trial. This includes evaluating the se of targeted kinase inhibition in an autochthonous mouse model of IDH* ICC, using proteomic approaches to identify the specific targets and mechanism of action of kinase inhibition in ICC and exploring the potential mechanisms of resistance that may develop in this disease. This work will benefit from the breadth of expertise at MGH, which houses leading research groups in cancer genetics, molecular biology, signal transduction and cancer therapeutics, and was the first institution to identify IDH mutations in ICC. Given his extensive background in laboratory research, promising preliminary results and the superb mentorship he will receive, Dr. Saha anticipates applying for independent funding within the third year of this award."
"9195756","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nervous systems from invertebrates to humans have shown remarkably resilient and adaptive abilities to maintain stable functionality despite challenges that may otherwise lead to suboptimal or uncontrolled activity. In each of these systems, perturbations to synaptic activity initially lead to corresponding alterations in synaptic strength. However, given sufficient time, nervous systems in these organisms adapt by modulating presynaptic release or postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors to re-target previous levels of synaptic strength. This process, termed homeostatic synaptic plasticity, is thought to enable stable, yet flexible, synaptic activity and to play key roles in tuning neural function in health and disease. Yet there is a major gap in our knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that endow synapses with these extraordinary abilities. The long term goal of this proposal is to identify the genes and elucidate the mechanisms that achieve and maintain the homeostatic control of synaptic strength. To understand the principles governing homeostatic synaptic signaling, we will utilize the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, which has been established as a powerful genetic system to study this process. This proposal will use a combination of genetic analysis, electrophysiology, and imaging approaches to investigate the homeostatic mechanisms that enhance presynaptic release in response to a perturbation to postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor function. In particular, three genes encoding neuronal transmembrane proteins have been identified that appear to function together in the presynaptic terminal to promote the calcium-dependent, homeostatic potentiation of synaptic transmission. Interestingly, these genes have been associated with epilepsy, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. The proposed experiments will first characterize these molecules in synaptic function and homeostatic plasticity. Confocal and super-resolution microscopy will then be utilized to reveal the subsynaptic localization and cellular activities of these proteins. Finally, complementary forward genetic screens are proposed to identify new genes that orchestrate homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Together, this work is expected to reveal new homeostatic genes and mechanisms that control the adaptive modulation of synaptic strength and provide a foundation from which to understand how transcellular homeostatic signaling systems more generally are established in the nervous system."
"9370988","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As pharmacogenomics moves from bench-top to bed-side, African Americans have been left out of the advances personalized medicine holds. To date, African Americans have been largely absent from the numerous pharmacogenetic studies that identify predictive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are being used clinically to improve care. As we move toward more comprehensive bioinformatics and high- throughput methods of evaluating the genome for functionally relevant SNPs that affect drug phenotypes, we are also producing a growing health disparity in the translation of these findings into the clinic for African Americans. Current genomic methods are trying to reach beyond genome-wide association in hopes of finding biological plausibility to genetic findings. This search has led to the use of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as a tool in pharmacogenetic association studies. SNPs labeled as eQTLs have intrinsic biological plausibility since they are significantly associated with changes in gene expression. However, no liver eQTL studies have been conducted in African Americans. By using liver-specific eQTLs, we will discover SNPs that affect drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), which will have wide-spread scientific and clinical impact; given that most drugs currently prescribed undergo some form of hepatic metabolism. Because of the increase genetic diversity found in African Americans, they may carry population specific SNPs can never be found by pharmacogenomics studies in populations of European-descent alone. Without African American focused pharmacogenomics studies we risk excluding African Americans from personalized medicine. We plan to use primary hepatocytes to conduct gene expression studies both before and after drug enzyme induction to identify genes that are differentially expressed. Drug enzyme induction is driven by increased gene transcription; therefore, by focusing on the genes that are differentially expressed after induction we can pin-point the drivers (i.e. genes) that regulate drug metabolizing enzymes. We will then look at SNPs within and in close proximity to these genes to determine if any are associated with differences in gene expression (dubbed DI-eQTLs). We will then look to see if these DI-eQTLs are associated with pharmacokinetic measures in the same set of cell cultures, affectedly preforming a pharmacokinetic and a pharmacogenetic study in the same individual. We hypothesize that drug enzyme induction will provide us with DI-eQTLs that are strongly associated to drug pharmacokinetics, a clinically relevant phenotype. To validate these findings we will query publically available data to look for an enrichment of our DI-eQTLs within the most strongly associated SNPs in pharmacogenomic GWAS data. The association between genotype, gene expression and drug pharmacokinetics in African Americans has never been conducted before and will provide an invaluable resource for pharmacogenomics and clinical pharmacology, as well as clinical translation in this understudied population."
"9263536","We propose to build upon exciting preliminary data to modulate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft- versus-tumor (GVT) effects following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) by understanding the role of obesity in the two processes. Currently, the vast majority of both HSCT and preclinical tumor studies involve the use of lean specific-pathogen-free (SPF) inbred mice. Obesity is a dynamic process that has been well defined to be immunomodulatory, and characteristically contains a ?meta- inflammatory? environment, defined as a state of low-grade, chronic, self-sustaining inflammation. As cytokine storms from inflammatory cytokines play a critical component in GVHD pathophysiology, this grant application seeks to delineate the effects obesity as a pre-existing inflammatory condition on GVHD pathogenesis and GVT responses. Additionally recent investigation into the effects of obesity on commensal microbiome ecology and colonization of the gut have shed light onto the relationship between microbial diversity and immunopathology. Our application proposes the following three aims using a combination of mouse and non- human primate studies due to the unique ability to obtain obese non-human primates at UC Davis: 1) Evaluate the impact of obesity on the induction of inflammatory responses and pathology in response to conditioning regimens, and its effect on immune reconstitution post-autologous/syngeneic HSCT using mouse and non- human primate models, 2) to determine the impact of obesity on GVHD pathogenesis using murine and non- human primate models following allogeneic HSCT, and 3) to determine the effects of obesity on tumor progression and using the pharmacological and microbiological interventions affecting GVHD in the second aim, will determine effects on GVT."
"9240249","Project Summary: Ras proteins play a central role in many aspects of biology. These monomeric GTPases cycle between an inactivate GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. Mutational activation of Ras occurs in approximately 30% of human tumors with some cancers such as pancreatic cancer having Ras mutations in >90% of tumors. These cancer associated mutations trap Ras in the GTP-bound state, leading to chronic activation of Ras-regulated signaling pathways and oncogenic transformation. Thus, RasGTP has been considered the only biologically important form of the molecule. However, we have discovered a novel role for nucleotide-free Ras (nfRas) in the negative regulation of cell signaling. This form of Ras, formed as an intermediate in the transition from RasGDP to RasGTP, negatively regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, class 2beta (PI3KC2?). These finding have profound implications for the understanding of Ras-mediated signaling and transformation. We propose that nfRas binds targets, e.g., PI3KC2?, leading to the mutual inhibition of both Ras and the associated target. Our model predicts that oncogenic activation of Ras leads to loss of repression of these targets resulting in their activation without binding RasGTP. Thus, our findings point to a new class of molecules important for Ras-driven tumorigenesis yet do not bind activated Ras. To better understand the role of nfRas in cell signaling, we have generated high affinity, high specificity monobody reagents that selectively bind different states of Ras. Using these reagents we demonstrate that nfRas represents a significant pool of total cellular Ras. In addition, one of our Ras monobodies which binds to all three forms of Ras (GTP, GDP, and nucleotide free) acts as a highly potent inhibitor of oncogenic Ras- mediated signaling. Using these reagents we will characterize the regulation of nfRas in vivo and determine the role of nfRas in regulating specific targets. Finally, we will utilize these novel monobody reagents to perturb Ras function in vivo using a novel chemical-genetic approach to interfere with pancreatic cancer development and progression. Given the prevalence of Ras mutations in human cancers, it is critical to understand the mechanisms through which Ras contributes to tumorigenesis. Our work represents an entirely new concept in Ras biology that defines a new class of targets that participate in Ras-mediated signaling and transformation. These studies will provide new insights into the mechanisms of Ras-mediated tumorigenesis and are therefore of high translational significance. This work will be beneficial to Veterans as well as the general population, both of which suffer from cancer. However, the incidence for certain cancers, such as lung and pancreatic cancer the latter of which has a high incidence of Ras mutations (<90%), has been reported to be up to 5-7x higher in Veteran populations making these studies particularly relevant to Veterans. Additionally, the goals of our proposal are consistent with the recently established National Cancer Moonshots Program to accelerate research efforts to improve cancer treatment. Finally, given the ubiquity of Ras family members in eukaryotes and their roles in many aspects of biology these results will be of broad scientific interest and importance to many areas of biomedical research."
"9327554","Project summary/abstract Germinal centers (GC) are regions in lymphoid organs where activated B cells are selected for their ability to bind antigen with high affinity as well as generate memory B cells and high affinity antibodies. GC B cells have the unique ability to improve their affinity to the immunizing antigen during an immune response through a process of somatic hypermutation and selection. Although somatic hypermutation targets the immunoglobulin genes, off-target mutations also occur and contribute to the malignant transformation of GC B cells into a subset of non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas. Our understanding of GC B cell biology has been greatly enriched by understanding how such mutations over-ride the normal constraints to GC B cell growth. For instance, our lab has shown S1PR2?s role in confining GC B cells to the GC and inhibiting growth by antagonizing Akt signaling. HVEM, a TNF receptor superfamily member (also called TNFRSF14), is frequently mutated in germinal center (GC) derived non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The mutations found in HVEM are predicted to lead to loss of the protein?s function, suggesting an important growth regulatory role for HVEM in GC B cells. However, HVEM?s function in B cells has not been directly examined. HVEM is highly expressed on follicular B cells and is expressed at a lower level on GC B cells, possibly suggesting an advantage to more finely tuned signaling in the GC. In preliminary studies we have found that deficiency in HVEM results in a cell intrinsic expansion of GC B cells. Of HVEM?s binding partners, the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily co-inhibitory receptor B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is most highly expressed in the GC. BTLA is highly expressed on T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and BTLA deficiency in antigen- specific CD4+ T cells increases IL-21 production and GC B cell expansion, suggesting a regulatory role of BTLA on Tfh cells. Tfh cells have a crucial role in GC B cell selection and several molecular regulators have been shown to tune the degree of T cell help provided to the GC B cell. We hypothesize that HVEM acts as a suppressor of GC B cell responses through its interaction with BTLA, a potential negative regulator of B and T cell engagement. Specifically, we aim to assess how HVEM regulates the magnitude of the GC B cell response and if it impacts the induction of long-lived humoral immunity (1); and to examine if BTLA expression on T follicular helper cells moderates the amount of T cell help during the GC reaction (2). This work will define a novel negative regulator of the GC B cell response, which can lead to a rational target for vaccine development, immunotherapy, and treatment for GC-derived B cell lymphomas."
"9370652","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease."
"9239186","Project Summary Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay for treatment of psychosis, yet they are associated with substantial heterogeneity in their therapeutic efficacy. Non-response to treatment contributes to poor quality of life for patients, and a large economic impact on healthcare systems. Treatment algorithms for these illnesses are devoid of prognostic measures, and clinicians generally must rely on trial-and-error. At the same time, neural mechanisms underlying response to treatment remain unclear, resulting in a lack of potential targets for novel treatment development. Surprisingly, given the urgent public health and scientific needs, very little work has utilized modern neuroimaging techniques to understand the mechanisms of antipsychotic response. We have recently demonstrated that resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) may be a valuable assay for biomarker development, both as pre-treatment predictors of treatment response, as well as dynamic markers of antipsychotic efficacy over the course of treatment. For example, our group developed an index of striatal connectivity that predicted response to second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) with high sensitivity and specificity in first-episode schizophrenia patients, and generalized to a cohort of chronic patients with psychosis. Moreover, we found that changes in the functional interactions of the striatum with the cingulate, hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex tracked improvements in psychosis after 12 weeks of SGA treatment. To date, this approach has not been applied to treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) populations, nor have treatment strategies that do not primarily target the striatum been extensively studied. In this project, we propose to assess RSFC in two groups of TRS patients undergoing treatment with effective intervention strategies that significantly differ from traditional D2 receptor antagonists. In Aim 1, we will assess psychotic patients undergoing a 24-week treatment trial with clozapine, which remains unique amongst antipsychotic drugs for its superior efficacy in TRS. In Aim 2, we will assess patients whose psychotic symptoms remain refractory even to CLZ, whom we refer to as ultra-treatment-resistant (uTRS). We will scan uTRS patients undergoing an 8-week treatment trial of CLZ combined with adjunctive electro-convulsive therapy (CLZ+ECT), a treatment strategy recently demonstrated to have remarkable efficacy in severely ill uTRS patients. For both aims, we will use a longitudinal design with MRI scans collected before and after controlled treatment, with symptoms assessed with structured rating scales. RSFC will be assessed using a seed-based strategy based upon our recent work, but expanded to include relevant subcortical structures beyond the striatum. Results from this project may provide: 1) biomarkers for use in ?precision medicine? strategies for patients with psychotic illnesses; and 2) biomarkers of striatal- and nonstriatally-mediated antipsychotic efficacy for use in novel antipsychotic drug development. Such biomarkers are urgently needed, given the lack of a sufficient evidence base to guide clinical practice, and the lack of a research base to guide treatment development."
"9239787","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a prevalent disorder with a number of adverse cardiovascular and neurocognitive consequences. However, the leading treatment, positive airway pressure (PAP), is poorly toler- ated by many individuals and thus the development new treatment strategies are critically needed.  A number of studies indicate that OSA is caused by the interplay of several phenotypic traits, including a small airway, an oversensitive ventilatory control system, decreased pharyngeal muscle activity during sleep, and premature arousals to a respiratory stimulus. In the previous grant leading up to this continuing renewal, we created methods for measuring these traits as well as a model (termed the ?phenotype model?) that illus- trates the relative contribution of each of these traits to a particular patient's OSA. We believe this model could be valuable for predicting response to PAP-alternatives.  At this time, PAP alternatives (oral appliances, surgery, and other devices such as hypoglossal nerve stimulation, etc.) suffer from inconsistent results, and there is no pharmacological treatment for OSA. Howev- er, respiratory control and arousal factors, which are now recognized as having pathogenic roles, provide po- tential new (and untested) pharmacological targets. The objective of this grant is to validate the predictive power of OSA phenotyping, as well as to test the effectiveness of novel pharmacological treatments alone and in combination with existing PAP alternatives such as oral appliance therapy.  In Aim 1 of this grant, patients will be ?phenotyped? using the methods developed in the previous grant. We will then perform experiments on the model, e.g., we will treat the model with drugs that change ventilatory control sensitivity and arousal threshold. These simulated treatments will generate a prediction of success or failure. We will then administer the treatments to the patient to see if the model prediction was correct. The treatments that will be given are acetazolamide (for decreasing ventilatory control sensitivity) and eszopiclone (for raising the arousal threshold). These medications will be given simultaneously as well as individually. Thus, an innovative component of this grant is that we will combine medications to maximize efficacy. Aim 2 will test the phenotype model's ability to predict response to oral appliance therapy. The same procedure of phenotyping, followed by simulated treatment on the model to generate a treatment prediction, followed by ex- perimental administration of the treatment to see if the prediction was correct will be used. Predictors of re- sponse to oral appliance therapy remain poor, so Aim 2 fills an important gap in this common alternative treat- ment. Finally, Aim 3 will test the phenotype model's ability to predict response to ?triple therapy? (acetazola- mide + eszopiclone + an oral appliance), which our preliminary data suggest can have a powerful effect on ap- nea severity in the right ?phenotype?. This research could lead to exciting new management strategies for OSA."
"9340391","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension affects nearly 1 in 3 of all adults in the U.S. and is well recognized as a major risk factor for a broad range of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, renal disease, and congestive heart failure. When hypertensive patients engage in strenuous exercise, sympathetic nerve activity can rise to dangerously high levels causing markedly exaggerated increases in arterial pressure and heart rate which increase the probability of sudden, adverse cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The mechanisms mediating these abnormal cardiovascular responses to exercise in hypertension are unknown. Many studies have shown that activation of the metabolically sensitive afferents within the active skeletal muscle (termed the muscle metaboreflex) can elicit profound increases in sympathetic nerve activity. Impaired cardiac function in hypertension due to elevated afterload, cardiac hypertrophy, tonic coronary vasoconstriction and impaired ability to increase ventricular contractility may lead to lower skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise thereby causing excessive activation of the muscle metaboreflex. Furthermore, the mechanisms of the muscle metaboreflex are intimately dependent on the arterial baroreflex. Although, there is evidence that hypertension impairs baroreflex function at rest, whether exercise further alters baroreflex function in hypertension is unknown. This proposal is focused on determining the role of the muscle metaboreflex in mediating the altered cardiovascular response to dynamic exercise and the involvement of the arterial baroreflex in mediating these responses. Our laboratory is uniquely poised to address this issue. Over the last two decades we have developed a highly innovative and technically complex conscious, chronically instrumented canine model using state of the art instrumentation which permits the continuous beat-by-beat monitoring of systemic hemodynamic parameters and multiple indices of ventricular function in order to assess the strength and mechanisms of cardiovascular reflexes at rest and during dynamic exercise in normal animals and after induction of disease states. We have expanded this model to the patho-physiological state of hypertension. We propose the first longitudinal study of the effects of hypertension on integrative mechanisms mediating neural control of cardiovascular function during exercise. Our approach is to study the same animal before and after the induction of hypertension thereby each animal serves as its own control. These results may aid in the prescription of exercise regimes for hypertensive patients as well as increasing our understanding of the impact of hypertension on neural control of the circulation during one of the greatest challenges to cardiovascular control - whole body strenuous dynamic exercise."
"9345478","Project Summary/Abstract Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that has spread rapidly throughout South and Central America in the last two years and is responsible for large outbreaks in Brazil and many other countries in Latin America. While the significant effects of maternal-fetal transmission and neurologic complications such as Guillain-Barre syndrome have been well-reported and is the focus of much of the current ZIKV-related research, less is known about ZIKV outcomes in potentially vulnerable populations with underlying co- morbidities such as sickle cell disease (SCD). A recent case report of a 15 year old female with relatively mild SCD who presented with confirmed ZIKV infection and progressed to multi-organ failure and death within 37 hours of hospital admission documents the potential for severe effects in other patient groups. In addition, at least 2 SCD patients within the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation (REDS)-III Brazilian SCD Cohort died after similar rapid deterioration with ZIKV or potentially another similar arbovirus infection. These uncorroborated observations suggest SCD patients are a high-risk population that requires additional monitoring and/or aggressive treatment for ZIKV. This proposal seeks to characterize the clinical impact and pathophysiology of ZIKV in SCD. We will enroll approximately 1000 SCD patients presenting to the emergency room with acute illness at three hospitals in Brazil in the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Recife. These patients will be screened for ZIKV using a nucleic acid triplex assay that simultaneously detects, discriminates and quantifies the viral load for ZIKV as well as the other similar arboviruses we expect may be co-circulating during an epidemic (chikungunya virus and dengue virus). We will define the prevalence of ZIKV viremia in the study population in the context of the other arboviral infections and compare clinical outcomes between patients who test ZIKV+ and ZIKV- to determine the clinical impact of ZIKV. Finally, we will also compare plasma biomarkers and gene expression between patients who test ZIKV+ and ZIKV- to elucidate mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology of ZIKV in SCD."
"9309417","Project Summary In September 2014, President Barack Obama signed an executive order directing federal resources to improve detection and prevention of antibiotic resistance, with a goal of developing a diagnostic test by 2020 that can distinguish between bacterial and viral infections in at least 20 min. The long-term goal of this research is to provide a novel platform solution for rapid, sensitive and specific detection of pathogenic bacterial infections through development of fluorescent probes specific to individual ?-lactamases expressed in the bacteria. ?-Lactamases are a class of bacterial hydrolases destroying ?-lactam antibiotics and rendering antibiotics resistance in bacterial pathogens. Today many patients with suspected infections are administered antibiotics (most frequently ?-lactams) empirically without prior proper identification of the causative agent, resulting in antibiotics overuse and overspread of antimicrobial resistance, with >500,000 deaths in the world annually attributable to these infections. This proposal will focus on two deadly bacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Tuberculosis represents one of the most dangerous respiratory pathogens in the history of mankind, killing over one million people each year and infecting one third of the world's population. Tubercle bacilli express BlaC, an Ambler class A ?-lactamase, so Mtb has the intrinsic resistance to ?-lactam antibiotics. Accumulating results including those from us have supported the use of BlaC as the biomarker for Mtb detection. Broad-spectrum carbapenem agents are frequently the last option for effective therapy of infections with antimicrobial resistant organisms, but the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) over the past decade has left clinicians with few treatment options. CRE is frequently due to the production of carbapenemase enzymes that efficiently hydrolyze carbapenems and other ?-lactam antibiotics. This project will explore novel double-quenching, dual targeting probe design strategy to develop BlaC-specific substrate probes for rapid, highly sensitive Mtb detection (Aim #1) and carbapenemase-specific substrate probes for rapid, highly sensitive CRE detection (Aim #2). These new probes will be evaluated with clinical patient samples. The expected outcome of this research is that a series of novel fluorescent probes will be discovered as a novel assay platform to enable rapid, sensitive and specific detection of Mtb and CRE. We envision that these assays could reduce unnecessary healthcare costs associated with treatment of bacterial infection and prevent further expansion of existing drug-resistant strains."
"9236731","Alaska Native people (AN), an underserved minority US population, have the highest reported incidence (91:100,000) and death (~35:100,000) rate from colon cancer in the world. There is overwhelming experimental and human evidence that diet drives cancer risk, irrespective of genetic background. The World Cancer Research Foundation found convincing evidence that meat increases cancer risk, and that fiber suppresses it [2, 3]. Consequently, the high risk in AN may be attributed to their remarkably low fiber (8g/d) and high meat consumption. We hypothesize that their extreme risk results from the combined effects of fiber deficiency, resulting in decreased colonic microbiota production of anti-cancer butyrate, plus the high exposure to carcinogens derived from meat, fat, smoked foods and tobacco. To explore this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized double-blinded 4-week clinical trial in up to 100 randomizable healthy, middle-aged AN undergoing screening colonoscopy, with the objective of obtaining 60 completed interventions. The interventions will consist of either a high-dose `indigestible' resistant starch fiber supplement (42g/d) given as a drink, which will increase their daily intake to >50g/d, or a control `digestible' starch drink. To gauge potential efficacy against cancer development we will use proliferative biomarkers which can be measured sequentially in colonic mucosa obtained by sigmoidoscopy biopsy (primary endpoint). At the same time, we will investigate the mechanisms responsible for these anticipated changes by measuring the colonic microbiota composition and activity by next generation sequencing of microbial 16S-rRNA genes, and its metabolome by NMR, UPLC-M, and GC-M spectrometry, interpreted with advanced mathematical modeling. We are confident that we will achieve our endpoint because we are using a much higher dose of fiber than has been used in previous clinical trials at >50g/d, which is the level shown to be associated with minimal risk in rural Africans. Secondly, we expect that the continued high fish oil consumption by AN will enhance their responsiveness to fiber supplementation. The conduct of this molecular proof-of-concept study is essential before the conduct of a large-scale definitive clinical trial of high dose fiber supplementation in the prevention of colonic polyps and cancer. While the long-term goal will be to increase the consumption of fiber-rich foods, low cost resistant starch supplementation may offer an immediate strategy to save lives in Alaska Native people, and also in high risk African Americans and the growing populations across the globe consuming low fiber Western diets. !"
"9194429","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on the model of its successful distance learning Masters of Science in Bioethics and its web-based Advanced Certificate Program in Research Ethics in Central and Eastern Europe (FIC-NIH Grant R25 TW007085; E-Education in Research Ethics: Central and Eastern Europe), Union Graduate College (UGC) proposes to develop and developer graduate level online and onsite programs in research ethics for the Caribbean Basin. Offered in partnership with St. George's University (SGU) in Grenada and the Universidad Aut?noma de Quer?taro (UAQ) in Mexico, the purpose of this program is to build capacity in research ethics in the 21 independent low- and middle-income countries that border the Caribbean Sea. Three levels of training will be provided to students: a Certificate (Certificado) in Research Ethics, a Diploma (Diplomado) in Research Ethics, and a Masters of Science in Bioethics. Certificate and Diploma courses will be offered in both English and Spanish at SGU and UAQ respectively, using a mix of online courses and onsite seminars. The use of a hybrid online/onsite approach means that most trainees will be able to receive in-depth comprehensive graduate education in research ethics without leaving their jobs or their home countries. In sequence four cohorts of 8-10 English-speaking students and four cohorts of 8-10 Spanish-speaking students will complete the 6-month, 3-course Certificate (1 onsite and 2 online courses) and the 6-month, 3-course Diploma (1 onsite and 2 online courses) programs. Of the students completing the Diploma program, four will be offered a scholarship to go on to complete the online Masters of Science in Bioethics at UGC. The partnership will also create the infrastructure to support the four cohorts of English- and Spanish-speaking students, train and mentor faculty from the region who can continue these training programs once the funding period ends, provide public online resources on research ethics for the Caribbean Basin, and develop St. George's University and the Universidad Aut?noma de Quer?taro as regional centers of excellence in bioethics and research ethics."
"9310635","Project Summary The great promise of human microbiome research is that managing microbiome composition will prevent and cure disease. To this end, our long-term goals are to identify molecular mechanisms that drive bacterial community dynamics in nasal and skin microbiota and to uncover new antibiotics for controlling pathogen colonization and infection. Previous research shows that nasal microbiome composition and Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization are strongly impacted by environmental factors, including other members of the microbiome. However, the molecular underpinnings of this are largely unknown. This proposal focuses on Propionibacterium species that colonize the skin and nasal passages of most adult humans. Our overarching hypothesis is that cutaneous Propionibacterium species produce antibiotics that control colonization by and proliferation of S. aureus and pathogenic Streptococcus species. Our preliminary data indicate that cutaneous Propionibacterium encode a distinct set of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) predicted to produce antibiotics. We recently purified and structurally characterized one we call propimycin, a Propionibacterium-produced thiopeptide with potent activity against S. aureus in vitro. Our objectives are to identify more of these antibiotics and to define their role in shaping microbiome in vivo. Our rationale is that these Propionibacterium-produced compounds are likely to be important drivers of skin/nasal microbiome composition and, thus, key to developing new approaches to manage microbiome to promote health. To date, we have identified two Propionibacterium antibiotic BGCs specifically induced by coculture with S. aureus, propimycin and a nonribosomal peptide (NRP) that is widely distributed on human skin based on metagenomic data. We will use chemistry, bioinformatic, transcriptomic and bacterial genetics approaches to achieve the Specific Aims of this proposal: (1) determine the role of propimycin on human skin, focusing on skin follicles; (2A) purify and solve the structure of the NRP, a second candidate Propionibacterium antibiotic predicted to have anti-S. aureus activity; (2B) determine the mechanism of the NRP's increased transcription in response to Staphylococcus; and (3) identify additional candidate Propionibacterium antibiotic BGCs expressed in the context of the skin or nasal microbiome. Our strategy has four main innovations: (1) doing molecular experimental work in cutaneous Propionibacterium, which are recalcitrant to genetic manipulation; (2) using sebaceous plugs from human skin follicles to develop ex vivo assays to assess the impact of Propionibacterium antibiotics on S. aureus; (3) coupling a genetic screen in a heterologous system with next-gen-sequencing-based identification of promoters bound by candidate Propionibacterium acnes transcriptional regulators; and (4) using interactions between commensal Propionibacterium and the pathogens S. aureus and S. pneumoniae to uncover molecular mechanisms governing microbiome community dynamics. The significance will be to uncover new antibiotics produced by Propionibacterium and define their role in structuring skin/nasal microbial communities."
"9239266","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious psychiatric condition that affects a substantial number of military personnel who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. Over 30% of all OEF/OIF/OND Veterans who receive health care from the VA have been diagnosed with PTSD. The disorder is characterized by symptom clusters of re-experiencing or intrusion, hyperarousal, avoidance, and negative alterations in cognition. In addition to these distressing emotional and mood problems, impairments in attention and executive control can be observed. Impairments in these frontal lobe functions could, in turn, have a negative impact on social and occupational activities. Recent studies show that PTSD is associated with deficits in highly specific frontal lobe functions, such as response inhibition and sustained attention. These cognitive deficits are strongly correlated with symptom severity. Conversely, other executive control processes, including interference resolution and error monitoring, are intact. Little is known about why these dissociations occur, and what their underlying neural mechanisms might be. The current project will extend previous findings in the OEF/OIF Veteran population by asking why this specific pattern of spared and impaired frontal lobe functions is observed, and how targeted task manipulations such as cues and rewards might improve performance. The proposed studies will investigate the cognitive and neural mechanisms of three cognitive domains that are difficult for Veterans with PTSD: (1) staying ?on task?, the ability to focus on the task at hand without mind wandering; (2) response inhibition, the ability to withhold inappropriate motor responses; (3) distractor resistance, the ability to filter out extraneous stimuli to maintain items in working memory. The project will use a direct measure of the brain's electrical activity to determine when in the information processing stream potential weaknesses occur. This is a critical element, because knowing if a particular deficit is associated with early suppression of distractors, sustained attention, and/or response inhibition may inform future therapeutic approaches. The project will also record electroencephalographic (EEG) activity at rest to examine possible changes in connectivity associated with PTSD. The relationship between off-task cognition (?mind wandering?), fluctuations of attention, and trauma-related thoughts and memories will be explored. The proposed studies will contribute to larger efforts to characterize this Veteran population by including PhenX common data elements and easily replicated methods that can be implemented at other research sites. An innovative aspect of the current proposal is its novel approach to resting state EEG, which is easier and less expensive to collect than resting state fMRI. The observed patterns of EEG network activity will be related to specific ?phenotypes? of resting state cognition as determined by the validated Amsterdam Resting-State Questionnaire (Diaz et al., 2013, 2014). We hope the project will lead to broader efforts to characterize the brain states correlated with maladaptive thoughts in a naturalistic setting, with possible use of this knowledge in the future to predict clinical response to treatment."
"9257954","Project summary Stem cells give rise to all tissues during development and are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis in adults. To divide, stem cells must replicate their contents, imposing a large requirement for nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. Therefore, most stem cells are programmed to respond to nutrient availability and dynamically adapt their rates of proliferation in response to nutrient flux. Emerging evidence indicates that stem cells typically rely on metabolic programs distinct from those used in other cell types in the same tissue. Misregulation of metabolic processes can uncouple cell proliferation from nutrient availability, and cancer cells frequently hijack cell growth programs to escape nutrient dependence. Therefore, precisely how stem cells restrain their proliferation in response to nutrient availability is a fundamental open question in stem cell biology with important implications for understanding the molecular basis of cancer. This project seeks to elucidate the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that couple stem cell proliferation with nutrient availability. Neural stem cells in the Drosophila central brain, termed neuroblasts, provide a unique system to study links between nutrition and stem cell proliferation as there two distinct subtypes that respond differently to nutrient availability despite sharing an extracellular environment. Moreover, systemic nutrient signaling to neuroblasts can be experimentally manipulated by varying larval diet. My preliminary data from this model indicates that a genetic program controlled by the Eyeless (Ey) transcription factor, homolog of mammalian Pax6, is both necessary and sufficient to drive nutrient-insensitive neuroblast proliferation. Other recent work has demonstrated that another transcription factor, Prospero (Pros), initiates developmental quiescence in some neuroblasts, but its role during nutrient restriction and its relationship to Ey are completely unknown. The first specific aim of this proposal will test the functional requirement for Pros in nutrient-induced neuroblast quiescence and determine if Pros activity is repressed by Ey in nutrient-insensitive neuroblasts. My preliminary data also suggest that nutrient-insensitive neuroblasts are metabolically distinct from those sensitive to nutrient restriction, both in the way nutrients are metabolized and how cellular growth signaling is maintained. The second aim seeks to better understand these differences and their contribution to nutrient-insensitive neuroblast proliferation by testing key biosynthetic pathways and cell-autonomous TOR cellular growth signaling for a functional role in nutrient-insensitive neuroblast proliferation. The results obtained from this project will lead to a better understanding of the ways in which nutritional demands are addressed in stem cells and indicate possible approaches to enhance stem cell therapies by modulating stem cell metabolism."
"9395342","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Training the next generation of HIV prevention scientists, skilled in the methods of multiple fields, and increasing the number of under-represented minority researchers are the long-term goals of the postdoctoral Traineeship in AIDS Prevention Studies (TAPS) at UCSF. Short-term goals are to build the skills of postdoctoral fellows to engage in research that: 1) combines biomedical, behavioral, and structural interventions to maximize impact, 2) eliminates racial/ethnic disparities in HIV in the US, and 3) develops novel prevention interventions. TAPS balances the behavioral and biomedical sides of prevention by training scientists newly minted in their respective fields in th disciplines of their co-postdoctoral fellows. TAPS is housed in UCSF's Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS), with close relationships to other institutions within the AIDS Research Institute umbrella. The program requires one-on-one mentorship with senior faculty; a master's degree in clinical or public health research; advanced courses in research methods and ethics; seminars and grand rounds; peer review and teaching; designing, grant writing, and implementing research projects; and submission of papers for publication. Since inception, TAPS has trained 109 fellows, while increasing URM scholars to 60% in the last five-year period; all transitioned to positions at universities conducting academic research and new discovery, health departments conducting implementation science research, and international organizations conducting policy research. Alumni in the last 10 years produced 580 publications and obtained 220 grants. Five-year renewal of TAPS will permit training of 2 to 3 new fellows per year who we envision will be poised to administer the coup de grace to the AIDS epidemic and carry on to address major future health issues in the US and worldwide."
"9239452","All eukaryotes use three essential DNA-dependent RNA polymerases to decode genetic information stored in DNA, namely RNA Polymerases I, II and III. Remarkably, plants have two more RNA polymerases, abbreviated as Pol IV and Pol V, that evolved from Pol II to specialize in the synthesis of RNAs that guide gene silencing, an important process in all living organisms for controlling retrotransposons, viruses or genes important for development. Pols IV and V are key to a complicated RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. The pathway is initiated by Pol IV, acting in partnership and physical association with a RNA- dependent RNA polymerase, RDR2 to transcribe DNA into short double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). These dsRNAs are then trimmed, from either end, by the DICER endonuclease, DCL3, yielding 24 nt short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The siRNAs, loaded into ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4), guide the siRNA-AGO complexes to sites of Pol V transcription, where they bind to Pol V transcripts as well as to the C-terminal domain of the Pol V largest subunit. The DNA methyltransferase, DRM2 (the ortholog of human DNMT3) is recruited, methylating cytosines within the Pol V-transcribed DNA. Resulting heterochromatin formation is refractive to transcription by Pols I, II or III. However, Pols IV and V are not repressed in this chromatin environment. Instead, helper proteins that recognize cytosine methylation or repressive histone modifications are thought to recruit Pols IV and V, taking the place of transcription factors and dispensing with conventional promoter elements.  There is much that we do not understand about the RdDM process. What unwinds DNA for Pols IV and V to gain access to template strands? How are Pol IV and RDR2 activities coupled for dsRNA synthesis? Where do Pol V transcripts begin and end, and how many siRNA-AGO complexes can bind them ? What do the presumed Pol IV and Pol V helper proteins actually do? By devising new biochemical assays combined with genetic, genomic and structural studies, our goal is to answer these questions in mechanistic detail.  In eukaryotes as diverse as humans, flies, worms and fission yeast, noncoding RNAs guide chromatin modifications important for centromere function, transposon silencing, X-chromosome inactivation or imprinting of paternal or maternal alleles. Of special relevance to our studies is the piRNA pathway that directs the silencing of transposons in the human germline, thereby serving the same purpose, and using the same DNA methylation machinery, as the RdDM pathway of plants. Controlled DNA methylation is critical, such that aberrant DNA methylation and chromatin modification is implicated in the pathology of Rett, ICF, Prader-Willi, Beckwith-Wiedemann and Fragile X syndromes, and in most forms of cancer. By understanding the biogenesis and targeting mechanisms of noncoding RNAs in DNA methylation and gene silencing, our studies will contribute new understanding of fundamental processes important for human development and disease."
"9379322","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Binge alcohol drinking, the most common form of excessive alcohol consumption, contributes to a host of long- term negative health consequences, including the development of alcohol dependence. Repeated episodes of binge drinking drive subsequent alcohol consumption, therefore characterizing the neural circuitry underlying this risky behavior is essential to the development of successful pharmacotherapeutic treatments for alcohol use disorders. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is critically involved in alcohol drinking and stress-induced relapse of drug seeking. The BNST is enriched with neurons that produce and release corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide that has also been shown to regulate these behaviors. However, the specific roles of BNST CRF neurons and their synaptic inputs in binge alcohol drinking have not been examined. I hypothesize that the activity of BNST CRF neurons drives binge alcohol drinking, and that repeated episodes of binge drinking dysregulate their function by enhancing the activity of glutamatergic neurons that directly modulate them. The goals of this proposal are 1) to characterize the roles of BNST CRF neurons and their glutamatergic inputs from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in alcohol drinking behavior, and 2) to examine how this neural circuit is altered by repeated cycles of binge drinking. During the K99 phase, I will be trained by Dr. Stuber in the use of in vivo optogenetics, and I will employ in vivo optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches to drive or inhibit the activity of CRF neurons in the BNST and evaluate alcohol drinking behaviors. During the R00 phase, I will use techniques that Dr. Kash has given me extensive training in, including neuronal tracing techniques and slice electrophysiology in combination with ex vivo optogenetics, to characterize and assess the strength of the PVT glutamatergic projection to BNST CRF neurons. Then, I will use in vivo optogenetics to evaluate the causal roles of these pathways in binge alcohol drinking. Finally, I will use ex vivo optogenetics, slice electrophysiology, and immunohistochemistry to examine the effects of repeated binge alcohol drinking on the intrinsic excitability of and synaptic function o BNST CRF neurons and glutamatergic neurons in the PVT that modulate them. Together, these studies will integrate my expertise in slice electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry with training in in vivo optogenetics essential to a making a successful transition to an independent research career. Experiments in this proposal will thoroughly characterize how crucial nodes of circuitry that regulate binge alcohol drinking are altered by repeated binge alcohol drinking, which may reveal pharmacotherapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorders."
