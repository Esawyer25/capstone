"9251775","The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) at Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) Is responsible for review of clinical cancer research protocols for scientific merit, ensuring prioritization of protocols based on scientific priorities and patient availability, allocating CCSG and institutional funds to support investigator-initiated trials and monitoring scientific progress. PRMS approval is required for all clinical cancer research studies at all MedStar hospitals. The function of the PRMS is independent ofthe role ofthe Institutional Review Board (IRB). Changes since the last submission include: 1) creation of a more robust cover sheet signed by the Disease Group Chair and PI that better documents prioritization of a specific trial relative to other trials and its importance to the disease and LCCC; 2) development of a Scientific Progress Review Subcommittee (SPRC), chaired by Michael Atkins, MD, Deputy Director, charged with monitoring scientific progress and accrual of all open interventional studies; 3) establishment of guidelines that encourage institutional studies be reviewed by the PRMS at the letter-of intent (LOI) stage with only approved LOIs developed into full protocols; 4) the Resource Allocation Committee for Investigator Initiated Trials (RACIIT) chaired by Bruce Cheson MD, has been reorganized as a subcommittee of the PRMS, with meetings every 6 months to review approved LOIs requesting CCSG funding and/or institutional support; 5) tightened administrative processes to ensure more complete minutes that include documentation of votes, conflicts of interest. Pi's response to all issues raised during PRMS review and accurate protocol versioning. While the focus ofthe PRMS is on institutional protocols, all clinical cancer studies (except for those involving healthy human subjects and/or population science studies deemed to be exempt by the Population Science Subcommittee of the PRMS) are reviewed by the PRMS. The PRMS comprises clinical Investigators from multiple MedStar Health hospitals, biostatisticians, basic scientists, population scientists, and translational researchers. Claudine Isaacs, MD, a medical oncologist and a breast cancer clinical investigator with a focus on treatment and prevention, has been Chair of the PRMS committee since 2006. Waddah Al-Refaie, MD, Chair of the Division of Surgical Oncology and a health services researcher assumed the vice-chair position in 2012. The PRMS reviewed and/or prioritized 190 clinical trials, including 34 institutional trials, over the past 3 years. In 2012, it deferred or disapproved 45% of newly submitted protocols, requiring further revision. In 2013 the SPRC performed an annual review and, based on this review, PRMS closed 16 protocols for lack of accrual or continued scientific relevance and recommended modification of 24 additional studies."
"9271241","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Together, pulmonary emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the third leading cause of death in the United States. Although often considered one disease, emphysema on computed tomography (CT) represents a distinct entity that is absent in some patients with COPD and present in some without COPD. The interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a class of non-infectious, non-malignant lung diseases characterized by alveolar injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. There are currently few medications available to stop the progression of these diseases, reflecting a limited understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. We recently completed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of percent emphysema and subclinical ILD on CT scan in ~7,600 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). The overall success of our GWAS efforts in identifying SNPs at genome-wide significance in or near SNRPF and PPT2 for percent emphysema, and ANRIL and D21S2088E for subclinical ILD traits reflect the notable quality of the pulmonary phenotypes in MESA. Still, GWAS approaches continue to face multiple limitations including (a) large multiple testing burden from considering millions of SNPs, and (b) lack of functional annotation to connect identified SNPs with specific genes. To address these and other limitations, we propose to apply a new gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates the imputed gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. The framework of PrediXcan opens the possibility to impute tissue-specific genome-wide gene expression levels for the MESA participants, thereby creating a population-based data set that combines both high quality phenotypes for percent emphysema on CT scan with whole blood and lung-specific gene expression levels. We expect that reduced multiple testing burden and increased functional relevance of gene expression traits obtained through PrediXcan will allow us to identify novel genes and pathways related to emphysema and ILD. Therefore, we propose to carry out transcriptome-wide studies of gene expression predictors for percent emphysema (Aim 1a) and subclinical ILD (Aim 1b) traits in MESA. We further use a model selection framework to identify combinations of genes underlying pathogenesis of emphysema and subclinical ILD in the general population (Aim 2). We have assembled a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary team of investigators representing expertise in statistical genetics (Manichaikul and Im), genetic epidemiology (Manichaikul and Rich), pulmonary epidemiology (Lederer and Barr), lung pathology (Borczuk) and systems genetics (Farber). Completion of the proposed Aims would result in improved understanding of predicted gene expression traits in relation to emphysema and ILD, leading to improved targeted prevention and treatment of these diseases."
"9256416","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Paget's Disease (PD) is the most exaggerated example of coupled bone remodeling with focal areas of increased bone resorption accompanied by exuberant new bone formation. The excessive new bone formation results in deposition of weak woven bone, which is responsible for many of the clinical sequelae of PD including bone deformity or fracture, skull thickening, bone pain and nerve root compression. Osteoclasts (OCLs) drive the increased bone formation, because treatments targeting OCLs decrease bone resorption and formation. However, the mechanisms responsible for the increased bone formation in PD are unknown. Genetic and environmental factors contribute to development of PD. The most frequent mutations linked to PD are in the SQSTM1/p62 gene, in particular p62P392L. Mice harboring germline p62P394L(p62 mice), the murine equivalent of human p62P392L, exhibit increased OCLs, but do not develop PD. OCLs from 70% of PD patients express the measles virus nucleocapsid protein (MVNP) gene, and transgenic mice with targeted expression of MVNP to OCLs (MVNP mice) develop OCLs and bone lesions characteristic of PD. Importantly, loss of IL-6 expression in MVNP mice blocked the pagetic OCL formation and increased bone formation in vivo. Thus, expression of environmental factors (e.g., MVNP) in OCLs is required for the development of characteristic bone abnormalities in PD. Recently, we found that MVNP but not p62P394L increases expression of the coupling factors ephrinB2 by OCLs and EphB4 on osteoblasts (OBs), which was mediated by IL-6. These results suggest that MVNP in OCLs induces coupling factors that increase OB activity. Further, MVNP induced expression of IGF1 by OCLs which may further increase bone formation. This proposal will assess the role of MVNP in the abnormal OB activity in PD by testing the hypothesis that MVNP increases OB activity in PD through induction of ephrinB2 on OCLs and EphB4 on OBs, in part through MVNP's up-regulation of IL-6 and IGF1 in OCLs. Thus, we will: 1) Test the hypothesis that MVNP's induction of ephrinB2 and IGF1 in OCLs and EphB4 in OBs increases OB activity. We will determine the effects of modulating ephrinB2/EphB4 and IGF1 levels/activity on the increased OB activity induced by MVNP. We will also determine if MVNP expression in OCLs from p62P392L PD patients increases ephrinB2 and IGF1 in OCLs and enhances their capacity to induce OB differentiation. 2) Test the hypothesis that IL-6 and IGF1 mediate the induction of ephrinB2 and EphB4 by MVNP. We will determine the mechanisms responsible for IL-6's induction of ephrinB2/ EphB4 by MVNP, and if IGF1 enhances ephrinB2 and/or IL-6 production by OCLs expressing MVNP or simply enhances OB activity via ephrinB2/EphB4. For these studies, we will use cells from MVNP, WT, IL-6-/- and MVNP and WT mice with knockdown of IL-6 or IGF1 in OCLs ex vivo. 3) Generate p62/MVNP mice with targeted deletion of ephrinB2 and/or IGF1 in OCLs and EphB4 in OBs to assess the roles of ephrinB2/EphB4 and IGF1 in the increased OB activity in PD."

"9402416","Abstract Exit from host cells is an essential step in the life cycle of intracellular pathogens including Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of human toxoplasmosis. Related malaria parasites also egress from host cells after replication, and they additionally traverse cells by escaping from a transient vacuole in a manner similar to egress. Recent work has identified critical roles for pore-forming proteins and phospholipases in cell egress and traversal. But how these proteins facilitate egress and the extent to which they collaborate to disrupt membranes is unknown. Also, although recent reports suggest that acidification of the parasite-containing vacuole augments activity of the pore-forming protein(s), the proton pumps mediating acidification have not been identified. Precisely how acidification facilitates pore-formation and egress is also unclear. The absence of such knowledge precludes rationale design of interference strategies to alter the course of infection and disease. We will address these key gaps by identifying the proton pump(s) responsible for vacuole acidification (Aim1), defining the structural basis for pH- augmented membrane binding by the pore-forming protein Perforin-Like Protein 1 (Aim 2), and measuring pH-dependent cooperativity between Perforin-Like Protein 1 and an LCAT phospholipase for membrane disruption during egress. The proposed studies will advance the field by delivering insight that is broadly relevant to egress by apicomplexan parasites and other cytolytic pathogens."
"9281002","Project Summary/Abstract: The US Surgeon General has declared pulmonary embolism (PE) a major national health problem, causing more deaths than breast, colon, and lung cancers. The current diagnostic standard for suspected PE is CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). However, the number of CTPA examinations is increasing dramatically, and incorrect CTPA interpretations are frequent in general practice (10-14% over/under-diagnosis). There is a clinical need to improve the efficiency and accuracy of PE diagnosis at CTPA. Our central hypothesis is that this clinical need can be addressed by exploiting computer-radiologist synergy. However, existing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods for PE have serious deficiencies: they are limited in sensitivity and specificity, incapable of handling PE over-diagnosis, and operating only at the embolus level?localizing individual emboli, but PE diagnosis is rendered at the patient-level?excluding non-PE patients and dispatching PE-patients to treatment. Therefore, our objective is to overcome these deficiencies with a new methodology. We have built a strong interdisciplinary team, developed an innovative prototype, and evaluated it through our pilot clinical studies, demonstrating outstanding performance. This proposed research has three specific aims: 1) boost our current system?s embolus-level performance with our newly proposed strategies, assisting radiologists in accurately localizing emboli and facilitating precision medicine through risk stratification; 2) achieve patient-level diagnosis through our newly developed algorithms, assisting radiologists in quickly excluding negative patients and improving diagnostic efficiency; and 3) demonstrate clinical benefits of our system by testing specific clinical hypotheses. This research is innovative because (1) our approach to embolus-level detection fundamentally differs from prior approaches in that it requires no vessel segmentation, overcoming their limitations; (2) we are pioneering two uncharted areas: PE patient-level diagnosis and over-diagnosis prevention; we do not perceive any similar objectives in existing NIH grants or publications in the literature; and (3) this project utilizes our original algorithms and will yield multiple novel algorithms. Our project is significant because it (1) addresses a major national health problem; (2) develops a new methodology that transcends the current paradigm from mere detection of emboli to simultaneous patient-level diagnosis, embolus-level detection, and over-diagnosis prevention, overcoming the deficiencies of the current PE CAD systems; and (3) delivers a next- generation, high-performance PE CAD system that quickly excludes non-PE patients, accurately localizes emboli, and actively prevent PE over-diagnosis, thereby enhancing radiologists? diagnostic capabilities and supporting precision medicine through risk stratification. Successful completion of the project is expected because (1) we have already made good progress in algorithm development and clinical evaluation; (2) our approach is carefully crafted on solid algorithmic and mathematical foundations; (3) our clinical evaluation is rigorously designed; and (4) our team is uniquely capable and well prepared to conduct this project, which builds upon our innovative research in CAD, pioneering research in deformable models, and world-renowned PIOPED trials. This research is expected to have important impact on PE- related clinical practice, development of decision support systems for many diseases, and medical education."
"9281457","This proposal is based on the novel finding that in addition to activating downstream components of the DNA damage response (DDR), the Mre11 complex-ATM arm of the DDR is required to activate a p53-dependent epigenetic program in response to oncogene activation. This pathway appears to parallel that governed by Ink4a-p19Arf. We will carry out quantitative analysis of the abundance and location of chromatin marks arising in response to the activation of neuT and c-myc, and assess changes in the expression of chromatin modifying enzymes in epithelial cells. To determine whether these responses are shared by hematopoietic cells, we will examine the same endpoints as well as the onset and progression of malignancy in p53-/- and Mre11ATLD1/ATLD1 bone marrow following introduction of c-myc or the Nup98-Hox9a cDNA. Finally, having defined these features of the p53-dependent epigenetic response to oncogene, we will identify enzymes that mediate this response and test the hypothesis that this p53-dependent function which requires DDR signaling is tumor suppressive. Collectively, the experiments proposed will illuminate a previously undescribed connection between p53 and the upstream components of the DDR that effects a barrier to oncogene-driven carcinogenesis. Therefore, this proposal is highly significant with the potential to provide novel mechanistic insight regarding tumor suppression by p53."
"9280283","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Project 1 In Conte Center Project 1, we will work to understand how cells of the central nervous system regulate the expression of complement and other immune proteins, and the extent to which this regulation is coupled to function and dysfunction at synapses. We will pursue these questions through experiments on clinical, post mortem, and biological samples. We will determine how the expression of C4A and C4B is regulated by allelic variation, cell type, and upstream biology (Aim 1). We will describe at single-cell resolution how diverse CNS cell types respond to synaptic dysfunction, utilizing the Drop-seq technology we developed to analyzed transcriptional responses in tens of thousands of individual cells (Aim 2). Finally, we will carefully evaluate cerebrospinal fluid as a potential reservoir of information about neural-immune interactions in the CNS (Aim 3). Through this work, we hope to better understand how neural-immune interactions play out through gene expression and may become visible in a clinical context."
"9256030","PROJECT SUMMARY. Mucus dysfunction underlies the pathophysiology of a number of common respiratory diseases including asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Asthma alone impacts 9% of the US population, resulting in considerable cost, morbidity, and occasional mortality caused by mucus hypersecretion. Recently, it was discovered that Synaptotagmin-2 (Syt2) regulates fast exocytosis of mucin granules in the lungs, and that Syt2 is limiting with respect to stimulated mucus secretion. These findings suggest that small-molecule inhibitors of Syt2 may comprise a new class of therapeutic agents allowing the clinical modulation of stimulated mucus secretion. We have developed a number of early lead inhibitors of Syt2, capable of inhibiting mucus secretion in airways of mice with IL-13-induced mucous metaplasia. These include Exo1, our early lead compound. Phase I studies will focus on the derivatization of the Exo1 compound, and success would advance a new drug class likely to improve quality-of-life for patients with a number of life threatening, chronic respiratory conditions including asthma, cystic fibrosis, and COPD. Phase II work would include formulation and delivery studies followed by pre-IND studies including GLP toxicology and animal efficacy studies in accordance with the most recent CDER guidance."

"9384435","PROJECT SUMMARY Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen found in acute infections (burns, wounds, ventilator associated pneumonia, eye infections) and chronic infections of the foot (diabetic ulcers) and lung (cystic fibrosis). This bacterium commonly survives in these contexts as a biofilm, the formation and high-level antibiotic tolerance of which interferes with effective patient treatment. A defining aspect of P. aeruginosa is its ability to make phenazines, colorful redox-active pigments that mediate a variety of processes, including survival within the anoxic interior of biofilms. Like biofilms, mucus collecting in the lungs of CF patients exhibits steep oxygen (O2) gradients. Over time, P. aeruginosa commonly dominates the microbial population in the CF lung, as its physiology permits it to thrive in this environment. As O2 declines, phenazines rise, and the concentration of certain phenazines, such as pyocyanin (PYO)?a virulence factor in animal infection models? is correlated with declining lung function. While how PYO is made and impacts diverse cell types (positively for the producer, and negatively for the host) is well understood, the potential impact of reducing PYO concentration for host-pathogen interactions is unknown. Recently, we discovered a novel PYO demethylase (PodA) made by members of the Mycobacterium fortuitum complex, which can infect CF patients. PodA converts PYO to 1-hydroxy-phenazine (1OHPHZ), and blocks biofilm formation and development. PYO is known to trigger eDNA release and promote biofilm formation, as well as sustain P. aeruginosa's anaerobic metabolism via a process called extracellular electron transfer (EET). In infections where PYO is abundant, we hypothesize that PodA might help control P. aeruginosa by inhibiting eDNA release and abrogating EET by converting PYO to 1OHPHZ. Here, we seek to gain a fundamental scientific understanding of PodA and its mechanism of anti-biofilm activity as a first step towards evaluating its therapeutic potential. First, how does PodA catalyze PYO demethylation? Second, what is the consequence of PYO removal and 1OHPHZ formation for P. aeruginosa? Third, might PodA activity potentiate the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics in controlling P. aeruginosa in slowly-growing, O2-limited biofilm regions? To answer these questions, we propose two specific aims. Aim 1 will explore the enzymatic activity and mechanism of action of the PodA enzyme in detail. Aim 2 will probe the mechanisms underpinning PodA's inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilm development at early and late stages, and whether it can sensitize P. aeruginosa to tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. Attainment of these objectives will lay the foundation of basic knowledge necessary to evaluate the potential usage of PodA as a therapeutic enzyme."
"9268763","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of early infant diagnosis (EID) is to identify HIV+ infants prior to the development of clinical disease to facilitate early initiation o ART and improve infant survival. Nearly 20% of Kenyan infants born to HIV+ mothers each year become infected (roughly 20,000). Without early diagnosis and ART over half of these HIV+ infants will die by the age of two years; however, early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation (before 12 weeks) can reduce the risk of mortality by 76%. In 2008 Kenyan National Policy was revised to include rapid initiation of pediatric ART to all infants confirmed HIV+ with PCR testing The current EID system, however, is hampered by significant structural barriers that contribute to late and sporadic testing of HIV exposed infants, lost or delayed test results from the laboratory, and the absence of a reliable system to notify mothers of test results or the need to return to the hospital. Consequently, only about one-third of HIV-exposed infants are retained in EID care until 18 months of age. The proposed study will evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of the HIV Infant Tracking System (HITSystem(c)), an online, intervention with automated alerts designed to overcome current EID barriers by prospectively tracking HIV-exposed infants, improving the communication of PCR results from laboratories to both clinics and mothers, and supporting existing networks to facilitate quality HIV pediatric care. This robust intervention allows clinicians, lab technicians, and program managers to track the time sensitive interventions of EID and ART programs in real-time through online entries which trigger action 'alerts' when time sensitive interventions are overdue for specific infants. A builtin text messaging system sends automated text messages to mothers' cell phones when test results are ready or follow up visits are needed. The ultimate goals of the HITSystem are to increase the number of HIV-exposed infants retained in EID services (until 18 months), and facilitate early ART initiation for infants diagnosed HIV+. Promising pilot data comparing pre (n=330) and post (n=460) HITSystem intervention data at two low resource hospitals in Kenya demonstrate acceptability and feasibility of implementing the system which led to highly significant improvements in EID retention (31% pre vs. 97% post), and ART initiation rates for infants diagnosed HIV+ (44% pre vs. 95% post)."
"9313353","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Project Summary Parkinson?s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. The etiology, mechanism and progression of pathology and its relationship to clinical manifestations is not fully understood. These factors, coupled with its insidious onset, clinical heterogeneity, overlap with dementias, and the variability in speed and pattern of symptom progression, make a rigorous characterization and prognosis of PD difficult. Recent bench research on the trans-neuronal ?prion-like? transmission of misfolded proteins is at last filling the gaps in the pathological context of PD, whereby misfolded alpha-synuclein protein can trigger misfolding in adjacent cells. If this spread mechanisms could be quantitatively modeled, it could enable accurate prediction of PD progression. This is the aim of our proposal. We will turn hitherto qualitative neuropathological insights into a rigorous ?network-diffusion? model of disease spread. The model will be fed baseline in vivo MRI of PD patients, and will produce a deterministic and testable prediction for PD progression and conversion to dementia. By explicitly incorporating the brain?s connectivity network, our model will quantify the role of the brain?s anatomic connectivity network in disease transmission. We are targeting various applications, including diagnostic imaging biomarker, prognostic tool for assessing likely future patterns of disease and future neurocognitive status including likelihood of conversion to dementia. Relevance Parkinson?s Disease is a debilitating and common age-related degenerative disorder. The proposed network model will yield a validated deterministic and predictive model for PD progression, with applications in prediction of a patient?s future atrophy patterns, neurocognitive and motor scores."
"9311552","Project Summary Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has low disease-free survival and limited therapeutic options. The only treatments for ccRCC have been elucidated as a result of mechanistic understanding of tumor suppression by VHL (von Hippel-Lindau), the most commonly mutated gene in ccRCC. After VHL, the second most commonly mutated gene in ccRCC patients is Polybromo-1 (PBRM1), a subunit of the SWI/SNF (or BAF for BRG1/BRM associated factors) chromatin remodeling complex, subunits of which are mutated in 20% of human cancers. PBRM1 is characterized by six sequential bromodomains proposed to bind acetylated lysines and is a subunit in a minor BAF subcomplex called PBAF (for Polybromo-1 BAF). The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism of PBRM1-mediated chromatin targeting of the PBAF complex and how that relates to downstream transcriptional regulation of genes important for tumor suppression in ccRCC. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that several of the six bromodomains of PBRM1 are required for multivalent targeting of the PBAF complex to multiple histone acetylation sites located at genomic regions important for the regulation of genes involved in cell adhesion and epithelial maintenance. In the proposed study we plan to 1) Use cellular assays and animal models to confirm and characterize PBRM1 as a tumor suppressor involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, 2) Define how PBRM1 status predicts therapeutic efficacy of established and proposed ccRCC drugs, 3) Identify genomic binding sites for PBRM1 in ccRCC and the transcriptional regulation by PBAF-mediated chromatin remodeling, and 4) Define the histone acetylation marks responsible for specific recruitment of PBRM1 and PBAF. The proposed study will greatly increase our understanding of the mechanisms involved in renal tumorigenesis and expand our understanding of the tumor suppressive mechanisms of BAF-mediated chromatin remodeling. It is our belief that this study will provide direct evidence of novel therapeutic targets for treating renal cancer."
"9308025","Summary  Glial activation and production of proinflammatory mediators contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Pre-clinical studies implicate microglia, the macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), as critical early regulators in the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. However, other studies indicate that microglial activation and the production of various proinflammatory factors play a beneficial role in nerve regeneration and functional recovery following nerve injury. Moreover, our preliminary studies show that similar to peripheral macrophages, spinal cord microglia exhibit a proinflammatory phenotype at early time points and an anti-inflammatory phenotype at later time points following spinal nerve L5 transection (L5Tx, a well-established murine model of neuropathic pain). We propose that these two microglial activation states correspond to unique sets of microglial functions. By optimally regulating microglial activation rather than completely inhibiting the activation of microglia, we can potentially limit the contribution of microglia to the development of neuropathic pain while simultaneously preserving the beneficial properties of microglia in nerve regeneration. We believe that CD137 ligand (CD137L) expressed on microglial surface acts in a proinflammatory manner and that negatively modulating CD137L can potentially shift the pro- vs. anti-inflammatory balance in activated microglia towards an anti- inflammatory state. However, most of the known functions of CD137L have been obtained from studies on peripheral immune cells. The role of CD137L in CNS microglia has not been studied extensively and the role of microglial CD137L in the development of neuropathic pain is unknown. In this study, we will determine the role of microglial CD137L in the pathophysiology of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain through the examination of two murine models of neuropathic pain. We hypothesize that microglial CD137L is involved in the development of peripheral nerve injury -induced pain-like behaviors and that negatively modulating CD137L can promote a shift in microglial activation towards an anti- inflammatory state and thus reduce peripheral nerve injury-induced pain-like behaviors. This central hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims: 1) Characterize the involvement of CD137L in peripheral nerve injury-induced pain-like behaviors. Pain-like behaviors will be tested in mice with and without CD137L expression. 2) Evaluate the activation status of spinal cord microglia following peripheral nerve injury in relation to the expression of microglial CD137L. Microglial activation will be monitored through assessing microglial phenotype via flow cytometry. And 3) determine the involvement of CD137-dependent vs. CD137- independent pathways in peripheral nerve injury-induced, CD137L-mediated pain-like behaviors and microglial responses. In sum, we believe that the investigation of CD137L could lead to novel treatment that could significantly reduce neuropathic pain while has minimal adverse impact on nerve recovery."
"9287498","Summary Dystroglycanopathies are a common and heterogeneous subset of muscular dystrophies associated with abnormal O-glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (?-DG). They are frequently caused by mutations in fukutin- related protein (FKRP), which encodes a putative Golgi-based glycosyltransferase, resulting in a broad spectrum of MD phenotypes; with most cases being classified as congenital MD type 1 (MDC1C) or limb-girdle MD type 2I (LGMD2I). In the case of LGMD2I, clinical presentation varies from severe early-onset to mild late- onset MD. The biochemical hallmark of FKRP-associated diseases is the hypoglycosylation of ?-DG, which results in dysfunction of this critical component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), and consequently leads to cell membrane damage and apoptosis of muscle cells, resulting in chronic tissue degeneration and impaired muscle contractility. Although no effective treatment is available at present for this or any other type of Dystroglycanopathy, one attractive therapeutic approach is to use cell based therapies to promote muscle regeneration. Because pluripotent stem cells can be expanded indefinitely, while maintaining differentiation potential, they represent an advantageous option for therapeutic application. In the case of muscular dystrophies, either allogeneic or autologous cell transplantations have the potential to lead to an effective treatment. For allogeneic transplantation, one would utilize iPS-derived myogenic progenitors obtained from a healthy HLA-matched donor, which following transplantation would give rise to new healthy myofibers. The autologous approach would require ex vivo genetic correction of dystrophic iPS cells prior to transplantation. Our group has pioneered methods to derive skeletal myogenic cells from mouse and human pluripotent ES /iPS cells through transient induction of Pax3 or Pax7 during early mesoderm development. Transplantation of these cells in mouse models for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), results in myofiber and satellite cell engraftment that is accompanied by improvement in muscle force generation. Here we propose to investigate for the first time a pluripotent stem cell-based therapy approach for muscle diseases associated with FKRP mutations. Exciting preliminary data, using a LGMD2I mouse model, reveal the ability of mouse pluripotent-derived myogenic progenitors to engraft the severely affected diaphragm of these mice upon systemic delivery. In Aim 1, we will investigate diaphragm engraftment in further detail. In Aim 2, we propose to establish gene editing tools to correct FKRP mutations of patient-specific iPS cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, which will be validated in vitro and in vivo. Finally, to begin laying the groundwork for clinical development of pluripotent stem cells for muscle diseases, in Aim 3 will focus on the scalability, purification, and safety of pluripotent-derived myogenic progenitors."
"9339774","Project Summary - Significant scientific advances were made in the last few years that contribute to better HIV prevention and treatment outcomes and increased cost-effectiveness but major challenges remain that could undermine the attainment of the global goal to end AIDS as a public health threat: Better treatment and vaccines remain an urgent challenge to address the HIV/TB epidemic. Much more is needed to effect scale up and optimize treatment strategies in high-burden regions. Globally challenges remain in reaching ambitious targets across the continuum of care. Concrete innovations are urgently needed to improve HIV testing and its uptake and to retain individuals successfully in life-long care. This is particularly evident in adolescent populations. IAS 2017 will contribute to addressing some of the continuing challenges in HIV prevention, treatment and care in a scientific program that will integrate innovative approaches, such as the active application of avant-garde technologies in basic science and implementation research, and precision medicine as a bridging theme. France?s key role in HIV science and the strong political will enabling a rapid translation of science into policy, along with the country?s strong links with countries in Africa and Asia, will be defining factors for a scientific conference program that will present latest science from across the globe and discuss its translation into a variety of specific epidemiological and policy contexts. IAS 2017, taking place in Paris on 23-26 July 2017, has an expected attendance of 6,000 to 7,000 delegates from more than 120 countries. The specific aims of IAS 2017 are to: 1. Accelerate basic science and innovation for the development of new prevention, treatment and care options; 2. Strengthen research towards remission off treatment and a vaccine; 3. Enhance knowledge transfer and sharing between HIV and co-infections, including tuberculosis, viral  hepatitis, malaria, and co-morbidities; 4. Strengthen the implementation science research agenda to address key barriers and challenges across the  HIV prevention and treatment cascades in a variety of epidemic scenarios; 5. Explore the links between HIV and human rights. The scientific program will consist of four tracks: Basic Science; Clinical Science; Prevention Science; Implementation Science. A symposium on HIV cure and cancer research with a further focus on therapeutic vaccines will be organized in conjunction with the conference. Cross-cutting aspects will be covered in plenary talks that also connect the scientific tracks with community and leadership perspectives; bridging sessions cut across at least two of the tracks to provide opportunities for multi-disciplinary dialogues. The participation of young researchers, basic scientists and researchers in related fields such as non-communicable diseases will be strengthened by active solicitation of relevant science and the provision of specific financial support."
"9276791","EPIGENETICS OF ARTERIOSCLEROSIS IN AFRICAN AMERICAN HYPERTENSIVE SIBSHIPS Arteriosclerosis (i.e., atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis) of the cardiac, cerebral, renal, and peripheral arteries leads to target organ damage and clinical sequelae such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, dementia, chronic kidney disease, and claudication. Variations in a large number of genes have recently been identified that influence susceptibility to arteriosclerosis and target organ damage, but the influence of epigenetics on these same traits has not been extensively studied. The Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study was initiated in 1995 to investigate the genetics of hypertension and its target organ complications in sibships to optimize both linkage and association approaches to identifying genomic mechanisms underlying arteriosclerosis. Our preliminary studies in GENOA African Americans demonstrate relationships between genomic DNA methylation profiles (at ~27,000 markers genome-wide) measured in peripheral blood leukocytes and inter-individual differences in age, risk factors for arteriosclerosis, and target organ damage. In this application, we propose to use new and existing DNA methylation data (Aims 1-3) plus existing transcriptomic profiling (Aim 4) as cost-effective methods of identifying and studying the relationship between variation in DNA methylation across the genome and arteriosclerosis in GENOA African American sibships that are at high risk of developing various types of target organ damage from hypertension."
"9271187","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic mutations in the pancreatic beta cell ATP-sensitive K (KATP) channel underlie congenital + hyperinsulinism (CHI), a disorder characterized by persistent insulin release despite severe hypoglycemia. Normally, the KATP channel acts as a gatekeeper for insulin secretion by coupling intracellular glucose metabolism to the beta cell membrane potential. In CHI, loss-of-function mutations result in either defective gating, such that channels are always closed, or defective trafficking, such that channels never reach the cell surface. The central objective of this proposal is to understand why mutations within certain regions of the KATP channel lead to defective trafficking. We have recently identified compounds that can correct these trafficking defects called pharmacological chaperones (PCs), and a second objective of this proposal is to understand the detailed mechanism of PC action on these mutant channels. Preliminary evidence shows that many of these trafficking-impaired channels are functional once rescued to the cell surface. Thus a third objective is to demonstrate that trafficking mutations do not impart any functional defect and then to establish the feasibility of using PCs as a potential treatment for CHI. This work is significant because i) we have little understanding of how trafficking mutations actually disrupt channel biogenesis to cause CHI; ii) very little is known about how PCs overcome trafficking defects; iii) there are very limited treatment options available for this disease. This work is bot basic and applied in that it attempts to understand how heteromeric ion channels assemble and are regulated physiologically and pharmacologically, but does so within the context of a relevant and challenging disease."
"9164290","Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancy. Novel treatment approaches directed against key oncogenic drivers and/or the use of a novel drug combinations to prevent/overcome platinum resistance are promising opportunities to combat this disease. Our lab has developed a strong interest in short-form Ron (sfRon) in the context of ovarian cancer pathogenesis. The sfRon is an alternative, N-terminally truncated, isoform of the Ron receptor tyrosine kinase that has been previously implicated in ovarian cancer progression. We made the striking and unexpected discovery that sfRon expression is necessary for development of carcinogen-driven ovarian tumors in mice. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that lack of sfRon completely protects mice from ovarian cancer. Our preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies support the role of sfRon as an important contributor to ovarian cancer. Importantly, our preliminary data using a large cohort of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC) patients revealed that significantly more patients in the cisplatin refractory/resistant group express high levels of Ron receptors (Ron and sfRon), compared to patients in the cisplatin sensitive group. We hypothesize that sfRon plays a central role in ovarian cancer pathogenesis, and that inhibition of sfRon may reduce or prevent tumor progression and cisplatin resistance.  In this proposal, we seek to investigate a new, potent anti-tumor therapeutic strategies with the potential to overcome resistance to platinum chemotherapy in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Specific Aim 1, we will use a panel of selected small molecule inhibitors to block sfRon signaling pathway and perform in vitro biological assays to unravel the underlying mechanism of sfRon-driven ovarian cancer progression. In addition, we will perform in vivo studies using ovarian cancer xenografts treated with sfRon pathway inhibitors to identify and optimize the best combinational treatment strategies that suppress ovarian tumor progression. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine which of the Ron isoforms is specifically associated with platinum resistance. To identify the best treatment regimens that sensitize ovarian cancer cells expressing sfRon to cisplatin, we will perform drug dose response assays using our carefully selected panel of small molecule inhibitors that target sfRon pathway in combination with cisplatin treatment. In Specific Aim 3, we will use a highly clinically relevant patient-derived high-grade serous ovarian cancer models to identify the most effective treatment strategies that inhibit tumor progression and sensitize cancer cells to cisplatin or prevent/delay acquisition of cisplatin resistance. Completion of this proposal will validate the role of sfRon in progression of ovarian cancer and provide a new promising therapy that has potential to benefit both chemotherapy-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer patients."
"9277726","TISSUE AND DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall objective of the Tissue and Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (TDAAC) is to support translational research at the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) by functioning as the primary fresh-frozen tissue acquisition and processing facility for human solid tissue and hematopoietic specimens. The broad, long-range objectives of TDAAC are to provide a gateway through which investigators involved in MCC investigator-initiated studies and clinical trials can acquire the human tissue samples required to support their research, to ensure the safeguard of sample acquisition for patient care, and to preserve the molecular integrity of the specimens. These objectives are met by leveraging a network of interdepartmental and informatics relationships within MCC and VCU Health. For each specimen, TDAAC collects and maintains the associated clinical and pathological annotation and provides this information under an anonymous honest broker system or for specific IRB-approved protocols. The cancer specimen acquisition process ensures that the primary purpose of the specimen for patient care is maintained and the quality of the specimen is optimal for biomedical research. TDAAC does not bank specimens from international sources or other biorepositories, and the specimens are not distributed without informed consent or IRB approval. The IRB-approved ?Tissue Acquisition System to Support Cancer Research? protocol allows TDAAC to collect and bank ?residual? specimens (ie, samples that are no longer needed for diagnostic purposes) arising from surgical specimens collected from standard patient care. Thus, all the fresh-frozen tissue specimens banked in our biorepository have a corresponding formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded counterpart in the Department of Pathology archives. Patients who sign the TDAAC informed consent documentation agree to have their residual fresh-frozen tissue banked by TDAAC and also agree to give access to their formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens for translational research. In addition, TDAAC banks hematopoietic specimens by cryopreserving mononuclear cells for future assays that may require primary cell culture. TDAAC is a jointly managed (MCC and VCU) resource and is directed by Catherine Dumur, PhD, and Michael Idowu, MD, with the support of 4.05 FTEs. The resource directors and staff provide consultative services for experimental design and data interpretation, and education to certify end-users in the use of the biospecimens. Standard hours for the facility are 8:00 AM until 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. The use of biospecimens and services is tracked and charged back. In CY2015, the TDAAC provided services and/or tissues for 28 MCC members, accounting for 72% of the total users of the resource. The services provided by TDAAC add significant value for MCC-member research by providing access to fresh-frozen specimens with associated annotation, as the specimens are not practically obtained through alternative vendors or would be cost prohibitive when obtained through an alternative vendor."
"9279238","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit is common, affecting almost 800,000 people each year. With survival improving over time, research on quality of life among ICU survivors and their family members has become increasingly important. This research has primarily focused on the negative experiences of these survivors and their family members, including long-term symptoms of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress that occur in patient survivors and their family members. In cancer and trauma survivors, studies have shown that individuals may respond with psychological adaptations that enable them to experience positive change in the context of their illness. A better understanding of the factors that define and influence patient and family psychological adaptations to the experience of acute respiratory failure, as well as the association between these adaptations and patient and family outcomes such as quality of life, will provide a novel opportunity to develop interventions to improve outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure and their family members. This application proposes to conduct a longitudinal cohort study of patients with acute respiratory failure and their family members to identify the contributing factors and outcomes associated with psychological adaptation including resilience, post-traumatic growth and benefit finding. We hypothesize that there will be characteristics of patients and family members, as well as processes of clinical care in the intensive care unit, that are associated with psychological adaptation after acute respiratory failure, and that enhanced psychological adaptation will be associated with improved long-term outcomes for both patients and their family members. The study aims to enroll 250 patients with acute respiratory failure and 250 family members, and will obtain in hospital assessments of demographics, psychosocial and behavioral characteristics of participants. Chart abstraction data will be used to record details of the patient's hospital stay. Patients and family members wil complete additional survey assessments 6 months after discharge. A subset of patients and family members will participate in in-depth qualitative interviews. The study had 3 specific aims: 1) To determine the patient characteristics that are associated with positive psychological adaptation in patient survivors of acute respiratory failure; 2) to determine the family characteristics and ICU processes of care that are associated with positive psychological adaptation in family members; and 3) to determine the association between patient and family psychological adaptation and patient and family long-term outcomes including quality of life, adverse psychological symptoms and healthcare utilization. This application offers an opportunity to expand the body of knowledge regarding patient and family quality of life after acute respiratory failure by identifying novel associations between psychosocial and behavioral characteristics, psychological adaptation, and long-term outcomes which will lead to development of interventions focused on improving outcomes for critically ill patients and their family members."
"9293615","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT New evidence from our studies demonstrates that specific P. acnes ribotypes, distinguished by unique 16S rDNA, may be associated with either healthy skin (ribotype PH) or acne (ribotype PA). We propose to investigate the nature of immune mechanisms by which ribotypes PH and PA induce Th1 vs. Th17-mediated responses. The P. acnes ribotypes PH and PA to be used in this study are the most prevalent and include three each of PH and PA strains that have been enriched in individuals with healthy skin or associated with the acne patient group. We will test our central hypothesis that that P. acnes ribotypes trigger T cells that mediate distinct immune responses, which either contribute to the pathogenesis of acne or lead to a protective mechanism. In Aim 1, we will use informatics, taking advantage of the publicly available skin database DermDB to gain insight into the mechanisms of T cell differentiation. Specifically, using RNAsequencing, we will derive gene signatures of PH and PA-activated innate immune cells, to identify the networks that determine T cell differentiation into functional Th1 and Th17 cell subsets. We will also determine the mechanism(s), including cytokine, by which PH and PA induce T cell differentiation. Although the P. acnes genome has been sequenced, virulence factors and specific ligand(s) that activate immune cells are not clear. We have previously demonstrated that the Toll like receptor-2 (TLR2) mediates the interaction between antigen presenting cells and P. acnes. The bacterial ligand(s) responsible for these interactions are potential therapeutic targets, but are currently unknown. In Aim 2, we propose to use biochemical and proteomic techniques to identify bacterial ligand(s) from PH and PA that lead to differential immune signatures identified in Aim 1, and using siRNA knockdown of specific pathogen recognition receptors (PRR), identify the PRRs that recognize PH and PA to induce the innate cytokines that instruct adaptive immunity. The data generated in Aim 2 will help in the identification of PH and PA ligand(s) that interact with innate PRRs, and provide new insights into the immunobiology of Th1 and Th17 cells. In Aim 3, we will identify the phenotype and function of Th1 vs. Th17 cells induced by P. acnes ribotypes PH and PA. Using the informatics approaches outlined in Aim 1 we have identified IL-26 within the potential new Th17 gene networks. A previously unknown function of Th17- derived IL-26 as a direct antimicrobial agent and activator of DNA-sensing innate immunity was recently reported. Here, we will determine the antimicrobial mechanisms of encoded proteins against P. acnes including IL-26 in in vitro CFU assays, and determine the frequency of IL-26 expressing cells in acne skin specimens by immunohistology. Our investigations of the mechanisms by which distinct ribotypes of a commensal bacterium trigger divergent immune responses will have broad applicability to understanding microbiome-host immune response interactions as well as identify novel targets for immunological intervention. Overall, the K01 training program will allow me to develop the skills and tools needed to become a successful independent investigator."
"9480128","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV continues to spread around the world and new infections in Asia are one of the most important areas for prevention among drug using populations.    There  is  strong  and  consistent  evidence  from  several  countries  that  while injection  drug  users  (IDU)  continue  to  be  a  source  of  new  infections,  treatment of opiae addiction is an effective prevention measure against further spread.  Among those IDU already infected, substance abuse treatment can improve access and adherence to HAART therapy and promote sustained viral suppression.  The proposed project will take place at the Go Vap HIV clinic in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam.  Vietnam is an original PEPFAR country and has experienced a major HIV epidemic that has been propelled by injection drug use.   In HCMC, it is now estimated that 51.8% of injection drug users (IDU) are HIV positive.  While the country has begun the scale up of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), coverage remains inadequate and the rate of expansion of new treatment programs clearly needs to be accelerated in order to have meaningful impact on the epidemic.  For heroin (and other opiate) dependent individuals, methadone maintenance has limited  availability  and  there  are  currently  no  buprenorphine/naloxone  (Suboxone)  treatment  programs  in  Vietnam.    This  newer  medication  has  the  possibility  of  making  treatment  available  to  more  patients  because of the efficiency of three times per week dosing and, given the high prevalence of HIV among  drug users in HCMC, fewer interactions with antiretroviral medications.  These factors motivated the Provincial AIDS Committee of HCMC to seek support in expanding drug treatment to both HIV positive and negative IDUs as a model prevention program.  These discussions have led to the current proposal that will begin with the implementation of a comprehensive training program on addiction and medication assisted treatment (MAT).  Following this training the program will introduce MMT at the Go Vap clinic.  In the second year, daily methadone will continue to be available and selected patients will be given the opportunity to be treated with Suboxone progressing from daily to thrice weekly observed treatment.  All participants also will be engaged in behavioral drug and risk counseling. During the course of the project we project enrolling 300 IDUs (150 HIV + and 150 HIV-) into MAT treatment program co-located with the Go VAP clinic.   We are not proposing a comparison between methadone and Suboxone.  Both are safe and effective medications.    We will demonstrate feasibility and evaluate participant, clinic, and community factors that promote or inhibit program implementation.  We will measure costs and identify factors that are associated with treatment success for each medication and for positive and negative participants.  Importantly,  the  program  is  being  implemented  in  partnership  with  the  Provincial  AIDS  Committee of HCMC and will contribute to their goal of expanding access to both drug abuse and HIV  treatment."
"9363011","Malaria is a blood-borne disease caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which causes more than a half million deaths per year. The life cycle alternates between a mosquito and a human stage; in the latter stage merozoites invade red blood cells, a process that occurs in seconds. Invasion into and egress from an infected host cell are powered by a multi-protein assembly called the glideosome, the core of which is the class XIV myosin motor PfMyoA, making it a primary target against malaria. This motor is anchored via its light chain subunit MTIP (myosin tail interacting protein) to integral membrane proteins in a double-membraned flattened complex called the inner membrane complex (IMC), which lies ~25nm below the plasma membrane. The Plasmodium actin isoform (PfAct1) that interacts with PfMyoA is quite divergent in sequence from, and much more dynamic than, muscle actin. Despite the importance of the parasite motor, knowledge of its structure, function, and regulation has been limited primarily because PfMyoA to date has not been expressed in a heterologous system. The Trybus laboratory has, however, recently discovered how to express milligram quantities of this motor using the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. They have also expressed Plasmodium actin, which allows actomyosin interactions to be studied with native isoforms. The Plasmodium motor and actin will be characterized by a combination of state-of-the-art biochemical, biophysical, and high resolution structural biological techniques. This is a multiple PI R01 grant: Trybus (protein expression, biochemical/biophysical assays of Plasmodium myosin and actin, University of Vermont), Anne Houdusse (crystallography, Institute Curie) and Dorit Hanein and Niels Volkmann (high resolution cryo- electron microscopy and image reconstruction, Sanford Burnham Prebys Institute). In Aim 1 we will determine how PfMyoA motor activity is regulated in the glideosome, and the mechanism by which small molecules inhibit activity. Unloaded and loaded ensemble in vitro motility assays and transient kinetics will be used to assess function. The goal of Aim 2 is to crystallize the Plasmodium falciparum class XIV myosin for structure-function studies, and to determine the site of binding of small molecule inhibitors. Aim 3 seeks to understand how the unique properties of Plasmodium actin and its interaction with Plasmodium actin-binding proteins regulate actin dynamics and affect its ability to interact with PfMyoA. In Aim 4 we will determine the structure of Plasmodium actin filaments, alone or decorated with PfMyoA, at 5Å resolution or better by high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy. Taken together, these studies will establish the molecular basis for Plasmodium glideosome activity."
"9307343","Project Summary A key goal of modern-day medicine is to use our knowledge of the unique genetic makeup of an individual patient to make personalized therapeutic decisions. For chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the advances in our knowledge of its disease genetics as well as the adoption of novel therapeutic agents in clinical practice have been rapid over recent years. Thus, the need now is ever more urgent to match patients with the appropriate therapeutic choice. Given the wealth of available human genetic data in CLL and our understanding of its genetic heterogeneity, our vision is that the path to precision medicine can be trail-blazed with CLL. Critical to this vision is the development of faithful animal models, since these would undoubtedly accelerate the preclinical testing of agents against genetically-defined subgroups. Herein, we propose leveraging the entirety of CLL genomics data, including genetic to methylation studies, to rationally create mouse models that provide the full range of genetic variability in order to recapitulate the clinical variability of patients. This goal is implementable because we recently demonstrated that the combined expression of 2 putative CLL driver events, identified from unbiased sequencing of patient samples, generates CLL-like disease that is highly faithful to the human disease. Specifically, co-expression of mutated Sf3b1 with Atm deletion (significantly associated together in patient samples) resulted in the development of clonal pathognomonic CD19+CD5+ B cells in blood, marrow and spleen at low penetrance in aged (18 months) mice, that can be propagated by in vivo passaging. With this work as a foundation, we now propose to investigate the hypothesis that distinct evolutionary paths are undertaken in CLL depending on the starting points of disease and that specific combinations of genetic events function to initiate malignancy, while others are critical for disease acceleration and even oncogenic transformation. To achieve this goal, we propose to leverage recently available facile genome-editing approaches, and a robust workflow we optimized to genetically manipulate mature B cells through engraftment of genome-edited B cell progenitor cells, in order to nimbly screen the functional impact of a variety of candidate driver mutations within a B cell context in vivo. We aim to identify the stepwise events required to initiate disease from normal B cells to a state of indolent malignancy (Aim 1), from indolent malignancy to more progressive disease (Aim 2), and even to aggressive lymphoma transformation (Aim 3). Generating such animal models is expected to provide an invaluable resource which will enable deep understanding of the functional impact of driver alterations, to accelerate disease prognostication, to facilitate rational evaluation of novel and combinatorial therapeutics, and to dissect the interaction of CLL cells with their in vivo microenvironment. Thus, we seek to create the same genetic heterogeneity in mice as in CLL patients so that we can faithfully model disease and provide a means to test therapeutics in advance?a stepping stone towards achieving precision medicine."
"9223553","PROJECT SUMMARY Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-organ rheumatologic disease characterized by immune dysregulation and a heterogeneous disease course, with heightened disease severity in pediatric patients. Conventional clinical and laboratory parameters are not sufficiently sensitive or specific for detecting ongoing disease activity or response to specific immunomodulators, underscoring a need to better delineate the underlying immune changes that drive unpredictable flare-ups of disease activity. The lack of knowledge regarding the precise immune cellular and molecular events leading to SLE disease poses a significant hurdle in the effort to develop accurate prognostic disease biomarkers and selective therapeutic agents. Our long- term goal is to identify immune cellular and molecular mediators that could provide targets for therapeutic intervention. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which serum-circulating factors including exosomes modulate immune cellular and cytokine derangements in pediatric SLE pathogenesis. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding these mechanisms could identify novel disease biomarkers that permit accurate prognosis and provide selective therapeutic targets. To achieve this goal, Dr. Hsieh will use a high-dimensional mass cytometry platform, which offers single-cell analysis of over 40 parameters, utilizing rare earth metal isotopes instead of fluorophores as tags bound to antibodies. In a pilot study, Dr. Hsieh established a quantitative and reproducible mass cytometry assay that allows precise monitoring of phenotypic (surface markers) and functional (cytokines/chemokines) immune derangements detectable in peripheral blood of pediatric SLE patients. The data from this study form the basis of Dr. Hsieh's central hypothesis that pediatric SLE patients share a unique multi-parametric monocyte cytokine signature, which drives disease activity and is propagated by serum factors (including exosomes) through activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the association of the cytokine signature (and other immune changes) with SLE disease activity, by integrating mass cytometry immune profile data and clinical parameters from a prospective longitudinal pediatric SLE patient cohort; 2) Elucidate immunomodulatory properties of SLE serum-isolated exosomes, by evaluating the ability of diseased serum exosomes to induce the cytokine signature, and identifying exosome proteomic components essential for such activity; and 3) Determine the capacity of ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) to abrogate expression of the cytokine signature, by evaluating ex vivo immunosuppressive effects (including off-target effects) of ruxolitinib on immune derangements observed in pediatric SLE pathogenesis. Dr. Hsieh is an Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado Denver/Children's Hospital Colorado in the Departments of Immunology and Microbiology, and Pediatrics. As a clinical fellow, she trained in Dr. Garry Nolan's laboratory (Stanford), acknowledged as world-class in the application of mass cytometry to single-cell analysis, where she acquired expertise in this technology. Dr. Hsieh has assembled a mentoring team composed of a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in basic science immunology, particularly immune signaling alterations in autoimmunity; clinical study design and implementation; exosome biology; and biostatistics. Her primary mentor Dr. John Cambier and co-mentor Dr. V. Michael Holers are well- established scientists with collaborations focused on autoimmune disorders and the immune system. Their extensive experience with trainees will be complemented by the expertise of her scientific advisory committee, co-mentor Dr. Michael Graner, internationally known expert in the field of exosome biology, advisors/collaborators Dr. Jennifer Soep, pediatric rheumatologist with a clinical research focus on SLE, and Dr. Debashis Ghosh, Chairman of Biostatistics with expertise on high-throughput data analysis. Collectively, this team will provide an outstanding training environment that will fill critical gaps in her toolbox and knowledge base to enhance her ability to study immune derangements in pediatric SLE patients. Dr. Hsieh has created a career development plan that will prepare her for successful transition to independence, incorporating didactic and mentored training in: 1) basic science immunology; 2) clinical study design and implementation; 3) exosome biology; and 4) biostatistics and computational biology. The proposed approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it departs from the status quo by elucidating specific mechanisms underlying inflammatory perturbations in SLE (e.g., serum exosome-mediated immune modulation) and by characterizing these mechanisms as they occur in the context of multiple immune cell phenotypes, intracellular cytokine networks, and remitting/relapsing disease activity, with single-cell level resolution. The proposed research is significant because it will likely identify candidate disease biomarkers for prognostic and therapeutic purposes in SLE, and will likely delineate novel therapeutic targets derived from serum exosomes and their proteomic components. The knowledge gained will have broad translational importance through application of this systems immunology approach to other systemic rheumatologic disorders."
"9479824","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV incidence and mortality decreased globally, yet increased markedly in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) of Eastern Europe and Central Asia where HIV epidemics remain volatile and fueled primarily by people who inject drugs (PWIDs) with opioid use disorders (OUDs). Regional drug policies favoring incarceration have resulted in 5 CIS countries being among the 10 countries with the highest rate of incarceration. In this region, HIV is concentrated 18- to 50-fold higher than in communities. Data from multiple settings where PWIDs and people living with HIV (PLH) are concentrated (i.e., prisons) reveal that such structured settings can be effective sites for HIV prevention. In the absence of preventive evidence-based interventions (EBIs), prisoners often engage in risky HIV behaviors both within prison and post-release. One of the most effective HIV prevention EBI is opioid substitution therapy (OST), but this EBI is mostly absent from or markedly under-scaled in CIS prisons. We have successfully completed and exceeded our original 3 aims. First, we created a new research collaboration called PRIDE (Prison-related Research, Intervention Development and Evaluation), which focuses on integrating research and policy with Prison Departments and local and international stakeholders in CIS countries. Second, we exceeded the number of biosurveillance prison surveys conducted and established a new method that is now endorsed by CDC, WHO and UNODC. We documented the extraordinary burden of HIV, other infectious diseases and substance use disorders, and community-transition challenges and recorded the highest recorded rate of within-prison drug injection among HIV+ prisoners. Third, we uncovered markedly negative attitudes toward OST, PWIDs and PLH among prison personnel, which was mediated by provision of accurate knowledge and could be improved using a brief intervention that we adapted from social marketing and decision science strategies. Fourth, we assisted with introducing pilot OST programs in two CIS countries. Last, because none of the countries had transitional care programs, including the ones where we introduced OST, we began the process of developing a MATLINK protocol (linkage to OST), that is based on another EBI - SBIRT (screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment). Findings presented to local and PRIDE stakeholders resulted in the request by several member countries to focus on either introducing or expanding OST within prisons, an EBI, or where local laws, policy or cultures were uncommitted, all PRIDE stakeholders stated their commitment to linking prisoners to OST post-release. This renewal application builds on our existing implementation science framework where we propose a series of related activities that involve improving access to OST either within prison and/or linking them to it post-release.

"9396424","Project Summary The cochlea is the organ in the auditory system responsible for the detection of sound. It houses a spiral- shaped sensory epithelium containing mechanosensory hair cells that transduce sound waves into neuronal signals. This sensory epithelium is tonotopically organized such that it detects high frequency sounds at the base of the spiral and low frequency sounds at the apex. The tonotopic specializations include a graded increase in hair cell size from the base to the apex, as well as graded changes in the electrophysiological properties of hair cells and neurons. However, the extrinsic and intrinsic factors controlling cochlear tonotopic specialization are largely unknown. The main aim of this proposal is to characterize the role of the LIN28B/let-7 axis in tonotopic specialization of auditory hair cells. The pro-growth RNA-binding protein LIN28B and the functionally opposing let-7 family of miRNAs regulate the expression of hundreds of genes, including genes involved in metabolism and cell growth. We have previously shown that LIN28B and let-7 miRNAs are expressed in opposing gradients that inform sensory progenitor cell cycle exit and hair cell differentiation. Our preliminary data show that during cochlear maturation, let-7 is highly expressed in basal outer hair cells, whereas pro-growth let-7 target genes are expressed in apical outer hair cells. Based on these findings we hypothesize that the basal-apical gradient of let-7 miRNA instructs the development of cochlear tonotopic specialization, specifically tonotopic differences in hair cell size and hair cell- specific gene expression. The development of tonotopic specialization in the mouse cochlea has not been well characterized, but it is thought that tonotopic changes start to become evident around the onset of hearing (P11). In aim 1, we propose to establish when tonotopic differences in hair cell/stereocilia size arise in the murine cochlea, by analyzing these features prior (P7), during (P14) and after the onset of hearing (P21, P30 and P60). In addition, we will characterize markers for tonotopic specialization in the murine cochlea. In aim 2, we will use existing transgenic mouse lines to abolish the gradient of let-7 miRNA in the maturing cochlea (P1- P12). At P30, we will assess the effects of these manipulations on frequency-specific hearing, as well as the tonotopic specializations of hair cells. We predict that LIN28B overexpression will produce a more `apical' identity of hair cells and functional deficits in high frequency hearing. Conversely, let-7g overexpression will lead to loss of `apical' hair cell identity and deficits in low frequency hearing. Our findings will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating tonotopic identity of hair cells. This will benefit efforts in hair cell regeneration therapies, as generating appropriately specialized hair cells along the cochlea will be critical to the perception of meaningful sound."
"9281513","PROJECT SUMMARY Ewing Sarcoma (EWS) is the second most common primary bone cancer and a deadly threat to US children and adolescents. Despite great efforts over the last few decades, early detection of pediatric EWS is still challenging for standard imaging and cytogenetic modalities and very little improvement in long-term survival of EWS has been achieved. Patients initially presenting without clinically overt metastases at diagnosis have a 5- year overall survival of 70-75%; in contrast, the 5-year overall survival for metastatic EWS is below 30% due to high prevalence of disease recurrence/relapse. The long-term survival is 22% to 24% for patients with limited localized relapse and even lower for distant relapse. Tissue biopsy for pathological or cytological diagnosis and monitoring of EWS is extremely invasive and difficult, especially in young children. The lack of reliable blood biomarkers presents a serious obstacle to the treatment and management of EWS, more importantly, recurrent or metastatic EWS. Thus novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed to improve clinical outcome of this deadly pediatric cancer. Circulating exosomes are emerging as a new paradigm of ?liquid biopsy? for non-invasive cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles of 30-150 nm in size secreted by most cells. Growing evidence has shown important biological roles and clinical relevance of exosomes. In various cancers, tumor-derived exosomes have been found to be accumulated in human biofluids, such as blood, and enriched with a set of biomolecules from the cells of origin, such as proteins and RNAs, which may constitute a ?cancer signature?. However, biology and clinical value of exosomes remain largely unknown, due in part to the challenges in isolation and analysis of such small, dynamic and molecularly diverse vesicles. Very few, if any, exosome studies in EWS have been reported. To address this obvious gap in both analytical technologies and the precision medicine for EWS, we propose to develop and validate the nanotechnology-inspired, integrated microfluidic platforms that offer unprecedented analytical capabilities for measuring protein and mRNA markers in circulating exosomes derived from EWS. These new technologies will be validated to profile circulating exosomes in a unique longitudinal series of blood samples from pediatric EWS patients at initial diagnosis, during therapy and off therapy, aiming to identify exosomal markers that can track therapeutic response and detect early disease recurrence. While designed to specifically target EWS as proof-of-principle, this project will ultimately provide transformative platform technologies for basic and clinical investigation of a wide range of malignancies and diseases."
"9293362","Therapies for occlusive arterial disease (vein and prosthetic bypasses, angioplasties, stents, endarterectomies, etc.) suffer from unacceptably high failure rates due to re-occlusive vascular wall adaptations, with intimal hyperplasia dominating most failures. Humans have evolved complex mechanisms to respond to and heal from stress such as vascular trauma. Dietary intake and patterns during these evolutionary pressures were quite different than the constant high protein intake of contemporary Western diets. Dietary restriction (reduced food intake without malnutrition) is known for extending longevity in multiple species. Recent published work by us and others has shown that brief dietary protein restriction (DPR) alone is also an approach to positively impact metabolic fitness and resistance to multiple forms of acute stress, including the vascular response to injury in arteries as well as vein grafts. We broadly theorize that adipose?a dominant, highly biologically active yet nimble tissue?can be pre-conditioned by short-term DPR to positively impact vein graft wall adaptations via specific signaling networks.  Herein we test the hypothesis that short-term DPR attenuates vein graft intimal hyperplasia via the nutrient sensor molecule mTORC1 and leptin dependent mechanisms in the stromal vascular fraction of local adipose tissue. The project will complete three Specific Aims: 1) Delineate over time the impact of short-term DPR on specific compartments of adipose and vein graft wall intimal hyperplasia and remodeling. 2) Define adipose mTORC1 dependent mechanisms of DPR as they relate to vein graft wall intimal hyperplasia and wall remodeling 3) Determine the role of leptin signaling in DPR attenuation of the vein graft wall adaptations.  This work builds on a foundation of multiple peer reviewed publications by the applicant, and established partnerships with experts in nutrition and vascular biology. Completion of these aims will uncover novel mechanistic links between pre-operative DPR, proinflammatory adipokine/cytokine secretion, the mTORC1 /leptin signaling pathways, and their links with early vein graft adaptations. These findings should be translatable to clinical practice as mechanistically informed, targeted adjunctive nutritional and medical therapies to prolong the durability of occlusive vascular disease interventions."
"9443791","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our research is to understand the molecular mechanisms that control centrosome biogenesis. Centrosomes are microtubule-nucleating organelles that play a central role in most microtubule- related functions, including cell motility, intracellular transport and chromosome segregation. In addition, the centrosome forms the basis of the basal body, which is required for the formation of cilia and flagella, and i therefore crucial for cells to both sense their environment and transduce signals. Centrosomes are present as a single copy at the beginning of the cycle and duplicate once during S phase to ensure only two copies are present to organize the poles of the mitotic spindle. Abnormalities in centrosome number are commonly observed in human cancer cells, where extra centrosomes lead to chromosome segregation errors that are thought to drive tumor formation. Understanding the mechanism by which cells achieve the once per cycle duplication of the centrosome is therefore an important fundamental question of considerable relevance to human health. Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) has emerged as the central, dose-dependent regulator of centrosome duplication. Suppressing Plk4 inhibits centrosome duplication, while Plk4 overexpression leads to the production of too many centrosomes. However, we understand little about how this kinase functions; and in particular, the critical Plk4 targets that control centrosome biogenesis remain to be identified. Our proposed research seeks to establish the mechanisms through which Plk4 orchestrates and coordinates centrosome biogenesis. Previous efforts to study Plk4 have been hampered because tools to specifically and rapidly manipulate Plk4 function have not been available. In this application we have overcome this limitation by developing two complementary methodologies that allow us to regulate Plk4 levels and activity in living cells. Using these tools we will establish the direct effect of altering Plk4 levels/actiity and distinguish between kinase-dependent and scaffolding functions of Plk4 in centrosome biogenesis. In Aim 1, we will study the effect of rapid loss/inhibition of Plk4 on cell growth and centrosome structure. In our preliminary data we have identified a highly conserved centrosome protein as a key Plk4 substrate required for centrosome duplication. In Aim 2, we propose to characterize how Plk4-mediated phosphorylation of this substrate contributes to centrosome assembly. These studies are relevant for understanding the normal regulation of centrosome assembly and for furthering ongoing efforts to target Plk4 in cancer therapy."
"9256548","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary RNA regulatory networks in motor neuron development and function Post-transcriptional regulation at the RNA level, such as alternative splicing, plays a critical role in generating of the cellular and functional complexityof mammalian nerve cells during neuronal development. This regulation is dictated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interacting with their target transcripts, thereby profoundly affecting the output of the transcriptome. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the organizational principles of these RNA regulatory networks and their functional impact on neuronal development at the systems level. Despite very significant progress made over the past few years, current efforts to dissect neuronal RNA regulatory networks are facing two major challenges: i) cellular heterogeneity of the brain tissue used as a major source of material for genomic and biochemical analysis of regulatory networks, and ii) difficulty and inefficiency of simultaneous perturbation of multiple regulators important for functional evaluation of the discovered networks. Both challenges are reflected in studies of the Rbfox RBP family, in which the three functionally redundant members Rbfox1 (A2bp1), Rbfox2 (Rbm9) and Rbfox3 (NeuN) are preferentially expressed in many types post-mitotic neurons and are believed to regulate a large set of important neuronal transcripts. So far, only a small number of Rbfox target transcripts have been validated in physiological contexts and the function of Rbfox proteins or their targets in specific neuronal cell types is poorly understood. In this proposal, we will particularly focus on motor neurons, which are the nerve cells required for muscle contraction and movement and are lost in several fatal neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that a concerted action of Rbfox proteins is critical for motor neuron development and function. To test this hypothesis, we will employ, in parallel, an in vitro but physiologically relevant stem cell differentiation system and an in vivo mouse model, in which various combinations of Rbfox family members are depleted in motor neurons as a means of elucidating their cell type-specific function at the molecular and cellular levels. The target networks directly regulated by different Rbfox family members will be defined by comparative analysis of genome-wide, high-resolution profiling of cell type-specific transcriptomes, unbiased maps of protein-RNA interactions, and integrative modeling of multiple modalities of data generated by these genomic and biochemical assays. Functional validation of a select subset of Rbfox targets will be performed to establish the link between splice variants and specific aspects of neuronal developments. Results from our studies will not only provide novel insights into the function of neuronal RBPs in motor neuron biology and the underlying molecular mechanisms, but also have the potential to expand our understanding in the consequence of disrupted RNA metabolism in motor neuron diseases."
"9353004","PROJECT SUMMARY ? OVERALL HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain very prevalent, even among aviremic HIV+ individuals treated with CART. In the era of CART, the prevalence of HAND in HIV+ individuals with advanced infection remains around 40-50% [1, 2], and HAND may now be the most common form of young-age neurocognitive impairment globally [1]. Currently there are no uniformly accepted clinical, neuroimaging, or laboratory outcome measures for clinical trials for the treatment of HAND. HIV-related neuroscience research at Johns Hopkins University has focused on this challenging problem, exploring critical pathogenic mechanisms for neurological damage. Despite tremendous efforts to understand the mechanisms underlying the persistence of HAND, no definitive adjunctive therapeutics have yet entered clinical practice. There is also an unfilled need to develop surrogate markers and more robust and simpler screening instruments for HAND, to allow for earlier detection, for tracking of the course of HAND, and improving the efficiency of clinical trials. Until the NIMH Center was established at JHU collaborations had been limited by the lack of a central organizing structure for this type of research, and limited resources to facilitate cross-disciplinary and translational research. The JHU NIMH Center has addressed these needs over the past 11 years and has provided a resource to catalyze interdisciplinary research in HIV neuroscience, with the aim of leading to new therapies. Accomplishments of the Center are highlighted in the Overall Strategy section and in each individual core, and the key accomplishment is our proven ability to move HAND therapeutics from the discovery phase, through animal models, and on to clinical trials, with the ultimate goal of shifting clinical practice."
"9267507","Project 1 will investigate the regulation of inflammation and lipid homeostasis in the context of macrophage foam cell formation and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. These studies will leverage our recent discovery that desmosterol, an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, unexpectedly plays a key role in integration of the homeostatic response to excess cholesterol by activating LXR target genes required for cholesterol efflux, suppressing SREBP target genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, and inhibiting inflammatory responses by LXR-dependent and independent mechanisms. These findings have a number of unanticipated implications for understanding the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and suggest new therapeutic approaches. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that de-compensation of cholesterol homeostasis and 'expression of genes that amplify inflammatory responses in macrophage foam cells results from extrinsic, pro-inflammatory signals that are generated in the artery wall and induce TLR signaling. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that in addition to serving as TLR-induced transcriptional activators of inflammatory-response genes, NFKB and IRF3 mediate TLR? dependent suppression of LXRs. Delineation of the mechanisms by which NFKB and IRF3 inhibit the lipid homeostatic and anti-inflammatory activities of LXRs may suggest new approaches for therapeutic  intervention. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that increasing endogenous levels of  desmosterol or mimicking its activities will promote sterol excretion and inhibit the development of atherosclerosis. Conventional LXR ligands promote cholesterol efflux and inhibit atherosclerosis in mice, but are not useful drugs because they induce the expression of SREBP1c and cause marked hypertriglyceridemia. In contrast, desmosterol activates LXRs but suppresses SREBP processing. In this aim, we will investigate whether treatment with a putative desmosterol mimetic or raising endogenous desmosterol levels can be used as approaches to restore cholesterol homeostasis in lesion macrophages without causing adverse effects on circulating lipoprotein levels."
"9273523","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Up to 50% of obese patients are not interested in, or ready for, weight loss. Clinical practice guidelines clearly recommend that these patients avoid gaining weight. Doing so might contain, or even attenuate, the adverse cardiometabolic risks that will likely accrue with additional weight gain. However, despite the clinical benefits, weight gain prevention interventions are not available in primary care practice. This evidence gap disproportionately affects medically vulnerable populations -- those who are low income, often racial/ethnic minority, and may reside in rural settings. These patients have the highest rates of obesity and weight gain but the least interest in, readiness for, and success with weight loss. The implications for these patients are clear: without intervention, most will continue to gain weight and incur cardiometabolic risks. Our Shape Program trial was the first to evaluate a weight gain prevention intervention in primary practice. Shape's participants were medically vulnerable, overweight and obese Black women who were not explicitly interested in weight loss. The 12-month Shape intervention consisted of tailored behavior change goals, weekly self-monitoring and tailored feedback via interactive voice response and monthly coaching calls from a clinic-based registered dietitian. After 18 months, intervention participants were twice as likel to have maintained their weight, compared to those receiving usual care. Recent analyses show that Shape's weight gain prevention effects have persisted for up to four years. To make Shape consistent with the latest obesity treatment guidelines, a key translational priority is to show tht Shape has generalized effects in a population of impoverished, rural, racially/ethnically diverse adults who are at high cardiometabolic risk. We propose to evaluate the effectiveness of an updated Shape 2 weight gain prevention intervention in a pragmatic trial conducted in a rural community health center system. We will randomize 442 overweight and obese adults to either: 1) usual care, or 2) a 12-month weight gain prevention intervention consisting of self-monitoring and feedback via interactive voice response and/or text messaging, tailored skills training, and responsive coaching from a clinic dietitian. The primary outcome is the prevention of weight gain over 24 months post-baseline. We will also compare the updated Shape 2 intervention to usual care with respect to 24-month changes in cardiometabolic risk markers. Finally, we will evaluate Shape 2's dissemination potential and incremental cost-effectiveness."
"9266833","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to determine how spinal cord neurons are made with appropriate characteristics to form functional neuronal circuitry. This knowledge is essential for developing effective treatments for spinal cord injuries and neuronal diseases that affect locomotion or sensory perception. In addition, it is likely to provide insights into similar processes that occur in the brain. Most of the functional properties of neurons, that determine the roles that they play in specific neuronal circuits, are thought to b determined by the post-mitotic transcription factors that these cells turn on (express) as they start to differentiate. However, in many cases, it is not known which transcription factors are important for specifying particular functional properties. This is particularly the case for excitatory neurotransmitter fates. Neurotransmitter fates are one of the key defining functional properties of a neuron. Neurons utilizing inappropriate neurotransmitters will not function properly in neuronal circuitry. This proposal focuses on an excitatory class of dorsal spinal cord neurons that express two highly-related transcription factors, Hmx2 and Hmx3. These neurons are involved in sensory perception but very little is known about how they develop their specific functional properties. Preliminary data suggest that Hmx2 and Hmx3 act redundantly to specify the excitatory fates of these dorsal spinal neurons. This project will test this hypothesis and use unbiased systems biology methods to determine the molecular mechanisms through which these two transcription factors act. This project will use zebrafish embryos as a model system as they have several advantages for this research. The embryos develop outside the mother and are optically transparent, enabling neuron morphology and synapse formation to be observed in intact, live embryos. In addition, it is faster and cheaper to test the functions of specific genes in zebrafish embryos than in mammals. Evidence to date, suggests that spinal neurons are highly conserved between zebrafish and mammals, in terms of the genes that they express and their functional properties. Therefore the findings from this work should also be applicable to mammals, including humans. The results from this research will significantly increase knowledge about how spinal neurons are specified and form functional neuronal circuits. This should have a huge impact on the fields of developmental neurobiology and neural stem cell biology. These results should also lead the way towards new treatments for CNS injury and disease. For example, molecules identified in this work may be able to instruct stem cells or neural progenitor cells to develop into excitatory neurons, repress GABAergic fates and/or may provide novel drug targets for conditions such as neuropathic pain."

"9272342",".  We demonstrated that muscle-derived stem/progenitor cells (MDSPCs) isolated from the skeletal muscle of naturally aged wild-type (WT) mice and mice that model a human progeroid syndrome (ERCCI-deficient mice) are defective in proliferation, multi-lineage differentiation and tissue regeneration after injury. This is consistent with the notion that autonomous defects in the adult stem cell compartment, which accrue over time, contribute to the loss of tissue regeneration and homeostasis associated with normal and accelerated aging. However, there is also evidence that aging and disease affects the stem cell niche, impacting stem cell function via non-autonomous mechanisms. In addition, there is strong evidence that factors circulating in the serum of aged mice affect stem/progenitor cell function. Therefore, it remains unclear if aging-related loss of adult stem cell function is primarily driven by cell autonomous and/or non-autonomous mechanisms. Thus one goal of this project is to characterize the mechanism through which MDSPCs become dysfunctional with aging using mouse models of tissue- and cell type-specific inactivation of ERCCI. The proposed experiments will determine if stochastic, endogenous damage directly or indirectly drives stem cell dysfunction. We also demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of MDSPCs isolated from young WT mice into ERCCI-deficient mice results in a significant lifespan and healthspan extension, as well as increased tissue regeneration and neovascularization. This occurred via a paracrine/endocrine mechanism as donor cells were not detected in all tissues in which benefits were seen. Thus a second goal of this project is to characterize this paracrine/endocrine mechanism by which young MDSPCs promote health and longevity when delivered systemically. Finally we will identify the factors secreted by young, functional stem cells that are important for conferring their beneficial effects. The successful completion ofthe proposed studies should lead to novel mechanistic information about the contribution of stem cells to maintaining healthspan and therapeutic stem cell-based approaches to improve human aging."
"9269237","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circadian rhythms are critically important, since they enable most organisms to cope with the physical and ecological changes occurring daily in their environment. Indeed, they time most bodily functions, from basic metabolism to behavior, so that they are synchronized and optimized with the time of day. Because of their profound impact on physiology and behavior, disruption of circadian rhythms seriously impact human health. Mood disorders are linked to defective synchronization of circadian rhythms, and specific cancers and gastro-intestinal diseases are more frequent in shift workers, for example. We are using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to study the fundamental principles underlying circadian rhythms and their synchronization (entrainment) to the day/night cycle. Indeed, a clock that drifts out of phase because it cannot respond to environmental cues or because its pacemaker mechanism is defective would have no adaptive value and be detrimental to health. We are pursuing three major objectives, using the full power of Drosophila genetics, molecular biology and neurobiology. Our first goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of circadian entrainment to light and temperature cycles, the two most important environmental cues. We will determine at the molecular level how circadian pacemakers receive and respond to photic and thermal inputs, and how they integrate them. Our second objective is to understand how the circadian neural network controlling rhythmic behaviors detects, responds and integrates various environmental cues. Indeed, in the brain, entrainment relies both on cell-autonomous molecular mechanisms and interactions between circadian neurons to synchronize circadian behaviors with the day/night cycle. Finally, our third objective is to understand how circadian rhythms are generated at the molecular level, with a particular interest in determining how the control of mRNA processing and translation contributes to circadian rhythms. There is indeed growing evidence that these regulatory steps of gene expression are critical for circadian rhythms. However, in contrast to circadian transcriptional and post-translational control, little i known about the mechanisms regulating circadian mRNA metabolism and translation. We expect our work to provide an integrative picture of the mechanisms generating, controlling and synchronizing circadian rhythms in fruit flies. Importantly, the basic mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms are remarkably well conserved in animals, from Drosophila to mammals. We therefore anticipate that our work will also prove important for our understanding of mammalian circadian rhythms, and might thus ultimately impact our ability to treat diseases associated with disrupted circadian clocks."
"9262604","This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a commercially-viable device that uses micro-scale acoustic streaming (low frequency sound energy) to deliver mixing to the interior of three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds used for stem cell cultivation applications. The enabling advantage of low frequency sound energy is the ability to generate micro-scale mixing in and around scaffolds that can enhance the movement of liquid, molecules, and oxygen within scaffolds without the need for pumps or a costly and inconvenient perfusion apparatus for each scaffold. Preliminary data shows that cells can successfully grow in the presence of the acoustic energy field.  Nutrient supply issues and difficulties in homogenously seeding dense scaffolds are issues that need to be overcome in order to successfully produce high quality, repeatable cell cultures in the complex 3D environments that are the mainstay of modern stem cell and tissue engineering. Many possible solutions to these problems have been examined, including the use of spinner flask, centrifugal, vacuum fixtures, or perfusion for cell seeding. The vision for the approach proposed here is to develop a single bioreactor platform on which multiple scaffolds can be mounted in simple fixtures to deliver similar benefits as those derived from complex perfusion bioreactors but without the significant time and capital investment inherent in such an approach. When used at low intensities, the proposed device should be able to deliver benefits similar to a perfusion bioreactor, but in a much simpler package. When used at higher intensities in the absence of cells, additional applications and benefits of the proposed product will be delivered in the form of much more rapid methods for the hydration, functionalization, and enzymatic degradation of scaffolds.  The goal of this research proposal is to build a commercial prototype Acoustic Scaffold Bioreactor device and to extensively characterize and optimize its use for scaffold-based hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cell culture systems. The commercial applications of the device will be broad within the field of stem cell and tissue engineering, extending to the full range of cells and tissues that have shown to be enhanced by more cumbersome perfusion flow-based systems, as well as to basic operations such as hydrating, functionalizing, and digesting scaffolds."
"9310665","Despite extensive study of DNA damage responses in both normal and pathologic settings, it is poorly understood how chromatin reorganization occurs in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and contributes to genome maintenance and cancer cell fitness. There is now strong evidence that DSB responses promote changes in higher order chromatin structure. These arise in part by DSB dependent alterations in transcription, and by DSB induced recombination between homologous genomic regions on different chromosomes. This proposal utilizes several novel approaches to address questions related to the interplay between DSB chromatin alterations and genome integrity. Namely, (i) How do DSB dependent chromatin alterations contribute to transcriptional gene silencing in cis to DSBs, and (ii) how do DSB induced inter-chromosomal telomere associations contribute to genome integrity and survival? Collectively, these investigations will address fundamental issues in genome integrity and radiation biology that are related to communication between DSB responses and higher order chromatin structure."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Following limb amputation, suspension-type attachment of an exoprosthesis to the residual limb is currently the standard of care, but is not suitable for every patient. For example, suspension technology fails with patients with short residual limbs, whom experience persistent deterioration of soft tissues, and/or hampered by exuberant heterotopic ossification. It is for these patients that Percutaneous Osseointegrated Docking Systems (PODS) are being developed worldwide so they can attach their exoprosthesis directly to the bone of their residual limb. In Europe, thre primary groups are working with human volunteer amputees to investigate PODS technology. However, these European PODS are not currently FDA approved for use in the United States, in part, because they lack evidence of an infection-free biological seal between the periprosthetic tissues and the PODS device. Here in the United States, our team has worked since 2006 on the design, the development, and the evaluation of a new type of PODS device. We have shown that endoprosthetic PODS devices, incorporating porous-coated titanium subdermal barriers, have the ability to inhibit infection by maintaining a biologically attached epithelial seal in load-bearing animals for at least 12- months. However, within the first 12-weeks post-implantation, the periprosthetic tissues surrounding the PODS device << exhibit a chronic wound healing response and >> migrate along the percutaneous interface, possibly in an attempt to make the device extra-cutaneous, a process known as down growth. This is of concern because << down growth breaks the biologically attached epithelial seal, creating a gap >> between the periprosthetic tissues and the PODS device, a direct conduit for microbial invasion - one that can lead to local, or even systemic infection. << To maximize the functional recovery of patients with amputated limbs, we >> need to establish, to maintain, and if necessary, to re-establish a non-migratory biological seal between the periprosthetic tissues and the PODS device. Clinically, chronic wounds are often closed using a technique known as Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) therapy, << also known as Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) >>. We will first determine if << NPWT can inhibit the down growth >> and subsequent infection of the periprosthetic tissues surrounding PODS devices. Second, we will establish whether << NPWT >> is required to maintain the biological seal over time. Third, in the << presence of a gap between the periprosthetic tissues and the PODS device >>, we will determine whether NPWT can re-establish the biological seal between the periprosthetic tissues and the PODS device. The results from this study will facilitate the safe clinical introduction of percutaneous osseointegrated prostheses, improving the quality of life for patients in the VA, military, and broader civilian populations with severe limb injuries."
"9368487","Permeability barriers of Gram-negative pathogens and approaches to bypass them A major source of resistance in Gram-negative species is the permeability barrier created by a synergistic action of slow uptake and active efflux of antibiotics across the outer membrane. The proposed research will address a critical need to understand penetration across the cell envelope of Gram-negative species and to develop antibiotics affective against these pathogens. In preliminary studies, we established novel mathematical and empirical approaches to analyze drug uptake across a two-membrane barrier with active efflux. Based on these results, we formulated a hypothesis that permeation and hence activities of antibiotics are affected by bacterial barriers and active efflux differently and that these differences are defined by physicochemical properties of antibiotics. To critically test this hypothesis, we will apply the new formalism and methods to analyze permeability barriers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Burkholderia spp. that differ significantly in the composition of their outer membranes and efflux pumps. These pathogens are notorious for their virtually unbreachable permeability barriers. Our goal is to establish structure-activity relationships between drug uptake, efflux and inhibitory activities for a select library of compounds in the context of barriers with different permeability properties. The proposed studies will define the limits of barriers and compounds and will create a framework for optimization of antibiotics targeting the ?impermeable? pathogens."

"9480127","Maladaptive pain-induced dysfunction in motivational circuits are the likely critical factors that lead to pathological alterations in natural and drug reward seeking behaviors, yet the neural circuit mechanisms for these effects are largely unknown. The mesolimbic system is a key network node that integrates pain and reward. Dopamine (DA) transmission in the mesolimbic system, via the VTA to NAc has long been recognized for its role in motivated behavior. Alterations in DA signaling within the mesolimbic pathway are associated with motivational deficits, and animals in pain show impaired motivated responses to natural and drug reward. Importantly, from a translational perspective, negative correlations between pain and mesolimbic DA activity in humans have been often reported. Mu opioid receptor (MOPR) agonists are positively reinforcing and remain the predominant opioids used for alleviating clinical pain and recreational use/abuse. We recently found that persistent inflammatory pain downregulates function of MOPR in the VTA with a concomitant loss of opioid- induced DA release in the NAc in a dose-dependent manner leading to increase intake of higher doses of opioids which are known to contribute to abuse-associated phenotypes. In addition, our preliminary data suggest that persistent inflammation causes an increase in endogenous opioid tone which is likely leading to desensitization of MOPR in the VTA. Collectively, these findings suggest that pain suppresses VTA?NAc neural circuit activity through suppression of mesolimbic DA release. We predict that this effect is mediated by an increase in endogenous opioid tone and reduction of MOPR function in the VTA which negatively impact the animal's motivational state contributing to an opioid abuse-associated phenotype. In this application we propose cross disciplinary cutting-edge approaches to dissect the neuronal and cellular mechanisms underlying the downregulation of mu-opioid circuits in the presence of inflammatory pain. In three specific aims we will: i) determine the mechanisms for downregulation of mu-opioid-containing GABAergic circuits in inflammatory pain ii) determine whether increases in endogenous mu-opioid agonist tone changes mu-opioid function, and whether these processes are necessary and sufficient for the effects of inflammatory pain on motivated behavior. Finally, in a third aim we will directly visualize endogenous opioid-containing neuronal ensembles during the development of inflammatory pain and decreased motivational states. Here we will determine whether mu-opioid receptors, their endogenous agonists, within discrete mesolimbic neural circuits, are necessary and sufficient to mediate pain-induced alterations in opioid intake and motivated behavior."
"9335168","ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is among the most common HIV-associated malignancies worldwide, and a leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. A growing body of evidence demonstrates the tremendous ability of T-cells to mediate tumor regression, and several characteristics of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are associated with superior survival in a range of solid tumors. While KS development is strongly associated with immune dysfunction in the context of HIV infection, little is known about immune responses to KS, and no studies have evaluated features of TIL in KS tumors in relation to clinical outcomes.  In response to PQ5, we propose the first study to define the characteristics of effective T-cell responses to KS in adults with and without HIV infection. Preliminary studies by our group demonstrate that T-cells commonly infiltrate HIV+KS tumors, and that higher T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is associated with improved treatment response. We have further observed the expansion of specific T-cell clones in post-treatment TIL in patients who ultimately achieve a complete response to therapy, and we hypothesize that these clones are reactive with KS tumor cells and contribute to tumor regression. Importantly, we have also found high expression in KS tumors of several immune exhaustion markers, including PD-1,CTLA-4, and LAG-3, which may be increased in HIV-infected individuals, and contribute to their inability to mount effective KS immune responses. By comparing TIL in HIV+ and HIV-KS tumors, we hope to learn about the impact of HIV on T-cell responses. We further postulate that persons with HIV-KS, who have no known immunodeficiency and typically enjoy superior treatment outcomes, will generate more effective antitumor responses that can guide therapeutic strategies to enhance similar T-cell responses in HIV+KS.  We will test our hypotheses by utilizing the extensive KS tumor repository from our ongoing study of adults with HIV+KS and HIV-KS receiving treatment at the Uganda Cancer Institute through the following aims: 1) To define the spatiotemporal characteristics of TIL in KS tumors, and to determine if features of intratumoral  CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell infiltration are associated with response to therapy and with 1-year survival. 2) To evaluate the diversity and clonal composition of the T-cell receptor ? chain (TRB) repertoire of TIL in KS  tumors, and to determine if clonal composition and/or specific clonal populations in TIL are correlated  with response to therapy and 1-year survival. 3) To define the expression of viral and immune-related host genes in KS tumors, and to identify features  associated with response to therapy and 1-year survival. Through an improved understanding of adaptive immune responses to KS, these studies will contribute to the development of targeted and effective immune-based staging and treatment strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibition and therapeutic vaccination, to improve response and survival in persons with HIV+KS."

"9320890","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this R01 application is to develop and evaluate a high-resolution X-ray phase- contrast (XPC) imaging system and associated image reconstruction algorithms for in-vivo volumetric imaging of biomaterials in small animal models. The need for improved imaging methods for evaluating and monitoring biomaterials for tissue engineering/regeneration, drug delivery, and cell therapies applications is great. The ideal method would provide 3D quantitative information, possess high spatial resolution (<100 µm), allow deep tissue penetration (>5 cm), and provide contrast between tissue and material structures essential for evaluating tissue response and development. Currently available imaging methods fall short in one or more of these requirements and this is currently limiting the development of biomaterial-based therapies. Moreover, these limitations hinder a variety of other preclinical imaging applications.  For high-resolution applications of XPC, a microfocus X-ray tube is required in combination with a magnification geometry. Although kW power tubes equipped with source gratings are being actively explored for XPC imaging using a Talbot-Lau interferometer, that implementation does not meet the resolution requirements needed for monitoring biomaterials in small animal models and many other preclinical applications. Despite significant effort devoted in recent years to the development of XPC computed tomography (CT) using tube-based sources, the technology is still plagued by long data-acquisition times and relatively high radiation doses. Accordingly, the technology is not yet suitable for routine live animal imaging. The dominant cause of the long acquisition times in high-resolution implementations of XPC CT is the brightness limitations of conventional microfocus tubes set by the melting point of the anode target material. Another important contributing factor is that the advantages of optimized tomosynthesis data-acquisition strategies coupled with advanced statistically principled image reconstruction methods have not been fully exploited.  The proposed research directly addresses the current limitations of high-resolution XPC imaging and will permit its translation for in-vivo volumetric imaging of biomaterials in small animal models. Our approach involves a high degree of innovation regarding both the hardware implementation and image reconstruction methods. The specific aims of the project are as follows.  Aim 1: Develop and characterize an XPC tomosynthesis imager based on a MetalJet source for 3D monitoring of biomaterials; Aim 2: Develop advanced image reconstruction algorithms to maximize image quality; Aim 3: Refine the imaging system via computer-simulations and imaging experiments; Aim 4: Validate XPC imaging for in-vivo volumetric imaging of biomaterials in pre-clinical animal models."
"9267530","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protective immune responses rely on the ability of leukocytes to cross endothelial barriers in response to inflammatory stimuli. However, inflammation is a double-edged sword; immune cells attack healthy tissues in situations such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and transplantation. T cell migration into sites f inflammation is tightly regulated by localized chemokine signals, which activate integrin dependent adhesion and cytoskeletal changes needed for migration across endothelial barriers. Transendothelial migration (TEM) is a multi-step process involving tethering and rolling, firm adhesion, crawling, and finally transmigration. TEM represents an important checkpoint in the inflammatory response, and reagents that block this process are therapeutically valuable. We have found that Crk family proteins function in the chemokine pathway leading to integrin activation and cytoskeletal remodeling, and we find that T cells lacking these proteins have defects in adhesion and TEM. Strikingly, we find that these T cells traffic normally to lymphoid organs, but show defects in migration to sites of inflammation. Moreover, these cells can carry out an efficient graft vs leukemia (GvL) response, with minimal graft vs host disease (GvHD). We hypothesize that Crk proteins are required for chemokine-induced integrin activation and cytoskeletal remodeling in T cells, and for corresponding changes in the endothelium that allow transendothelial migration and T cell trafficking into inflamed tissue. This hypothesis will be tested by carrying out following three Aims: First, we will define the mechanisms through which Crk protein signaling in T cells promotes TEM. Using ligand-coated surfaces and endothelial monolayers under shear flow conditions, we will test the ability of Crk/L deficient T cells to undergo individual steps in the TEM process, and test hypothesis that Crk proteins function through both Rap1 and Cdc42 in this context. Second, we will assess endothelial cell responses to Crk/L-deficient T cells. We will test the hypothesis that defects in Crk-dependent integrin activation within the T cell result in a failure to appropriately activate one or more endothelial ell signaling pathways that are required for efficient TEM. Three pathways that function together to weaken endothelial junctional complexes and generate a specialized conduit for T cell passage will be investigated. Third, we will analyze Crk protein dependent T cell trafficking in acute inflammation and GvHD/GvL models. Consistent with their role in controlling TEM, we find that Crk/L deficient T cells show defects in migration into inflamed tissues. Moreover, these cells cause minimal GvHD, even under conditions where they can efficiently eliminate lymphoma. In this aim, we will use animal models to explore Crk protein function in T cell trafficking during an in vivo immune response. We will conduct histological analysis and intravital imaging to study T cell-vessel interactions in inflamed skin. In addition, we will use GvHD and GvHD/GvL models to study T cell trafficking to target organs, and to test our ability to target Crk protein function i a therapeutic setting."

"9324255","ABSTRACT The overall goal of this proposal is to understand calcium regulation in both cardiac and skeletal muscle at the atomic level. Calcium (Ca2+) is an essential messenger for muscle contractility, and its homeostatic balance is controlled by proteins embedded or peripheral to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane. In cardiac myocytes, the SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) regulates diastole by translocating ~70% of the Ca2+ ions. In its unphosphorylated state, phospholamban (PLN) reduces SERCA's affinity for Ca2+, whereas phosphorylation of PLN at Ser16 re-establishes basal Ca2+ transport. Sarcolipin (SLN), a PLN homolog, regulates SERCA in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, keeping SERCA's activity within a physiological window. Like PLN, SLN is also modulated by ?-adrenergic stimulation through phosphorylation at Thr5, though the role of this phosphory- lation event in SERCA regulation is incompletely understood. Dysregulation of SERCA's function outside the physiological window by PLN and SLN leads to cardiomyopathies and heart failure. SLN is also proposed to play a crucial role in metabolism and skeletal muscle thermogenesis through uncoupling ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport in SERCA. Though there is compelling biological evidence for this phenomenon, the molecular mechanisms by which SLN elicit the functional uncoupling of SERCA is unknown. In this competitive renewal, we will build on our previous discoveries and take new and exciting directions to understand the atomic details of PLN and SLN's allosteric regulation of SERCA and unveil the different roles of these endogenous inhibi- tors both in cardiac and skeletal muscle. In AIM1, We will focus on the structural analysis of SERCA regulation by two mutants, PLNP21G and PLNM20GP21G, which we designed and currently testing for gene therapy. We will study how these mutants mimic the phosphorylated state of PLN and tune SERCA activity. In AIM2, we will determine the role of SLN in non-shivering muscle thermogenesis. Finally, in AIM3, we will study the functional and structural role of a newly discovered regulator of the SERCA/PLN complex: HAX-1, which has an anti- apoptotic role in cardiomyocytes. These studies will be carried out using a combination of molecular biology, biochemical assays, thermocalorimetry, and spectroscopic methods (solution, solid-state NMR and fluores- cence) in synthetic and native membranes. To accomplish these specific AIMs, we have assembled a strong collaborative team, including Dave Thomas, Muthu Periasamy, Roger Hajjar, Evangelia Kranias, and Seth Robia. These scientists are at the forefront of the study of Ca2+ physiology and pathophysiology and have committed to a collaborative effort and timely data sharing plan that will propel our research and ensure sound biological and biomedical significance for our studies. The outcomes of this research will have a strong im- pact for understanding excitation-contraction coupling, muscle contractility, and thermogenesis, with significant implications for the design of alternative therapeutic approaches to counteract muscle disease."
"9411244","Abstract:  Cryptococcus neoformans is a major comorbidity of HIV infection and transplantation with high mortality rates due to the toxicity and limited availability and efficacy of existing antifungal agents. As an environmental saprophyte, cryptococcal pathogenesis requires adaptation to the environment of the human host. Our work has led us to the scientific premise that stress adaptation in C. neoformans requires two sequential post- transcriptional events. First, the accelerated degradation mRNAs encoding metabolically expensive processes such as the translational machinery, and second, the translation of stress response mRNAs via cap- independent translation mechanisms on recycled ribosomes. This premise implicates the ribosome as a sensor of cellular stress through translation quality control mechanisms. The aims in this proposal will investigate co- translational quality control as a trigger for accelerated mRNA degradation in response to temperature sturess (Aim1) and will investigate cap-independent translation mechanisms (Aims 2) in stress adaptation. Aim 2 will focus on two CNBP orthologues expressed in C. neoformans that we hypothesize to regulate translation via internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) in response to temperature and oxidative stress. Finally, we will assess the contributing role of ribosome-associated quality control in starvation stress responsive translation and define the contributions of each quality control pathway in the response of C. neoformans to compound stressors (Aim 3). These studies will be the first investigation of translation in C. neoformans, and include the first application of ribosome profiling in this pathogen. Translation is known to be pharmacologically targetable but conservation in eukaryotes is thought to be a hindrance. Only through molecular investigation of translation regulation can fungal-specific aspects of the process be identified for future investigation as drug targets."
"9370768","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity and high-fat diets (HFD) increase the risk for disorders of skeletal muscle function including anabolic resistance, which is an inability to increase protein synthesis in response to feeding or growth cues. Anabolic resistance leads to the attenuation of muscle growth under conditions of increased loading, such as recovery from disuse and functional overload. The objective of this application is to examine the mechanisms by which a HFD and/or obesity reduces load-induced muscle growth in both male and female mice. Our recent findings reveal that in mice fed a HFD muscle growth in response to increased loading is significantly attenuated. These results have led to the formulation of our central hypothesis: the development of anabolic resistance in diet-induced obesity is related to an accumulation of intramuscular lipids and increased fatty acid intermediates leading to an increase in oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which inhibits anabolic signaling in response to increased loading. To address our hypothesis, we propose three specific aims that take advantage of unique differences in three mouse strains (C57BL/6J, MuRF1-/-, and ob/ob) and two load-induced growth models: functional overload and hind limb unloading/reloading. State of the art imaging techniques (7-T MRI, laser trapping Raman spectroscopy, and coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy) will be used to measure intramuscular lipid content and lipid droplet size, number, and composition. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that increasing duration on a diet high in saturated fats, and not adiposity, leads to the development of anabolic resistance in male and female mice. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that a HFD leads to an increase in intramyocellular lipids and the accumulation of fatty acid intermediates causing the development of anabolic resistance. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that MuRF1-/- mice on a HFD have reduced storage of intramuscular lipids and a decrease in fatty acid intermediates, which prevents the development of anabolic resistance. This application is significant because it will lead to major advances in our understanding of the effects of obesity and diets high in saturated fats on the ability of muscle to respond to growth cues, which is clinically important because anabolic resistance leads to decreased mobility and independence, increases the likelihood of injuries and falls, and further increases the risk for diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease."
"9260748","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this T32 program is to train new independent investigators who will utilize contemporary genetic and molecular genetic techniques to investigate the underlying mechanisms of aging. The rationale for the focus of our program can be succinctly summarized as follows: 1) The genetic approach to the analysis of the biology and pathobiology of aging has special merit that, by definition, it deals with primary, constitutional, heritable, controls of gene action and thus can inform us as to fundamental mechanisms. 2) The tools for the molecular genetic approach to the pathobiology of aging are becoming increasingly rich and diverse. We thus believe that this focus for gerontological research will be applied with increasing frequency and success. While this may seem obvious given today's prominence of molecular genetics, until recently the field of gerontology did not have so rich a historical background in use of genetic approaches. Thus, we believe there is a need for more investigators who are trained in the principles and methods of genetic analysis and in gerontology. Such training is the primary goal of this program. The program currently supports 8 pre- and 8 post-doctoral trainees, and we request to sustain these numbers. We provide continuity of training by typically providing support for 3-4 (pre-doc) or 2-3 (post-doc) years. Predoctoral candidates ordinarily begin in their 2nd year of graduate training and post-docs in their 1st year of post-graduate training. The relevance of this program to public health is rooted in fact that age is the primary risk factor for disease in our population: diseases associated with aging are the chief health burden to our society and the primary cause of reduced quality of life. An increased understanding of the genetic mechanisms responsible for the processes that contribute to the burden of disease in aging can have a great positive impact on our society. We are training bright, new scientists who are highly motivated to work to increase this understanding."
"9272022","Project summary Systematic functional dissection of neuronal transcriptome diversity Cell type-specific alternative splicing (AS) enormously amplifies the neuronal transcriptome diversity. Proper regulation of such molecular complexity and its establishment during development is critical for the maturation of nerve cells and maintenance of their homeostasis. Multiple RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been identified to control neuron-specific splicing. We pioneered the development of an ?RBP-centric? strategy to reconstruct precisely the splicing regulatory networks of specific classes of neuronal RBPs using an integrative analysis framework that combines multiple modalities of experimental and computational data. These efforts generated prioritized lists of developmentally regulated exons that will be studied in details to improve our understanding of the functional importance of AS at various stages of neuronal differentiation. However, a major roadblock for the field is our current inability to efficiently interrogate the function of a vast number of splice variants. To fill in this gap, we propose to develop an ?exon-centric? strategy using an exon- specific genetic screen to dissect directly and systematically the functional role of specific splice variants during neural development. For a pilot study, our focus is to identify alternative exons that regulate axon morphogenesis in an in vitro model system of spinal motor neurons derived from mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. In Aim 1, we will establish a large-scale genome-editing platform to delete individual alternative exons in mES cells through lentivirus-based, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering. We designed a cloning strategy that will allow us to build a CRISPR library with a large pool of paired guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting individual alternative exons to trigger specific exon deletion. Parameters for optimizing the complexity of the library, viral delivery, and efficiency of genome editing will be established. In Aim 2, we will perform a pilot screen of ~100 prioritized neuronal alternative exons and identify those important for axon outgrowth. To perform this screening based on analysis of neuronal morphology in the absence of a reliable reporter, we propose a strategy to derive clonal mutant mES cell populations from transduced cell pools in a high-throughput format. These clonal lines carrying individual mutations will be subject to paralleled neuronal differentiation, high-throughput imaging and phenotypic analysis. This strategy will allow sensitive detection of mutants showing fine morphological defects in axon growth, which will be genotyped and further validated. Our approach will therefore combine advantages of being both scalable and flexible. This study will establish a very effective method to extend our knowledge of gene function to the level of individual splice variants. This strategy can be readily adapted to study the molecular programs underlying neural differentiation, migration, and function in normal and pathological contexts."
"9256554","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the present project is to understand the neuronal activity underlying the process of voluntary control. Historically, investigating this process has been constrained largely by the fact that voluntary motor output is naturally coupled to motion of a body part, to the muscle contractions moving that body part, and to the sensory feedback produced by the motion of that body part. Now, as knowledge of these relationships is being harnessed to control brain computer interfaces (BCIs), BCIs themselves provide a new paradigm for directly examining the neuronal processes underlying voluntary control.  As the brain controls a BCI, neuronal activity becomes dissociated from movement of the body and devoted instead to voluntary control of the interface. Movement of the native limb may cease, and EMG activity may be absent as neurons continue to control the BCI voluntarily. Hence proprioceptive feedback and visual observation of limb movement may be absent as well. Carefully chosen BCI paradigms thus provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine voluntary control of neuronal activity per se, dissociated from motor output and sensory feedback. Here we propose to investigate the neuronal processes underlying voluntary control using a simple BCI paradigm that assesses the single-session performance of neurons in voluntarily controlling a novel interface. Our BCI paradigm assesses the ability to coordinate the activity of small ensembles of arbitrarily-selected neurons in novel patterns. Specifically, th present proposal aims to determine whether the brain's ability to control neurons voluntarily depends: i) on the cortical area (motor, premotor, and parietal areas will be compared), ii) on the presence or absence of visual and/or somatosensory inputs, and iii) on output projections to different levels of the neuraxis (neurons with cortico-cortical axons, axons projecting to the brainstem, cortico-spinal axons, and cortico-motoneuronal connections will be compared).  Current efforts at neuro-prosthetic control of artificial hands, while impressive, have not progressed as rapidly as might have been expected. In part this may reflect inadequate basic understanding of the neuronal activity underlying the process of voluntary control per se. Thus, improved understanding of this fundamental process will lead both to improved neuro-prosthetic devices for restoration of lost function and to improved neuro-rehabilitation for functional recovery in patients affected by a wide variety of neurological diseases including stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, brain or spinal cord injury, and cerebral palsy."

"9313955","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus?L4?L2/3?L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct ?strata? of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of ?deep networks?. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies."
"9263028","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Veterinarians are well-suited for comparative and biomedical research due to their knowledge in basic physiology applied to multiple animal species and their clinical training. Veterinary specialists in biomedical and comparative research are essential for successful research at all levels and locations and a shortage of veterinarians with the background and training for biomedical research has been documented in reports by the National Academy of Sciences and is predicted to increase. The College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at Iowa State University (ISU) has a stellar history of educating veterinarians many of whom have entered careers in biomedical research. The CVM at ISU has a cooperative educational agreement with the University of Nebraska at Lincoln (UNL) whereby UNL School of Veterinary medicine educates an additional 25 students per year for two years of the veterinary curriculum. Today, ISU CVM has one of the largest class sizes among U. S. Veterinary Schools and Colleges which makes an excellent pool of student trainees for recruitment into the summer scholar program. The CVM enrolls over 140 graduate students. ISU CVM research funding has increased to $17 million in 2011 with faculty members, including veterinarians who receive NIH grants. Nearby ISU is the USDA/ARS-National Animal Disease Center which is the largest animal research facility in the world with veterinarians dedicated to animal research. ISU CVM began a summer scholar training program for veterinary medical students in1991 and received T35 support in 2001 with renewal in 2008. The T35 has supported 75 trainees during this time. The broader summer scholar program at ISU CVM (supported by Merial, LTD, Iowa Healthy Livestock Advisory Committee, Morris Animal Foundation) has consistently supported 20-25 trainees for 20 years. Many of these enter biomedical research fields. The objective of the T35-supported scholar training and the overall Veterinary Medical Summer Scholars Research Program (SSRP) at Iowa State University is to expose first and second year veterinary medical students to biomedical research by direct laboratory experience and through participation in allied activities including seminars, workshops, journal clubs and presentations. The overall goal of the SSRP is to increase the number of scientifically-trained veterinarians that are successful as biomedical scientists. The objectives and goals are met through a 13 week summer program that includes fruitful laboratory experiences with highly engaged and qualified, NIH-mentors that includes veterinarians in superb facilities; lectures and seminars on animal care, ethics, conflicts, inter-student and mentor interactions, scientific writing; and deep engagement with veterinarians as mentors in biomedical research."
"9480134","Project Summary/Abstract Propensity toward relapse is a hallmark feature of addiction. Hence, understanding the cellular mechanisms responsible for relapse vulnerability represents an important focus of addiction research. One significant and long-lasting cellular adaptation observed in response to multiple drugs of abuse is downregulation of astroglial glutamate transporter GLT-1. However, relatively very little is known about how drug self-administration affects astrocytes beyond GLT-1 expression, or how astrocytes may contribute to mechanisms of drug seeking. Results collected during the preceding K99/R00 award indicate that restored expression of GLT-1 is pivotal to the mechanism of action of multiple compounds that reduce behavioral measures of relapse in the rat self- administration and reinstatement model of addiction. Preliminary data also indicate that downregulation of GLT-1 by cocaine is accompanied by reduced expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and a retraction of astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens core. Astrocyte retraction is characterized by decreased surface area, volume, and decreased synaptic contacts. This finding represents a heretofore-unappreciated fundamental consequence of cocaine use on astrocyte cell biology. Thus, decreased GLT-1 expression is a component of larger-scale adaptions in astrocyte biology that occur following chronic cocaine use. These findings have led to the hypothesis that astrocyte retraction in the nucleus accumbens of cocaine-withdrawn rats contributes to synaptic adaptations that drive cocaine seeking. In order to test this hypothesis, the specific goals of this proposal are: (1) to determine when during the addiction cycle the morphological effects on astrocytes are induced (2) to determine the functional relationship between astrocyte retraction and synaptic adaptations believed to underlie cocaine seeking, and (3) to determine the relationship between astrocyte retraction and drug seeking after cessation of drug use. These questions will be addressed by combining rat cocaine self-administration with behavioral measures of cocaine seeking, high-resolution imaging of fluorescently labeled astrocytes, and whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. These studies will provide novel insight into how cocaine-dependent adaptations in astrocyte dynamics contribute to the cellular and behavioral pathologies characteristic of psychostimulant addiction. These studies will also provide important information toward the translational potential of astrocytes as a pharmacotherapeutic target for substance use disorders."

"9273474","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by autoimmunity. We propose a novel method for suppressing inflammation by upregulating and activating natural inhibitory receptors called leukocyte associated immunoglobulin-like receptors (LAIR). One of these, LAIR-1 (also called CD305) acts as a negative regulator of immune cell receptor signaling, suggesting that activating LAIR-1 receptors may lead to diminished autoimmune activity and less severe disease in patients with RA. We have further demonstrated that culture with vitamin D increases LAIR-1 on CD4+ T cells. The discovery of a new secosteroidogenic pathway initiated by P450scc that produces vitamin D3 hydroxyderivatives has opened new options in treatment for RA. We predict that upregulating Lair-1 by using new vitamin D3 hydroxyderivatives could lead to attenuation of the severity of arthritis using safer therapies than are currently available. We propose a set of experiments using murine models of autoimmune arthritis. Our central hypothesis is that inflammation can be downregulated by stimulation of the inhibitory receptor LAIR-1 and that vitamin D and its analogs enhance this suppression by upregulating LAIR-1. We also believe that the noncalcemic 20(OH)D3 will be as effective and less toxic than the classical form of vitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. To understand the mechanisms by which inhibitory receptors attenuate inflammation we propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that activation of the LAIR-1 inhibitory receptor leads to suppression of T cell cytokine production and that the inhibition is enhanced by vitamin D or the noncalcemic 20(OH)D3 analog. Specific Aim 2. Determine whether activation of LAIR-1 will attenuate autoimmune arthritis and whether vitamin D or 20(OH)D3 enhances this effect using two mouse models of arthritis: collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and the IL-1 receptor antagonist deficiency IL-1Rn-/- spontaneous arthritis model (SAD). Specific Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that upregulation of LAIR-1 leads to suppression of T cell signaling by repressing the canonical T cell pathway and altering T cell cytokine production and that vitamin D or 20(OH)D3 will enhance this effect. Successful completion of these experiments will elucidate the mechanisms whereby treatment with new Vit D analogs leads to upregulation of the inhibitory receptor LAIR-1, ultimately inducing suppression of cytokine secretion and prevention of arthritis.      "
"9461824","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Binge alcohol drinking, the most common form of excessive alcohol consumption, contributes to a host of long- term negative health consequences, including the development of alcohol dependence. Repeated episodes of binge drinking drive subsequent alcohol consumption, therefore characterizing the neural circuitry underlying this risky behavior is essential to the development of successful pharmacotherapeutic treatments for alcohol use disorders. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is critically involved in alcohol drinking and stress-induced relapse of drug seeking. The BNST is enriched with neurons that produce and release corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide that has also been shown to regulate these behaviors. However, the specific roles of BNST CRF neurons and their synaptic inputs in binge alcohol drinking have not been examined. I hypothesize that the activity of BNST CRF neurons drives binge alcohol drinking, and that repeated episodes of binge drinking dysregulate their function by enhancing the activity of glutamatergic neurons that directly modulate them. The goals of this proposal are 1) to characterize the roles of BNST CRF neurons and their glutamatergic inputs from the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in alcohol drinking behavior, and 2) to examine how this neural circuit is altered by repeated cycles of binge drinking. During the K99 phase, I will be trained by Dr. Stuber in the use of in vivo optogenetics, and I will employ in vivo optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches to drive or inhibit the activity of CRF neurons in the BNST and evaluate alcohol drinking behaviors. During the R00 phase, I will use techniques that Dr. Kash has given me extensive training in, including neuronal tracing techniques and slice electrophysiology in combination with ex vivo optogenetics, to characterize and assess the strength of the PVT glutamatergic projection to BNST CRF neurons. Then, I will use in vivo optogenetics to evaluate the causal roles of these pathways in binge alcohol drinking. Finally, I will use ex vivo optogenetics, slice electrophysiology, and immunohistochemistry to examine the effects of repeated binge alcohol drinking on the intrinsic excitability of and synaptic function o BNST CRF neurons and glutamatergic neurons in the PVT that modulate them. Together, these studies will integrate my expertise in slice electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry with training in in vivo optogenetics essential to a making a successful transition to an independent research career. Experiments in this proposal will thoroughly characterize how crucial nodes of circuitry that regulate binge alcohol drinking are altered by repeated binge alcohol drinking, which may reveal pharmacotherapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorders."

"9277730","EARLY-PHASE CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Conducted through the Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center (MCC) Clinical Trials Office (CTO), the Early-Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS) program provides MCC investigators with a comprehensive, high-quality, integrated platform to facilitate and accelerate the evaluation and development of promising scientific discoveries from the MCC research programs into early-phase clinical trials. Highest priority is given to MCC investigator-initiated trials (IITs) that advance concepts arising from MCC research laboratories into novel proof-of-principle, feasibility, and phase I, single-agent and rationally designed combinations of targeted agents that address the molecular signatures of tumors arising in our patients. Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) early-phase funds are used to support the clinical research infrastructure required to promote productive collaborations between basic and translational scientists in the MCC research programs and their MCC clinical research colleagues to translate innovative new approaches to cancer treatment identified through laboratory research into pilot and phase I clinical trials. New concepts for these trials are solicited from research program members and are prioritized by a well-defined and transparent review process overseen by the associate director of clinical research and facilitated by a standing IIT Concept Review Committee composed of senior MCC clinical, translational, and basic scientists. During the current period of support, EPCRS funds have been used to facilitate the opening and conduct of 12 new MCC-led investigator-initiated treatment pilot and phase I trials in solid tumors, hematologic malignancies and radiation oncology. These trials, which required 7 INDs, accrued 168 patients (60%) of the total 281 early-phase accruals. Total early-phase clinical trial local accrual of 281 accounted for 33% of the total MCC treatment trial accrual of 855 patients. MCC IITs have resulted in the definition of maximum tolerated doses for drugs and drug combinations and have identified cancers particularly sensitive to novel therapies suitable for phase II trials. The prioritization process in place is used to pursue a pipeline of additional innovative pilot and phase I trials, of which 6 are currently poised for initiation, with another 7 under development. Support from EPCRS funds focuses on trials addressing the unmet needs of the patient population in the catchment area served by MCC and support the mission of the NIH/NCI by providing access to early-phase clinical trials to patients within the largely underserved and minority populations in the MCC catchment area."

"9268777","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multi-site RCTs have shown that every 2lbs of weight loss is associated with a 20% reduction in the 3yr risk of hypertension and a 32% reduction in the 3yr risk of type 2 diabetes. This is equivalent to the stroke risk reduction associated with smoking cessation. Unfortunately, in intervention trials dating back to 1990, black women have experienced 50% less weight loss than white women. Thus, lifestyle weight loss interventions may actually increase racial disparities in morbidity; all 5 leading causes of death among black women are obesity-related. Obesity prevalence among the urban poor is very high and obesity research in the urban poor is an IOM and DHHS priority. Starting in 2006, we worked with the 3rd largest safety-net health system in the U.S. to implement a lifestyle weight loss intervention that operates in its 8 Federally Qualified Health Centers. This program too has resulted in 50% less weight loss in black relative to white women. We also have an ongoing weight loss RCT testing the impact of delivering the intervention into the homes of the urban poor. No outcomes are available yet but it too is a person-centric lifestyle intervention. With a goal of improving weight loss outcomes, we successfully piloted a novel approach to assessing micro- environments that coincide with weight-related behaviors including momentary social interactions and emotions. Literature places a very strong emphasis on the role of social micro-environments in obesity and weight loss disparities. Individuals are often unaware of the influence of micro-environments on their behavior. For example, experiments have shown that we consume up to 70% more calories when eating with others and that we are largely unaware we have done so. Previous research suggests social networks of black women are less supportive of weight loss than are those of white women. Such social networks may lead to more exposures to obesity, food, eating, sedentary activities, and acceptance of these. In fact, a recent year-long study that captured objective assessments of social interactions among first year dormitory residents found the number of interactions with weight gaining others accounted for 1/3rd of the variance in one-year weight gain. We seek in the proposed study to assess, compare, and test the influence of social and physical micro- environments and emotions on inactivity and eating in 300 urban poor black and white women. Our Aim 1 involves novel data collection via GPS, Bite Counters, and accelerometers to obtain location and behavior data and a hybrid of ecological momentary assessment and the day reconstruction method to obtain social interaction and emotion data. In our Aim 2 randomized trial, these data are used to test hypotheses about micro-environments and weight change. Each individual's Aim 1 data are used to test whether messages in the form of health-related words and images at the time and location each woman's data indicate she is vulnerable to eating or sedentary activity affect weight change. This work will inform next-generation weight loss programs and advance our understanding of automatic behaviors in health and health disparities."
"9277733","CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The central theme of the Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) program is to translate its research findings into practice and policy to improve the prevention, detection, treatment, and control of cancer. The CPC program strives to enhance the quality of life of all individuals affected by cancer, including a large African American population served within the MCC catchment area. MCC received distinction as a Minority Based NCI Oncology Research Program Community Site to further advance research in this important area of need. Additionally, CPC clinical trials and much of the program?s basic science research addresses disparities in this population. The CPC program has 36 members representing 12 departments and 4 schools. Currently, the CPC program has a total peer-reviewed cancer-related funding base of approximately $6.5 million in direct costs, of which nearly $2.3 million is from the NCI and over $3 million is from other NIH institutes. During 2011 to 2015, the CPC program had a total of 475 publications, of which 22% were intraprogrammatic and 10% were interprogrammatic. The scientific goals of the program are highlighted by its themes of (1) reducing cancer risk and (2) improving cancer-related care, both of which are tied together by the cross-cutting theme of alleviating disparities. CPC continues to achieve significant impact in these areas as evidenced by the program?s accomplishments of: translating MCC basic science findings into clinical trials for a novel smoking cessation therapy (now in phase IIa clinical trials in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute); informing the FDA and WHO tobacco policy on modified-risk tobacco products such as e-cigarettes with CPC?s first multi-PI P50 grant; decreasing cancer risk through obesity control in high-risk populations? adolescents and African Americans; improving cancer screening decision making; enhancing patient and caregiver experience with cancer care; identifying Medicaid and other policy effects on access to care; identifying barriers to African American enrollment in clinical research trials; and developing methods to overcome these barriers. In line with the NCI priority to foster multidisciplinary research, MCC has facilitated cross-cutting collaborations by generating an award program dedicated to CPC interprogrammatic pilot projects, several of which have recently led to large externally-funded grant projects. Value is added by MCC shared resources and CPC-sponsored education and training through monthly seminars, interprogrammatic research retreats, competitive CPC pilot grants, and through support of student and trainee fellowships. In summary, the CPC program is a vital, dynamic, and growing program within MCC, which addresses the unique needs of the MCC catchment area, as well as the nation more generally. The program, with its vibrant research agenda, engaged multidisciplinary membership, and ongoing support from MCC is well poised to continue to build upon the impact of its high-quality basic science, clinical, policy, and outcomes research."

"9480212","PROJECT SUMMARY Disorders of transepithelial ion transport underlie clinical disorders of extracellular volume, blood pressure, and electrolytes, but molecular mechanisms of transepithelial ion transport are difficult to directly examine in the mammalian nephron. The applicants' long-term goal is to better understand epithelial ion transport mechanisms relevant to human kidney function, in sufficient molecular detail to define new therapeutic strategies. The overall objective of this application is to identify regulators of a kinase cascade, consisting of WNK (With No Lysine) and SPAK/OSR1 (Ste20-related proline alanine rich kinase/oxidative stress response) kinases, that plays an essential role in sodium and potassium homeostasis through the regulation of renal transepithelial ion transport. The application builds on three recent findings: Cl- directly binds to the WNK kinase domain to inhibit autophosphorylation and activation; the scaffold protein Mo25 (Mouse protein 25/Cab39) enhances the activity of SPAK/OSR1; and low potassium diet activates WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling. The central hypothesis is that transepithelial ion flux is directly regulated by transported ions (Cl- and K+) through modulation of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling, while Mo25 provides additional regulatory control. The rationale is that better understanding of these molecular mechanisms will allow the design of novel therapeutics with fewer off-target effects. Guided by strong preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the roles of Cl- and K+ in the regulation of WNK isoforms in transepithelial ion transport; 2) Determine the role of Mo25 in WNK signaling in a transporting epithelium; and 3) Probe tubule physiology using newly developed chemical WNK inhibitors. The approach is innovative by bridging fundamental molecular insights gained from biophysical studies, with the functional physiological roles of those molecular mechanisms, using newly developed platforms and tools to probe questions of transporting epithelium biology. Assays have been established, and demonstrated feasible in the investigators' hands, to examine regulation of Drosophila and mammalian WNKs by Cl- and K+ in vitro and in the fly renal tubule, and to measure intracellular Cl- in live tubules, with temporal resolution; and to measure transepithelial ion flux in genetically modified, or pharmacologically treated, tubules. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance understanding of molecular mechanisms of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 regulation in a transporting renal epithelium. The studies will determine: 1) how quickly changes in intracellular Cl- change WNK activity; 2) whether WNKs act as K+ sensors; and 3) the role of Mo25 in transepithelial ion transport. In addition, these studies will further develop recently identified pharmacological WNK inhibitors, which will be a useful tool for further probing the biology of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling in Drosophila and mammalian systems, and potentially serve as the basis for future development of therapeutic compounds for the treatment of volume overload, hypertension and hyperkalemia.  "

"9269623","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The sequencing of the human genome marked the beginning of a collective scientific expedition to understand complex organisms. Genes, of course, merely contain the instructions for which proteins will populate the cell. Untangling the multi-faceted networks that regulate complex organisms and their diseases will require innovative technologies to globally monitor many classes of biomolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites. High-throughput technologies for gene and transcript measurement are well-developed and broadly accessible, and, as such, have had a fantastic and transformative impact on modern biology and medicine. For numerous reasons, methods for global analysis of proteins and metabolites - crucial biological effector molecules - are less evolved and markedly less accessible. The overarching mission of my program is to (1) facilitate expedient, comprehensive analysis of proteins and metabolites by innovating new mass spectrometric technologies and (2) apply these techniques to advance biomedical research. To accomplish these goals we center our efforts on four main areas: Instrumentation and Informatics, Proteomic Methodology, Metabolomics, and Biomedical Applications. First, leveraging our extensive electron transfer dissociation (ETD) development history, we plan to expand our ability to interrogate many currently intractable peptides, post-translational modification (PTMs), and other biomolecules. Second, with these and other tools, we will simplify and expedite proteome analysis; we envision analyzing an entire proteome (>10,000 proteins) or PTMome (>10,000 phosphorylation sites) in hours, or even minutes. Third, by development of novel chemical instrumentation and software tools, we will advance the field of metabolite profiling and discovery. Finally, the above mentioned technologies are most meaningfully developed in the context of relevant biology and, therefore, we plan to apply our innovative tools to many cutting-edge biomedical projects."
"9265433","Project Summary / Abstract  The Single Cell Profiling Core of the DFCI-PSOC is a virtual infrastructure led by Dr. Fan who has been  serving in this role since 2012 for the current DFCI-PSOC. The core provides the capability of characterizing  single cells at the omics level in order to dissect intra-clonal cellular heterogeneity, discover molecular  correlates, and refine the parameters used to gauge tumor cell fitness in computational modeling. Specifically,  the core will support all three projects, focused on hematologic, brain and breast cancer, respectively, by  offering services to measure the transcriptome, epigenome, and proteomic signatures in single cells isolated  from either `winner' clones or therapeutically resistant clones. Because fractional killing is common even within  individual clones, it is highly desired to conduct single cell profiling in conjunction with computational analysis  to identify molecular correlates associated with the most aggressive fraction and refine the parameters for  modeling tumor cell fitness. While researchers in individual projects will carry out tracking clonal growth and  molecular signature changes of each clone, the core will characterize cellular heterogeneity within individual  clones, especially at the omics level, which remains challenging. The core is positioned to address this critical  need and to enhance the PSOC's ability to probe cancer clonal evolution in a more systematic and granular  manner. In parallel, the core is a technology innovation center that aims to develop new technology platforms  (e.g., single cell methylome profiling, single cell protein secretome profiling) to enable new opportunities of  scientific discoveries that cannot be achieved using the existing tools."
"9312866","The use of deep hypothermia (<20°C) for cerebral protection ushered in the modern era of safe and effective operations on the heart and aorta. In large part due to advanced circulatory management strategies, surgical procedures on the proximal aorta and arch utilizing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest have steadily increased over the last decade. Despite these advances, neurologic complications remain a sobering limitation. Indeed, 7%-13% of patients endure permanent neurologic dysfunction. In addition, postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) occurs in 36% of cardiac surgery patients at 6 weeks after surgery, and importantly, persists in 42% of patients up to 5 years after surgery and reduces quality of life. Although deep hypothermia has been the standard of care for decades in adult patients requiring circulatory arrest, moderate hypothermia is now more commonly used in many centers. However, this transition to moderate temperatures has been based entirely on observational studies that have not adequately assessed neurological or neurocognitive outcomes. Little is more devastating to a patient or the patient's family than to have a successful operation that prolongs life, but is complicated by cognitive impairment resulting in a diminished quality of life and loss of functional in- dependence. The long-term goal of our multidisciplinary Neurologic Outcome Research Group is to understand the mechanisms underlying neurologic and neurocognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery, and to reduce the incidence of these devastating outcomes. In the proposed study, we will test our hypothesis that deep hypo- thermia (<20°C) during surgical circulatory arrest limits POCD and preserves brain connectivity to a greater degree than moderate hypothermia (24.1°C-28°C) and that low hypothermia (20.1°C-24°C) is non-inferior to deep hypothermia. Thus the primary aims of our prospective, randomized clinical trial are to 1) determine the effect of deep vs low vs moderate hypothermia on neurocognitive function and quality of life after surgical cir- culatory arrest; 2) determine the effect of deep vs low vs moderate hypothermia on brain connectivity and met- abolic signatures of neuronal damage following surgical circulatory arrest; and 3) determine how temperature management affects leukocyte SUMOylation patterns as a mechanism of inflammatory modulation in surgeries employing circulatory arrest. Our proposed study will be the first randomized trial to evaluate the effects of deep vs low vs moderate hypothermia during circulatory arrest on neurocognitive function and functional brain connectivity. Our preliminary data strongly supports a detrimental effect of moderate hypothermia during circu- latory arrest and thus this study is likely to dramatically alter practice and improve patient safety. This study will also be the first study in humans to assess the role of the small ubiquitin-like modifier conjugation pathway in protecting the brain during cardiac surgery requiring circulatory arrest. Thus, this study is significant, and will vertically advance the field of cardiac surgery by revolutionizing our understanding of the effects of hypother- mia on neurologic and neurocognitive outcomes, by providing strong evidence for optimal hypothermic tem- peratures during surgical circulatory arrest, and by identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention to in- crease the resistance of organs to a transient interruption in blood supply."
"9263830","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxidative stress is a major component of a number of cardiovascular pathologies associated with high mortality and/or morbidity. For instance unstable atherosclerotic plaque, aortic aneurysm, and myocardial infarction (MI) each have strong inflammatory aspects resulting in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We hypothesize that the ability to noninvasively image and quantify ROS will have a major impact on detection and monitoring of inflammation in the context of treatment. For example, stimulating endogenous cardiac repair mechanisms with stem cell therapy holds promise to potentially reverse the damages accrued during a heart attack. However, cell therapies face the challenge of surviving the hostile microenvironment of the acute infarction, where the combination of ischemic injury and infiltrating inflammatory cells lead to high concentrations of ROS that limit engrafted cell survival and endogenous repair. Noninvasive imaging of ROS in this context could inform on the best time post-MI to engraft the cells or could be used to monitor the effect of adjuvants (e.g. antioxidants) on ameliorating the hostile infarct microenvironment to promote cell survival.  Noninvasive ROS imaging has been attempted with limited success. Nuclear-based techniques suffer poor resolution, while optical probes are limited by poor tissue penetration of light. MRI offers high resolution and deep tissue penetration and can be used to assess ROS pre-clinically. Gadolinium-based probes have been developed to generate increased signal in the presence of myeloperoxidase and have been used to image ROS in animal models of MI, atherosclerosis, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. However, the gadolinium probes are limited by low sensitivity, low dynamic range, and difficulty in quantification. We recently invented a class of manganese (Mn) based probes that utilize oxidation state change (redox) to exhibit unprecedented dynamic range in detection of ROS compared to other MR probes. Preliminary data indicates that the sensitivity of these probes can be at least an order of magnitude higher than gadolinium and that absolute quantification of ROS is feasible.  In this K25 application I will expand this Mn chemistry to develop and deploy an optimized, clinically translatable ROS-sensing probe for quantitative imaging of myocardial inflammation. My career objective is to independently develop and translate new chemistries and imaging probes to interrogate the molecular mechanisms that underlie human cardiovascular disease and therapeutic interventions. This research plan builds upon my preliminary findings and leverages my skills in chemistry and biophysics. However to achieve this goal I require additional skills in MR imaging, cardiac pathophysiology, molecular and cell biology, ex vivo tissue analysis, grant writing and grant management. I have addressed these gaps with bench and theoretical training provided by my mentoring team, supplemented with didactic courses offered by Harvard, MIT and MGH. I plan to direct the results of the research plan toward an R01 proposal that I will submit in year 4."

"9266232","Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease characterized by impaired regulation of pulmonary hemodynamics and vascular growth. The excessive growth and dysfunction of endothelial cells that line the blood vessels in PAH is the continuing focus of our research. In the current award period, we established primary cell culture methods from PAH lungs; mechanistically linked low levels of nitric oxide (NO) to PAH in humans; identified pathologic expression of HIF-1? and its role in the metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis in PAH; and defined a novel myelopulmonary disease paradigm in PAH pathogenesis. In this extension, the hypotheses and aims remain well within the scope of the award. In Aim 1, we define mechanisms of low NO production by PAH pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC). We hypothesize that low NO production is due to reduced activity of the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and plan to uncover mechanisms. We will measure intracellular NO production in PAEC in real time and define functional endophenotypes. Because eNOS activity depends on tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), we will quantify H4B in PAEC and serum of patients in comparison to controls. Likewise, we investigate intracellular mechanisms that regulate eNOS phosphorylation states, i.e. kinase and phosphatase pathways. In Aim 2, we identify HIF-1? expression in PAH and the mechanisms accounting for expression. We hypothesize that HIF-1? expression is fundamental in the pathologic angiogenesis and preferential energy generation by glycolysis in PAH. We determine mitochondrial and glycolytic bioenergetics in PAH PAEC and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. We extend mechanistic studies to iron metabolism, which is important to understanding HIF-1? and bioenergetics. We measure hepcidin in PAH patients in comparison to healthy people to test the hypothesis that higher hepcidin accounts for lower iron in PAH. In Aim 3, we determine consequences and relevance of HIF-expression and myeloproliferative processes to pathophysiology of PAH. We hypothesize that HIF- expression is mechanistically important to PAH pathogenesis by establishing a pathologic myeloproliferative process that consequently promotes and sustains the proliferative panvasculopathy of PAH. We test .the effects of transplantation of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells isolated from PAH bone marrow into NOD-SCID mice. Similarly, we plan mechanistic transplantation experiments using marrows from Caveolin-1 deficient mice, which develop pulmonary hypertension when exposed to hypoxia. We will quantitate lung vasculature, activation and injury of vascular endothelium, and cardiac function in the Wild type mice that receive Caveolin-1 deficient stem cells. Overall, in this extension of the MERIT, our long-term goal remains the same: to define the pathophysiology of abnormal pulmonary vascular growth and endothelial dysfunction, and in so doing, apply the knowledge to improve the care of patients with PAH."

"9343411","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY - Administrative Core The goals of the Administrative Core are to provide streamline governance of our center and to promote collaboration and integration among experimental and computational researchers. The leadership will be responsible for the oversight and effective management of the Core in order to enhance intra- and inter-center communication and to facilitate data dissemination through the NCI's Research Center for Cancer Systems Biology (RCCSB) Consortium. The Executive Committee (EC) is consisted of eight members who are leaders of three projects and three cores. These EC members will monitor monthly progress of omics studies and outreach/training activities, conduct scientific reviews of Intra-center Pilot Project (IPP) applications, and prioritize access to high-performance computing servers and to biospecimens including primary tumors, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines, and circulating tumor cells. A four-member panel of Internal Advisory Board (IAB) will meet quarterly to provide ongoing feedback and to advise new directions of cancer omics research within our center. To foster innovative ideas of cancer omics research, the Administrative Core will encourage IPP applications from mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers, and biophysicists who are interested in interfacing with biomedical researchers in participating institutions. Prior evidence of omics research is not necessary for submission of a proposal although an eventual avenue for integrative and translational applications should be apparent. Funding of IPPs is supported in part by the proposed RCCSB budget and matching funds from the Alice P. McDermott Endowment at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. A robust and transparent peer review process will be established to evaluate submitted proposals and to regularly review the progress of funded proposals. In addition, two mentors ? one experimentalist and one computational modeler will be assigned to each junior awardee to instill the concept of team-oriented research and to monitor career development of the awardee in systems biology. The leadership of this Core will recruit four prominent scientists from outside of our center with expertise in 4D nucleome, omics data integration, or anti-hormone therapy. These External Advisory Board (EAB) members will independently conduct annual reviews of all aspects of our intra- and inter-center research activities, including experimental designs, statistical and mathematical approaches, translational applications, mentoring and outreach training, and administrative effectiveness. The EAB will provide recommendations regarding continuation and alterations of specific sub-aims or objectives of each project and core. Other recommendations by EAB are expected to expand the horizon of our cancer omics research. Thus, through these administrative mechanisms the Core will promote high-quality, team-oriented, and niche-focused research in our proposed U54 center."

"9272338","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):    The Mouse Models Core (Core B) will be responsible for providing the investigators of this Program Project with the tissues and cells necessary to achieve their experimental aims. Experiments in this Program Project focus on mice, both naturally aged mice and a unique strain of mice engineered to age rapidly, which will accelerate the pace of research. Novel strains of double mutant mice, reporter mice, and mice with accelerated aging of one tissue at a time will be bred to address the overarching question- does stochastic, endogenous damage promote aging via a cell autonomous or non-autonomous mechanism? In addition to the genetic approaches, treatment studies will be conducted on mice in Core B to test specific hypotheses about the contribution of oxidative stress, signaling pathways and adult stem cell attrition to aging. By coordinating the creation of animal cohorts and exposure studies within this Core, it will be possible to standardize methods and quality control, which will improve the reproducibility of in vivo experiments, minimize animal use and costs, and dramatically improve the sensitivity of analytical approaches to quantify aging (e.g. histopathology and proteomics). In addition, this centralized Core supports an integrated systems biology approach to the study of aging because all of the following information will be obtained for each animal studied via sharing specimens with each ofthe other projects and cores: Vital statistics, age at onset of aging-related symptoms, organ dysfunction and histopathology: Core B Level of ROS, mitochondrial function, cell death and senescence, identification of cell types affected: Core C Level of oxidative DNA damage: Project 1 Activation of NF-kB and signaling in response to cellular damage and inflammation: Project 2 Adult stem cell function: Project 3"
"9267523","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A critical need continues to exist for a robust supply of clinician scientists with formal training in pediatric clinical pharmacology. Without trained investigators the goal of optimizing use of medications for individual children cannot be realized. The Indiana University Department of Pediatrics and Division of Clinical Pharmacology are uniquely positioned to address this need. A strong, well-established group of clinical pharmacology investigators has the advantage of being located directly adjacent to one of the strongest pediatric research environments in the US: Riley Hospital for Children, with a Department of Pediatrics consistently ranked in the top 10 in NIH funding. This renewal seeks to continue a formal pediatric clinical pharmacology and therapeutics training program in parallel with their long-standing clinical pharmacology training program, which has a track record of excellence in training successful translational clinician scientists. There are three main components to the Indiana University Postdoctoral Research Training in Pediatric Clinical and Developmental Pharmacology: 1) completion of a two to three year formal didactic curriculum, at the end of which the trainee may receive a master's degree in clinical research; 2) organized pediatric participation in a personalized therapeutics seminar series and weekly journal club; and 3) active involvement in pediatric therapeutics research under the mentorship of one of the faculty members associated with the program. The program faculty selects trainees for the 2 to 3 year program based on their potential as clinician scientists from candidates with MD or MD/ PhD degrees who qualify for primary specialty certification. Exceptional PhD or PharmD candidates with experience and goals related to the objectives of the program may be selected. We propose to continue supporting a total of three postdoctoral fellows at any given time. Those who complete the program will develop core competencies in clinical and translational research methods, biostatistics, clinical trials, research ethics, scientific writing, and grant writing. Thy will also be provided with a structured research mentoring program with an explicit timeline and benchmarks. In depth training focusing on pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics, drug development, individualized therapeutics, clinical trial design, modeling and bioethics is included in a didactic lecture series required of all trainees. Trainees may also participate in the Clinica Investigator Training Enhancement program supported by the Indiana CTSI and resulting in an MS in Clinical Investigation. Coursework combined with supervised research experience will result in development of a highly trained cadre of investigators with broad, deep, cutting edge training experiences preparing them for successful careers in pediatric clinical and translational pharmacology. A large, diverse patient population coupled with the depth, breadth and flexibility imparted by cutting edge Clinical Pharmacology training and strong clinical, translational and basic research infrastructure in the Department of Pediatrics at IUSM offer an exceptional opportunity designed to generate leaders in this field."
"9272340","The long-term objective of this project is to identify the mechanism by which damage, in particular damage to the nuclear genome that arises spontaneously as a consequence of endogenous processes, promotes aging-related degenerative changes. The current model is that stochastic damage promotes aging via a cell autonomous mechanism, i.e., by driving cell senescence or cell death. We seek to challenge this model by carefully examining how spontaneous DNA damage drives aging in a mouse model of a human progeriod syndrome caused by a defect in DNA repair. The approach will be to combine unique genetic and mass spectrometry tools to accomplish the following aims:  1) To use highly sensitive LC-MS/MS/MS assays to measure endogenous oxidative DNA lesions in tissues of progeroid and wild-type mice at multiple ages and determine if the level of damage predicts the extent of aging-related pathology in each of these tissues.  2) To genetically deplete DNA repair in one tissue or cell type at a time and determine the impact on those cells, neighboring cells and distant tissues, to determine if damage drives aging via a cell-autonomous or non-autonomous mechanism.  3) To use parabiosis between normal and progeroid mice to determine if circulating factors can overcome accelerated aging due to too much DNA damage.  4) To use unbiased and targeted proteomics approaches to identify systemic signals activated in response to genotoxic stress and old age.      Successful completion of these aims is anticipated to yield novel information about the aging process and if there are common underlying mechanisms for multiple aging-related diseases. The proteomics work may yield new biomarkers of biologic age. In addition, extension of our preliminary work via this project is anticipated to yield rational strategies to extend healthspan ofthe elderly by reducing stochastic damage and/or inhibiting the damage responses that promote aging."

"9386180","Project Summary Human malaria, responsible for inordinate mortality, morbidity and economic loss worldwide, is caused by protozoan parasites in the genus Plasmodium that are obligatorily transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. Failure of traditional control methodologies has stimulated efforts to develop novel strategies to control the mosquito vectors of malaria, particularly An. gambiae. While transgenic manipulation of Anopheles species has been accomplished, routine manipulation of An. gambiae has proven challenging, and the technology to do so is not broadly available among non-specialized laboratories. The development of novel, easy to use tools for routine forward genetics in An. gambiae is critical for both applied strategies for malaria control and basic research into the genetics and host/parasite interactions of this important mosquito vector species. Densonucleosis viruses, or ?densoviruses? (DNVs), are single-stranded DNA viruses in the family Parvoviridae with very small genomes (4-6 kb) that are flanked by terminal hairpin structures at the 5-prime and 3-prime ends. The entire viral genome can be placed into an infectious plasmid from which functional virus will be produced upon transfection into an appropriate cell line. In our laboratory, we have identified only known densovirus (AgDNV) capable of infection and dissemination in Anopheles gambiae. AgDNV replicates preferentially in adult mosquito tissues to very high titer, but is completely non-pathogenic. We have developed and validated novel techniques to use AgDNV to express secreted effectors or microRNAs that can modulate or alter patterns of Anopheles gene expression. Our overall hypothesis is that AgDNV can be used overexpress or knock down expression of specific genes of interest in Anopheles gambiae, leading to phenotypes of basic and applied importance. This overall hypothesis will be addressed in the following specific aims: 1) Develop an AgDNV-based gene transduction system for routine forward genetics in An. gambiae, focusing on modulation of Plasmodium falciparum infection/transmission; 2) Develop an AgDNV-based system for routine reverse genetics in Anopheles gambiae, focusing on modulation of P. falciparum infection/transmission and mosquito fitness; 3) Characterize and quantify AgDNV infection of the male mosquito reproductive system, and determine the potential for using auto-dissemination to introduce AgDNV into mosquito cage populations. This research will result in the development of a novel toolset for addressing basic questions in Anopheles and Plasmodium biology, as well as the development of potential control agents for human malaria."
"9440083","Pediatric cardiovascular disorders, which comprise congenital heart defects (CHD) and myocardial and conduction system diseases, remain highly challenging due to cardiac co-morbidities and premature mortality. As most of these disorders are genetic, efforts over the past 30 years have focused on identifying their causal mutations. Particularly for Mendelian traits such as Noonan syndrome and related disorders (the RASopathies), this has been highly successful. Newer genomic technologies have accelerated gene discovery for pediatric cardiovascular disorders, including genetically complex ones. These genetic discoveries are improving care through more accurate diagnosis, better prognostication, and refinement of clinical trial design. What has not occurred with rare exception is the development of novel therapies based on the new understanding of disease pathogenesis enabled by these gene discoveries. Finding therapies for pediatric cardiovascular disorders will be challenging because the biological targets are generally central to cell homeostasis (e.g., RAS/MAP kinase signaling) so cannot be completely inhibited for long periods without incurring side effects that would outweigh their benefits. For this R35 mechanism, I and my outstanding co- investigators with relevant expertise intend to address this gap using a drug development pipeline that begins with high-throughput screening to overcome pupal lethality in Drosophila melanogaster models of disease with a chemical library that covers druggable space (n=14,400) using 96-well plates and robotics. Screening in whole animals is performed agnostically and has the putative advantage of providing a simultaneous read out of efficacy and toxicity. We provide preliminary data showing that we have already achieved this using a fly RAF1 mutant model of Noonan syndrome with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Subsequent steps with fruit flies include confirmation of initial hits in vials, determining efficacy against adult fly phenotypes such as rough eye, ectopic wing veins and heart hypertrophy. Back-up libraries for the candidate compounds, typically 60-80 chemical neighbors, will be culled for ones with most desirable drug traits and then screened in the fly models. Using a defined set of fruit fly deficiency lines, targets and anti-targets will be established to enable further rounds of rational pharmacology. ADME studies will be used to reduce potential for drug-drug interactions. In parallel, we will pursue repurposing of FDA-approved drugs using library screening with fruit fly models and systems pharmacogenomics. Leading compounds and drugs will then be tested against phenotypes in human induced pluripotent stem cell lines with the disease-causing mutation for efficacy. The most promising drugs will then be tested in existing mouse models (e.g., HCM in Raf1 mutant mice) using appropriate endpoints. Taken as a whole, the approach proposed will significantly advance the identification of novel therapeutics for pediatric cardiovascular diseases, starting with the RASopathies and later for other traits. If robust, this will provide a paradigm that can be adopted for other genetic traits of interest to the NHLBI."
"9262201","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project, which builds upon our previous R34 NIDCR Planning and Feasibility study, is designed to examine the efficacy of a sensory adapted dental environment (SADE) to enhance children's oral care. Two groups will be studied: children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically developing (TD) children. Children with ASD, and a subset of TD children, exhibit sensory over-responsivity when confronted with experiential aspects of dental visits such as exposure to bright fluorescent lighting, touch in or around the mouth, or the texture and smell of various oral care products. This often results in increased anxiety and negative behavioral responses, which hinder the dentist's ability to perform treatment. In the proposed project, we test a SADE intervention designed to reduce children's anxiety and negative responses during oral care. The SADE intervention includes adaptations such as dimmed lighting, moving projections on the ceiling (fish, bubbles), exposure to soothing music, and application of a butterfly vest with wings that wrap around the child to provide calming sensations.  The specific aims are to conduct a randomized clinical trial in order to: 1. Determine if SADE, relative to a regular dental environment (RDE), reduces physiological anxiety and negative responses (behavioral distress, perception of pain, sensory discomfort) during dental cleaning for children with ASD and TD children and test whether SADE's effect is greater for the ASD group. 2. Identify whether physiological anxiety mediates the beneficial effects of the intervention and whether severity of ASD and communication ability (ASD group), or dental anxiety, sensory over-responsivity, and age (both groups) act as moderating variables. 3. Assess the quality of care and cost effectiveness/savings of the dental cleaning associated with SADE.  Research participants will be 220 ethnically diverse children aged 6-12 years, 110 with ASD and 110 TD. Using a randomized counterbalanced study design, each child will undergo two dental cleanings four months apart: one dental cleaning in RDE and one dental cleaning in SADE.  This project is significant because it is the first full-scale trial of an intervention designed to reduce oral care problems in children with ASD. It is theoretically important because it will elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the effects of the SADE intervention and help to identify which subgroups of children, both TD and with ASD, which will benefit most from this approach. Based on the study findings, we will develop a model to transform the standard of pediatric dental care by modifying the sensory qualities of the dental environment; this model will have the potential to be utilized in dental clinics worldwide. As such the project promises to have a major public health impact insofar as the potential gains in oral health, child comfort, and cost-savings will be dramatic, potentially applying to more than one-fourth of all children."
"9353018","OVERALL ABSTRACT The use of antiretroviral therapy to turn HIV infection into a chronic disease has been a major medical advancement. However, along with this has been the recognition of sequelae of HIV as a chronic condition, with end-organ consequences such as the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), as the brain is a target of HIV, and interactions with disease associated with aging. Indeed, the face of HIV infection is changing to an older population, and soon over half of infected individuals in the U.S. will be 50 years of age or greater. As age is the largest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, this graying of the HIV pandemic is a critical focus of study especially for the central nervous system. Furthermore, the brain can provide a reservoir for HIV, impacting efforts to find a functional cure. NIH P30 Centers support shared resources and facilities for research in a focused field. Here, we propose to build upon striking successes we have made in multiple areas to continue the UNMC Chronic HIV Infection and Aging in NeuroAIDS (CHAIN) Center. We have revised the Center based on our findings and current issues and needs in the field, and these closely follow the new NIH priority topics for using AIDS-designated funds, including neurological complications, comorbidies, cross-cutting basic research, long-acting therapeutics, and reservoir and cure. Through this Center mechanism, we will significantly facilitate research and accomplishments across these areas. Experts in a number of fields will direct Imaging, Therapeutics, Cell- Tissue-Animal, and Omics Cores. These, combined with a Developmental Core to stimulate new and innovative work and an Administrative Core to integrate and run the Center, will serve to significantly enhance our knowledge of neuroAIDS, its prevention and treatment, while joining others in work for an overall cure for HIV."
"9302472","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell-cell adhesion defines solid tissues, and dysregulation of adhesion is an essential step in cancer cell metastasis. The protein aE-catenin has critical roles in cell and tissue development by transducing mechanical tension between cadherin cell adhesion molecules and the actin cytoskeleton into biochemical signals. We will investigate the molecular basis of how aE-catenin structure changes in response to force, and how its molecular behavior contributes to the formation and dissociation of cell-cell contacts. Our approach is to use a combination of rigorous biochemical characterization (Weis) and innovative single-molecule optical trapping assays (Dunn) to discover how the protein a-catenin both reinforces cell-cell junctions and triggers downstream signal transduction in response to mechanical stress. This question has deep biomedical significance, since a-catenin is known to be required for the formation of multicellular tissues and is a central player in both organogenesis and cancer metastasis.  Cell biological data show that a-catenin and its binding partner ß-catenin are required to link the intracellular adhesion protein E-cadherin (epithelial cadherin) to the actin cytoskeleton. However, the a- catenin/ß-catenin/E-cadherin does not bind actin in bulk biochemical assays. In preliminary work, we used a novel single-molecule optical trap assay to show that the cadherin/catenin ternary complex can indeed bind actin, but only in the presence of mechanical load. Further, we find that the strength of the a-catenin-actin bond increases with mechanical load, and that binding of the cadherin/catenin complex to the actin filament is highly cooperative. The implication of these findings is that a-catenin acts as a force sensitive linker that can reinforce cell-cell contacts in response to mechanical load. This mechanism provides an elegant means to maintain tissue integrity in the presence of mechanical strain, and provides an explanation for how cells may sense tension at cell-cell junctions, a topic of intense current interest. However, how exactly a-catenin senses mechanical tension is not known.  We will use a combination of biochemical and single-molecule biophysical approaches to: 1) determine the molecular mechanism by which a-catenin forms a force-sensitive linkage between cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton; and 2) discover how cooperative structural transformations in a-catenin, actin, or both regulate binding between the cadherin/catenin complex and filamentous actin. These measurements will reveal the molecular mechanism by which a-catenin senses force at cell-cell junctions. In addition, this work will provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how groups of cadherin-catenin complexes work in concert to remodel cell-cell junctions in response to changes in mechanical load, with potentially broad implications for our understanding of epithelial remodeling and morphogenesis."
"9324260","Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes."
"9479765","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal is to understand the mechanisms of synaptic vesicle release and recovery that permit the accurate encoding of sound over wide dynamic ranges over varying times scales. The calyx of Held/MNTB synapse in the auditory brainstem is a key connection in this pathway since it provides precise timing and activates sustained inhibition to key binaural cell groups. Its large size has made it an experimentally accessible entry point into understanding the mechanisms and function of these synaptic connections. The calyx can be driven by sound at high rates, operates in the background of varying spontaneous firing rates, and yet must be relatively immune to acoustically noisy backgrounds. How is this achieved? Since the presynapse has a finite supply of fusion competent synaptic vesicles (SVs), termed the readily releasable pool (RRP), the release and replenishment of the RRP must be balanced to sustain transmission. Priming, the creation of fusion competent SVs at the active zone (AZ) that can be released in response to action potentials (APs), is a key regulatory pathway that regulates the RRP release and replenishment to sustain transmitter release. Ultimately, the molecular mechanisms that regulate priming underlie efficient release and replenishment of SVs underpins sound encoding. Therefore we aim to define the molecular mechanisms that ensure availability of release competent SVs throughout a wide range of AP firing rates to support the early stages of auditory processing. As release and replenishment of the RRP is necessary in all synapses to encode information over varying timescales, our data will have broad relevance to understanding how synaptic communication leads to information transfer in neural networks."
"9310678","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Chronic spinal pain is associated with loss of function and significant disability. When spine pain is comorbid with fibromyalgia, symptom severity and disability are amplified. Interventions capable of improving functional status, reducing symptoms, and enhancing well-being are critically needed. Both medications and cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) have demonstrated similar, modest effects for reducing symptoms in chronic pain. Behavioral treatments for chronic pain like CBT act predominantly by decreasing negative states rather than by Resilience-based interventions target the enhancement of positive emotions and well-being rather than focusing solely on negative emotions and behaviors. Although relatively under-used in chronic pain populations, resilience-based interventions have been used successfully in other clinical settings including depression, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and HIV. promoting positive states associated with resilience. Thus, adding resilience-enhancing strategies to CBT for pain holds promise for further enhancing the effectiveness of CBT. In addition, most current behavioral interventions require specialized training and as such are not widely available. Medical assistants (MAs) are well-positioned in the healthcare system to play a pivotal role in helping individuals with chronic pain improve their functional abilities through innovative self-management strategies. The MA-led self-management programs proposed herein leverage the unique training and capabilities of MAs, while considering minimizing costs and maintaining the flow of clinical practice. The benefits of resilience- enhanced CBT that targets increasing patient well-being are also expected to extend beyond pain to potentially include genomic effects. Telomere shortening is predictive of disease and mortality and is considered an index for premature cellular aging. Our pilot data suggest that in addition to age and other physical and psychological stressors, inadequately managed pain can also affect telomere attrition. Thus, in addition to demonstrating the efficacy of online CBT self-management with resilience-enhancing activities (CBTRE), this application seeks to evaluate the impact of CBTRE on telomere health. Our central hypothesis is that our MA-supported CBTRE program will demonstrate superior efficacy to standard MA-supported online CBT self-management (eCBT) alone (Aim 1) through the enhancement of well-being (Aim 2). Both the CBTRE and eCBT interventions will improve telomere health with greater benefits being attributable to the CBTRE condition due to the mediating benefits of well-being (Aim 3). Therefore, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 300 individuals with spinal pain who also meet fibromyalgia criteria to investigate the effectiveness of the CBTRE program in promoting functional status, improved symptoms, and genomic health using resources already in most medical settings (i.e., MAs). By demonstrating the ability of this self-management intervention to improve physical function, pain and other symptoms, as well as telomere health, we hope to improve the options available for the care of millions of people who suffer with chronic spinal pain."
"9456279","Abstract The obesity epidemic is accelerating at an alarming rate and contributes to the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle modifications, like diet and exercise, have not proven effective as methods to attenuate metabolic dysfunction; thus, new therapeutics are needed to treat obesity related disorders. It is believed that the `spillover' of lipids from adipose tissue into the liver and muscle is the primary etiology of insulin resistance in obesity. Numerous studies have shown obese human subjects exhibit fibrosis, decreased vascularization, inflammation, and hypertrophy of adipocytes, suggesting that the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in the pathology of obesity. The ECM functions to provide mechanical support, however ECM accumulates in the fibrotic interstitial space during obesity, limiting the expansion of adipocytes and inhibiting angiogenesis and adipogenesis. Understanding the mechanics and kinetics of adipose tissue remodeling in order to modulate lipid storage is an intriguing therapeutic strategy. Additionally, identifying myofibroblast progenitor cells in order to attenuate their accumulation during obesity-induced fibrosis may have therapeutic potential. It is well appreciated that myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTFA) regulates myofibroblast activation and tissue remodeling; however, its role in adipose tissue fibrosis is not clear. Our data show that MRTFA null mice are protected from diet-induced insulin resistance and have decreased expression of collagen genes in adipose tissue. We hypothesize that MRTFA mediates adipose tissue remodeling and fibrosis and hence, inhibition of MRTFA may be a potential therapeutic target to facilitate lipid storage and the healthy expansion of adipose tissue. We propose the following three aims to test our hypothesis that adverse adipose tissue remodeling causes metabolic dysfunction. In Aim 1, we will determine whether SMA+ myofibroblasts contribute to the collagen-rich ECM in adipose tissue fibrosis. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of MRTFA in myofibroblast activation in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells and adipose tissue remodeling and fibrosis associated with obesity. In Aim 3, we will determine whether myofibroblasts originate from vascular smooth muscle-like cells using inducible lineage tracing technology to fate-map progenitors to interstitial fibrotic areas. A comprehensive study of adipose tissue remodeling in an obese mouse model will provide new insights into the progression of obesity and fibrosis."
"9421513","DESCRIPTION    Abstract:    Eighty to ninety percent of what most young children learn about the world comes through vision. The same cannot be said when we seek to learn about the inner workings of our own body, because light beyond skin deep becomes diffused due to multiple scattering. Instead, researchers have resorted to alternative means-such as X-ray, magnetic resonance, and ultrasound-to probe deep into the body. Until now, most advances in optical imaging have been geared towards high-resolution functional and molecular imaging at depths less than 1 mm in scattering tissue. The pursuit of deep-tissue optical imaging with high spatial resolution has been stymied by the inherent optical diffusion-the grand challenge since the inception of biomedical optics. We must meet this challenge to reach the full potential of light because it is such a powerful tool from both the physical and biological perspectives. Physically, the tiny fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum that light covers is the only part that probes molecular structures directly; biologically, the ability of molecules to sense, react to, and emit light is encoded on the most fundamental (i.e., genetic) level! In addition, light as nonionizing radiation is as safe to biological organisms as air and water. Therefore, light is the most natural choice fo visualizing biological structures and events, interrogating and controlling biological processes, as well as diagnosing and treating diseases, if only we could overcome the optical diffusion-a seemingly unbreakable barrier. While multiple scattering of light is treated as a problem in conventional wisdom, I believe that it should be part of the solution. Our recent work on time-reversed ultrasonically encoded (TRUE) optical focusing (Nature Photonics 2011) is a first breakthrough in this direction. TRUE focusing can noninvasively deliver light to a dynamically defined focus deep in a scattering medium. This invention opens the door to an even greater paradigm-shifti"

"9480140","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The impact of cocaine addiction on the lives of those who suffer from it, their families and society as a whole is staggering. The specific factors that determine an individuals' risk of transitioning from initial cocaine use to abuse and addiction are largely unknown but a role for genetics has been established. Therefore, identification of specific genes that increase susceptibility to abuse cocaine has been an area of considerable effort in the research community. Attempts to identify genetic loci involved in addiction liabilityin human populations have met with some success but are complicated by lack of environmental control, genetic heterogeneity, the need for large sample sizes and ethical concerns. Genetically stable mouse populations have proven useful for the study of complex human diseases like addiction. While mice will never replicate the entire spectrum of traits that define the human disease state, there are commonly used behavioral models that are believed to faithfully represent key features of addiction. Most drugs of abuse cause psychomotor stimulation when administered acutely and initial sensitivity to a drug has been associated with increased risk for subsequent use and abuse. Therefore, locomotor activation in response to cocaine is often used as a model for addiction-related behavior in mice. It has been known for some time that inbred strains of mice differ widely in their locomotor response to cocaine proving a role for genetics in this complex behavior. More recently, a dense SNP panel has been developed that allows for determination of haplotype structure in inbred mouse strains. These SNP data, along with inbred strain behavioral data, can be used to conduct genome-wide association mapping (GWAS) to identify genomic loci that are associated with cocaine locomotor response. We have recently completed a 45 inbred strain survey of cocaine-induced locomotor response and have identified multiple genetic loci that influence the behavior. The goal of this application is to replicate these QTL in standard intercross (F2) populations and use haplotype information from inbred strains to narrow QTL intervals and identify candidate genes. We also propose to test a set of candidate genes by measuring behavior in knockout lines and by complementation testing. Finally, we propose to examine inbred strains at the extreme ends of the phenotypic distribution in an attempt to uncover the biological mechanisms that contribute to initial locomotor sensitivity to cocaine and may increase risk for addiction."

The overall objective of the Transgenic/Knockout Mouse Shared Resource (TG-KO) is therefore to facilitate timely and cost-effective production and use of GEMMs in cancer research by members of the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC). This objective will be met by producing novel GEMMs (including transgenic, knockout, conditional knockout and knock-in mice) using both conventional and CRISPR/Cas9- based technologies and by providing a full range of support services to facilitate the use of these models, including breeding colony management, mouse genotyping, mouse line rederivation, embryo and sperm cryopreservation and cryorecovery, and consultation. The TG-KO is directed by Jolene Windle, PhD, who has nearly 30 years of experience in the production and use of GEMMs in cancer research, and is supported by 2.5 additional FTEs who bring added expertise in GEMM creation, molecular methods involved in GEMM production and screening, and breeding colony management. The TG-KO is a jointly managed (MCC and VCU) resource that is within close walking distance of MCC member laboratories. The TG-KO facility includes restricted-access laboratory and animal holding space in the barrier vivarium in the Molecular Medicine Research Building, as well as general molecular biology laboratory space on the floor below, all of which is fully equipped for the services provided. The TG-KO does not have fixed hours of operation; however, a subset of staff members is generally present from 8:30 AM until 6:00 PM or later, Monday through Friday. All members of the staff can be readily reached by email, and they typically respond to emails from investigators as soon as possible, often outside of regular work hours. The services provided by the TG-KO are tracked and charged back. Additional support is provided by institutional sources and the Cancer Center Support Grant, which allows the TG-KO to offer its services at rates that are significantly lower than those charged by commercial vendors. The services provided by the TG- KO add value for MCC research by providing necessary services that are not practically obtained or are cost prohibitive through alternative vendors, including other non-profit institutions. Through the combination of in- house expertise and services and highly competitive rates, the TG-KO greatly facilitates the use of GEMMs by MCC members in their basic and translational cancer research efforts.

"9267162","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Personalizing COPD therapies by determining heterogeneity of treatment effects Project Summary/Abstract Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 3rd leading cause of death in the country, affecting nearly 24 million Americans1. COPD is a heterogeneous disease2, making it difficult to personalize treatment decisions. Existing treatment recommendations3 are heavily influenced by severity of airflow obstruction, a poor predictor of outcomes such as exacerbations and death3. Multidimensional indices to predict disease outcomes4,5 and treatment recommendations account for exacerbations and dyspnea3, but do not account for comorbidities, frailty and age-related conditions that are common in COPD. For example, two patients with similar FEV1% predicted and exacerbation frequency will receive the same therapy, regardless of risk for cardiovascular events with long-acting bronchodilators6 or pneumonia with inhaled steroids7,8. Indeed, the recommendations overlook that there are likely to be individuals who will benefit more or less from certain therapies than the average outcome reported from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). This heterogeneity of treatment effects is a novel concept9,10, explained by the fact that RCTs report average results for the average participant, ignoring differences in baseline risk10 and the possibility that treatment benefit varies by baseline risk. Indeed, with a constant relative risk reduction across baseline risk, the absolute benefit of treatment will be lower for te lowest risk patients, so that those at lowest risk may have more adverse than beneficial effects from treatment. This concept, not previously explored in COPD, is relevant to identifying appropriate candidates for different COPD therapies. For example, although azithromycin reduced exacerbations in a RCT11, it has not been adopted by treatment guidelines3 due to concerns about side effects12,13. Subgroup analysis and research on COPD phenotypes have identified patient characteristics impacting outcomes with azithromycin and roflumilast14,15; however, evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effects using multivariate models will provide more nuanced information to guide individual treatment, as has been demonstrated for other diseases16,17. Similarly, existing treatment guidelines and multidimensional indices do not address the growing evidence of premature aging in COPD18-20, an important consideration as COPD patients frequently have impairments in vision, hearing, memory, incontinence, falls, sarcopenia and are at risk for dependency for activities of daily living (all hereafter termed geriatric conditions21). These factors change the baseline risk and are probable contributors to heterogeneity of treatment response22, but have been, so far, overlooked. Most geriatric conditions can be assessed in the office, and sarcopenia can be assessed in clinically-indicated thoracic imaging studies. Incorporating geriatric conditions into models of heterogeneity of treatment effects will allow us to maximize treatment benefits for individual COPD patients23,24. Aligned with the NHLBI goal of translating research into practice, we propose to re-analyze RCTs of COPD treatments to identify heterogeneity of treatment effects and test the hypothesis that adding data on geriatric conditions will yield robust and applicable personalized risk models. We hypothesize that using multivariate models of COPD outcomes will allow us to identify individuals most likely to benefit and less likely to experience harm from COPD interventions and that geriatric conditions will independently contribute to risk of poor COPD outcomes, and that inclusion of geriatric conditions will result in more robust risk models.  This patient-orientd proposal has two key objectives. First, we will use multivariate models of COPD outcomes to re-analyze RCTs to assess heterogeneity of treatment effects, to estimate how the benefits and risks of COPD treatments vary for individuals. Second, we will prospectively determine the burden of geriatric conditions in COPD and test their contribution to more accurate risk models of outcomes, which can be used in the future for similar analysis and to design more efficient and informative RCTs. Our specific aims, focused on individuals ?50 years old with COPD, are: 1) Use risk models of COPD outcomes to identify heterogeneity of treatment effects in COPD; 2) Determine the frequency of geriatric conditions in COPD; and 3) Determine the independent contribution of geriatric conditions to 2-year COPD outcomes. Completion of these studies will generate novel and robust models of COPD outcomes, allowing for identification of subjects most likely to benefit or experience harm from interventions; a first step in developing personalized decisions.  Dr. Martinez has a unique background as a Pulmonologist trained in Public Health, Health Services and Translational Research, with a proven commitment to research and scholarly productivity. This proposal includes an educational plan that will allow him to develop the gaps in his training: focused expertise in novel  analysis of clinical trials and longitudinal studies, geriatric aspects of pulmonary disease, and outcome prediction. These experiences will provide him with the foundation to become an independent investigator in translational research with emphasis on the elderly and personalized medicine. Dr. Martinez will be supported by an outstanding multi-disciplinary mentorship team: Dr. Sandeep Vijan, a pioneer in developing models to inform the delivery of personalized medicine and Dr. MeiLan K. Han, a leader in COPD phenotyping. Drs. Neil B. Alexander, Caroline R. Richardson, and Christine T. Cigolle, leaders in geriatrics, and Dr. Fernando Martinez, a leader in developing treatments for COPD, will serve as advisors."
"9398713","SUMMARY: Stress can precipitate the onset of psychiatric disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and posttraumatic stress disorder. Currently available pharmacotherapies have limited efficacy in anxiety disorders - hence there is an urgent need to identify new approaches that can ameliorate anxiety. Stress-induced abnormalities in neuronal activity lead to long-lasting changes in anxiety, hence targeting the mechanisms underlying these effects in stress-sensitive brain regions may provide new insight for treatment. In rodent and human studies, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has emerged as a key brain region translating stress into sustained changes in anxiety. Repeated stress increases the activity of BNST output neurons, which produce the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). This parallels a state of anxiety, fear and hypervigilance, hallmarks of stress-induced mental disorders. Accordingly, activity of the BNST is elevated in patients suffering from GAD. Therefore, the factors that regulate BNST output have untapped potential as novel therapeutic targets. We propose that one such target may be engaging local inhibitory interneurons to strengthen inhibition of BNST output neurons. Oxytocin (OT) has been shown to inhibit the stress response and reduce anxiety, but the sites or cellular targets of these OT actions remain unclear. BNST neurons express OT receptors and receive OT input from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Our preliminary data indicate that OT activates a subset of inhibitory interneurons in the BNST. Based on this premise, the main objective of this proposal is to establish whether by activating the inhibitory interneurons, OT inhibits BNST output and thus reduces anxiety. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that OT ameliorates stress-induced anxiety-like behavior by engaging interneurons that provide inhibitory control over BNST output (CRF) neurons. This innovative concept will be investigated using cutting- edge experimental approaches, including OT promoter-driven expression of inhibitory DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) to selectively suppress the release of OT in the projection from the PVN to the BNST (OT PVNèBNST pathway). Rigorously designed experiments combining behavioral and electrophysiological measures will test the central hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) Determine the role of OT in the BNST in the regulation of anxiety and fear in male and female rats and 2) Determine the role of OT in regulating the activity of BNST neurons in male and female rats. Accomplishing these Aims will fill a significant knowledge gap by establishing the role of OT in the BNST in ameliorating the effects of stress. We expect that by refining our understanding of central OT effects this proposal will have a positive impact on uncovering the mechanisms underlying the neurobiology of stress-induced psychiatric disorders."
"9277724","VCU LIPIDOMICS/METABOLOMICS CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the growing appreciation that changes to specific molecules can reflect the broader biochemical anomalies arising from the cancer state, the study of lipids and small-molecule metabolites has become increasingly important for cancer research. The objective of the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Lipidomics/Metabolomics Core (VLMC) is therefore to provide cost effective lipid and small-metabolite analyses for VCU Massey Cancer Center (MCC) members. The VLMC supports the ability of MCC members to qualitatively and highly quantitatively investigate the lipidome and metabolome both in vitro and in vivo studies involving cancer cell lines, preclinical animal models of cancer, and/or patients with cancer. The VLMC does so by providing and maintaining a dedicated advanced lipidomic and metabolomic instrumentation suite that is nationally competitive. Specifically, the VLMC maintains 4 advanced QTRAP-type mass analyzers, each equipped with an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. An additional quadrupole time-of- flight mass analyzer is equipped with a differential mobility source and a UPLC. In addition to instrumentation, the VLMC has developed, deployed, and proven state-of-the-art methodologies that contemplate overlapping targeted, semi-targeted, and non-targeted approaches to the identification and quantification of changes to the lipidome and metabolome in a high-throughput fashion and over a large dynamic range. The resource is directed by Charles Chalfant, PhD, who is supported by the technical director, D. Shanaka Wijesinghe, PhD, and an additional 2.0 FTEs. The resource director and/or staff support MCC programmatic science by providing consultative services for experimental design and data interpretation, method development, education to certify end-users in the use of the equipment, operator-assisted analysis, and instrument maintenance. The VLMC is a jointly managed (MCC and VCU) resource within close walking distance of MCC. Standard hours for the facility are 9:00 AM until 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, with certified users enjoying access 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The usage of services and equipment is tracked and charged back. The VLMC adds significant value to MCC research by providing services that are critical to addressing the research questions of MCC members, services that otherwise would not be practically obtainable or would be cost prohibitive through alternative vendors or even other non-profit institutions. Overall, the instrumentation and expertise available in the VLMC have facilitated the development of a growing user base of MCC members, whose cancer-related research routinely garners peer-reviewed national funding and is published in high-impact scientific journals."
"9265436","Project 3: Single cell measures of intratumor diversity for optimal breast cancer therapy  Project Summary / Abstract  Despite improved treatment, metastatic breast cancer is still inevitably fatal and is a major cause of cancer-  related deaths. Triple negative and inflammatory breast cancer are breast tumor subtypes that lack targeted  therapy, which, in combination with the high propensity to distant metastatic spread, leads to poor outcome;  70-80% of patients diagnosed with TNBC or IBC die within 5 years of diagnosis. Thus, new treatment  strategies are urgently needed.  We have previously analyzed the clinical and functional relevance of intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer.  We analyzed breast tumor samples before and after pre-operative chemotherapy and at different stages of  disease progression for intratumor cellular heterogeneity for genetic and phenotypic features. We found that  lower pretreatment genetic heterogeneity predicts better response and that distant metastases have the  highest diversity index. We have also developed a xenograft model of intratumor clonal heterogeneity in breast  cancer and utilized this model to assess the functional relevance of clonal interactions in metastatic  progression. We found that polyclonal tumors are more likely to metastasize and identified underlying clonal  cooperative mechanisms driving this process. Lastly, we have developed mathematical models based on these  experimental data that can infer the evolution of tumors during treatment and disease progression both in  clinical samples and in xenografts. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that (1) intratumor  heterogeneity is a driver of disease progression, (2) single cell measures of intratumor heterogeneity and their  topologic distribution can be used to build mathematical models of tumor evolution and treatment response, (3)  the use of these models will aid the design of individualized treatment strategies that more effectively eliminate  breast tumors. We propose three specific aims to test these hypotheses: Aim 1. Single cell analyses of breast  tumor samples. Aim 2. Characterization of therapeutic responses in xenograft models of breast cancer. Aim 3.  Predict optimal therapeutic strategies to prevent metastatic outgrowth and treatment resistance and validate  these strategies in xenograft models. Our goal is to translate our findings into future clinical trials."
"9277729","PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cancer clinical trials are a necessary and integral part of the research activities at the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) as they provide the opportunity for cancer patients to receive the most promising new therapies and provide the mechanism that brings MCC laboratory findings into the clinic. The MCC clinical trials program has 3 major goals: (1) to facilitate investigator-initiated and other clinical research trials; (2) to provide an appropriate menu of clinical trials to address the cancer burden of patients within MCC?s catchment area; and (3) to advance cancer care through research. The broad, long-range objectives of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS), operationalized through the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC), are to ensure that the clinical research portfolio consists of meaningful and scientifically sound studies and that these studies are conducted appropriately in terms of patient accrual, data analysis, and patient safety. Due to the importance of cancer clinical trials, the resources required to conduct clinical trials, and the value placed on human subjects who enroll on the studies, all proposed cancer clinical and population science protocols at VCU undergo an internal review of the scientific merit and prioritization before their submission to the Institutional Review Board. Prioritization of trials is necessary to facilitate progress of the most important science and optimize the use of MCC research resources. The PRMC conducts an initial and on-going review of all cancer clinical trials for scientific merit and scientific progress. The PRMC establishes priorities among trials potentially competing for MCC resources or patients. On-going review consists of review of amendments, accrual, and reports of the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee that identify potentially serious concerns. Trials are closed in the case of inadequate accrual, a change in priorities, or problems with clinical trial conduct that are so serious as to render the results of the clinical trial meaningless. These objectives are relevant to the mission of the National Cancer Institute as they advance the agency?s goals of preventing, controlling, and treating cancer."

The Core B will allow the PPG to gain mechanistic insights into the pro-longevity effects of FGF21 across multiple organ systems (adipose tissue, liver, bone, CNS and the immune system) using measures of functional decline in aging, longevity and burden of disease as primary endpoints. The Aim 1 of Core B is be work closely with the leader of the Administrative Core and leaders of the research projects, to assist in the experimental design and execution of the animal research phase of the individual projects, and to assure efficiency and standardization of procedures. The Aim2 is To perform an omnibus study with male and female mice examining the effect of inducible overexpression of FGF21 on lifespan and the contribution of adiponectin to FGF21's pro-longevity effect. Aim 3: To determine the cause of death by detailed pathologic examination of inducible FGF21Tg mice and inducible FGF21Tg mice lacking adiponectin. These studies will involve gross necropsies and histological analyses to quantify pathology and disease burden in our mouse models. Dr. Caroline Zeiss (ACVP and ACLAM boarded) will direct these studies as part of the PPG team. The aim4 will perform an omnibus study with male and female mice examining the role of the FGF21-adiponectin endocrine axis on healthspan and age-related functional decline across organ systems."
"9378859","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) is an independent, free-standing research, education and clinical cancer care Institute. Dr. Donald Trump, CCSG PI and RPCI President/CEO, is responsible solely to the RPCI Board of Directors. RPCI has been continuously recognized as a Cancer Center since NCI first designated centers in 1974 and has been designated as a comprehensive center since that term was first employed. This application requests continued NCI support for another five years. RPCI occupies a 27 acre campus near downtown Buffalo. The RPCI campus consists of 1.6 million square feet (sf) of laboratory, office, clinical and education. An additional 142,000 sf clinical care, clinical research and office building began construction on April 18, 2013. New developments on the main campus since last review have included opening of the Centers for Immunotherapy, Robotic Surgery, and Personalized Medicine. An additional 16,000 sf of clinical space have been opened at three affiliate sites. While the population of the RPCI catchment area (the 8 county region of WNY from which ~86% of RPCI patients are drawn) has been generally stable at ~1.5M, the number of tumor registry cases has increased 25% since 2008. In 2012 RPCI physicians cared for 4,242 new tumor registry cases and a total of 8,626 new analytic and non-analytic cases.    Since the last competitive renewal in 2008, RPCI has continued scientific, clinical, population science and education program growth, despite a difficult economic environment. This growth is demonstrated by: 1) recruitment of 137 new faculty clinicians and researchers, of which 51 are new CCSG members; 2) a 17% increase in total peer-reviewed funding from 2008 to 2013; 3) an increase in high-impact (impact factor>10) publications (91 to 193); 4) increased accrual to first-in-human, phase I, investigator-initiated studies; 24 accruals in 2008 vs 118 in 2012 and the  highest phase I trial institutional recruitment in RPCI history; 5) 2.5X increase in the number of therapeutic (treatment) trials supported by peer-reviewed funding (27 to 67); and 6) opening of three new satellite RPCI facilities. RPCI has expanded its educational programs, including an international program for the training of cancer scientists, clinicians and administrators from around the world. RPCI has successfully recruited three Senior Leaders, and invested $277 million in resources for the future to build on RPCI's unique opportunities in experimental therapeutics, translational medicine, genomics and education."
"9271228","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) is an effective therapy for persons with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite this, relapse occurs in 30-40% of patients transplanted for AML and is the leading cause of death in this population. There is an urgent need to decrease the risk of AML relapse following alloHCT. Natural killer (NK) cells are bone marrow-derived lymphocytes whose effector function is mediated by interaction between NK cell surface killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and their cognate HLA class I ligands on target cells. Donor-derived NK cells are known to exhibit a strong graft versus leukemia effect after alloHCT, preventing disease relapse. Thus, maximizing donor NK alloreactivity is an attractive goal for improving post-alloHCT outcomes. Similar to HLA, the KIR genes are highly diverse both in terms of variable gene content between individuals as well as allelic polymorphism within KIR gene loci. KIR and HLA combinatorial diversity creates a spectrum of NK reactivity that varies between individuals, resulting in differences in anti-tumor potency and HLA class I-mediated inhibition. Large retrospective clinical studies have demonstrated that donor KIR/HLA combinations dictating higher NK response and lower sensitivity to inhibition are associated with diminished risk for relapse following alloHCT for AML A novel algorithm based on KIR/HLA gene and allele combinations can be used to distinguish KIR-advantageous stem cell donors from otherwise HLA-equivalent donors for patients needing alloHCT. The proposed study will demonstrate in a prospective multicenter clinical trial for AML patients requiring an alloHCT from an unrelated donor that (1) KIR/HLA combinations can be used to identify and select KIR-advantageous donors, and (2) patients with KIR-advantageous donors will have less relapse and higher survival. Correlative laboratory studies using fluorescence and mass cytometry will demonstrate that donor-derived NK cells exhibit higher NK activity and less inhibition in response to leukemia target cells when their KIR and HLA genotypes imply advantage(s). Combined, these studies have the potential to transform current donor selection practices and reduce the risk of leukemia relapse in patients."
"9257474","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hereditary ataxias are a group of genetic disorders that share neurological and pathological features, such as loss of balance and coordination, as well as cerebellar neurodegeneration. The ultimate research goal of my laboratory is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for cerebellar degeneration in order to develop effective therapeutic interventions for this class of neurodegenerative diseases. To begin to identify these mechanisms, we previously generated a protein-protein interaction network for proteins associated with twenty-three different inherited ataxias. This study and several others suggest that the Wnt-?-catenin signaling pathway may be commonly affected in a subset, if not all, of the hereditary ataxias. However, it has not been determined yet whether Wnt-?-catenin signaling is indeed affected in cerebellum in vivo in the hereditary ataxias or whether the altered activity of the Wnt-?-catenin signaling pathway is responsible for the cerebellar neurodegeneration. To address these questions, we use spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) as a prototype of hereditary cerebellar ataxias. SCA1 is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), brainstem cranial nerve nuclei and inferior olive nuclei, and spinocerebellar tracts. SCA1 is caused by a glutamine expansion in ATAXIN1 (ATXN1). The preliminary data presented in this application clearly show that the Wnt-?-catenin signaling pathway is functionally active in normal PCs in the adult cerebellum in mice and this activation is strongly enhanced in PCs in SCA1 mice. We also provide evidence that the enhanced activation of Wnt-?-catenin signaling in SCA1-affected neurons, such as cerebellar PCs and the inferior olive, results in cerebellar PC atrophy and/or degeneration in adults. These data strongly support the idea that Wnt- ?-catenin signaling may have a crucial role in the physiology of the adult cerebellum and/or in cerebellar neurodegeneration. Here, we hypothesize that the disease-causing mutant ATXN1 protein strongly activates Wnt-?-catenin signaling beyond the normal level in SCA1 mice, and that this upregulation is sufficient to cause PC dysfunction and degeneration. To investigate this hypothesis we will perform the following specific studies: 1) Explore the role of Wnt-?-catenin signaling in PC function/survival in the normal adult cerebellum; 2) Identify the molecular mechanisms by which polyglutamine-expanded mutant ATXN1 activates Wnt-?-catenin signaling; 3) Determine the in vivo relevance of enhanced activation of Wnt-?-catenin signaling in SCA1 pathogenesis. The knowledge gained from the studies proposed in this application will advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cerebellar neurodegeneration and will suggest new therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the burden of these devastating diseases."

"9398344","Project Summary - Innate immunity to enteric virus infection by IFN?-stimulated-gene expression Antiviral immunity in the intestine and other mucosal surfaces faces a distinct challenge: clearance of viral infection while maintaining barrier function and tolerance of the bacterial microbiome. To maintain this balance, immune mechanisms with specificity to mucosal surfaces have evolved. Interferon lambda (IFN?) stimulates antiviral responses in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and is a critical component of intestinal immunity in mouse models of norovirus (MNV) and rotavirus (MRV) infection; this requirement for IFN? in control of these enteric virus infections distinguishes it from other interferon types. Additionally, the bacterial microbiome promotes MNV infection in an IFN? receptor- (IFNLR) dependent manner, suggesting that the microbiome alters the IFN?-stimulated antiviral response. This proposal aims to close the gap in our understanding regarding transcriptional programs unique to IFN?, the effect of the bacterial microbiome on those transcriptional programs, and the specific interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) required for viral control. Specific Aim 1 will comprehensively characterize the transcriptional response in IECs and identify the genes necessary for cell-intrinsic control of rotavirus infection. Specific Aim 2 will use novel intestinal macrophage and IEC co- culture system to identify mechanisms by which IFN? stimulates cell-extrinsic clearance of MNV. Specific Aim 3 will determine the role of the commensal microbiome in regulation of IFN?-stimulated antiviral responses. The long-term goal of this work is to discover novel aspects of IFN biology and its regulation in the intestine that will aid in rational development of antivirals and immunotherapies.  "
"9266209","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Declining lung function is a consequence of aging that results from the gradual loss of alveoli. This debilitating process is exacerbated in the context of lung diseases that are oftentimes progressive and fatal. Recent data suggest that adult humans are capable of generating new lung tissue in response to a surgical reduction in lung volume. This raises the exciting possibility that, given the right cues, endogenous progenitor cells could be capable of restoring normal alveolar architecture and function in diseased lungs. The objective of this project is to identify epithelial stem cells in the adult lun that have the capacity to generate new alveolar tissue and the microenvironmental cues that trigger this response. Several obstacles have impeded previous efforts to identify human alveolar stem cells. These include the inability to perform interventional, longitudinal injury/repir studies in humans, striking dissimilarities between the lungs of humans and most model organisms, and a paucity of discriminating markers for putative progenitor cell populations. Here, the advantages of two model systems will be exploited to address these issues. In Specific Aim 1, the genetically tractable mouse will be used to identify, at the single cell level, cells with the ability to generate new alveolar epithelium. Because the lungs of rhesus macaques are more similar at the cellular level to those of humans than most model organisms, the mechanisms identified through functional studies in mice will be validated with data from pneumonectomized macaques. In Specific Aim 2, genetic loss of function experiments will be used to test the hypothesis that Notch, provided by the local fibroblast component of the regenerative niche, is critical for the generation of new alveolar epithelium in adults. In Specifi Aim 3, genetic loss of function and bone marrow transplants in mice will be used to test the hypothesis that AEC2 recruit monocytes to the lung post-PNX through the secretion of Ccl2. In the lung, IL13 polarizes these cells toward a wound healing M2 phenotype to promote adult alveologenesis. Together, this comprehensive, multi-organismal approach will address knowledge gaps surrounding the mechanisms of lung regeneration in adults. These data will provide novel cellular and molecular targets that can be leveraged to prevent or reverse the decline in lung function associated with the destruction of alveoli."
"9271922","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this R03, we propose to add new assays for DNA copy number alteration, to allow us to test for feasibility and reliability of using these assays o older breast tumor specimens, dating back to the 1950s. These new assays and new analysis will innovatively and significantly build on our funded R21 (5 R21 CA166115-02), which is focusing on ascertaining the feasibility of obtaining breast cancer tumor specimens dating back to the 1950s, to allow for research on trends in both tumor characteristics and social disparities in these characteristics. The significant problem our R21 addresses is: the absence of data on long-term trends in breast cancer tumor profiles, overall and by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position. As articulated in the original application, such long-term data can uniquely reveal what aspects of tumor biology are amenable to change. Relevant examples include our recent study documenting that between 1992 and 2005, the US white/black odds ratio for ER+ tumors among breast cancer cases likewise rose and fell, likely linked to changes in hormone therapy use after publication of the Women's Health Initiative results in 2002. Key implications are that: (a) the biological expression and social patterning of breast cancer, far from being fixed, can change, and (b) analyzing data on long-term trends has important implications for both understanding the causes of and reducing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in breast cancer incidence, survival, and mortality. Our newly proposed Aim 2d has two parts:  Aim 2d1: extract DNA from the 30 tumor blocks obtained for Aim 1 (5 specimens per decade, from 1947-1959 to 2000-2009, randomly selected from invasive cases of breast cancer diagnosed among women age 50-64, obtained from the Kaiser Permanent (KP) Division of Research in Northern California);  Aim 2d2: determine whether current assays for DNA copy number alteration can validly be employed with the study specimens. The new assays complement those for Aims 2a-c, for which preliminary results indicate all specimens displayed excellent histo-morphology and both appropriate values and excellent test-retest reliability for key immune-histo-chemical markers: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), cytokeratin (CK) 5/6, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and Ki67, allowing for classification of molecular phenotypes. Results will inform the R21's Aim 3: Determine if results for Aims 2 support the feasibility of developing an R01 to study long-term trends in prevalence of - and racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in - breast cancer tumor profiles (using the KP & NZ data), and Aim 4: use results to prepare an R01 to conduct the first long- term and cross-country (US and NZ) analysis of trends in breast cancer tumor profiles and racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in these biomarkers, with major implications for prevention and treatment."
"9479902","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although smoking cessation efforts by NIDA and others have been successful, millions of Americans continue to smoke. Additionally, our laboratories have found important results on the metabolic effects of nicotine, including findings that nicotine plus a high fat diet (HFD) leads to hepatic and muscle steatosis. We have also used a large database to show that secondhand smoke is associated with both diabetes and obesity. This has led us to develop the theme of the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (CDU) Diversity-Promoting Institution Drug Abuse Research Program (DIDARP) to be Metabolic Effects of  Nicotine: it Matters. Our training theme will continue to be Research Teams of the Future that is based on the NIH roadmap. Our training program will focus on minority trainees at all levels and make a difference in the long run by tackling the problem of substance abuse. The overarching goal of the research, training and education programs of this DIDARP are to enhance CDU's capacity to conduct substance abuse research with a primary focus on the metabolic effects of nicotine. The specific goals of CDU DIDARP are:   1. To increase the number of high quality drug addiction research projects related to the metabolic effects of nicotine to allow CDU to develop expertise and acquire preliminary data to be able to compete for NIDA P01, P50 or ROI grants;   2. To continue to foster interest in substance abuse research among under-represented students and other trainees by providing meaningful educational and research experiences; and   3. To continue to enhance the research infrastructure at CDU to support substance abuse research.  To achieve these goals, we will have 3 related, cross-disciplinary projects:  Project 1: Nicotine exacerbates high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and skeletal muscle abnormalities in obese mice.  Pilot Project A: Understanding the role of dopamine in binge-eating, nicotine and alcohol use: a translational PET study.  Pilot Project B: The association between secondhand smoking and diabetes, obesity and other chronic diseases.  Achieving these goals will eventually help reduce the health disparities as related to substance abuse."
"9480129","?

Despite these findings, there have been very few drug prevention programs developed and evaluated specifically for these youth (Edwards, Giroux, & Okamoto, 2010; Rehuher, Hiramatsu, & Helm, 2008). Therefore, the purpose of this research proposal is to complete the development of a video-enhanced, culturally grounded, school-based drug prevention curriculum for rural Native Hawaiian youth (Ho'ouna Pono), and to evaluate the curriculum across all public middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island. This will be accomplished through three specific aims. AIM 1 (Year 1) is to complete the Ho'ouna Pono drug prevention curriculum initially developed and validated in a NIDA-funded translational pilot/feasibility study (R34 DA031306). To date, five professionally filmed video vignettes depicting drug-related problem situations specific to rural Hawaiian youth and seven interactive classroom lessons have been created, implemented in randomly selected intervention schools, and preliminarily evaluated using a pre-test, post-test control group design. Aim 1 enhances and builds upon this work by producing two new video vignettes, re-editing a Behind the Scenes video, developing new classroom curricular components, and synthesizing the new content with the existing curriculum. AIM 2 (Years 2-3) is to evaluate the fully conceived curriculum across all middle/intermediate schools on Hawai'i Island (N = 15) using a dynamic wait- listed control group design (Brown, Wyman, Guo, & Peña, 2006). AIM 3 (Year 4) is to assess community, systemic, and curricular factors related to the implementation, adoption, and sustainability of the curriculum within public middle/intermediate schools on Hawaii Island."
"9345070","Project Summary Our goal is to develop a novel immunotherapy for the treatment of melanoma, and potentially a wide array of tumors. Although surveillance by the immune system eliminates cancer cells in some instances, tumor cells have developed a variety of mechanisms to escape immune recognition often resulting in tumor outgrowth. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab) and cellular immunotherapies (e.g. adoptive cell transfer and CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T cells) are showing dramatic efficacy in on- going clinical trials. However, even the most promising therapies are effective for a limited range of cancers and only for a minority of patients (e.g. response rates with PD-1 inhibitors are ~25-40%). Moreover, they can be associated with significant toxicities, and tumors ? especially solid tumors ? eventually develop resistance. The potential of B cells as anti-tumor immunotherapeutics has, to a large extent, remained untapped. Nevertheless, B cells constitute part of the cancer-infiltrating immune cells and they have anti-tumor properties including production of tumor-suppressive cytokines and enhancing tumor-killing T cell response. Indeed, the presence of B cells in the tumor microenvironment is correlated with long-term survival for cancer patients. This application is focused on advancing our preclinical development in preparation for a subsequent Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. We will determine the optimal efficacious dose of GIFT4 in murine models of cancer; assemble a toxicology package in appropriate models and optimize exprssion and develop fermentation and large-scale purification protocols. Successful commercialization would ultimately provide profound anti-tumor immunotherapeutic benefits in a wide variety of cancer indications, particularly those characterized by a weakened immune system that do not respond to other immunotherapies."
"9269065","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tendons and ligaments are dense connective tissues of mesodermal origin, which connect muscles to bones or bone to bone, and transmit mechanical force. The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists mainly of collagen type 1, organized as triple-helix polypeptide chains, which unite into fibrils, fibers, fascicles, tertiary bundles, forming the tendon and ligament architecture. Damage to tendons and ligaments caused by overuse or injuries is not healed and rarely recovers completely. In addition, to injury, aging-related changes in cells and ECM of ligaments and tendons represent an important risk factor for the development of knee osteoarthritis or rotator cuff syndrome. Obstacles in the development of approaches to address tendon and ligament damage are partly due to the limited knowledge about mechanisms that regulate development, adult tissue homoeostasis and regenerative responses following injury. We recently identified Mohawk (Mkx) as a key regulator of tendon and ligament development. Mkx is a member of the Three Amino acid Loop Extension superclass of atypical homeobox genes. Mkx-/- mice had hypoplastic tendons throughout the body, clearly demonstrating an essential function of Mkx in tendon development. Importantly, Mkx is highly expressed in adult human and mouse tenocytes and ligament cells but its expression is decreased in aging or in arthritis-affected joints and in response to inflammatory stimuli such as interleukin-1. These observations support our hypothesis that Mkx is a central regulator of adult tendon and ligament homeostasis and that its suppression following injury or during aging and arthritis accounts for limited repair responses and leads to degenerative changes. To test this hypothesis and reveal the molecular mechanisms of Mkx to maintain and/or regenerate tendon/ligament, we will perform the following studies. Aim 1: Determine Mkx targets and functions in tendon/ligament cells during development and after birth. Aim 2: Analyze mechanisms controlling tendon/ligament specific expression of Mkx. Aim 3: Examine role of Mkx in tenogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and its potential to enhance repair or regeneration of tendon injuries. Feasibility of this project is based on availability of several genetically modified mouse lines, including conditional Mkx TG and KO mice; access to human ligament cells from a wide range of donors across the adult age spectrum and at various stages of ACL degeneration and multiple genome-wide screening systems. The findings from this study are expected to advance our current understanding of tendon and ligament biology and serve as a basis for the development of new therapeutic approaches for tendon and ligament injuries and diseases."
"9267504","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Diamond Blackfan Anemia Registry (DBAR) is a comprehensive database of patients with the rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA). DBA is a heterogeneous genetic disorder characterized by pure red cell aplasia, congenital anomalies and a predisposition to cancer. Anemia usually presents in infancy or early childhood and approximately 50% of patients have at least one congenital anomaly. The overall cumulative incidence of cancer is over 20% by age 46, with some individual cancer risks such as colon carcinoma and osteogenic sarcoma elevated more than 30-fold compared to the general population. To date, 11 genes encoding ribosomal proteins of both the small and large subunits have been found to be mutated, representing nearly 70% of patients with DBA. Affected individuals within the same family vary dramatically as to the degree of anemia, response to corticosteroids, the presence of congenital anomalies, and the development of cancer. Prior to the development of the DBAR, our knowledge regarding the epidemiology and response to various treatment modalities was determined exclusively from literature reports. The DBAR was developed in order to provide a well-characterized patient substrate linked to biological samples, permitting the study of the epidemiology and biology of DBA. The objective of this proposal is to continue to improve and exploit the DBAR in order to:  1) facilitate investigations into the epidemiology and biology of DBA  2) provide an accurate phenotype of DBA patients to facilitate genotype-phenotype  correlations as new genes are discovered  3) provide well-characterized patients access to treatment protocols  4) provide patients and their health care providers access to research studies  5) provide patients and their health care providers with results of research studies  6) serve as a resource to patients and their doctors to guide diagnostic, therapeutic,  and reproductive decisions  7) develop an accurate, rapid diagnostic test for DBA  8) utilize the DBAR infrastructure and patient data to develop and manage clinical trials  9) solicit national and international collaborative research"
"9262956","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with intellectual disability often display severe destructive behaviors (e.g., aggression, self-injurious behavior) that pose significant risk to self or others and represent overwhelming barriers to community integration. These destructive behaviors are often treated with behavioral interventions derived from a functional analysis (FA), which is used to identify the environmental antecedents and consequences that occasion and reinforce the target response. One such treatment is called functional communication training (FCT), which involves extinction of destructive behavior and reinforcement of an alternative communication response with the consequence that previously reinforced destructive behavior. Results from epidemiological studies and meta analyses indicate that interventions based on FA, like FCT, typically reduce problem behavior by 90% or more and are much more effective than other behavioral treatments. Despite these impressive findings, FCT interventions reported in the literature have typically been developed and evaluated by highly trained experts in tightly controlled research settings, and treatment relapse (i.e., increased destructive behavior) often occurs in the natural environment when a caregiver is unable reinforce the FCT response due to competing responsibilities (e.g., caring for a sick sibling). Behavioral momentum theory helps to explain why treatment relapse occurs under these circumstances and also provides mathematical equations that can be used to model and predict the variables that increase and decrease the likelihood that treatment relapse will occur. In the current project, we have used these equations to identify several potential refinements to FCT that are likely to markedly decrease the probability that treatment relapse will occur when the FCT response is not reinforced. In some cases, these refinements are at odds with what is recommended in the clinical literature on FCT. Therefore, it is critically important that we compare these refinements that are derived from behavioral momentum theory with current clinical practice in order to determine the best way to implement FCT, so that treatment remains effective when it is implemented with less than perfect precision by caregivers in the natural environment."

"9270578","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for a K23 award for Nirav Bhakta, MD, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in pulmonary medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Bhakta is beginning a career as a young investigator in translational research in asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways in the lungs that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, cough and shortness of breath. There has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence, morbidity, and economic burden associated with asthma over the past 40 years. This K23 award will provide Dr. Bhakta with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to develop an independent patient-centered translational research career focused on airway diseases; (2) to advance the application of multi-color flow cytometry to human tissue samples to quantitatively evaluate inflammatory pathways; (3) develop expertise in using airway epithelial cells in culture as a model system to interpret human data; and (4) to apply advanced biostatistical methods to the development of biomarkers to predict response to molecularly-targeted therapies. To achieve these goals, Dr. Bhakta has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Prescott Woodruff, an expert in translational asthma research and molecular phenotyping of asthma; a co-mentor, Dr. John Fahy, an expert in translational asthma research and airway epithelial cell biology; and 4 grant advisory committee members: Dr. Mark Ansel, an immunologist with expertise in immune cell subsets and multi-color flow-cytometry; Dr. Dean Sheppard, a senior researcher studying inflammatory pathways in mouse models of asthma; and Dr. David Erle, an expert in the application of high-throughput technologies and statistical methods to study gene networks in asthma; and Dr. Mark Segal, a senior biostatistician with extensive experience in high-throughput data analysis. There is growing recognition that asthma is not a single disease, but rather has many different forms leading to variability in severity and response to medications between patients. It is likely that these differences are driven by the predominance of distinct underlying pathways of inflammation, the discovery of which would inform the development of novel targeted therapies. Identification of one such pathway, inflammation driven by T helper 2 (Th2) cells, has led to a novel blood biomarker (periostin) which predicts response to Th2-targeted therapy, proving the concept that molecular phenotyping can guide cytokine-targeted therapies. However, Th2 inflammation explains only a subset of asthma, and there is a need to identify other pathways, especially for the 10% of asthmatics who are severe and do not respond to standard therapies. The proposed research will investigate the role of one such pathway, inflammation driven by IL-17 cytokines, which preliminary findings lead us to hypothesize is associated with heightened eosinophilic inflammation and two cardinal features of severe asthma: excessive airway narrowing and mucous overproduction. An ongoing bronchoscopy study in severe asthmatics will be leveraged to obtain airway washings and tissues to test these hypotheses. The numbers of IL-17 cytokine- expressing cells will be assessed in these tissues with flow cytometry and microscopic examination, and their association with inflammatory cells, clinical airway narrowing, and mucous overproduction determined. Importantly, the proposed study will combine this data with experiments on isolated cells to develop biomarkers in the blood and sputum that reflect IL-17-driven inflammation in the lung. These biomarkers have the potential to improve asthma care by providing a test to identify the individuals most likely to respond to IL-17-targeted drugs already in development by pharmaceutical companies."
"9347784","PROJECT SUMMARY There is need for an artificial oxygen (O2) carrier to substitute for banked blood in settings where: (1) stored blood is unavailable (pre-hospital care/transport, austere environments, undeveloped countries) or (2) undesirable (transfusion risk exceeds benefit). To address this need, we developed ?ErythroMer? (EM), a first-in- class nano-cyte blood substitute. EM is a deformable, cross-linked polymeric nanoparticle that incorporates high per particle payloads of hemoglobin (Hb). Our ?artificial cell? design has yielded a prototype that emulates RBC physiology in all key respects and represents a potentially disruptive introduction into Transfusion Medicine. To date, efforts to develop Hb-based oxygen carriers (HBOCs) have failed, because of design flaws which do not preserve physiologic interactions of Hb with: (1) O2 (they capture O2 in lungs, but do not release O2 effectively to tissue) and (2) nitric oxide (NO) (they trap NO, causing vasoconstriction). The EM design surmounts these weaknesses by: 1) encapsulating Hb, 2) controlling O2 capture/release with a novel 2,3-DPG shuttle (2,3-DPG is the major heterotropic effector for Hb and diminishes O2 affinity), 3) attenuating NO uptake through shell properties, and 4) retarding metHb formation by co-packaging a reduction system. Moreover, EM is designed for sterile lyophilization and so, is amenable to facile reconstitution after extended dry storage under ambient conditions. EM offers a pragmatic approach to a complex need and is designed for cost-effective production at scale. Our prototype has passed rigorous initial ex vivo and in vivo ?proof of concept? testing. We founded KaloCyte so that we may translate ErythroMer innovations into a pragmatic therapeutic and as well as realize the commercial potential of a disruptive introduction into transfusion medicine. Our project goals are to scale up reliable EM production, perform pharmacokinetic studies, initiate toxicity screening and affirm efficacy in a robust animal model of hemorrhagic shock resuscitation. ErythroMer intellectual property is robust and secured by KaloCyte, which has been supported by robust entrepreneur / incubator programs that have afforded business and regulatory expertise, initial space and administrative support. STTR funding will enable KaloCyte to transition EM production from research- to pilot-scale (Phase I) and initiate groundwork required for IND authorization (Phase II). Of note, our initial studies and the approach herein meet published FDA expectations for blood substitutes. Given the significant potential for Department of Defense (DoD) collaboration and support, we have chosen to pursue hemorrhagic shock as the first indication for FDA approval. Our strategy to accelerate EM to human study involves collaborating with the DoD on a highly prioritized project to develop a ?Multifunctional Resuscitation Fluid (MRF)?. We have established firm collaborations with the US Army and the MRF program, which currently lacks an O2 carrier. Following a successful trial for hemorrhagic shock, we would expand EM into other settings (pre-hospital use, blood banking in the developing world, and exploit the design to extend efficacies beyond that of stored blood)."

"9277752","PROJECT 3 SUMMARY  The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has risen nearly ten-fold over the past several decades,  and the prognosis for EAC remains poor. During this time period, the GI microbiome has undergone a  significant shift with the advent of antibiotics and the progressive decline in Helicobacter pylori infection rates,  and there is increasing evidence that bacteria play an important role in GI cancers. However, the contribution  of the esophageal microbiome to Barrett?s esophagus (BE) and EAC is not understood, and likely involves a  complex relationship with the epithelium, microenvironment and gastro-esophageal reflux. Filling this gap in  knowledge is critical to the development of rational cancer prevention strategies; the current paradigm, which  relies on clinical suspicion to identify patients for endoscopy to screen for BE, has been unsuccessful and  misses most patients who go on to develop EAC. The esophageal microbiome in BE is heavily populated with  Gram-negative bacteria, which may drive a chronic inflammatory state. We have found high abundance of  Fusobacterium nucleatum in EAC, and previous work by our team showed that F. nucleatum has proneoplastic  effects in the colon. Further, in preliminary data we found that BE patients have alterations in specific taxa in  the oral microbiome, a potential biomarker for BE. In Project 3 we propose to build directly on Projects 1 and 2  to elucidate the relationship between the microbiome, inflammation, and the microenvironment in BE and EAC,  with the end goal of developing a non-endoscopic testing strategy based on pathogenic factors to identify  patients at highest risk for EAC. To accomplish this we will enroll 100 patients with known BE (50 with  dysplasia or EAC) and 50 subjects without BE undergoing upper endoscopy. Prior to endoscopy each subject  will undergo three minimally invasive potential screening and surveillance tests: saliva (oral microbiome),  breath test (exhaled volatile organic compounds), and tethered capsule sponge sampling (methylated DNA  markers). We will then address the following Specific Aims: 1) To assess the relationship between the  microbiome (using 16S rRNA gene sequencing) and tissue inflammation (using RNA-Seq) in Barrett?s  progression to EAC. We will also explore the oral microbiome and exhaled volatile organic compounds as  potential biomarkers. 2) To determine how bile acid composition impacts the microbiome and tissue  inflammation in BE. We will also assess the relationship between these factors and methylated DNA markers.  3) To develop a non-endoscopic, biologically-based screening and surveillance strategy for BE. We will  evaluate these novel tests in combination with clinical and anthropometric factors to describe an optimal  strategy for BE screening and monitoring. We hope that this will lead to development of a testing approach that  is highly acceptable to patients, is cost-effective, and can be easily translated to the non-specialist setting.  Furthermore, we anticipate that our findings will also lead to novel avenues for EAC chemoprevention."
"9280284","Project 2: How does human C4 allelic diversity affect microglia-mediated synaptic pruning? Abstract: Schizophrenia (SCZ) patients exhibit excessive loss of grey matter and decreased dendritic spine density, suggesting that abnormal synaptic pruning may contribute to SCZ etiology. Genetic studies indicate that complement C4A is a susceptibility factor for SCZ, although it is not clear if this link is a result of increased complement expression in the brain or in the periphery, or both. The complement system is a major mediator of inflammation in the periphery and over expression of C4 could induce release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce pathology affecting both the periphery and the CNS. The human C4 locus encodes two highly conserved isoforms named C4A (acidic) and C4B (basic) which differ overall by only four amino acid differences. The differences are functionally important in binding to target sites. In the brain, C4 localizes to synapses and is required for synaptic pruning in the developing visual system. Whether the two isoforms differ in binding efficiency to synapses has not been reported. SCZ patients express elevated levels of C4A relative to C4B in the CNS suggesting that the level of local expression of C4 in the brain may also be an important factor in disease. To help address these questions, we have developed novel strains of mice that express the common alleles of human C4, i.e. C4A only, C4B only or C4A and C4B, and crossed them to the C4-deficident background. In addition, we have used gene editing to alter the murine C4 locus to express the human C4A- or C4B-like isotypic region. Given the importance of complement C4 in synapse elimination in the murine visual system, will use these mice to test our hypothesis that chemical differences in C4 combined with increased level of local expression affect binding to synapses and directly affect the efficiency of synapse elimination by activated microglia. Two specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: How do the activities of C4A and C4B differ in the periphery and CNS? This aim will precisely define how C4A and C4B functional differences affect developmental synaptic pruning and microglia activity in the LGN. Aim 2: What are the effects of complement overexpression on synaptic pruning? This aim will test for the first time the idea that complement overactivation stimulates excessive synaptic pruning using mouse models designed to model C4A expression in SCZ."

"9272403","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Complex II enzymes are integral-membrane heterotetramers with two spatially separated active sites that couple the oxidoreduction of succinate and fumarate to the oxidoreduction of quinone and quinol. In humans, Complex II is a mitochondrial enzyme that contributes to energy generation by participating in both the TCA cycle (via succinate oxidation) and oxidative phosphorylation (via quinone reduction), and its mutation is associated with tumor formation and neurodegeneration. The long-term objective of this research program is to reveal mechanisms of catalysis, assembly, and physiological function. In the proposed research, we will identify roles of Complex II assembly factors, reveal how Complex II contributes to in vivo signaling, and demonstrate how disease-associated mutations alter Complex II function.  Aim 1: Until very recently, Complex II assembly was thought to proceed autocatalytically, but two assembly factors have now been identified in humans. Both are proposed to assist in cofactor insertion, but the published evidence supporting this is tenuous and there is no consensus mechanism of assembly. Understanding the roles of these assembly factors will provide insight into fundamental mechanisms of assembly of this essential protein complex. We will use Escherichia coli Complex II to reveal the role of each assembly factor, identify if they work directly or indirectly, and identify whether thre are additional assembly factors using gene deletion and complementation, mutagenesis, in vivo site-specific cross-linking, binding assays, and crystallography.  Aim 2: In both humans and bacteria, Complex II activity is required for functions outside of bioenergetics. For example, in E coli, assembly of the flagellum and the chemotactic response to fumarate requires activity of the Complex II homolog QFR. Since future antimicrobials could be directed toward disruption of bacterial motility, it will be important to reveal how QFR supports flagellar assembly. We will combine site-specific cross- linking, binding assays, motility assays, crystallography, and computational modeling to identify how QFR influences the conformation of the flagellar torque ring to promote assembly and influence chemotaxis.  Aim 3: Mutations in the genes encoding human Complex II are associated with pleiotropic clinical presentations. Cellular changes associated with these mutations have been reported in the literature, but almost nothing is known about the biochemical consequences of these mutations on enzyme activity. Identifying the biochemical changes associated with Complex II mutation is important for developing future therapies for mitochondrial disease. We will therefore develop an expression system for human Complex II and assess the consequences of disease-associated mutations on enzyme assembly, kinetics, and structure."
"9241444","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social attachments play a central role in most, if not all, levels of human interaction, from parent-child attachment, fraternity and kinship, friendship and social affiliation, to enduring partnerships with mates. Social attachment behaviors are also clinically very relevant, as several devastating conditions such as autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia often manifest with a dramatic collapse of inter-personal interactions. These fascinating behaviors have traditionally been resistant to genetic and neurobiological approaches because of the limitations imposed by working on primates. Mice, the only genetically tractable mammalian model to date, appear not to display adult social attachment behaviors. This proposal seeks to establish the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) as a model system to examine the deficits in social attachment behaviors that result from mutations in genes associated with psychiatric illnesses.  Prairie voles are small mouse-like rodents that display strong social attachment behaviors such that mates typically form an enduring pair bond. Pair bonding results in dramatic changes in other social behaviors. These findings suggest that voles engage in a rich repertoire of social attachment behaviors that bear a striking resemblance to many of the social behaviors observed in humans.  Pioneering work in the prairie vole has identified vasopressin (Avp) and oxytocin (Oxt), neuropeptides and hormones, as critical mediators of pair bonding. Strikingly, AVP and OXT signaling have also been implicated in social attachment type behaviors in humans. Given the deep evolutionary similarity between humans and other eutherian mammals, including prairie voles, these findings indicate that the genetics and neural control of social attachment may also be conserved between humans and prairie voles. Thus, findings in the prairie voles may directly inform our understanding of human attachment behaviors.  We therefore propose to model the social deficits that manifest in psychiatric illness in this ideal model system for social attachment behaviors by generating prairie voles bearing mutations in genes implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. While no single model system is likely to recapitulate the entire spectrum of complex symptoms that occur in human psychiatric illness, this model system will, for the first time, allow use to understand the neurobiology underlying the profound social deficits in these disorders. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia often result in marked social deficits, which manifest as significantly limited social supports and relationships, difficulty maintaining employment, and overall deficits in social skills. We propose 1) to generate prairie voles mutant for genes implicated in autism, SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3), and schizophrenia, Disks large homolog 2 (DLG2), 2) examine the pattern of deficits in social attachment behaviors that result from the loss of function of these genes, and 3) determine the change in patterns of neuronal activation that correlate with deficits in attachment related behaviors."

"9397717","ABSTRACT Overuse of antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and is a growing threat to human health worldwide. In the U.S., industrial food animal production (IFAP) is a powerful driver of antibiotic use. Seventy percent of antibiotics are sold for use in livestock, including tetracycline, gentamicin, and third-generation cephalosporins (3GC). In an attempt to reduce AMR and population health impacts, beginning January 1, 2018, California's Senate Bill 27 (SB27) will ban all non-therapeutic uses of antimicrobials in livestock (includ- ing growth promotion and routine disease prevention) and require a veterinarian's prescription for therapeutic indications. We will quantify the effect of this legislation on AMR E. coli E. coli is an ideal pathogen for evaluating changes in antimicrobial use and AMR related to livestock production because (1) AMR profiles of E. coli circulating in livestock and humans overlap; and (2) extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli are a leading cause of human UTI, which cost Americans $1-2 billion annually. We plan to use data ranging from the molecular to the population level in a natural exper- iment to address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use whole genome sequencing and antimicrobial sus- ceptibility testing to characterize resistance genes, phenotypes, and E. coli populations isolated from retail chicken meat and UTI. We hypothesize that contaminated retail meat products contribute to the burden of AMR E. coli UTI in humans. In Aim 2, we will leverage longitudinal (2015-2021) electronic health records on retail chicken meat and human E. coli urinary tract infections (UTIs). (EHRs) on more than 7 million outpatients with 100,000 E. coli UTIs per year from two major California health systems to estimate longitudinal changes in the proportion of tetracycline-, gentamicin-, and 3GC-resistant E. coli isolated from retail chicken meat and laboratory-confirmed E. coli UTI before and after the implementation of SB27. We will also employ synthetic control statistical analyses to estimate the causal effect of SB27 on AMR trends in retail chicken meat and E. coli UTI. We anticipate that the enactment of SB27 will be associated with reductions in AMR of E. coli isolated from retail chicken meat and human UTI cases. In Aim 3, we will conduct spatial analyses using patient addresses from EHRs and IFAP location data. We hypothesize that pri- or to SB27, residential proximity to IFAP will be a risk factor for tetracycline-, gentamicin-, and 3GC-resistant E. coli UTI; after SB27, this risk will be reduced. The approach is innovative because it uses a quasi-experimental design built around a first-in-the U.S. policy-mandated reduction in livestock antimicrobial use. Results of this work will make a significant contribution to the evidence base connecting food systems and UTI and will de- termine if this state-level legislative intervention affects AMR trends in retail meat and human UTIs, informing decision-making about implementation of similar policies across the U.S."
"9307011","ABSTRACT Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most lethal human malignancies. Median survival is a dismal 12-15 months in spite of aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation and concurrent temozolomide. New avenues are urgently needed for development of effective therapeutics. An emerging area of interest in cancer is the role of the mitochondria, cellular organelles which provide most of the energy needs of the body via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Mitochondria possess an independent circular 16.5KB genome (mtDNA) that is an essential, and often overlooked, cytoplasmic element of the human genome. mtDNA encodes proteins critical to OXPHOS and is highly polymorphic in human populations and also subject to somatic variation. A growing body of evidence indicates that ancient and recent germline mtDNA variants and the burden of somatic alterations in mtDNA may play important roles in cancer risk and progression. In glioma, recent evidence points to OXPHOS enzyme activity and tissue mtDNA content playing a role in drug resistance and tumor grade. In this R21, we propose to carry out the first comprehensive investigation of germline and somatic mtDNA variation in GBM survival. The project is based on a unique resource of germline and tumor DNA from large numbers of GBM patients for whom uniform tumor and treatment data, and vital status are available. Germline mtDNA sequence will be determined using high-throughput next-generation sequencing of oral DNA samples. We will investigate whether germline variants distinguish infrequent `extreme survivors' (ES) of 3 years or longer from average survivors (AS) of 15 months or less (150 ES versus 450 AS matched for age and treatment). Mitochondrial haplogroups, common individual variants, as well as rare and singleton variants considered in aggregate within genes and functional pathways, will all be examined for association with patient outcome. We will then investigate, in exploratory analysis, whether somatic variants in tumor mtDNA contribute to patient survival (120 GBM patients with paired germline and fresh frozen primary tumor). Somatic variants will be determined by sequencing native tumor mtDNA employing high depth of coverage to capture low frequency variants within individuals. Structural and single nucleotide variants will be considered by class, total burden and predicted pathogenicity for association with patient outcome. The proposal is responsive to ?Provocative Question 5? from the NCI eg: ? How does mitochondrial heterogeneity influence tumorigenesis or progression?? (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-15-009.html). Results will contribute new insight on questions surrounding the role of the mitochondrial genome in driving GBM and may point to novel therapeutic strategies that target mitochondrial function."

As of February 2015, 1.1 million people out of the total estimated Somali population of 12.3 million are IDPs and of thee 130,000 are settled in Puntland. Somalia has the 2nd highest Neonatal Mortality Rate in the world (46/1000 live births/yr), Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of 850/100,000 live births/year, and under five mortality (146/1000 live births/year). Six Maternal and Child Health (MCH) facilities provide services to the 69,000 IDPs in Bosaso. The MCH facilities provide antenatal care, postnatal care and delivery services however none of the MCH facilities provides newborn care services. Save the Children in collaboration with UNICEF, CDC, and other partners has developed a newborn health in humanitarian settings field guide as a package to facilitate the integrated delivery of newborn are in primary health care and reproductive health programs. We are proposing to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the Newborn Health in Humanitarian Settings Field Guide in displaced person camps in Puntland, Somalia. The study will measure effectiveness using before and after comparison in the intervention group and comparison between intervention and control clusters. Systematic documentation of change in systems, program inputs (type, quantity and cost), and processes will be done to assess feasibility. The results of the study will inform health programming strategies of Save the Children, Ministry of Health and partner agencies in Puntland and Somalia and the wider humanitarian community."
"9479821","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Untreated substance use disorders are associated with premature mortality, productivity loss, high rates of disability, and increased risk for HIV. Substance use also places users at risk for elevated depression symptoms and high levels of anxiety. In reciprocal fashion, having mental health problems radically increases the likelihood of augmented drug use, smoking, binge drinking and heavy episodic drinking. Despite a substantial body of evidence documenting the high prevalence of dual-diagnosis patients, few rigorous interventions have been conducted to treat individuals with comorbid substance use and mental health disorders. Globally, most people with substance use and/or mental health problems receive no treatment. The proposed International Latino Research Partnership (ILRP) directly responds to this gap in the literature.  The ILRP brings together research institutions an their partnering community clinics in Boston, Madrid and Barcelona to enhance a collaborative international partnership and to develop the research evidence necessary to respond to Latino migrants' behavioral health service needs. We turn our focus to Latino migrants because economic opportunities have moved unprecedented numbers of migrants from Latin America to host countries like Spain and the US. Spain has the second largest number of Latino migrants in the world behind only the US, where most immigrants are Latino. Migrant Latinos confront colossal barriers to behavioral health. During the process of acculturation to the host culture, migrants have been shown to drink more alcohol and use more drugs straining the health care system, public safety, and increasing their risk for HIV.  We propose three aims: 1) Develop an international partnership and research collaboration to support research that can improve accessibility, quality and outcomes of integrated behavioral health services for migrant Latinos with co-occurring substance use, mental health problems and/or HIV risk in primary care clinics; 2) Harmonize data across research sites; and 3) Conduct behavioral health services research focused on rapid screening, referral, and integrated behavioral health services research for migrant Latino populations with co-occurring substance use, mental health problems, and HIV risk in primary care clinics. For Aim 3, we follow a Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) model, where we first test the validity of a brief behavioral health screener for Spanish-Speaking populations. Building on that work, we test the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of the Integrated Intervention for Dual Problems and Early Action (IIDEA) intervention addressing substance use, smoking and mental health disorders. As such, the proposed ILRP multi-site international project is a critical step towards developing models of integrated care for the large and diverse Latino migrant population and more broadly towards understanding how best to integrate evidence- based assessment and treatments for co-occurring substance and mental health problems and HIV risks."
"9325918","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Phagocytes Gordon Research Conference (GRC) has been in existence since 1981 and the 19th GRC on Phagocytes will be held June 11-16, 2017 at Waterville Valley Conference Center, Waterville Valley, New Hampshire. Phagocytes are defined by their ability to ingest other cells/particles and include neutrophils, monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells. These cells play a central role in innate and adaptive immunity. However, it is now apparent the these cells are also critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis, and when thrown out of balance their activities can cause pathological changes that contribute to some of the most prevalent diseases seen globally, including chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes. The theme of the 2017 Phagocytes GRC is ?The Yin and Yang of Phagocytes: Regulators of Human Health and Disease? and it will be a forum for in depth discussions of the most recent discoveries in phagocyte biology. The meeting will highlight the latest advances in our understanding of inflammation and its resolution, host-pathogen interactions with insight into the mechanisms of infectious disease, elucidating critical underlying mechanisms of phagocyte function in obesity, HIV mediated neuropathies and in cancer. The translational value and the development of new therapies for phagocyte related diseases will also be discussed. The conference draws from a world-wide group of scientists with diverse backgrounds in cell biology, molecular genetics, microbiology, immunology, bioengineering, and clinical medicine. The meeting has consistently been an important venue for disseminating information and facilitating communication between investigators studying different facets of phagocyte function, and also provides a general educational forum for trainees and young investigators. Over 150 scientists attended the previous GRC in 2015 and we expect equal or greater numbers for the 2017 GRC. In 2015, approximately 45% of the past attendees were women and more than 50% were graduate students or postdoctoral fellows and 25% of the attendees had speaking opportunities. The program planned for the 2017 GRC includes nine sessions, chaired by discussion leaders who are experts in the field, where 25 invited speakers will present their latest and most exciting unpublished findings. In keeping with tradition, we also plan to select 12 junior scientists to present short talks based on submitted abstracts. In addition to oral presentations, we expect 100 posters to be displayed at the meeting. To further promote the participation and professional development of students and postdoctoral fellows, the 2017 Conference will incorporate a Gordon Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) immediately prior to the start of the GRC (June 10-11) that is organized by trainees. This multifaceted program will provide opportunities for participation of scientists at all levels and is designed to promote the participation of junior investigators, postdoctoral trainees and new investigators to the field. In addition, the Phagocytes GRC and GRS meetings should promote information transfer and collaborations that will drive the discovery of novel therapeutic targets."
"9251844","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission of a renewal application for continued support of an established T32 Training Grant in Circadian and Sleep Research to train and support predoctoral and postdoctoral students at Northwestern University (NU) and the University of Chicago (U of C). The integration of circadian biology and sleep research in both animal models and humans has been the cornerstone of the relationship between the preceptors on this Training Grant at the U of C and NU for over 20 years, and we have added the term circadian to the title of our Training Program in recognition of the importance of combining these fields in the training of the next generation of young investigators. This Training Program will be led by two established senior investigators under the Multiple Leadership Plan and will involve 13 Primary Training Faculty who have their primary appointments in either basic science or clinical departments. The proposed Training Program will offer predoctoral and postdoctoral students interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary training in a wide range of scientifi disciplines that are highly relevant to understanding the function, regulation and health implications of sleep and circadian rhythmicity. Central to this Program is the training of student in modern basic science, translational research as well as patient oriented research. Multiple research perspectives have fueled for more than a decade the productive interactions and cross-fertilization that have developed between the preceptors in this Program. During the current grant period, the scope of the research activities of the Training Faculty has expanded to include bench to bedside investigations of the impact of sleep-disordered breathing on metabolism and cardiovascular function and we propose to further broaden the program in our renewed program with the addition of six outstanding physician-scientists to the training faculty. As our nation is facing unprecedented epidemics of obesity, diabetes and their cardiovascular consequences, the Training Program proposed in the present application is uniquely positioned to train an interdisciplinary workforce of academic and industry investigators as well as government decision makers to address the roles of sleep disturbances and circadian dysfunction in these public health challenges. A key feature of our Training Program is the inclusion of 10 Collaborating Faculty with additional clinical, scientific and/or educational expertise that greatly enhances our training environment, and conversely, they will benefit from their participation in the program by developing mentoring skills. Our Program will enable trainees to integrate cutting edge approaches and techniques in the areas of genetics, genomics, endocrinology, metabolism, pharmacology, neurobiology, pulmonology, cognitive neuroscience, gerontology and chronobiology into their training in sleep and circadian research. Because the preceptors in this Training Program are actively involved in research at the molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral and epidemiological levels, trainees will be trained in a rich environment of activities that are integrated together for the study of the basic mechanisms of sleep and circadian function at all levels of biological organization."
"9271978","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Modeling quantum change in adolescent sexual initiation and condom use) A better understanding of early sexual initiation and condom use among adolescents is of great significance for prevention of HIV transmission. According to the dual-process systems theory, human behaviors are determined largely by two decision making systems. System 1 is a cognitive mechanism frequently used for routine or quick decisions (e.g., in emergency or under pressure); System 2 is a cognitive mechanism less frequently used for rule-based decisions by carefully weighing pros and cons of alternatives. According to this theory, adolescents' decisions regarding sex and condom use may contain both quick processes executed by System 1 and a gradual processes executed by System 2. Analytically, behavioral changes operated by System 1 will be seen as discrete because these changes are rapid, giving the appearance of having been executed without thinking. Behavioral changes executed by System 2 will be seen as continuous because critical thinking and careful assessment take time. Behavioral theories and models guiding much of our past research have focused on continuous changes, leaving discrete changes largely untouched. The co-existence of continuous and discrete processes in human behavior has been termed quantum behavior change (QBC) in the literature given their similarity to the well-known dual characteristics of waves and particles of light ray in physics. HIV behavior research may be advanced through the application of the QBC approach. The investigation of the QBC nature of a behavior requires methodologies capable of simultaneously modeling both continuous and discrete process; to date, such methods have not been well established. Cusp catastrophe modeling represents a promising approach, but several limitations of the estimation method prevent its use in HIV behavior research. Guided by the dual-process systems theory, in this project we will (1) extend and improve the estimation methods for cusp catastrophe modeling; (2) employ the improved methodology to simulate different risk and intervention scenarios to gain new insight into the complex dynamics of adolescents' sexual initiation and condom use behavior; (3) employ the same methodology to analyze the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 data to investigate factors associated with risky and safer sex, and data from two NIH-funded randomized trials we conducted to re-assess program effect; and (4) develop statistical software supporting the use of cusp catastrophe modeling method, making it available without charge to researchers. A team consisting of behavioral scientists and methodologists is assembled and well positioned to carry out the proposed research. To the best of our knowledge, this project is the first to address the QBC nature of adolescent sexual risk behavior using the cusp catastrophe modeling method and guided by the dual- process systems theory. Expected findings of this project will (1) add new data furthering our understanding of adolescent HIV risk behaviors and supporting more effective interventions for risk reduction and (2) provide new paradigms and analytical tools for researchers to advance their research agenda."
"9269517","Program Summary Dengue is the most common arthropod borne viral disease of humans. Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent dengue yet vaccine development is complicated by the presence of four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes and the possibility of immune enhanced dengue disease. The leading vaccine candidates contain 4 live attenuated viruses to cover the 4 serotypes. The most advanced vaccine candidate, a chimeric Yellow Fever-Dengue tetravalent live virus vaccine (CYD-TDV) developed by Sanofi Pasteur, was recently evaluated in human efficacy studies conducted in Asia and Latin America. Overall, CYD-TDV was efficacious at reducing the burden of dengue disease in the vaccinated populations. However, the vaccine had unexpectedly low efficacy against DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) and in dengue naïve subjects compared to dengue exposed subjects who were vaccinated. The lower efficacy in these groups was unexpected because the vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in these subjects. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the quality (Ab epitope specificity) rather than total quantity of cell-culture neutralizing Abs is a better predictor of DENV vaccine performance in human populations. Moreover, as the DENV complex has 4 serotypes and vaccines will be used in populations with a mix of naïve and partially immune individuals, immune assays based on a single epitope are unlikely to predict efficacy against the 4 serotypes.  This project is grounded on studies in our laboratories to understand protective and pathogenic Ab responses in people exposed to natural DENV infections. We have discovered new quaternary structure Ab epitopes linked to protection and developed reagents (human monoclonal Abs, recombinant DENVs) and assays that precisely measure Ab epitope-specific responses in human sera. In collaboration with Sanofi Pasture, we will use samples from the CYD-TDV efficacy trials, including several hundred samples from people who experienced vaccine breakthrough infections, to identify Ab epitope based correlates of protective immunity. Currently we are the only group capable of doing this study because no other dengue vaccine has been tested in efficacy studies.  As DENV vaccines have 4 attenuated replicating viruses, it has been difficult to obtain balanced replication and immunity to all 4 serotypes. Currently there are no reliable models to optimize the formulation of multi-component live dengue vaccine formulations. Investigators at Sanofi Pasteur's VaxDesign campus have developed a fully automated human Peripheral Tissue Equivalent (PTE) biomimetic model for preclinical evaluation of vaccines. As DENVs initially replicate in peripheral tissues after mosquito transmission or vaccination, we will test if the PTE biomimetic model has utility for predicting and optimizing the replication of single and multicomponent live-attenuated dengue vaccines.  Within the time frame of this study, we will establish novel standardized assays for supporting global efforts to develop dengue vaccines."
"9351702","Calorie restriction and the peripherally-derived growth factor, FGF21, have been correlated with increased lifespan. The hypothalamus plays an important role in the adjustment of whole body metabolism in calorie restriction. We uncovered that cell-selective impairment of hypothalamic Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)- expressing neuronal circuitry, part of the hypothalamic melanocortin system, in ad libitum fed mice, results in accelerated aging phenotype of many tissues, including the immune system and bone. In addition, we found that males of mice strains with impaired AgRP neuronal circuitry have shorter mean life-span when ad libitum fed. Our central hypothesis is that the AgRP system functions as a flip-flop switch for of fuel utilization for all tissues, and, that proper adjustment in the functioning of this central pathway is key in the aging process. We will test our hypothesis through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that calorie restriction-induced changes in the activity and synaptic input organization of the melanocortin system is mimicked by FGF21. Aim 2. To unmask if hypothalamic AgRP neurons are critical for behavioral- and peripheral tissue adaptations to calorie restriction and FGF21. Aim 3. To determine the role of the AgRP neurons in the effect of calorie restriction and FGF21 on hippocampal and cortical circuit integrity. Studies of this project will offer conceptual interface with Projects 1-3 as well as cellular- and behavioral analyzes for studies proposed in those projects."
"9271847","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cryptococcal meningitis is a leading cause of death among persons living with AIDS in resource-limited settings. In 2014, cryptococcal meningitis was responsible for approximately 15% of deaths in HIV treatment programs in Africa. Many of these deaths are preventable. Furthermore, the aggressive roll-out of ART in Sub-Saharan Africa has resulted in only slight decreases in cryptococcal meningitis incidence, e.g. 10-15% per South African national surveillance. In Uganda among hospitalized patients with suspected meningitis in 2014, Cryptococcus still remains more common than all other causes of meningitis combined.  One strategy to prevent the early mortality in ART programs is to screen for sub-clinical cryptococcal infection among asymptomatic persons living with AIDS using a simple blood test (cryptococcal antigen or CrAg). The prevalence of this detectable sub-clinical cryptococcal infection averages 7.2% (95%CI: 6.8-7.6%) among 36 African cohorts with CD4<100 not receiving ART. If identified, these asymptomatic CrAg+ persons can be given preemptive fluconazole antifungal therapy to prevent the development of meningitis or death. Our stepped- wedge randomized ORCAS trial demonstrated that pre-ART CrAg screening among HIV- infected persons with CD4<100 cells/mcL led to a 30% relative reduction in overall 6-month mortality within 18 clinics in Uganda. A similar ~30% benefit was seen in a separate randomized clinical trial in Tanzania and Zambia. However, while the CrAg screening intervention was successful, the survival of CrAg+ persons was 2-fold worse than CrAg-negative persons in both trials. Based on our team's prior research, Uganda and multiple other countries have incorporated pre-ART CrAg screening of persons with CD4<100 into National HIV Guidelines.  Therefore, further improvements in CrAg screening and preemptive therapy regimens are needed in order to reduce early ART mortality. First, we will evaluate in a randomized comparative effectiveness trial if 6-month cryptococcal-free survival of CrAg+ persons can be improved with enhanced preemptive antifungal therapy using adjunctive sertraline compared with the current WHO recommended preemptive CrAg+ therapy. Second, we will identify risk factors for failure of preemptive CrAg+ therapy with respect to 6-month cryptococcal-free survival. Overall we seek to innovate the delivery of HIV care to reduce early mortality on ART through implementation of an improved package of care for late presenters to care."
"9265434","Project Summary / Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is rapidly fatal, poorly controlled disease that can be rapidly brought into  complete remission but where relapse kills the vast majority of patients. The genetic evolution of the disease  has been defined retrospectively, but the basis for resistance to therapy and effective strategies to overcome it  are lacking. This project seeks to take advantage of well-defined mouse models where a human leukemogenic  allele induces highly penetrant, lethal AML that can be temporarily brought into remission by chemotherapy  agents used in patients. Combining these basic biologic features with novel strategies for quantitatively  assessing clonal behavior, clonal molecular features, physical localization and the in vivo parameters of growth  pathway, cell cycle and apoptosis over time will provide multidimensional datasets for mathematical modeling  of the parameters correlating with: 1. Clonal dominance in vivo (Specific Aim 1) and, 2. Sensitivity/resistance to  chemotherapy in vivo (Specific Aim 2). The models will guide experimental testing of the role of the  parameters in the in vivo behavior of the disease that will then be used to develop and test methods for  enhancing durable control of AML (Specific Aim 3)."
"9268504","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary / Abstract Although clinical palliative care fellowship programs have been growing in number and quality, there is a paucity of research training opportunities in palliative care1 with reports from the Institute of Medicine and National Institutes of Health highlighting the need for basic, translational, clinical, and heath services research in palliative care. 2 3 4 5,6 One of the most important ways to advance care for older adults with advanced illness is to develop junior investigators. Such training is necessary to build the academic infrastructure required for continued evidence-based growth of the field. Recognizing this need, a 2012 joint statement from the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) and American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) recommended increased collaboration between palliative and geriatric medicine in workforce, education, research, and policy. 7 Given existing expertise, a critical mass of experienced investigators, and longstanding close collaborations between palliative care and geriatrics, the University of Colorado is uniquely qualified to address this urgent need through a T32 palliative care research training grant. The goal of this T32 is to prepare postdoctoral fellows for careers as palliative care researchers. This is accomplished by recruiting exceptional and committed applicants and exposing them to an environment which features dedicated, experienced, and outstanding Program Faculty who will serve as senior mentors and affiliated faculty who will serve as junior/co-mentors. These faculty represent key disciplines and resources essential for palliative care research: the Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy and Public Health, the College of Nursing, the Colorado Health Outcomes Program, the Center for Bioethics and Humanities, the Department of Psychology, the Kaiser Institute for Health Research, National Jewish Health, and the resources of the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CCTSI), the University of Colorado CTSA. From the School of Medicine, key connections and collaborations are between the Divisions of General Internal Medicine, Geriatric Medicine and Health Care Policy and Research. The specific objectives of this training program are to: 1) recruit and retain outstanding post-doctoral trainees; 2) support their research training through experiential and didactic instruction; 3) ensure the highest level of academic success through conscientious monitoring of a thoughtfully constructed personalized research career development plan; and 4) enhance the mentoring skills of junior mentors through co-mentoring with more experienced senior mentors, expanding the cohort of senior mentors in palliative care research. These objectives will be carried out by offering: 1) 2 years of research training support for 4-post-doctoral trainees per year; 2) expert mentoring by experienced senior mentors (Program Faculty) with co-mentoring by less experienced investigators (Affiliated Faculty) ; 3) relevant formal coursework tailored to the needs and prior training of individual fellows; 4) regularly scheduled research and career development seminars; 5) integration of trainees into the existing Program in Palliative Care Research activities and resources; 6) frequent and careful review of trainee progress/success, incorporating feedback to and from trainees; 7) ongoing appraisal of the program goals, strength and weaknesses; and 8) sound financial and administrative oversight. Our success will be evidenced by our ability to: 1) fill our positions wih outstanding trainees and foster an ongoing pipeline of trainee candidates; 2) produce academically successful and productive trainees; 3) expand the cohort of palliative care research mentors by engaging more junior faculty as co-mentors with a goal of transitioning them to Program Faculty / senior mentors as they gain experience/expertise; and 4) expand palliative care research capacity through deliberate and strategic interactions amongst programs and faculty, bringing new skills and expertise to and engaging new senior mentors in palliative care research. Of the 52 institutional training grants at the University of Colorado, ths is the only one specifically dedicated to palliative care research. Nationally, only 2 institutiona research training awards (T32) focus on palliative care, and both are limited to cancer (NIH RePORT, accessed 5/19/13)."
"9310274","The Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) is dedicated to creating a new model for conducting clinical and translational research throughout the Johns Hopkins University, by addressing critical obstacles that impede the progress of basic science discoveries to the clinic, clinical discoveries into the community and results back to the research community. To propel additional high impact and efficient translational research, the ICTR will create Translational Research Communities and The Studio. Three Translational Research Communities will be organized around: 1) drugs, biologies, vaccines and devices; 2) biomarkers and diagnostic tests and 3) behavioral, social and systems interventions. These communities of researchers will help prioritize important clinical problems, develop new technologies and methodologies, support junior investigators, work with translational partners outside of Johns Hopkins, and promote efficient research. The Studio is both a place and a process by which research teams can present problems and get integrated, efficient, multidisciplinary consultations from multiple experts. With the emergence of complex big data originating from genomic as well as electronic health records, the ICTR has expanded the Quantitative Methodologies and Informatics Cores to create an integrated platform of data services. These new programs will assist our multiple research teams across the University to access a large array of services provided in five ICTR Cores: Translational Science, Human Subjects Research, Quantitative Methodology, Informatics and Research Participant and Community Partnership. Translational research is changing with more ambitious goals and access to more tools. Johns Hopkins University will continue to provide rigorous, comprehensive training to learners that range from graduate students, fellows, and junior faculty to practicing physicians so they are able to lead and work effectively in translational research teams. Through these innovative and comprehensive programs, the ICTR wants to lead Johns Hopkins University to be an exceptional engine of discovery and innovation. RELEVANCE (See instructions): By identifying and overcoming barriers in the translational pathway, increasing scientific collaboration, providing consultative services, clinical infrastructure, and technology cores that bridge the gap between the laboratory and the clinic, the ICTR helps to speed the pace of scientific discovery, and bring effective therapies to the public, and improve the health of Americans."

"9292355","We propose to create a massively scalable toolkit to enable large, multi-center Patient-centered Information Commons (PIC) at local, regional and, national scale, where the focus is the alignment of all available biomedical data per individual. Such a Commons is a prerequisite for conducting the large-N, Big Data, longitudinal studies essential for understanding causation in the Precision Medicine framework while simultaneously addressing key complexities of Patient Centric Outcome Research studies required under ACA (Affordable Care Act). This agenda entails the four following aims:    Aim 1: Create an individual patient data identification and retrieval toolkit that is robust across distributed data of wide variety and geographically scattered. Robustness with regard to a variety of organizational structures and national scalability is emphasized.  Aim 2: Generate a complete diagnostic and prognostic 'data' picture of a patient across multiple sources of data, some of which are noisy and sparse.  Aim 3. Enable robust decentralized computation on large-scale data with the Patient-centered Information Commons Big Data Science Platform (PIC-DSP), particularly in configurations where data are generated in locations other than where computational resources are most available.  Aim 4: Create three patient-centered information commons instances (PICIs) to test all aspects of the toolkit developed.

"9271972","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HD-domain proteins constitute a novel superfamily of metalloenzymes that counts presently more than 37,000 members in all three domains of life. Though there are generally annotated as as (phospho)hydrolases their functions are mostly unknown. Less than a decade ago, a novel diiron HD enzyme involved in the catabolism of inositol and associated with type I diabetes mellitus, namely myo-inositol oxygenase was demonstrated to carry out a radically different reaction using molecular oxygen to afford activation of its substrate. The only recently identified HD enzyme PhnZ, was also shown to follow the paradigm of MIOX, employing oxygen for the conversion of an organophosphonate to phosphate by marine microorganisms. The mechanism and structure of the reactive intermediates are presently unknown, but their mechanistic striking similarity to other nonheme Fe enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics, invoke questions about the function of these enzymes and their possible implications on human health and environment. For this purpose, the first part of the project will focus on the characterization of PhnZ. This entails a combination of spectroscopic, structural, redox and activity studies so as to establish the modus operandii of such novel oxygenases. The substrate-free and bound forms of the enzyme will be studied so as to obtain for the first time combined structural and electronic information about the 'on' and 'off' reactive states for which crystallographic information has been extremely challenging, how substrate or inhibitors tune and affect the properties of the active site of the enzyme. This information will set the grounds for the discovery of compounds that can activate and inhibit these enzymes, therefore providing powerful control over their function. In addition to, the characterization of downstream events in the chemical reactions will likely establish the common strategy that specific nonheme Fe enzymes (mononuclear or dinuclear) adopt to carry out difficult and environmentally important reactions. The second part of the project aims at mapping the catalytic landscape of (dinuclear) HD domain enzymes, discovery of new functions and identifying the type and the role of metals in modulating specific activities (hydrolysis vs oxygenation). For this purpose, on the basis of phylogenetic analysis new attractive protein targets of unknown function have been identified. Selected protein will be overexpressed and purified. These will be spectroscopically characterized with a combination of EPR, M?ssbauer, crystallographic and NMR techniques. A profile of their activities will be established by screening activities for specific substrates and mass spectrometry methods. Presently there are a handful of HD domain enzymes implicated in immunoresponse, such as restriction factors for HIV-1 or nucleotidases attacking viral nucleotides that have come into the scientific focus. Their function is not completely understood, whereas the presence of one or two metals is not known whether it is functional, structural or co-catalytic. This work will begin during the K99 funding period and will continue during the independent phase and will attempt to study these enzymes and draw the molecular background of their function (hydrolytic vs oxygenation). The long-range purpose of this second phase of the project is to establish on the basis of bioinformatics, crystallographic, mutagenesis and activity studies the determinants directing distinct functions within the HD superfamily that will ultimately lead to the identification new antiviral factors and therapeutic agents as well as the discovery of novel oxygenases implicated in chemically difficult small molecule transformations."
"9266458","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood sets that stage for self-regulatory and decision making processes that shape health and well-being for a lifetime. Research is rapidly uncovering the fundamental principles and processes which govern how human beings perceive the environment, process information, make decisions, experience, express and regulate emotion, form and change attitudes, beliefs and values, and become and remain motivated to change behavior. Translation of these basic behavioral science findings to applied health problems and scalable interventions that improve health and well-being during the childhood years is a complex challenge. Achieving this goal requires knowledge in three critical domains: trajectories of child development and behavior and their biological underpinnings, parenting as a transactional process with roots in biology, and behavioral intervention implementation. We propose a training program that will supply a cadre of researchers fluent in the integration of these three domains of knowledge. We propose to support 4 post-doctoral fellows per year (2 MD fellows in Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics and 2 PhD psychologists). Each fellow will participate in a 2-year course of training that will provide them with knowledge and skills in (1) theories of development and behavior; (2) developmental science methodologies (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging, functional near infrared spectroscopy, eye-tracking, and observational behavioral methodologies); (3) study design and statistical methodology; (4) translation of behavioral research findings to intervention; (5) presentation skills; (6) critical assessment of the scientific literature; (7) socialization into the profession by seeking consultation and advice; (8) grant preparation and peer review; (9) career planning; and (10) ethical conduct of research. The training program will be based in the Department of Pediatrics in collaboration with the Center for Human Growth and Development (CHGD), an interdisciplinary research unit of the University of Michigan with a 50- year history of robust federal funding. CHGD includes 38 regular faculty members, all of whom hold joint appointments in academic departments, including Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, Pediatric Endocrinology, Public Health (Health Behavior and Health Education, Environmental Health Sciences, and Epidemiology), Psychiatry, Social Work, Linguistics, Neurology, Psychology, Neonatology, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. Eighteen faculty with robust funding and mentoring histories are included in the current application. The training will draw on the rich resources at the University of Michigan, including the Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars Program didactic series, the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research, and the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research Summer Program in Quantitative Methods of Social Research. In summary, our training program will prepare leaders in the field of child development. They will be poised to make substantial contributions to improving health and well-being in childhood by integrating biology, behavior, and intervention science."
"9302566","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The six-layered cerebral neocortex is assembled from diverse neuronal subtypes characterized by layer- dependent properties. To attain the laminar organization and neuronal diversity that support cortical circuit function, the full repertoire of distinct cell fates must be specified during neurogenesis. In the developing cortex, myriad subtypes of excitatory neurons arise from common neural progenitor cells (NPCs) that transition through distinct modes of cell production, sequentially specifying diverse cell types with a stereotyped temporal progression (deep-layer neurons ? upper-layer neurons ? astrocytes). Highlighting the significance of this process, disrupted cortical layering is found in cases of autism and genes expressed in layer-dependent patterns in the fetal human cortex have been strongly implicated in autism pathogenesis. The mechanisms underlying layer-dependent fate diversity and how their dysregulation can contribute to brain disorders remain largely unknown. However, sequential neurogenesis from common NPCs is at least a partially epigenetic process, wherein NPCs with the same genome inherit distinct transcriptional states appropriate for their stage in the neuro- gliogenic sequence. In preliminary studies, we found that polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a histone methyl-transferase complex that regulates transcriptional state dynamics via deposition of the repressive histone modification H3K27me3, plays cell type-specific roles in the sequential production of distinct neural fates from NPCs. In this application, we seek to understand the mechanisms by which PRC2 regulates corticogenesis. We hypothesize that PRC2 plays stage-dependent roles in sequential generation via the control of stage-dependent epigenetic programs and transcriptional states within NPCs. To test this hypothesis, we will first define the stage- specific requirement for PRC2 in sequential neurogenesis. Second, we will determine the effects of PRC2 on stage-dependent transcriptional states in cortical NPCs. Third, we will assess reconstitution of the epigenetic landscape following PRC2 re-expression. Histone methyl-transfer has emerged as a leading biological process altered in neurodevelopmental disorders. The successful completion of this study is expected to provide an understanding of histone regulation of corticogenesis, which is a prerequisite to realizing its potential to be pharmacologically targeted in brain disorders."
"9311150","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While considerable knowledge has been accumulated on improving reading for students with reading disabilities in the primary grades, reading interventions conducted with middle-grades (i.e., grades 3-6) have been rare and have typically evidenced low impacts, even when more intensive interventions are provided for increasingly longer durations. One hindrance to extant interventions has been the narrow focus on reading problems without addressing non-academic (e.g., self-regulation, socioemotional) factors known to also affect learning. Thus, investigations of the efficacy derived from integrating additional components into standard reading skills interventions are necessary. Anxiety represents a particularly salient target for such an approach, as it is among the most commonly reported mental health issues of childhood, and significant associations have been found between anxiety and academic outcomes. Further, an overwhelming number of children who are struggling to read or who fail to respond to reading interventions report elevated anxiety. The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate an integrated program designed for middle-grade readers and comprised of evidence-based practices for the treatment of anxiety and reading difficulties. A pilot study of this program, conducted with 36 students randomized to treatment and control conditions, demonstrated its feasibility and positive effects on anxiety outcomes. The proposed multi-site RCT will extend this work by comparing the combined reading and anxiety intervention with a reading-only condition and a control condition. Struggling readers will be included in this study and will receive two years (4th-5th grades) of intervention. The study will assess efficacy of the interventions at reducing anxiety and improving reading at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up (Aim 1). This project significantly enhances extant research on interventions for struggling reading by examining mechanisms of action associated with augmented outcomes among students who receive the combined intervention (Aim 2), and by determining potential moderators of intervention effects (Aim 3). In all, 300 ethnically diverse students will be recruited across two sites. A multi-informant (student, parent, teacher), multi-method (e.g., survey, standardized test, experiential sampling) assessment will be used. Relevance of this project lies in the determination of whether the inclusion of anxiety management skills enhances existing intervention outcomes for struggling readers in the upper elementary grades (concurrently/longitudinally). Examination of contextual and mitigating factors are further relevant for understanding the complex etiology of response to intervention among struggling readers. This project represents translational research that directly informs the practice community (e.g., clinicians, teachers) by identifying novel instructional practices that can be aggregated to more effectively influence student outcomes. By providing socioemotional skills training with a reading intervention using a school-based delivery model, this work has the potential of reducing disparities in mental health outcomes by reaching students of diverse backgrounds (e.g., ethnicity, SES) who would be otherwise less likely to receive such services."
"9258486","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Emphysema is a leading cause of disability and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Aside from cigarette smoke, age is the biggest risk factor for emphysema development. Emphysema has been considered by some as an age-related disease because the alveolar destruction that is its hallmark occurs in the normal aging lung. Telomere dysfunction is one of the best-characterized mechanisms of cellular aging. Our group has recently shown that telomere dysfunction is a determinant of emphysema susceptibility in mice as well as in some human families. This application builds on these findings to probe the mechanisms underlying telomere-mediated emphysema. Our focus is primarily on understanding how epithelial damage and cellular senescence contribute to emphysema, with age and in response to cigarette smoke. The specific aims build on compelling data showing that telomere dysfunction in epithelial cells limits repair after injury, ad test whether telomere length is a relevant determinant of stem cell function in alveolar progenitor cells. Our proposed studies aim to advance paradigms of emphysema biology in the context of aging mechanisms with the goal of identifying new understanding of disease mechanisms and novel targets for treatment."
"9479916","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed P50 Center, Translational Drug Abuse Prevention (TDAP), is to serve as a national resource for cutting-edge, multidisciplinary, scientifically innovative and synergistic Type I and II translational prevention research in drug abuse that seeds future research, practice, and policy in the child welfare system (CWS). Children and adolescents with involvement in the CWS, and those adopted following CWS involvement, are at greatly elevated risk for drug use, HIV-risk, and associated problems including delinquency and poor mental health. The TDAP Center will extend our previous work on drug abuse prevention and broaden the reach and impact of our basic and intervention work in this area through an integrated program of research spanning Type I and Type II prevention research that will increase our understanding in three key areas that have direct effects on CWS policy and practice: (1) Understanding of underlying mechanisms and processes associated with exposure to high levels of early life adversity, and specific to risky decision-making in certain social contexts that are common for CWS youth during early adolescence; (2) reducing the high rates of drug use and engagement in HIV-risk behaviors in adolescent girls in the CWS via novel preventive intervention strategies; and (3) identifying methods for implementing extant evidence-based interventions into CWS real-world settings with high fidelity and empirically measuring implementation success/failure in the context of a public child welfare system-initiated reform. The above Research Components will be supported by a Methodology and Statistics Core that will facilitate integrated qualitative and quantitative analyses of the incoming data, as well as integrate the new data with our large existing data resource of CWS studies. A Pilot and Training Core will support the development of small-scale studies designed to lead to innovative, new independent research projects led by early career, and minority researchers in the area of prevention of drug abuse and HIV-risk in the CWS. Finally, an Administrative Core will provide leadership within the Center, interface with an external Advisory Board comprised of experts in CWS leaders and policy makers, and facilitate training and mentoring of Early Career Scientists."
"9305169","Vascular cognitive impairment & dementia (VCID) is defined as a form of dementia that is triggered by damage to cerebral blood vessels or cerebrovascular disease. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which is accumulation of amyloid ß-protein (Aß) within and along primarily small and medium-sized arteries and arterioles of the brain and in the cerebral microvasculature, is a common cerebral vascular condition that can cause VCID in the elderly. Not surprisingly, with the involvement of Aß, CAA is the most common vascular comorbidity found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Although there is evidence that both parenchymal plaque amyloid and cerebral microvascular amyloid can contribute to dementia in patients with AD and related disorders, there is growing recognition that the latter is a potent driver of cognitive impairment. Yet, the reasons as to why cerebral vascular amyloid forms and its contribution to downstream pathologies and early cognitive impairment remain unclear.  Altered copper homeostasis has been considered an important factor in the neurodegenerative diseases. Earlier findings suggest that copper may play an important role in the formation of amyloid deposits and in subsequent neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. However, relatively little is known about the accumulation of copper in cerebral vascular amyloid deposits, which are associated with early-onset VCID. Thus, the overall hypothesis of our proposal is that copper plays a role in driving fibrillar amyloid assembly in CAA and that the subsequent accumulation of copper in the cerebrovascular amyloid deposits promotes downstream pathologies and early- onset cognitive impairment. In order to test this hypothesis we propose to three specific aims. First, we will determine if vascular amyloid deposits exhibit high levels of copper compared to parenchymal amyloid plaques in post mortem human brain tissue samples of AD, sporadic CAA and familial CAA patients and in transgenic mouse models. Second, we will investigate the effects of copper on Aß fibril assembly. Third, we will determine the effects of increasing or reducing copper levels on the development of CAA, downstream pathologies and cognitive impairment in Tg-SwDI mice.  Currently, there are no effective therapies or reliable biomarkers specifically for CAA. These deficiencies are complicated by our lack of understanding of the assembly and unique structural attributes of cerebral vascular amyloid and their distinctive features that lead to CAA formation and subsequent pathologies. The present proposal, focused on the role of copper in these events, will seek to fill this critical void in our knowledge and will advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of CAA and provide insight into the development of novel diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic interventions for CAA and VCID."
"9224081","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Seasonal influenza A virus epidemics are an obstinate global health issue and cause severe illness and death in high-risk populations. As with other respiratory viral infections, recovery from illness requires pathogen clearance, resolution of the anti-viral inflammatory response, and repair of damaged lung tissue. Restoring the pulmonary epithelial barrier is of profound importance to organ physiology and necessary to minimize susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections1, 2. While many studies have focused on the stages of viral elimination by innate and adaptive immune responses3, a comprehensive understanding of how tissue repair is coordinated, and the role of leukocytes in this process, is poorly defined.  Recent studies have demonstrated a role for leukocyte-derived epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, amphiregulin, in promoting tissue protection in the intestine and muscle4, 5, and following influenza virus?induced damage in the lung6, 7. The applicant recently illustrated that genetic ablation of amphiregulin in murine regulatory T (Treg) cells results in impaired lung function and markedly reduced airway epithelial repair after challenge with influenza virus in vivo6. Transcriptional profiling and flow cytometric analyses of murine lung Treg cells isolated at 5 days post-infection indicated that these cells express receptors for two hallmark tissue damage cytokines, IL-18 and IL-33, and in vitro treatment of purified naïve Treg cells with either of these cytokines was sufficient to induce amphiregulin production. These findings uncovered an important and previously unknown role for Treg cell?derived amphiregulin in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity during the immune response to a respiratory pathogen. This K22 proposal builds on the applicant's prior study and examines (1) the mechanism by which Treg cell?derived amphiregulin contributes to tissue repair and (2) the role of other amphiregulin-producing leukocytes and tissue-protective mediators in coordinating repair processes throughout the course of influenza infection.  Characterizing the molecular and cellular pathways that protect against infectious damage and prevent associated immunopathology will broaden our knowledge of immunological responses and aid in the development of novel therapeutics for treating infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases."

"9267436","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The design of novel synthetic proteins is a key challenge in computational biochemistry with the potential to lead to a better understanding of the processes that underlie life and allow the discovery of molecules with applications in therapeutics, materials, and scienti?c tools. However, due to the high number of degrees of freedom and rugged energy landscape in even small proteins, protein design remains a challenging computational problem. Researchers have begun turning to video games as a means to crowdsource human problem solving for proteomics at a mass scale. This project aims to signi?cantly adapt the existing proteomics video game Foldit to incorporate big data from protein databases into computational structural protein design. This data will be used to inform the manipulation of structural components of proteins. Foldit, a scienti?c discovery game featuring an interactive protein manipulation interface, allows the public to contribute directly t scienti?c research involving the study of proteins. Previous work with Foldit has shown that with an appropriate interface and introduction, even amateur players with no formal background in biochemistry can make contributions to our knowledge of proteomics. Additionally, preliminary protein design work has shown that players can contribute to the successful redesign of existing protein enzymes. In this work we propose to build upon the existing successes of Foldit in crowdsourcing protein design. To do so, we will leverage the huge amount of data on protein structures that exists in protein databases like the RCSB Protein Data Bank. By integrating this data into the mechanics of the Foldit game, we will be able to both improve the tools available to the players and allow them to construct more realistic protein-like structures. We will additionall be able to reward players for staying closer to these structures when making future modi?cations and for ?nding novel sequences that do not exist in databases."

"9429233","Project Summary/Abstract Type2 diabetes (T2D) is the result of reduced insulin release from the pancreas following systemic insulin resistance. Insulin-producing ?-cells within the islets of Langerhans are responsible for maintaining blood glucose homeostasis; and dysfunctional insulin release in T2D results from reduced ?-cell function and mass. Insulin secretion from ?-cells is regulated by coordinated electrical signaling across the islet, which is established by Connexin-36 containing gap junctions (GJs). GJs ensure organized calcium signaling, resulting in proper insulin secretion and ?-cell survival. Preliminary data shows that GJs are prone to uncoupling upon exposure to a pro- inflammatory environment and in response to elevated circulating free fatty acids (FFAs). Given that T2D onset is associated with increases in both adipocyte-derived circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and FFAs, we hypothesize that FFAs and pro-inflammatory cytokines induce islet dysfunction via FFA receptor (GPR40)-mediated GJ uncoupling, which ultimately induces altered Ca2+ signaling, reduced insulin secretion and ?-cell death. Furthermore, we hypothesize that preventing GJ uncoupling under these conditions can prevent diabetes-induced islet dysfunction. To test these hypotheses, both mouse and human islets will be exposed to concentrations of cytokines and palmitate that mimic the pre-diabetic environment. FFA signaling mechanisms will be delineated in islets treated with chemical antagonists/agonists of GPR40 and known GPR40 effector molecules (including phospholipase-C and protein kinase-C? pathways). We will also examine islets isolated from pre-diabetic, leptin receptor deficient mice (?db/db?) that model T2D. In an effort to prevent GJ uncoupling and associated islet dysfunction in T2D, we will synthesize novel inhibitory mimetic peptides targeted against Cx36 motifs that regulate coupling in response to FFAs/cytokines. In each case, state-of-the-art microscopy techniques will be used in conjunction with established methods to assess islet function by measuring GJ coupling, calcium signaling, insulin secretion and ?-cell viability. Results from these studies will define mechanisms by which islet dysfunction occurs in early in the disease that could be precipitating factors to T2D onset. We will also delineate opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions to preserve ?-cell mass, insulin secretory function and improve glycemic control in type2 diabetic patients."

We propose to further develop and validate an endpoint measure of communication for use in clinical trials research. We created a scale that reflects the developmental hierarchy of early communication, referred to as the Communication Complexity Scale (CCS). The CCS can be used with children and adults with severe disabilities including individuals with autism, Rhett syndrome, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), and Angelman syndrome. The focus is on developmentally early communication, beginning with alertness to changes in the environment and progressing through beginning word use. The CCS fills a significant gap in available measures that provide a reliable index of early communication development. The CCS has been used successfully in our research projects with over 100 individuals. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the psychometric properties of the CCS with 300 new participants across ages and types of disabilities. We will measure inter-rater and test/retest reliability of the scale, conten validity, concurrent validity, and discriminant validity. In Aim 2, we will provide evidence about the sensitivity of the CCS to measure change in clinical trials for behavioral interventions of varying lengths, with both preschool and early elementary-aged children. Aim 2 will be accomplished in collaboration with researchers at UCLA. In Aim 3 we will investigate the utility of the CCS as an outcome measure. Following the development of an administration and scoring manual in both English and Spanish, usability testing of the scale and training materials will be completed. Through this research, we will be addressing a critical need identified by NIH to develop and validate outcome measures for use in clinical trials by individuals with ID."

"9284797","PROJECT SUMMARY Translational control plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis under stress conditions as it allows immediate and selective changes in protein levels. A long-standing question in the field of translational control is the mechanism through which cellular mRNAs are able to undergo cap-independent translation. How cells orchestrate differential modes of mRNA translation upon stress remains poorly understood. The goal of this project is to investigate dynamic O-GlcNAcylation in response to stress and understand its role in cap- independent mRNA translation. O-GlcNAc has been proposed to regulate diverse cellular processes, including transcription and cell signaling pathways. Our preliminary results have indicated that O-GlcNAcylation switches the function of eIF4G1 from cap-dependent to cap-independent initiation. We further uncovered a mechanistic linkage between O-GlcNAcylation, ABCF1, and mRNA methylation in cap-independent mRNA translation. These findings led to the central hypothesis that stress-induced O-GlcNAc modification of eIF4G1 licenses cap-independent mRNA translation by remodeling pre-initiation complex formation, recognizing methylated mRNA, and facilitating cap-independent translation. To test this hypothesis, the following Aims are proposed: 1) Characterize the functional switch of eIF4G1 upon O-GlcNAcylation; 2) Define the role of ABCF1 in O- GlcNAc signaling; 3) Dissect the network between mRNA methylation and O-GlcNAc signaling. These Aims are independent of one another but unified in their central focus on O-GlcNAc signaling in translational control of stress response. By integrating innovative approaches into fundamental studies of translational regulation, the proposed studies will open up new avenues of research in the field of mRNA translation. The mechanistic insights we gain from this study will provide paradigms for better understanding of translational control in cellular homeostasis and stress adaptation."

"9470269","Background: Stem cells require support from a niche, which provides regulatory and housekeeping functions. In the C. elegans gonad, the stem cell niche is the distal tip cell (DTC). The germline stem cells induce their own enwrapment by long cellular processes of the DTC. When the gonad basement membrane ruptures, germ cells escape and spill into the body cavity. Escaped germ cells induce enwrapment by body wall muscle to form an ectopic niche. Broad, long-term objective: This system is ideal for studying a property of the niche that is not well understood?reciprocal signaling from stem cells to the niche. Preliminary results show that innexin proteins are necessary for DTC processes to form, and for ectopic enwrapment by muscle. The objective of this proposal is to discover how innexins and other genes mediate this interaction in endogenous and ectopic niches. Specific aims: Aim 1 of the study is to determine the precise role of innexins in normal germ cell-niche interactions. Aim 2 will determine their role in the ectopic niche. Aim 3 is an RNAi screen for genes necessary for the elaboration of DTC processes that also function in ectopic enwrapment. Method: Innexin genes will be endogenously tagged and mutated using CRISPR/ Cas9 genome-editing. Combined with traditional transgenic reporters for the relevant cells types, these genome-edited worms will allow for high resolution confocal microscopy in live animals to see the interactions between germ cells and the niche. RNAi knockdown of genes at precise developmental times and existing mutants will be used to analyze gene function. C. elegans are perfectly suited to genetic screens, and the RNAi screen will be performed according to established protocols. Health-relatedness: Enwrapment of stem cells by their niches and gap junctions between stem cells and their niches are both widespread but not previously known to be related. The proposed research will determine the mechanism by which gap junctions function in stem cells to induce enwrapment by the DTC and ectopic niche, with implications for better understanding stem cell- niche interactions in many contexts, including regenerative therapies and cancer metastasis. Gap junctions are known to be misregulated in cancer. The ectopic muscle niche constitutes a new model for the formation of secondary tumors seeded by cancer stem cells during cancer metastasis."
"9381071","Project Summary: Tick borne diseases continue to emerge in the United States. Powassan virus (POWV), transmitted by the Lyme disease vector Ixodes scapularis, is a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) complex. It causes encephalitis, including fatal neuroinvasive disease in approximately 10% of cases, and long-lasting neurological sequelae have been documented in 50% of survivors. POWV has recently re-emerged, as evident by the increase in number and expanding geographic range of confirmed cases (USGS, 2015; CDC). POWV transmitted to humans by infected ticks, and successful transmission of POWV can occur within three hours of Ixodes scapularis attachment. Successful tick feeding is facilitated by a collection of pharmacologically active factors/proteins in tick saliva, which are secreted into the feeding pool that the tick creates on the vertebrate host. The skin serves as the interface of host-virus-tick interactions; therefore, the objective of this proposal is to investigate cutaneous host immunomodulation by POWV-infected ticks while examining components of tick saliva that lead to a more favorable environment for virus transmission, and identify salivary components that enhances POWV infection. We will test our hypothesis by exploring the following specific aims: (1) Investigate the role of POWV infected tick saliva in modulating immune responses at the bite site to facilitate POWV transmission and dissemination; (2) Identify the specific tick salivary protein/s that potentiate POWV transmission. The proposed research is innovative and novel because we, for the first time, will examine the molecular mechanisms involved in potentiation of a tick borne virus at the tick-host interface. We will also investigate concurrently both host and vector attributes of POWV infection using a systems biology approach. This has never been attempted before. The proposed project will also identify POWV infected cells at the site of tick feeding using Laser Scanning Cytometer that will provide us with precise identification of the type, number, time, and location of immune cells associated with early tick feeding time points. We will also identify the salivary protein/s that enhances POWV infection and dissemination, and also check if antibodies to these proteins will attenuate virus infection. This proposed work will make a significant contribution to the field because it will employ systems biology approach, cutting-edge technologies and innovative ideas to understand the mechanisms and identify salivary components that lead to a more favorable environment for tick-borne virus transmission. Overall, these studies will fill the gaps in our current knowledge/understanding of tick-borne viral infection that continues to increase in prevalence, and provide a new line of investigation of the tick-pathogen-host interface. This, in turn, will lead to development of countermeasures that will attenuate the virus infection.  "
"9479888","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cocaine abuse and dependence continue to extract considerable personal, health and societal tolls in the U.S. and the world. The cycling progressive nature of this disorder stymies efforts to stay abstinent with relapse oft precipitated  by impulsive behavior and craving in the face of exposure to cocaine-associated cues (cue reactivity). Serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission is a strategic nexus that mechanistically connects these phenotypes. The Translational Addiction Sciences Center (TASC) is comprised of a translational team bridging from molecules to cells to animals to humans with the long-term research goal to definitively reveal the role of 5-HT in addiction neurobiology and to integrate this knowledge into the dominant theoretical constructs of addiction. The central research theme of the TASC is that impulsive action and cue reactivity are mechanistically-linked to disrupted 5-HT signaling through the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and 5-HT2CR localized to prefrontal-striatal-thalamic circuitry. Our premise is that restoration of the 5-HT2AR:5-HT2CR balance will repair corticostriatal deficits and ameliorate relapse. The TASC is led by an experienced, translational team that melds classical and state-of-the-art methodologies, bridging chemistry, cellular biology and pharmacology with human and animal psychopharmacology to address this problem. Project 1 will utilize pharmaco-fMRI, dynamic causal modeling, and human laboratory tasks to demonstrate that 5-HT2R gene variants drive both impulsivity and cue reactivity in cocaine-dependent subjects. Project 2 will employ rodent models to illuminate the 5-HT2AR:5-HT2CR imbalance that drives impulsivity and cue reactivity and to provide the experimental platform to normalize 5-HT2AR:5-HT2CR homeostasis and reduce vulnerability to relapse. Project 3 will design and synthesize bifunctional molecules with targeted actions at 5-HT2R to establish proof-of-concept efficacy against relapse in animal models and to study the unique biology of receptor homo- and heteromers. Synergy will be engendered through the Cellular Biology and Pharmacology Core which will centralize genetic screening in humans, cellular assays In vitro for new ligands, receptor signaling and localization ex vivo and studies of receptor homo- and heteromers. The Administrative Core will centralize, coordinate and facilitate the productive community of the TASC, with particular emphasis on removing barriers to success in translational addiction research, optimizing mentoring experiences, and communicating advances in the TASC and the field to the community at large. The progress of the TASC mission will provides insight Into neural dysfunction in the disordered state of drug dependence and establish that restoration of the 5-HT2AR:5-HT2CR balance with targeted new ligands will repair homeostasis and mitigate deleterious behaviors that promote relapse."

"9382059","Signaling networks are crucial for the orchestration of cellular functions in response to stimuli. Knowledge of the structure of these networks provides a basis for understanding the pathological consequences of their malfunction and offers opportunities for designing therapeutic interventions. The complexity of these networks and the speed with which signals are transmitted in cells makes mapping them a formidable challenge. The typical approach for elucidating the structure of cellular signaling networks involves an iterative process of creating signaling protein disruptions, domain mutants and site-directed mutants followed by characterization of each mutant through a battery of cellular activation assays. As a complementary approach, modern proteomic methods using quantitative mass spectrometry can facilitate the hypothesis-driven characterization of signaling pathways by providing a global view of cellular phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions through a variety of activation states.  T cells play a central role in cell-mediated immunity against viruses, a variety of microbes, and cancer. This proposal focuses on the elucidation of the molecular details of the T cell signaling pathway using these new technologies. Lck tyrosine kinase is the central regulator of T cell activation regulated through its phosphorylation state. Lck autophosphorylation at Tyr394 activates the kinase, whereas phosphorylation at Tyr505 inactivates the kinase. Four phosphatases were shown previously to act on Lck Tyr394, but how each one is recruited to Lck and whether other negative regulatory molecules are involved is not understood. The molecular mechanism controlling the proper distribution of Lck between the T cell receptor and downstream signaling nodes such as the SLP76 scaffolded signalosome are not well defined. In the previous funding period, our research team discovered that downstream members of the T cell signaling pathway regulate the phosphorylation of Lck and its substrates. We discovered that the scaffold protein SLP-76 controls both negative and positive feedback loops in T cell receptor signaling at Lck Tyr394. We also discovered that PLC?1 regulates differential Lck substrate phosphorylation within the TCR and the SLP-76 complex.  To gain new insights into the pathways regulating Lck activity and spatial localization, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team to apply novel quantitative proteomic techniques, biochemical methods, and mouse models to provide a detailed view of the network. The central question that we will address in this project is how SLP76 and PLC?1 set the spatial and temporal equilibrium of Lck activation resulting in appropriate T cell response to antigen. Successful completion of the aims will clarify the identity of the regulatory proteins employed in each feedback loop, define molecular factors controlling the cellular localization of Lck, and define their physiological role."
"9281455","Project Summary Project 1: Opposing Roles of Wild-type and Mutant p53 in Regulating Oncogenesis. The wild-type p53 protein is recognized as a major tumor suppressor protein. p53 sits at the hub of numerous upstream stress signaling and downstream gene regulatory pathways and works as a transcription factor whose varied transcriptional targets mediate numerous cellular outcomes. Depending on the context, these include cell cycle, cell death, senescence, metabolic changes and others that serve to protect cells from acquiring cancerous properties. By contrast, evidence continues to mount that the common mutant forms of p53 found in human tumors are actually contributing to their malignant properties. Both wild-type and mutant p53 have been shown to regulate expression over 1000 genes each. Interestingly, in many cases the genes and pathways that mutant p53 upregulates are actively inhibited by wild-type p53. One line of evidence for mutant p53 gain of oncogenic function that was supported by this program was the discovery that mutant p53 regulates the SREBP-2-dependent mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway by which cells synthesize cholesterol and that this is required for the malignant characteristics of breast cancer cells grown in 3D cultures. We now have evidence in collaboration with the Lowe laboratory that wild-type p53 actively represses the MVA pathway by a novel mechanism whereby p53 induces the ABCA1 cholesterol exporter leading to blocked maturation of the SREBP-2 transcription factor. With Scott Lowe we showed that p53 repression of the MVA pathway is required for Myc/p53 null liver tumors to develop. Interestingly, a key byproduct of the MVA pathway, namely protein geranylgeranylation, is required for mutant p53 to upregulate the MVA pathway and ablation of this byproduct plays a role in wild-type repression of this pathway. We also recently discovered VEGFR2, the receptor for the pro-angiogenic VEGF ligand, as another gene that is up-regulated by mutant p53 in breast cancer cells. Activation of VEGFR2 RNA expression involves mutant p53 cooperation with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Indeed, mutant p53 regulation of nearly half of its targets including the MVA pathway genes requires SWI/SNF. The goals of this project are to gain further insight into how mutant p53 works with SREBP2 to regulate both known (MVA and VEGFR2) as well as anticipated new target genes, to gain insight into the positive feedback relationship between mutant p53 and SWI/SNF, to determine how and when p53 activates ABCA1 to block maturation of the SREBP2 protein, to identify which geranylgeranyl targets are required for maintaining growth and malignancy in breast cancer cell cultures, and to identify factors that lead to dependency on the MVA pathway for viability. These experiments, which will potentially inform new treatments for cancer, will in many cases involve collaborative projects with the other members of this program."

"9477268","PROJECT SUMMARY Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive types of skin cancer, causing a large majority of skin-cancer related deaths worldwide. Recently, there have been staggering breakthroughs with the advent of drugs that act on checkpoint inhibitors. These are paradigm- shifting immunotherapeutic agents not only for melanoma, but for cancers in general, because they harness the body's innate ability to target and destroy malignant cells. The original FDA approval for anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies for melanoma contributed to better patient outcomes. The recent FDA approval for their combination for metastatic melanoma showed that attacking cancers through dual pathways led to better efficacy than with any single agent alone. Although promising, the incidence of high-grade immune-related adverse events (irAEs) due to the combination therapy is over 50%. Therefore, there is a pressing clinical need to develop therapeutic agents that may enhance the therapeutic effect of anti-PD1 therapy without significantly increasing toxicity in cancer patients. Resiquimod is TLR 7/8 agonist that is chemically related to imiquimod (Aldara). Resiquimod is more potent than imiquimod in inducing cytokine release owing to its ability to target two, not one, TLRs and its increased bioavailability. Our goal is to harness this small molecule to destroy malignant melanocytes, but to keep its effects localized to the site of injection to prevent systemic side effects. In addition, we plan to boost resiquimod with chemical enhancers that will increase the local anti-tumor immune response. Our preliminary data demonstrate that topical resiquimod has surprisingly potent therapeutic efficacy against established melanoma in multiple genetically engineered mouse (GEM) and syngeneic melanoma mouse models. Topical resiquimod treatment not only inhibited melanoma growth, but also suppressed lymph node metastasis while exhibiting the abscopal effect, whereby tumors distant from the site of treatment were also affected. We plan to develop an injectable form of resiquimod, which we believe will be even more effective against melanomas. Our goal is to minimize the dose of resiquimod needed to induce a local anti-melanoma immune response. We will formulate the safest and most effective form of injectable resiquimod first and test our best resulting product with anti-PD1 therapy. We are confident based on our preliminary data that combination injectable resiquimod/anti-PD1 treatment will be groundbreaking for melanoma as well as for many other malignancies such as lung and bladder cancers. We have the scientific and personnel capability to achieve these aims quickly and meticulously. Our innovative product will lay a solid foundation for IND-enabling studies that will ultimately bring a novel and effective therapy to clinicians and patients in their fight against melanoma.  "

"9351704","PROJECT SUMMARY: Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) constitute a family of 22 proteins that regulate diverse biological processes such as growth, development, differentiation, and wound repair. FGF21 is a unique metabolic hormone as it is secreted in blood from liver in response to starvation and nutrient deprivation to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and to maintain energy balance. Recent studies from our PPG team (Drs Kliewer and Mangelsdorf) have demonstrated that overexpression of FGF21 in mice extends lifespan. Interestingly, FGF21 is also expressed in thymus, however, the impact of FGF21 on ability of thymus to produce T cells and immune system decline during aging is unknown. A major phenotype of age-related thymic degeneration is loss of thymic epithelial cells, emergence of fibroblasts and the accumulation of ectopic lipid within thymus. This project is based on our recent findings that FGF21 overexpression delays aging of thymus and reduces the generation of ectopic lipid and inflammation in thymus. Based on our novel findings that FGF21 improves thymic function, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that approaches to enhance FGF21 signaling in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) will rejuvenate thymic lymphopoiesis and expand T cell repertoire diversity during aging. Aim1 will be using loss and gain of function models where FGF21 signaling is specifically targeted to thymic epithelial cell. This aim will test the hypothesis that FGF21 supports thymic function during aging through autocrine and paracrine action on thymic stromal cells. Aim2 will test the impact of FGF21 on thymic rejuvenation in aged mice and will test the hypothesis that FGF21 mimics a molecular state that signals energy deficit which reprograms thymic stromal cell metabolism towards utilization of lipid as energy substrate. Aim3 will evaluate thymus-independent effects of FGF21on systemic age-related inflammation. Thus, the long term goal of this project is to develop FGF21 agonists as clinical intervention to lower inflammation and improve T cell dependent immune-surveillance in elderly."

"9292231","SUMMARY Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is thought to involve early synapse loss. Familial AD is most often caused by mutations in presenilins, which are the catalytic subunits of g-secretase. Inactivation of g-secretase in adult mice by conditional deletion of its presenilin or nicastrin subunits causes synaptic impairments followed by neurodegeneration, but the relation of the loss of g-secretase acitivity, the observed synaptic impairments, and the neurodegeneration is unclear, as is the connection between these processes and human AD. The present project will focus on clarifying the synaptic function of g-secretase in mature neurons and its relation to neurodegeneration, using mice as a model system. The project proposes four specific aims to address this overall goal. The first two specific aims will mechanistically characterize the synaptic impairments that are caused by g-secretase inactivation in young adult mice in vivo, and analyze their relation to the neurodegeneration that develops at a later stage after g-secretase inactivation. The third and fourth specific aim will then test the hypothesis that at least some of the synaptic functions of g-secretase that are impaired upon its inactivation may be mediated by g-secretase-dependent cleavage of presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic neuroligins, which are trans-synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that bind to each other and act as master regulators of synaptic properties. Strikingly in this context, neurexins and neuroligins were shown previously to be substrates for g-secretase, were genetically linked to AD, and are arguably the most plausible mediators of g-secretase function at the synapse. To test the involvement of neurexins and neuroligins in the synaptic functions of g-secretase, the project will characterize the site and regulation of the g-secretase- dependent cleavage of neurexins and neuroligins, and probe the function of this cleavage using conditional knockout mice of these molecules. Moreover, the project will examine whether inactivation of neurexin- and/or neuroligin-cleavage promotes neurodegeneration. Viewed together, the experiments of this project will thus not only characterize the synaptic function of g-secretase and its relation to neurodegeneration, but also determine whether the synaptic function of g-secretase involves the cleavage of neurexins and/or neuroligins and whether such cleavage may play a contributory role in the pathogenesis of AD."
"9281458","Summary Mutational data from human cancer imply that the p53 tumor suppressor gene is crucial for limiting tumorigenesis. p53 is a sequences specific DNA binding protein that is induced by DNA damage or oncogenic stress leading to induction of genes that trigger a series of anti-proliferative responses whose contribution to tumor suppression remains controversial. Additionally, p53 can directly or indirectly repress gene expression, though the impact of p53 repressed genes on tumor progression and maintenance is poorly understood. Adding to this complexity, p53 mutations typically involve a point mutation in one allele and a large deletion targeting the other, with emerging data indicating that both of these events promote cancer beyond p53 loss. Our project previously established that apoptosis and cellular senescence an be major modes of p53 action in tumor suppression, and most recently identified a key role for p53 in limiting aberrant self renewal and restricting cellular plasticity during tumorigenesis. Using key technologies developed in our group, we showed that reactivation of endogenous p53 in advanced tumors produces potent anti-tumor effects, and explored mechanisms whereby p53 lesions promote tumorigenesis independent of their effects on wild-type p53, for example, identifying therapeutically actionable effectors of p53 mutant action in pancreas cancer and additional haploinsufficient tumor suppressors encompassed within 17p deletions that cooperate with p53 suppress tumorigenesis. In the current proposal, Project 4 will continue to use innovative genetic and animal modeling technologies to address significant unanswered questions in the p53 field. For example, it embraces and studies the notion that p53 action depends on context, and combines powerful uses novel mosaic mouse models to interrogate mechanisms of p53 mediated tumor suppression in different tissue and genetic settings. Using potent and inducible shRNA technology optimized in the group, it tests the novel hypothesis that genes normally repressed by p53 and aberrantly increased in mutant tumors contribute to tumor maintenance and may include targets that are synthetically lethal to mutant p53. In doing so, it implements unique inducible shRNA transgenic technology to explore the impact of target inhibition in tumor and normal tissues. Finally, the project will develop a streamlined method for producing p53 mutant alleles in mice, and use this to explore the biology of highly frequent but understudied p53 truncating alleles to determine whether they produce have gain of function properties. Each of our proposed Aims is supported by substantial preliminary data and will benefit from interactions with all other projects and cores. Successful completion of the proposed work will substantially understand how p53 suppresses tumorigenesis in vivo, and may point to therapeutic opportunities relevant to a large fraction of human cancers."

These lipid peroxides may enable activation of scavenging mechanisms that resolve the nutrient scarcity, induce alternative metabolic pathways that bypass the need for the scarce nutrients, and/or drive activation of ferroptotic cell death to eliminate cells damaged by nutrient scarcity. We suggest that each of these outputs can lead to a tumor suppressive phenotype, and that understanding the mechanisms that govern these processes is critical for understanding the evolution of human cancers and how they may be addressed with precision therapeutics. We focus here on the role of the p53 network in this checkpoint and its impact on tumor suppression. We have two major goals?to define how regulation of the mevalonate pathway by p53 alters sensitivity to ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinomas and to define the regulatory mechanisms governing polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism in lymphomas. Together, we suggest that these studies will define a critical new axis of p53-mediated tumor suppression and provide a new avenue for creation of precision cancer medicines."

"9481886","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of the proposed project is to investigate the functional significance of profilin-1 (Pfn1 - a cytoskeleton regulatory protein) downregulation in breast cancer. We will study how Pfn1, a traditionally pro- migratory molecule, can also regulate intracellular signaling generated at the membrane-cytosol interface to suppress breast cancer invasion and metastasis. In Aim 1, we will first combine clinical correlation and mouse model studies to determine whether a) there is a casual relationship between Pfn1 dysregulation and metastatic progression of breast cancer, and b) Pfn1 expression reflects stages in tumor progression and predicts clinical outcome of breast cancer patients (Aim 1). In Aims 2 and 3, we will identify the molecular pathways by which Pfn1 inhibits breast cancer dissemination Successful completion of these studies will determine whether Pfn1 could be used as a prognostic marker in breast cancer and justify novel cancer therapeutics revolving around Pfn1."
"9280949","?    DESCRIPTION:  Cardiac fibrosis naturally occurs following myocardial infarction (MI). While the fibrotic tissue that forms initially protects the heart from rupture, continued cardiac fibrosis leds to a progressive decrease in cardiac function, and advances the infarcted heart towards heart failure. Accordingly, a therapy that can inhibit cardiac fibrosis from progressing at different stages of post-MI will preserve cardiac function and prevent the heart from evolving towards heart failure. However, there is currently no clinically approved therapy available. Myofibroblasts, formed primarily through TGF? binding to the TGF? receptor IIs (TGF?RIIs) on cardiac fibroblasts, are responsible for cardiac fibrosis. As such, to prevent cardiac fibrosis fro progressing, it is essential to inhibit the TGF? pathway-mediated new myofibroblast formation, and to convert existing myofibroblasts back to cardiac fibroblasts. Yet current preclinical approaches, such as the systemic delivery of TGF? inhibitors or anti-TGF? antibodies, only decrease the content of active TGF? in the heart, but do not inhibit the binding of TGF? to TGF?RIIs, thus cannot fundamentally prevent myofibroblast formation. Besides, the systemic delivery causes dose-limiting side effects. While the use of TGF?RII inhibitors have the potential to prevent myofibroblast formation by blocking TGF? from binding to TGF?RIIs, most of them are not suitable for cardiac anti-fibrotic therapy due to the effective dosages being always above the toxic level.  The fundamental goal of this project is to create a peptide-based, low toxicity TGF?RII inhibitor, and its delivery system to efficiently inhibit TGF? pathway-mediated cardiac fibrosis from progressing at different stages of post-MI, thus preventing cardiac function from progressive deterioration. In our preliminary studies, we have created a peptide based TGF?RII inhibitor ECG. It blocks the initial step of the TGF? pathway ? TGF? binding to TGF?RIIs. It specifically binds to the TGF?RIIs on cardiac fibroblasts without differentiating them into myofibroblasts. ECG also has a higher affinity for TGF?RIIs than TGF?. Therefore, once the ECG binds to TGF?RIIs, TGF? cannot bind to these receptors. ECG also pulls off those TGF? already bonded to TGF?RIIs and occupies the receptors by itself. As a result, ECG is able to prevent TGF?-induced myofibroblast differentiation, and revert myofibroblasts back to cardiac fibroblasts. To deliver ECG into infarcted hearts with high ECG retention in the tissue, and without causing dose-limiting side effects, we have developed an injectable and fast gelation hydrogel that can be specifically injected into infarcted hearts, can quickly solidify (<10 s) afte injection to efficiently retain ECG in the heart, and can gradually release ECG. Our preliminary in vivo study demonstrated that the hydrogel-based ECG release system attenuated cardiac fibrosis.  Based on the above studies, we hypothesize that local delivery of hydrogel-based ECG release system into the infarcted heart will significantly attenuate cardiac fibrosis at different stages of post-MI, thus preventing cardiac function from progressive deterioration. The hypothesis will be tested through 2 specific aims: AIM #1 will test the hypothesis that optimal ECG release profiles will efficiently prevent cardiac fibroblasts from differentiating into myofibroblasts, and convert myofibroblasts back to cardiac fibroblasts. AIM #2 will test the hypothesis that ECG release systems will inhibit cardiac fibrosis from progressing in the infarcted hearts at different stages of post-MI to prevent progressive cardiac function deterioration."
"9258507","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 30,000 Americans currently suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) which is characterized by progressive paralysis due to the degeneration of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control muscles. Almost all cases of ALS are eventually fatal and the rapid progression of the disease makes it particularly terrible, with over 80% of patients dying within five years of diagnosis. No cure exists for ALS and the only available treatment slows disease progression by merely a few months. Therefore a great need exists for more effective and specific therapies that can stop or even reverse neurodegeneration. Innovation for such therapies will only arise from a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathological process.  The proposed study aims to identify molecules and pathways dysregulated during disease progression in specific cell populations in the cerebral cortex, including the vulnerable upper motor neurons (UMNs). Such an analysis has never been done before due to the complexity of cortical architecture hampering the ability to distinguish between cell populations. Genetic studies have linked a number of genes to ALS pathology, including SOD1, TDP43, and FUS, yet all of these genes are widely expressed in many cell types throughout the body while ALS afflicts only certain cells in the CNS. This project will utilize the novel translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) methodology to overcome these limitations by allowing for the examination of protein translation from genetically defined cell types. Engineered mice harboring the TRAP transgene (bacTRAP mice) in four cortical cell types (two populations of vulnerable UMNs, a non-vulnerable neuronal population, and astrocytes) will be crossed to three mouse models of ALS that utilize disease-linked mutations in the SOD1 (G93A), TDP43 (M337V), and FUS (P525L) genes. These models recapitulate the neurodegeneration seen in human patients and will enable a comprehensive assessment of cell-type specific molecular changes during ALS pathology.  Changes in gene expression during disease progression will be determined by analyzing TRAP translational profiles at three time points (early, pre-symptomatic, and late) within each model. While this is a pre-clinical basic research project, efforts will be focused on identifying candidate genes that wil have the strongest and most immediate clinical impact. Particular emphasis will be placed on changes that occur at early and pre-symptomatic stages since earlier intervention will likely have an increased rate of success. These studies aim to improve upon the success rate of therapies arising from animal models by probing genes altered specifically in vulnerable cells across multiple models. Results from the proposed study will provide the field with a valuable resource of novel genes and signaling pathways to serve as candidate targets for more specific and innovative therapeutics to treat ALS."
"9280278","Program Summary/Abstract  This T32 renewal application requests funds over five years to support six (6) predoctoral traineeships in population research at the Center for Demography and Ecology (CDE) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Since 1962, CDE has offered a world-class training program in population science (with nearly continuous NICHD T32 funding since 1975). Our graduates are among the leaders in population research today, serving in a range of academic, government and applied research settings. Guided by the NICHD mission ?to ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of all people,? CDE research is organized around five major areas: 1) Fertility, families & households; 2) the Demography of Inequality; 3) Health & mortality; 4) Biodemography; and 5) Environmental and spatial demography. Our training objectives?and associated research activities?fall squarely under the Population Dynamics Branch which ?supports research and research training in demography, reproductive health, and population health.?  The primary goals of the CDE training program in demography are: (1) to foster an interdisciplinary community of junior scholars in population research; (2) to build expertise in demographic theory, methods, and analysis; and (3) to cultivate students' professional skills, including the organization, execution, presentation, publication, and critique of research. Within the CDE training program, the process of developing this expertise involves four essential components: (1) formal training via coursework in students' home departments and interdisciplinary coursework in other departments; (2) exposure to cutting-edge research of scholars in the broader community of population studies, primarily through the weekly Demography Seminar (`DemSem'); (3) participation and collaboration in substantive research projects of CDE training faculty through an apprenticeship model; and (4) professional socialization and integration into the field of population studies, especially via the weekly Demography Training Seminar.  Predoctoral T32 trainees are typically appointed in the second or third year in their PhD program, having shown clear academic promise and a strong commitment to pursuing a population research-related career; most students come from Sociology, Economics and Population Health (although we are increasingly recruiting from a broader range of disciplines), and they typically receive T32 funding for two to three years. We are requesting 6 predoctoral training slots (1 more than our current allocation) because our program has continued to grow in size, scope and quality. Our training efforts have expanded to focus on interdisciplinary research areas at the forefront of social science (especially biodemography and spatial/environmental demography), and we have been very successful at recruiting even larger numbers of highly-competitive students into our broader training program. For the 2016-17 academic year, 8 top-notch, first-year students in Sociology and several enrolled students in Economics and Population Health will join our existing group of 26 demography trainees. Having a critical mass of T32 traineeships ensures that we can continue to support our most outstanding students in what we believe is one of the best available environments for predoctoral training in population research."
"9387669","?    DESCRIPTION: The Center for Learning and Memory (CLM) at the University of Texas at Austin is an organized research unit that brings together researchers whose goal is to identify the neural mechanisms of learning and memory. The CLM has grown to include fifteen faculty, all hired since its inception in 2005. Given this growth, the highly interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the CLM faculty, and the major University commitment to this research field, we believe all key elements are in place to implement an innovative and active training program in learning and memory. The CLM faculty represent a broad range of approaches to the mechanisms of learning and memory - from the molecules of neural information processing and synaptic plasticity to cellular and systems level studies to functional neuroimaging in humans. We will leverage the strengths of this collaborative faculty along with innovative and comprehensive training activities to implement a program that prepares graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to become innovative leaders in the future of learning and memory research. The proposed training has four important components. First, we will provide our trainees with hands-on instruction in the implementation of interdisciplinary approaches to the study of learning and memory that cross levels of analysis. Second, we will provide extensive training in computational neuroscience methods that are increasingly necessary to understanding the neural mechanisms that support learning and memory. Third, the proposed activities will provide our trainees with the ability to place their research in a biomedical contet, with a particular emphasis on the role of learning and memory processes in disorders of mental health. Finally, the proposed activities and resources provide our trainees with many opportunities for career development including the skills necessary to obtain a tenure track position (e.g., presentation and grant writing skills) as well as exposure to research-related careers outside of academia. These components will prepare our trainees to be the next generation of leading edge researchers dedicated to uncovering the neural mechanisms that support our ability to acquire new information and remember past experiences."

"9278557","ABSTRACT Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease are the leading cause of preventable cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Acute rheumatic fever is a multisystem inflammatory autoimmune disease that occurs in a subset of patients as a delayed complication of an improperly or untreated throat infection with a rheumatogenic strain of S. pyogenes, Group A Streptococcus, (GAS). While the exact triggers and mechanisms of ARF have not been proven, studies indicate that aberrant immune responses develop against host tissues approximately 3 weeks after GAS infection. The most severe pathology of ARF takes place in the heart, where infiltrating immune cells, cytokines and auto-antibodies cause destruction of the heart muscle and permanent damage to the heart valves. While there is no current diagnostic kit available, a method of detecting children who are more susceptible to ARF (3-6% of the total population) would have global health and economic benefits. As such, over the last century investigators have searched for genes related to ARF susceptibility. As ARF is an autoimmune complication of infection, most the research has focused on genetic markers related to different components of the immune response and effects of various immune mediators, but no direct correlations could be made across ARF patients from different ethnic groups and geographical locations. As an alternative, D8/17, a murine monoclonal IgM antibody capable of binding an unknown allogenic epitope on B- cells from ARF patients, was found to bind B lymphocytes in 90-95% of ARF patients from diverse ethnic groups and different geographical locations compared to only 11% in matched controls. While many studies have successfully tested cell culture supernatants of the D8/17 antibody as a marker for rheumatic fever susceptibility across several different population groups, no group to date has identified the specific target antigen that the D8/17 antibody binds to on the surface of B cell lymphocytes. We plan on use cutting edge techniques involving antibody sequencing and recombinant engineering, to elucidate the sequence of the D8/17 antibody variable regions. We then produce new recombinantly expressed mouse IgM and IgG1 versions of the D8/17 antibody. We hypothesize that the IgG1 class- switched antibody will be a better reagent to identify the D8/17 antigen and more amenable for use in diagnostic testing. We will also compare the activity of these newly engineered antibodies and utilize them in fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry experiments to more specifically derive the D8/17 antigen from our previously immortalized B-cell lines isolated from rheumatic fever patients and controls. By utilizing the class switched D8/17 antibody, we hope to discover novel susceptibility markers in patients predisposed to acute rheumatic fever (ARF), allowing us to derive better diagnostic reagents and gain further insight into the role of the associated genetic factors in pathogenesis. This will be achieved though proteomic and expression analysis of immortalized B lymphocyte lines from rheumatic fever patients to identify the D8/17 marker. We hope that our findings will lead to an ARF specific-diagnostic test for susceptibility to this illness and further elucidate the mechanisms behind this treatable and preventable disease."
"9281453","Overall Summary For the past 15 years our Program Project CA87497 has been highly productive and interactive. The future goals of this program are to study the context-dependent tumor suppressive roles of wild-type p53, and to elucidate how cancer related mutant forms of p53 promote oncogenesis. We will investigate newly discovered pathways in which wild-type and mutant p53 proteins operate and their respective roles in regulating the epigenome and characterize new transcriptional targets of p53. In addition to the current members, Drs Carol Prives, Arnold Levine, Scott Lowe and Carlos Cordon-Cardo, we have brought in Drs Brent Stockwell and John Petrini who each contribute new and exciting directions that interface with the existing projects. Our approaches include cell biology, chemical biology, biochemistry, proteomics, microscopy, bioinformatics, functional genomics, mouse modeling and human and mouse pathology. Our research is highly translational and relevant to human disease, focusing on breast cancer, liver cancer and lymphoma. Project 1 (Prives) will investigate mutant p53 gain of function activities employing cell-based assays, gene expression profiling and proteomics. Project 1 will elucidate how and why mutant p53 stimulates the mevalonate pathway, while wild- type p53 represses this same pathway, and will obtain mechanistic information as to how mutant p53 facilitates nucleosome remodeling. Project 2 (Stockwell), will define mechanisms that govern p53 regulation of ferroptosis, which his group discovered. Planned work will define how the p53 target p21 acts in a negative feedback loop to restrain ferroptosis, how p53 regulates ferroptosis through its effects on the mevalonate pathway, and how nutrient deficiency regulates p53 and its impact on ferroptosis. Project 3 (Petrini) will quantify and determine the location of p53-dependent epigenetic changes induced by oncogene activation in mammary epithelium and will determine whether this novel pathway is operative in hematopoietic cells, and assess its importance for suppression of lymphomagenesis and myeloid leukemia. Project 4 (Lowe) uses advanced genetic and genomic tools together with novel genetically-engineered mouse models to explore mechanisms of p53-mediated tumor suppression in different tissue and genetic contexts, and the role of novel p53 mutants on tumor initiation and progression in vivo. It will also explore the role of ferroptosis in tumor suppression and how deregulation of p53-mediated gene repression programs including the mevalonate pathway contributes to tumor maintenance. The planned research will rely extensively on three cores: Core A (Prives), that will administratively support all interactions within the program, the Bioinformatics Core B (Levine) that will provide crucial computational support for each project in order to aid in the discovery of genes and pathways regulated by mutant and wild-type p53 in different contexts. Core B will test new hypotheses and identify new modulators of wild-type and mutant p53. The Molecular Systems Pathology Core C (Cordon-Cardo) will provide critical information regarding human tumors including new molecular biomarkers derived from mevalonate and ferroptotic pathways. Core C will also quantify heterochromatic marks and will study biomarkers of mutant p53, stem cells, and new repression targets in liver and lymphoma samples."
"9480139","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal drug addiction constitutes a major public health problem for both women and affected children, with long lasting consequences on children's social, emotional and cognitive development. Current treatment strategies tend to focus on the mother and her current addiction, rather than her relationship with her child, and developmental processes that may perpetuate the addiction problems, such as unresolved childhood attachment trauma, neglect, and chronic stress. Unlike mothers who find engaging with their own infant to be a uniquely rewarding experience, mothers with addictions may be less able to respond appropriately to their infant's cues, finding them less intrinsically rewardin or salient, and more stress provoking. Our current study has identified key areas in dopaminergic and oxytocinergic brain pathways that show a diminished functional MRI response when addicted mothers view the faces of their own vs. unknown infants, compared with non- addicted mothers. These areas include the hypothalamus, striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Oxytocin, a neuropeptide with decreased peripheral levels seen in addicted mothers, is integrally involved in maternal brain and behavioral responses. When administered intranasally, our pilot data has shown enhanced activation of the striatum, prefrontal cortex and amygdala. The purpose of this renewal grant is to continue and expand upon our investigation of maternal addiction, by conducting a randomized, double-blinded, placebo- controlled, crossover study of intranasal oxytocin on maternal brain responses. A new group of 150 mothers from our two current study sites (Baylor College of Medicine and the Yale Child Study Center) will be enrolled (75 with a history of drug addiction and 75 matched control mothers), along with their 4 to 7-month-old infants, to participate in four study visits over a two-month period. During Visit 1, mothers will complete the Adult Attachment Interview to determine their attachment classification and to identify markers of unresolved trauma. At Visit 2, a videotaped free-play assessment of mother-infant interaction (the CARE-Index), and a modified Still Face Procedure, will be conducted to assess the quality of maternal caregiving and synchrony. During the final two study visits, functional MRI will be used to compare maternal brain responses to infant face cues after receiving either intranasal oxytocin or placebo, comparing own vs. unknown happy and sad faces. We will focus on activation of, and functional connectivity between, the striatum, prefrontal cortex and amygdala, key reward and stress related regions containing oxytocinergic neuronal connections. We will also examine factors that may moderate oxytocin's effect in the brain, including attachment classification, mother-infant synchrony, sensation-seeking or risk-taking behavior, and stress/trauma exposure. This knowledge will contribute significantly to our long-term goal of discovering novel treatment strategies for mothers who suffer from drug dependency and addiction."
"9479912","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opiate addiction is now a national epidemic marked by an increased incidence of abuse and overdose of heroin and elevated misuse of prescription opioids which also bears a high incidence of overdose death. Despite this growing opiate problem there remains a lack of knowledge about the molecular neuropathology of this human disorder. A fundamental core of our reverse translational research efforts has thus been to fill critical gaps of knowledge by direct investigation of the brains of human heroin abusers. Such efforts have identified the transcription factor ets-like kinase 1 (ELK1) as a central candidate in human heroin abusers. ELK1 disturbance was downstream of the mu opioid receptor (the pharmacological target of heroin metabolites and prescription opiates) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and it was found by in silico analysis of microarray data to target the promoters of a large percentage of down-regulated genes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of heroin abusers. Surprisingly, very limited knowledge exist about ELK1 in relation to drug abuse, but this transcription factor has been implicated in other fields in cellular differentiation and synaptic plasticity that are highly relevant to the pathophysiology of addictio disorders. We hypothesize that heroin abuse leads to dysregulated ELK1-mediated transcriptional activity of target genes involved in the reorganization of striatal synapses and tht modulate drug-seeking behaviors. We propose: (1) to determine ELK1-mediated transcriptional regulation in neurons within striatal and mesocorticolimbic brain regions of human heroin abusers by conducting ELK1 ChIP in combination with high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) on the nucleus accumbens, dorsal striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex of heroin abusers. This data will also be integrated with transcriptome analysis to determine the relationship to gene expression. (2) To identify the epigenetic landscape across the ELK1 gene that contributes to its dysregulation in heroin abusers. (3) To investigate the causal role of ELK1 in structural plasticity and heroin seeking behavior by use of animal models. The multidisciplinary approach will expand significant insights about novel targets for treatment interventions and the dataset accrued by this body of work will be a unique and valuable resource to the field given the current lack of such human brain data."
"9268790","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions targeting overweight individuals can produce positive ripple effects on untreated overweight partners in the home. Interestingly, ripple effects on partners' weight appear most pronounced when the interventions target women. Women, and mothers in particular, remain the primary nutritional gatekeepers of the home. Despite widespread recognition that motherhood is a powerful motivator for behavior changes, no study to date has examined the ripple effects of prenatal lifestyle interventions that target mothers' gestational weight gain. The primary aim of the proposed study is to determine whether lifestyle interventions to prevent excessive gestational weight gain in overweight/obese pregnant women have positive ripple effects on untreated partners in the home. The proposed study is ancillary to two randomized phase III clinical trials in the LIFE-moms consortium (1U01HL114377-01, PI Phelan; 3U01DK094418-01S1, PIs Martin and Redman) that are examining the efficacy of multi-component lifestyle interventions to prevent excessive gestational weight gain in a total of 650 overweight/obese women. In this ancillary study, partners' weight, home environment, and psychosocial behaviors will be assessed when their pregnant partners are ~13 weeks gestation (study entry), 35 weeks gestation and at 6 and 12 months postpartum. We hypothesize that partners of pregnant women randomized to the lifestyle intervention, relative to those of standard care, will have greater weight losses through 12-months. Secondary aims examine partner improvements in weight control behaviors, the home environment, and psychosocial parameters. This project is highly innovative, as it capitalizes on existing funded research and is the first study to examine ripple effects of multicomponent prenatal interventions. The project also has high impact, as pregnancy is a powerful motivator for behavior and environmental changes in the home; and, if positive ripple effects occur, the field of obesity treatment and prevention could move beyond focus on individual level to the often unrecognized interpersonal effects of lifestyle interventions."

"9417488","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Toxoplasma gondii's tropism for the CNS underlies the symptomatic disease it causes in developing fetuses, the immunocompromised, and, occasionally, the immunocompetent. As an intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma's ability to co-opt host cell function determines both the parasite's survival and its effects on the host. What is known about the Toxoplasma-host cell interaction comes primarily from in vitro studies in fibroblasts and immune cells. These studies have revealed that Toxoplasma commandeers host cell functions in part through the injection of effector proteins and that these proteins target boh universal and host-cell-specific pathways. While these studies established much about Toxoplasma-host cell biology, they will have missed host cell pathways specific to the CNS or only triggered during in vivo infection. These limitations are particularly relevant to the CNS, which is composed of multiple interacting cells types that maintain a baseline anti-inflammatory state. Given the vital nature of the CNS- Toxoplasma interface to clinical disease, understanding the CNS-specific effects of Toxoplasma is essential to eventually preventing symptomatic neurologic disease. To this end, we recently engineered Toxoplasma strains that inject Cre recombinase into host cells concomitantly with the effector proteins. By using these parasites to infect mice that express a green fluorescent protein only after Cre-mediated recombination, we are able to permanently identify and profile CNS cells injected with Toxoplasma effector proteins. Substantial preliminary data from this model strongly suggests that, contrary to existing  dogma, Toxoplasma primarily interacts with neurons in vivo, which means that neurons are the major parenchymal CNS cell directly manipulated by Toxoplasma. The goal of this proposal is to determine how the neuron-Toxoplasma interface drives the establishment and outcomes of CNS infection. To this end, we will use our new mouse model in combination with two genetically divergent strains of Toxoplasma that cause different CNS outcomes and that we have engineered to inject Cre. Specifically, using cut- ting edge CNS imaging techniques that we have developed, we will determine if these Toxoplasma strains cause distinct CNS outcomes by infecting different CNS regions or co-opting different neuron subtypes (Aim 1). Additionally, to determine if these strain-specific CNS effects are secondary to differential manipulation of neurons, we will isolate and transcriptionally profile these Toxoplasma-injected neurons (Aim 2). The successful completion of this research will provide the first mechanistic insights into how neuron-Toxoplasma interactions drive CNS disease. Ultimately, such insights will offer us new avenues for developing CNS-specific or even strain-specific therapies that improve the outcomes of CNS disease."
"9269624","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this research is to improve the understanding of factors explaining one of the most pervasive results of social epidemiology: the migrant mortality advantage, i.e., the observation that migrants tend to exhibit lower mortality than the non-migrant population of their host country. In spite of the extensive literatue on the topic, this mortality advantage remains questionable and poorly understood, in part because of the very nature of the migrant population: a population that is highly mobile and difficult to capture correctly in data sources. Studies documenting the migrant mortality advantage in various countries typically fail to adequately account for these features, producing mortality rates among migrants that tend to be artificially low. In such a context, the classic observation that migrants experience a mortality advantage upon arrival in the host country (often in spite of their lower socio-economic status) which diminishes over time and disappears or even reverses for the second generation, remains difficult to interpret in epidemiological terms. This challenges the ability of policy makers to adequately address the health needs of migrant populations. This research will examine the nature and magnitude of the migrant mortality advantage using three rich and unique longitudinal data sets from France, a highly-relevant context for this area of research. Specific features of these data sets will allow us to address methodological pitfalls that have plagued research on migrant mortality so far. These features include: a rigorous follow-up of deaths occurring among migrants in the host country; the possibility of censoring individuals when they leave the host country; a rigorous follow-up of deaths worldwide for former residents of the host country; and the possibility of capturing second-generation migrants. These unique features will allow us to evaluate two major hypotheses for the migrant mortality advantage: (1) the hypothesis that the migrant mortality advantage is a data artifact due to inadequate recording of deaths and person-years of exposure for migrant populations in their host country; and (2) the hypothesis that the mortality advantage is produced by selective return migration, a hypothesis also known as the salmon bias hypothesis. The focus is on mortality above age 30, with additional focus on mortality above age 65. Using data with unique features and representing a highly-relevant context, this project will evaluate hypotheses with a greater level of precision and comprehensiveness and will make important contributions to debates about how a set of general mechanisms can affect patterns of the migrant mortality advantage, with implications for a variety of contexts where a similar advantage has been observed."
"9323232","PROJECT ABSTRACT The Hsp110 molecular chaperone is increasingly being recognized as a potent regulator of amyloidogenesis as well as a potential pathogenic modifier for multiple protein misfolding disorders including cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer?s disease and Huntington?s disease (HD). However, few systematic studies have been carried out on metazoan Hsp110 to examine its physiological roles, particularly in long-lived neurons that are more susceptible to protein misfolding and aggregate formation, largely due to lack of suitable metazoan model. In addition, Hsp110 has been determined at the biochemical level to function both as a chaperone ?holdase? and as a Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factor (NEF). However, how these two distinct activities contribute to its neuronal protective role is unknown. In this R21 application, we propose to generate Drosophila lines with designed mutations in the sole fly Hsp110 ortholog (dHsp110) that specifically abolish holdase or NEF activities, and use established Drosophila HD models to test the hypothesis that Hsp110 acts as an activator of Hsp70 cycling in concert with Hsp40, and/or as a stand-alone chaperone holdase to sequester amyloidogenic proteins and prevent aggregation and associated toxicity. Completion of this project will establish the feasibility of future pharmacological exploitation of Hsp110 in the nervous system to combat morbidity and mortality arising from proteopathies in the aging population."
"9439341","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The mortality rate of PCa in African American (AA) is 2-3 times higher than Caucasian American (CA) men. A number of studies demonstrated that high incidence and mortality rates of PCa among AA men might originate from genetic, lifestyle or socioeconomic-related factors. Molecular mechanisms underlying these discrepancies are still under investigation. The process of tumor growth and metastasis mainly depends on the ability of cancer cells to communicate with each other and with neighboring cells. Microvesicles (MVs) are small cell-derived extracellular bodies secreted by normal and tumor cells and they promote cell-cell communication. The cargo of these vesicles carries microRNAs mRNAs and proteins to recipient cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding regulatory RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. However, their real physiological function of extracellular RNA (exRNA) including miRNAs, in PCa racial disparities is still obscure. Our previous study demonstrates that MV-derived onco-miRNAs contribute to PCa progression through transformation of patient-derived adipose stem cells. Importantly, we identified selective expression of a subset of putative onco-miRNAs in prostate tumors. Thus, altered onco-miRNAs expression could be a determinant factor for high PCa progression and mortality rates among AA men. Thus, we hypothesize that onco-miRNAs derived by prostate tumor microvesicles are critical to PC progression in AA men of PCa. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims; 1) To investigate the expression levels of putative (miR-3613-3p and miR-3680-3p) and known (miR-125b, miR-130b and miR-155) onco-miRNAs in normal and PCa cells derived from AA and CA men as well as in human PCa specimens and 2) To examine the functional significance of these onco- miRNAs in mediating disease progression. This study is innovative, because it capitalizes on discovery of new functional roles for this putative onco-miRNAs and their relevant cellular target genes in PCa health disparity. Our expectation from this proposal is to understand the pleiotropic functions of these putative onco-miRNAs and clarify their implications in health disparity. Our preliminary results show that not only the expression of putative miRNAs (miR-3613-3p and miR-3680-3p) was higher in PCa cell lines versus normal cells but also in AA vs. CA patients. However, the expression of miRNA target genes (i.e. tumor suppressor genes; PDCD4 & LATS2) was low on in vitro and on human tissue level suggesting these miRNAs have an oncogenic activity. Our long-term goal is to explore the functional significance and potential clinical utilities of these putative miRNAs, as biomarkers or therapeutic targets, to improve the outcomes and quality of lives of patients suffering from this disease. The outcomes from this study will certainly benefit the PI by giving him the opportunity to acquire research support, exercise him to become independent investigator and inspire him to apply for independent research-supports (i.e. R01). In addition, scientific findings that will be obtained from this proposal may lead to discovery of new prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in PCa and definitely will address the reasons why African American men have more aggressive disease than other minorities."
"9469090","African American women have 1.5 times the rates of preterm birth (PTB)(<37 weeks completed gestation) compared with non-Hispanic white women. This disproportionately high PTB rate in African Americans is a persistent health inequity that leads to high child mortality, morbidity, and developmental delays. In the U.S. approximately $26 billion are spent annually on health care costs for infants and children that were born prematurely. Recent attempts to explain the high PTB rates in African American women have focused on social stressors, such as disadvantaged neighborhoods, racial discrimination, and stressful life events. These social stressors may lead to PTB by increasing women's emotional stress levels. Not surprisingly, emotional stress along with levels of the stress hormone cortisol and systemic inflammation - both physiological responses to stress - have all been related to higher risk of PTB. In contrast, one's psychosocial resources (e.g., social support) can lessen emotional stress and have protective effects on PTB. Little is yet known about the pathways by which social stressors affect inflammation, and ultimately PTB. The objective of the proposed study is to determine how social stressors alter inflammation during pregnancy and lead to PTB in African American women. We aim to: 1) determine the pathways by which social stressors affect PTB; and 2) describe social stressors, emotional stress and psychosocial resources; the associations among these concepts; and their impact on PTB from women's perspectives.  In this longitudinal convergent mixed methods design, we will enroll 1,500 African American women who live in the Detroit metropolitan area. We will collect data on social stressors, emotional stress, and psychosocial resources through questionnaires and administrative (e.g., census) data. This will be done three times prenatally. At these same time points, levels of cortisol and systemic inflammation will be determined from hair and blood samples, respectively. We will also obtain birth data from the prenatal and hospital records. In a subsample of 60 women, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to more specifically understand the associations among social stressors, emotional stress and psychosocial resources; and their impact on PTB. We will conduct a variety of statistical, qualitative and mixed methods analyses using both quantitative and qualitative data to determine answers to the aims of our study. We will also consider the timing of pregnancy in our analyses, as the prenatal data are collected at three distinct time points. The proposed research is highly relevant to NIH's mission to elucidate mechanisms underlying health disparities in PTB. Insights gained from this mixed methods approach may lead to the development of an individualized PTB risk profile based on a woman's social stressors and biomarkers which will have potential use in clinical practice and be a target for culturally appropriate interventions to reduce PTB incidence in African American women, and will generate new perspectives for future research in other racial groups through our detailed focus on this high risk group."
"9480124","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoke exposure results in a significantly increased life-long risk for numerous inflammatory lung diseases. Fetal and neonatal exposure to tobacco is a major risk factor for chronic lung disease of prematurity, which affects an extremely vulnerable population, with an estimated burden of more than $2.5 B/yr. in the US. Epidemiological studies strongly support a causal association between smoking history and COPD, the third leading cause of death in the US and lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. Animal models and in vitro systems have been used, in combination with studies of human disease samples, to identify disease-associated pathways. Unfortunately, while the health risks of tobacco smoke exposure are widely-appreciated, there are no existing in vitro tests to ascertain risks associated with exposure burden or different type of tobacco products. We hypothesize that specific, reliable changes in gene expression can serve as biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposures that are accurate and predictive of human disease risk. The goal of this Project is to develop cell-based assays for specific disease-relevant gene expression signatures of cigarette smoke exposure. We propose three Specific Aims: The first Aim will survey genome-wide responses to tobacco smoke in vitro and ultimately result in a set of transcriptional biomarker sets which are accurate and predictive of human disease. The second Aim will define specific, physiological responses to inhaled smoke from a variety of tobacco types and doses within the lung, using a validated mouse model of smoke-induced lung disease. This Aim will also identify distinct responses in adults and more vulnerable juveniles and neonates. The third Aim will help to refine the set of biomarkers to focus upon whose dysregulation are observed in human lungs upon tobacco smoke exposure and/or in resulting disease states, and assess the predictive potential of those specific biomarkers. This project is highly responsive to the goals of the Program and will support the FDA mission to regulate tobacco products by developing multiple, disease-relevant, regulatory-appropriate assays that could be used by the FDA to quantitatively and qualitatively measure the adverse impact of tobacco smoke exposure."
"9275533","Summary: The most popular replacement heart valve designs (so called ?bioprosthetic heart valves? or BHV) continue to be fabricated from xenograft biomaterials for both current and novel valve designs (e.g. standard stented valve, percutaneous delivery). Failure continues to be the result of leaflet structural deterioration mediated by fatigue and/or tissue mineralization, with durability limited to 10-15 years. Such limitations results from a combination of valve design and the intrinsic fatigue response of the constituent xenograft biomaterials. Thus, improved durability remains an important clinical goal and represents a unique cardiovascular engineering challenge resulting from the extreme valvular mechanical demands that occur with blood contact. Yet, current BHV assessment relies exclusively on device-level evaluations, which are confounded by simultaneous and highly coupled biomaterial mechanical behaviors and fatigue, valve design, hemodynamics, and calcification. Thus, despite decades of clinical BHV usage and growing popularity, there exists no acceptable method for simulating replacement valve function and durability at both the device and component biomaterial levels. This situation has contributed to the current stagnation in BHV development, limiting rationally developed improvements in prosthetic heart valve durability. We thus hypothesize that with the use of advanced biosolid mechanics simulations of the fatigue response of xenograft biomaterials coupled to state-of-the-art fluid-structure interaction (FSI) methods, a biomechanically rigorous and physiologically realistic approach to predict BHV performance can be developed. We will develop these coupled computational goals first in parallel, then combine and validate them in a final project stage.   "
"9421678","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a devastating psychiatric disorder that affects millions of Americans. Despite substantial research, no specific risk factor has yet been identified as having a causal role in MDD. Epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation, are increasingly being recognized as a key mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of depression. However, the biological pathways linking aberrant methylation to depression remain poorly understood. This uncertainty greatly hampers our ability to implement early diagnosis, prevention and treatment for this debilitating disorder. The objective of this study is to identify functional epigenetic determinants for MDD. Our central hypothesis is that aberrant DNA methylation and resulting alterations in gene expression are associated with MDD. The rationale for the proposed research is that: once we know the epigenetic determinants for depression, we will be able to develop novel epigenetic markers and therapeutic targets for risk assessment, prevention and treatment of MDD and related psychiatric conditions. We proposed three specific aims: (1) Identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with MDD. This aim is to conduct an epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis to identify epigenetic variations contributing to MDD in monocytes DNA from 100 monozygotic (MZ) discordant twin pairs from the University of Washington Twin Registry (UWTR), a large community-based twin registry in the U.S. (2) Replicate the top 50 ranked genes from Aim 1 in two independent samples, including 80 MZ discordant twin pairs recruited from the same registry and 36 postmortem brain tissue of well-characterized MDD patients and matched controls. (3) Determine the functional importance of the positive methylation findings in both blood and brain by profiling gene expression levels in each of the four brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and cingulate cortex). Differential expressed genes related to MDD will be identified. Integrative analyses will be performed to elucidate the connections between DNA methylation patterns and gene expression of cognate genes in relation to MDD. The proposed study is the only one of its kind to identify functional epigenetic determinants for MDD in a well- matched MZ discordant twin sample, followed by replication in postmortem brain tissue, the affected organ in MDD. The work proposed here is expected to have an important positive impact, because genes with both differential methylation and expression are highly likely to provide novel epigenetic targets for prevention, intervention and treatment for depression and its related psychiatric conditions in addition to fundamentally advancing the fields of psychiatric genetics."
"9479870","PROJECT SUMMARY OVERALL COMPONENT The Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction (CSNA) synergizes the expertise and effort of behavioral neuroscientists, computational biologists and geneticists, who each bring state-of-the-art approaches to an integrated research program that will identify and model the common underlying biological mechanisms of biobehavioral risks for stimulant self-administration. Drug addiction is a devastating and highly complex neurobehavioral phenomenon, characterized by multiple etiological factors, stages and behaviors that have proven difficult to study in combination. Advanced mouse genetic populations provide a platform for evaluating the relationships among these behaviors, finding genetic variants responsible for their variation and identifying their associated biological mechanisms and pathways. We will make use of the new Collaborative Cross genetic reference population and Diversity Outbred mapping population to identify the biological mechanisms by which predisposing traits predict the tendency to self-administer the psychostimulant drug cocaine. Each predisposing trait, including impulsivity, acute and sensitized drug responses, reward-seeking, adolescent nicotine exposure and circadian variation, is studied in one of the Center's five scientific projects. Our approach is unprecedented in that we will evaluate these traits simultaneously in a mouse population exhibiting extreme genetic and phenotypic variation, enabling a holistic and extensible assessment of the common and distinct biological mechanisms of addiction vulnerability. We will definitively and directly identify sources of trait correlation in the population. We will produce functional genomics and phenomics datasets, which will be deposited in widely accessed and highly functional informatics resources, where they may be expanded upon by the global research community. Our Center will also generate novel, validated mouse mutants and complex models for mechanistic studies of addiction-related phenomena. In addition to aiding the scientific mission of our five scientific projects, our three research support cores will provide proven, state-of-the-art and innovative technologies to the broader field, including: 1) a sophisticated, large-capacity Behavioral Phenotyping Core, 2) an Integrative Genetics and Genomics Core for statistical genetics, molecular profiling, biobanking and data dissemination, and 3) a Mouse Resource and Validation Core for delivering novel mouse resources for systems genetics, in vitro and in vivo mutation induction and validation. The Administrative Core will oversee the effective coordination, integration and dissemination of the Center's research activities and deliver our findings through The Jackson Laboratory (JAX)'s well-established educational programs. The Pilot Core will offer additional investigators the opportunity to initiate collaborative work with the Center. Through its combined efforts, the CSNA will enable discovery of the mechanisms linking multiple susceptibility phenotypes to the propensity to seek and take drugs, opening up new opportunities for both prevention in those at risk for addiction and intervention in those already afflicted."
"9259916","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that early detection, targeting aggressive prostate cancer, will enable survival benefits of treatment for lethal disease, and reduce harms of over-treatment for indolent disease. Toward this goal, we assemble biospecimen sample sets via rigorous SOP's in cohorts designed to avoid bias. We provide these specimens and guidance regarding study design to Discovery Labs, industry and consortia. Team efforts between the DMCC, the Hopkins BRL, industry partners, UTHSC-SA and our CVC facilitated FDA approval of the Prostate Health Index (phi - with data from our CVC's first cycle), and urinary PCA3 (with data from the current cycle). In two funding cycles, our CVC enrolled 4,821 subjects. We helped advance the TMPRSS2:Erg fusion (T2:Erg) discovery by the Chinnaiyan BDL toward actionable clinical use, completing 3 Aims with progress on the 4th: First, we combined urinary detection of T2:Erg with urinary PCA3 to improve specificity of detecting cancers with Gleason score > 7, validated this algorithm in a multi-center cohort, and showed the potential to reduce health care cost via this algorithm in men less than 65 years old. Second, we characterized community-based distribution of urinary T2:Erg, PCA3, and phi independent of PSA screening, and found race- based differences in these parameters, paving the way for a phase IV screening trial (separate proposal under review by DOD). Third, we compared prostatectomy tissue Erg expression to urinary T2:Erg, guiding the range of appropriate urinary T2:Erg cut-points to reflect tissue status. Fourth, we procured biopsies from two nation- wide, retrospective watchful waiting cohorts (PHS and HPFS), enrolled subjects onto the PASS Trial, and assembled a biospecimen set suitable for evaluating multiplex RNA's to discern aggressive from indolent disease. Recognizing limitations of T2:Erg as a classifier of cancer aggressiveness, we initiated clinical translation of a 24-gene, multiplex RNA panel for discerning aggressive from indolent prostate cancer; showed the feasibility of this assay in biopsy tissue and urine, and identified an industry partner to evaluat this signature on a clinical grade platform. We will expand our validation studies to include imaging to assess cancer severity based on FACBC, a PET radiotracer undergoing clinical development. We are expanding the breadth of our CVC from previously being limited to academic medical centers (AMC's), to now including an urban indigent care hospital, a Veterans Administration Medical Center, and a suburban community hospital (in addition to our host AMC) so that we project enrolling 1050 African-American men, substantially diversifying the EDRN biospecimen resource. We now propose the following Aims: 1) To validate the combination of urine PCA3, T2:Erg and serum phi as predictive of aggressive prostate cancer de novo and for active surveillance; 2) To validate a multiplex RNA signature of aggressive prostate cancer in biopsy samples and post-DRE urine; 3) To validate FACBC as imaging to detect occult metastatic disease in high-risk, localized prostate cancer; 4) To collaborate with EDRN BDL's, CVC's and BRL's to advance prostate cancer biomarker development."

"9351705","Project Summary Inhibiting the growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway by dietary or genetic manipulation extends lifespan in a range of species, including possibly humans. However, achieving this effect pharmacologically has proven difficult. FGF21 is a hormone that is released from the liver in response to fasting and elicits diverse aspects of the adaptive starvation response. Among its metabolic actions in mice, FGF21 causes GH resistance and consequently a marked reduction in circulating IGF-1 concentrations. Remarkably, transgenic mice overexpressing FGF21 from birth live 30-40% longer than wild-type mice. In the studies proposed in this application, we will test whether FGF21 causes a corresponding increase in the healthspan of mice as assessed by measuring strength, immune system and cognitive function. We will further determine whether initiating exposure to FGF21 in adulthood also extends lifespan and healthspan. Lastly, we will test whether FGF21 suppresses the GH-IGF-1 pathway by inducing suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 2, which has well established anti-GH effects. Since several pharmaceutical companies already have FGF21 in clinical trials for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes, FGF21 administration may be a viable approach for extending healthspan and lifespan in humans."
"9251767","The mission of the Molecular Oncology Program (MO) is to integrate and coordinate research with a focus on identifying and exploring anti-cancer targets, particularly those that distinguish cancer from noncancer cells based on growth, differentiation and survival. Key accomplishments in this Program include the discovery of a novel small molecule that targets an oncogenic fusion protein, STAG2 as a regulator of chromosomal integrity that is deleted in many cancers, and a novel method to chemically reprogram cancer cells. Continued emphasis is on discovering small molecule probes that may lead to future novel therapeutics and biomarkers. To accomplish this mission, MO members perform research around three themes: Theme 1 focuses on unique genomic events that initiate and sustain cancer growth: mechanisms deregulating chromosomal integrity and the role of oncogenic chromosomal translocations in malignancy. Theme 2 focuses on the immortal lives of cancer cells: studies on cellular immortalization; cancer prevention by dietary components that modulate DNA repair mechanisms; and the effect of nutrients on the activity of mutant p53 and its role in transcriptional activation in DNA repair. Theme 3 focuses on the metastatic mechanisms that allow the spread of cancer: discovering novel regulators of metastatic pathways and identifying useful small molecule inhibitors. Led by Jeffrey Toretsky, MD, and Vicente Notario, PhD, the Program has 17 members and includes faculty from six Georgetown University departments. Total peer review funding is $5.9M (direct) in the last budget year, of which $4M is from NCI. MO members published 210 peer-reviewed publications, of which 35% involved external collaborations and 41% were intra- and/or interprogrammatic, the latter involving collaborations with all three other LCCC Programs. Research on small molecules targeting EWS-FLH and the conditionally reprogrammed cells methodology begun in MO have transitioned to the Experimental Therapeutics or Breast Cancer Programs for clinical trials.

"9317138","Project Summary: The exploratory research proposed here addresses the critical issue of understanding both macrostructure and microstructure of infant sleep as well as the role of sleep as a facilitator of brain maturation and cognitive outcomes. Although extensive research has been conducted on sleep in animal models, in adults and in premature neonates, very little is known about the neurophysiology of sleep in healthy human infants. Current research suggests that alterations in sleep pattern or duration play a role in almost all known psychiatric disorders and further, that many of the mechanisms governing developmental plasticity also mediate plasticity in the adult brain. Variability in sleep patterns is also gaining attention as a possible early biomarker for a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. Identification of reliable biomarkers could lead to targeted diagnostic tools that would be useful in diagnosing a number of developmental disorders. We will examine infant daytime sleep in a rarely studied age group (3, 6 and 9 months), using advanced dense-array EEG recording (dEEG) and analytic techniques seldom used in sleep studies, in combination with concurrent assessment of infant cognition and information processing. Thus, the aims of this application include: (1) characterizing the topographical spectral composition and network connectivity of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) in typically developing, napping infants, at 3, 6, and 9 months; and (2) testing the hypothesis that neurophysiological measures of topographical electrophysiology (microstructure) and temporal global functional networks (microstates) during NREMS are associated with cognitive measures. We propose to achieve these aims using dEEG data and characterizing spectral power, coherence, and network connectivity of NREMS and REMS as well as the morphology, topography, and developmental trajectories of two prominent NREMS waveforms (i.e. sleep spindles and slow waves), which are hypothesized to be critical to infant brain development. Finally we will use standardized cognitive scales and auditory and visual habituation/recognition-memory tasks to assess infants? cognitive development levels as well as working memory and attention. We anticipate that the outcomes of this study will accelerate our understanding of infant brain development across the first year of life, delineating the emergence, function and maturation of changing oscillatory sleep patterns, while simultaneously facilitating future translational approaches (e.g. interventional strategies for slow wave and spindle enhancement) targeting developmental sleep as it relates to the prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders."

"9326634","PROJECT SUMMARY Callous-unemotional (CU) traits predict socially debilitating outcomes including Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) and violent crime in adulthood. Despite significant research, the etiology of CU traits is not well understood. The current project incorporates genetic, physiological, neuroanatomical and self-report measures to investigate the etiology of CU traits within the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). Psychopathic/CU traits have long been proposed to reflect an underlying fear-deficit, and therefore this project focuses on measures corresponding with the acute fear construct within the RDoC matrix. Specifically, the physiological measures of facial eyeblink EMG in response to startle and fear-potentiated startle probes, as well as the neuroanatomical volumetric measures of regions of interest (ROIs; anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala) will be investigated as potential endophenotypes for CU traits. To be considered a putative endophenotype for CU traits a measure must display three characteristics: 1) association with CU traits, 2) heritability, and 3) genetic covariation with CU traits. While startle and neuroanatomy have been shown to meet the first two criteria, little to no research has investigated the third criteria. We hypothesize that startle response and neuroanatomical ROIs will meet all three criteria for endophenotypes of CU traits. Furthermore, we hypothesize that there are specific developmental periods that are most salient for the genetic and environmental factors influencing the progression of CU traits. We will address these hypotheses through the following Specific Aims: 1) investigate the phenotypic relationship between CU traits and startle, 2) examine the genetic influence on the variation and covariation of CU traits and startle throughout childhood and adolescence, and 3) investigate potential neuroanatomical ROIs associated with CU traits, and the genetic influence on the variation and covariation of ROIs and CU traits. We will accomplish these aims using a large, genetically informative, general population sample of juvenile (ages 9-20) twins (N=1696, 848 twin pairs). Biometrical structural equation modeling (i.e., `twin modeling') will be used to decompose the variance and covariance of CU traits and potential endophenotypes proposed here into latent factors reflecting the effects of 1) additive genetics, 2) unique environment and 3) dominant genetic or shared environment. Additionally, how these influences change over the important developmental period of childhood and adolescence also will be examined. This proposal directly corresponds with the NIMH strategic plan for research, which emphasizes the need for research on 1) defining the mechanisms associated with complex behaviors and 2) determining the developmental trajectories of mental illness. The results from this study have the potential to a) confirm the use of specific measures as endophenotypes in future research on CU traits, and b) inform future developmentally-based intervention strategies."

The merged program represents the only NIH-supported mechanism for postdoctoral training in diabetes research at Washington University.   The program is continually evolving in response to our ongoing assessment of its effectiveness, the needs of our trainees, and the dynamic nature of diabetes research. It is multidisciplinary and team-oriented. We propose to continue to train MD, MD PhD, and PhD scientists for 2-3 years through a structured program that leverages numerous strengths that include but are not limited to:  ? An exceptional pool of 29 mentors focused on diabetes. These scientists are pursuing research in basic mechanisms, proof of principle T1 translation, T2/T3 translation to patients and practice, and T3/T4 translatio to practice and populations. This group includes two members of the National Academy of Sciences and one member of the Institute of Medicine, each having mentored trainees during this most recent funding period, and several new members representing a broad spectrum of career stage and diversity.  ? A core curriculum in diabetes science required of all trainees to ensure that individuals with different backgrounds establish a standard knowledge base. ? Training with a clinical context for PhD scientists as well as those with clinical degrees in order to inform translational efforts.  ? Clearly defined metrics of success that are monitored by a personalized Career Development Committee for each trainee. ? A series of mechanisms to assess quality and effectiveness of the program as well as established procedures to take action in response to the results of these assessment tools. ? A dynamically integrated short-term research training program operated in close collaboration with our NIDDK Diabetes Research Center. ? Well-established mechanisms for enhancing diversity.     Our trainees are productive, having published more than 250 papers that have been cited more than 8000 times in the past 10 years. They are successful in terms of obtaining grant support for their research that includes (in the past 10 years) two R01s, several R01 equivalents (in the EU), three K01s, two K12s, two KL2s, one K99/R00, several pilot and feasibility awards, awards from the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association, and others. They are successful in terms of achieving productive scientific careers since our trainees enter academics (in the past 10 years) at a rate ~50-100% greater (depending on degree) than the biomedical workforce based on data cited by NIH. Our integration of two programs has achieved synergies leading to improvements in the mentor pool, enhancements in recruitment and mentoring strategies, and expanded efforts to increase diversity that collectively perpetuate a culture of multidisciplinary training with a very high likelihood of exerting a sustained and powerful influence on diabetes research."
"9355465","DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Fibroids affect 77% of women by onset of menopause in the U.S. and account for $2.1 billion in healthcare costs each year. Fibroids negatively impact reproductive health causing heavy and painful menses, pelvic pain and pressure, pregnancy complications, and interventions including myomectomy and hysterectomy. Until recently, tumor tissue and cell culture studies investigating fibroid growth have been the primary sources for understanding fibroid pathophysiology. Genetic analysis can provide a powerful and cost effective tool to identify etiological and causal factors, especially since a genetic predisposition to fibroids has already been documented from twin studies. As much as 69% of risk is explained by genetic factors. Racial disparities also support a role for genetics with fibroid risk. African American women have earlier age of onset, more numerous and larger fibroids with a greater lifetime incidence compared to Caucasians. We propose to identify genetic markers for risk of fibroids through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of African American and Caucasian participants, leveraging ancestral differences to narrow down genomic regions for targeted follow- up analyses. To accomplish this we will take advantage of a unique Vanderbilt resource, the BioVU DNA databank. BioVU currently has over 122,470 adults linked to electronic medical records. From BioVU we have already identified 2,902 African American and Caucasian subjects who meet our stringent inclusion criteria to conduct a GWAS of fibroids, including pelvic imaging. Available imaging is critical, because many women with fibroids are asymptomatic and without imaging, studies may misclassify as many as 51% of women. We have also defined definitive controls who reached menopause without fibroids. We have a strong group of nationally known fibroid researchers who will provide over 10,000 samples for replication. Our first Specific Aim is to conduct a GWAS for association between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and fibroid risk. Using a case-control design we will perform a GWAS in 2,902 (1,451 fibroid cases and 1,451 controls) women from BioVU stratified by African American and Caucasian race. Secondary admixture mapping (AM) analyses will also be performed to identify chromosomal regions of interest to prioritize for replication. Our second Aim is to resequence chromosome regions identified from GWAS and AM to discover rare variants. Finally, in Aim 3 we will replicate SNPs selected from Aim 1 and 2 in independent samples of at least 3,230 fibroid cases and 7,097 controls. We propose an efficient and cost-effective approach to identify genetic risk factors for fibroids, by taking advantage of imaging information and DNA available through BioVU. This study represents the largest GWAS of uterine fibroids and the first among African Americans leveraging emerging technologies and new statistical approaches to conduct this study. Our proposed study will fundamentally change knowledge about fibroids and lay the ground work for breakthroughs in understanding mechanisms of fibroid formation and in identifying novel therapeutic approaches."
"9313275","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We still know very little about the mechanisms that regulate and synchronize morphogenetic events during later stages of vertebrate development. Nonetheless, understanding the factors controlling these later developmental periods is essential to understanding how adult traits form, and will lend insight into morphological defects and disorders that arise during human post-embryonic fetal and neonatal periods. This research utilizes the zebrafish, which undergoes extensive post-embryonic development involving modifications and maturation in many different organ systems; many of these changes are similar or identical to processes that occur following embryogenesis in humans. This proposal employs several strategies towards understanding the mechanisms underlying the zebrafish transformation from larva to juvenile. The first aim adopts a targeted approach, testing the specific roles of thyroid hormone in post-embryonic developmental transitions. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that thyroid hormone is involved in several developmental processes in zebrafish, but the ability of this hormone to effect specific morphogenetic processes and cellular behaviors remains unclear. This aim will test roles of thyroid hormone in promoting both global somatic developmental progression and the behaviors of a specific, well-characterized cell lineage that produces adult pigmentation during the larval-to-juvenile transition. The second aim takes a forward genetic strategy to identify novel genes required for post-embryonic stage transitions. This approach has already identified two mutants that exhibit complete somatic arrest during larval development, ceasing ontogenetic progression at stages normally reached by 2- and 3-week old wild-type larvae. These phenotypes suggest an impairment of genes absolutely required for post-embryonic progression. Mapping and cloning the mutations and characterizing the pathways to which they belong will reveal mechanisms essential for post-embryonic developmental processes; continuation of this screen will identify further larval arrest phenotypes. The final aim utilizes a species related to zebrafish that exhibits a natural failure t execute the terminal stages of somatic post-embryonic development. Focusing primarily on the structure and expression within the skin, changes in genetic and developmental architecture will be elucidated in this context of post-embryonic developmental truncation. These analyses will reveal the both extent of decoupling between traits and regulatory pathways, and whether dormant genetic pathways retain responsiveness to a key endocrine mediator of post-embryonic development. Overall, these efforts will characterize the morphogenetic roles of a known endocrine regulator, will identify novel factors that regulate normal post-embryonic progression, and will establish a novel model for dissecting the ways in which developmental genetic pathways and endocrine mechanisms can evolve. Moreover, this project will complete the developmental biology and genetics training of a scholar with a background in population ecology, and will establish the foundation for her independent research laboratory."
"9257448","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dense core granules are vesicles that store and release bioactive peptides, and are found throughout most eukaryotes. Over the past two decades, detailed models have been developed to explain protein targeting to secretory granules. The most fundamental aspect of these models is that protein sorting in this pathway does not rely on canonical transmembrane receptors or receptor adaptors. However, recent experiments in mammalian neurons led to the surprising finding that bone-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), a peptide important for neuronal maintenance, is targeted to secretory granules in a pathway, as yet undescribed, that involves a classical lysosomal sorting receptor, sortilin. Moreover, sortilin-family receptor variants have been identified as risk factors for diabetes, and recent work suggests they play a direct role in formation of insulin-containing granules. Another challenge came from recent studies in Drosophila, and in mammalian neuroendocrine cells, which implicated the AP-3 adaptor complex in secretory granule formation. No current model explains the sortilin or AP-3 data. Secretory granules are a prominent feature in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. By studying gene expression during periods of active granule synthesis, it was recently discovered that the Tetrahymena sortilin homologs are highly upregulated under these conditions, in combination with a set of genes that are proposed to underlie secretory granule formation. Those gene products include putative sortilin ligands as well as AP-3 adaptors and other cytoplasmic machinery that is likely to be involved in sortilin trafficking. Preliminary data validate the value of this gene expression-based approach to uncovering mechanisms involved in granulogenesis, and demonstrate that sorting of major classes of granule proteins in Tetrahymena requires sortilins. The proposal is therefore aimed at understanding how sortilins facilitate protein targeting to granules, and what other cellular machinery is involved. To that end, the aims of this proposal include the analysis of sortilin ligands and of adapter proteins that interact with sortilin cytoplasmic domains."
"9281460","CORE B SUMMARY The advent of a wide variety of high throughput techniques has enabled the rapid sequencing of DNA and RNA and the identification of large numbers of proteins in protein complexes. These technologies, and their further iterations, have in turn allowed researchers to identify and catalog the somatic mutations in cancer, associate genetic variants with disease, the abundance of individual mRNA transcripts in every cell, the nature and expression of a range of non-coding RNA species, and the nature of modifications on histones and DNA. While the data arising from these methods has the power to produce enormous insights into cancer, the datasets produced are large, unwieldy, and of varying quality. Consequently, the role of bioinformatics in cancer research has become a necessity for the proper interpretation of data. The goal of Core B is to provide support for program investigators in the analysis and interpretation of these large datasets. It takes advantage of the expertise of Dr. Levine, a pioneer in the p53 field who has used computational approaches to reveal new insights into the p53 network, and the infrastructure at the Institute for Advanced Study. In the current iteration of the grant, the four projects will interact with Core B to continue to explore the roles and regulation of p53, with an emphasis on the context dependent nature of p53 action and the action of p53 mutants, the role of p53 in DNA damage and oncogene responses, the impact of a novel form of cell death ? ferroptosis ? on the output of the p53 network, and on developing therapeutic strategies to exploit p53 mutations or the consequences of p53 loss. All of these significant questions rely a variety of `omics technologies for assessing gene expression, chromatin configurations, and many other applications. As such, core B is essential for the proper analysis of these data and as such is central to the program's success."
"9251190","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The goal of this study is to develop, explore the effectiveness, and implement the novel training method of dynamic haptic robotic training (DHRT). This method utilizes a commercially available haptic robot that can be programed to apply forces to the resident's hand to mimic an actual needle insertion. We postulate this training method will allow residents to more efficiently build their skills, obtain greater proficincy in less time and will better ensure that a proficient skill level is reached before the residents ae allowed to perform these interventions on patients. This proposed goal will be accomplished through the completion of the three specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop accurate needle insertion model and implement into haptic robotic device. In this aim ex vivo bovine liver experiments will be conducted to characterize the noise in the force upon needle insertion into soft tissue. This information will form a needle insertion model that will be programed into a haptic robotic device to simulate the haptic feel of needle insertion. This simulator will be evaluated by expert vascular surgeons and then modified accordingly to ensure accuracy in needle insertion simulation. Specific Aim 2: Develop and Optimize the Dynamic Haptic Robotic Training (DHRT) Program Hypothesis (H1) We hypothesize that our DHRT program will improve CVC insertion competence and success rates better than traditional CVC simulators because it allows for the development of the complex cognitive and psychomotor needed to successfully perform CVC procedures. The needle force data acquired in Aim 1 will be integrated with novel visual simulations of human anatomical configurations (e.g. vessel wall location, size variation, and wall thickness) in a graphical user interface that will provide both haptic and visual feedback to surgeons. The DHRT program will be experimentally tested by quantitatively and qualitatively comparing the program method to the baseline static simulation models currently used Specific Aim 3: Assess long-term improvements in CVC insertions and patient safety after incorporation of the DHRT program in the educational curricula at Hershey Medical Center Hypothesis (H2): A dynamic haptic robotic training program can reduce complications rates among patients undergoing CVC procedures at Hershey Medical Center (HMC), improve confidence, and offer a more accurate assessment of resident CVC skills than current state of the art phantom based training methods alone. To validate this hypothesis CVC complication rates and resident confidence will be compared among residents who receive the traditional phantom training (Year 1) and residents who receive the DHRT training method (Year 2)."
"9309412","This proposal will examine the unanticipated hypothesis that the ?6?4 integrin (referred to as `?4') contributes to the initiation and metastasis of breast tumors by a non-cell autonomous mechanism. This hypothesis derives from the observations that the expression of ?4 is low or absent in breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) but that it contributes to the formation and metastasis of breast cancers. A major goal of this proposal is to reconcile these discrepant observations and understand how ?4 contributes to tumor formation and metastasis. Interestingly, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) contain a distinct sub-population of cells characterized by high expression of the ?4 integrin (?4high) that is distinct from CSCs (?4-/low/CD24low/CD44high), exhibits basal epithelial differentiation and lacks stem cell properties. These observations indicate that repression of ?4 is necessary for CSC function. In fact, we observed unexpectedly that ?4 expression in CSCs promotes their differentiation and inhibits their self-renewal. The first specific aim will investigate the mechanism that underlies this phenomenon and it will focus on the exciting possibility that it involves the ability of ?4 to modulate focal adhesions and cytoskeletal tension resulting in diminished stem cell properties. This aim will also test the possibility that alterations in cytoskeletal tension have a causal role in promoting the differentiation of CSCs. The second specific aim will evaluate the hypothesis that the ?4high sub-population exerts non-cell autonomous regulation of CSCs. In other terms, a key function of the ?4high subpopulation is to expand the CSC population. More specifically, it is proposed that this distinct sub-population engages in paracrine signaling with CSCs mediated by parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and that this signaling contributes to the expansion of CSCs. This hypothesis is based on the observations that ?4 regulates PTHrP expression and that the ?4high sub-population and CSCs are in proximity in breast tumors. Also, our preliminary data indicate that the ?4high sub-population helps to maintain self-renewal and survival. These observations provide an explanation for how the ?4 integrin contributes to tumor initiation and metastasis without being expressed in CSCs. The final specific aim will study the relationship between CSCs and ?4high cells in vivo and evaluate their relative contribution to tumor initiation and metastasis. The first set of experiments will examine whether both CSCs and ?4high cells are required for efficient tumor formation and metastasis using a transgenic model of TNBC. The second sub-aim probe more deeply into the relationship between CSCs and ?4high cells by evaluating the extent to which CSCs differentiate in vivo and assessing their association with ?4high cells in niches. These goals will be facilitated by the use of reporter constructs to tag these distinct populations. This approach will allow us to address several key issues including the frequency that CSCs (GFP+) differentiate in vivo, the association of ?4high and CSCs in `niches' and the relative frequency of CSCs and ?4high cells in metastases."
"9262274","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal fibrotic lung disease for which there is no effective therapy. IPF fibrotic progression is characterized by the relentless spread of fibrosis from scarred alveoli into normal adjacent alveolar units. Our studies indicate that there is a distinct IPF fibroblast phenotype characterize by aberrant integrin signaling leading to pathological activation of proliferation signaling pathways. We have discovered that IPF lung tissue harbors pathologic mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) that are a cell-of-origin for IPF fibroblasts. Despite this discovery, the detailed mechanism(s) leading to the genesis and maintenance of IPF MPCs in the IPF lung and their differentiation to IPF fibroblasts remain unclear. We have found that IPF MPCs contain high levels of the calcium-binding protein S100A4 in the nucleus where it exists in a complex with histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). HDAC4 epigenetically regulates gene expression and has been implicated in stem cell and fibroblast differentiation. We have found that the S100A4/HDAC4 nuclear complex promotes IPF MPC propagation while suppressing differentiation. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesize that the S100A4/HDAC4 nuclear complex functions to maintain and promote the expansion of the IPF MPC population in the IPF lung. Recent studies have defined a critical role for a stiff fibrotic matrix in programming fibroblasts to acquire fibrotic properties and highlight the importance of the pathologic matrix as a driver of the progressive fibrosis in IPF. However, the role of the fibrotic matrix in directing PF MPC differentiation has not yet been examined. We hypothesize that a stiff fibrotic matrix directs IPF MPC differentiation to disease-mediating fibroblasts. This is based on exciting preliminary studies indicating that in response to interaction with a stiff matrix, the S100A4/HDAC4 nuclear complex becomes depleted and this is associated with IPF MPC differentiation. In the case of S100A4, contact with a stiff matrix promotes S100A4 translocation to the cytoplasm, where it associates with myosin IIA. The loss of nuclear HDAC4, triggered by contact with a stiff matrix, involves a decrease in the function of the a2 integrin/PP2A phosphatase axis. Our studies support a model where the S100A4/HDAC4 nuclear complex promotes IPF MPC proliferation and maintenance of IPF MPCs in the IPF lung. However, as fibrosis progresses IPF MPCs contact matrices of increasing degrees of stiffness. This triggers loss of the S100A4/HDAC4 nuclear complex and IPF MPC differentiation. We suggest that expansion of the IPF MPC population and subsequent differentiation fuels IPF fibrotic progression. To test our hypotheses we will: Aim 1: Determine the role of the S100A4/HDAC4 nuclear complex in regulating IPF MPC proliferation and suppression of differentiation. Aim 2: Analyze the role of matrix stiffness in regulating IPF MPC differentiation. Aim 3. Analyze the role of S100A4/HDAC4 in the ability of IPF MPCs to drive fibrotic progression in vivo employing the adoptive transfer model using immune-deficient mice."
"9418163","Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F Buffalo Clinical and Translational Research Center The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes 12 major academic, research and healthcare institutions and 5 influential community partners in our region, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The distribution of underrepresented minorities who experience health disparities in Buffalo in 2015 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 35 years. The vision for our CTSA hub is to develop, test and share novel approaches to improve health and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a ?population of the future?. Improving health in our community and the nation will require innovative research across the full T1 through T4 translational spectrum. In 2012, the University at Buffalo opened the new 170,000 ft2 state-of-the-art Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) devoted entirely to clinical and translational research. The CTRC provides a centralized facility, including translational research laboratories, a clinical research center, an imaging center, a lab animal facility and a biorepository. The CTRC and other enormous BTC investments to build a 21st century Academic Health Center creates a setting for a CTSA to provide the key piece to transform our capacity to bring discoveries in the laboratory, the clinic and the community to benefit individual and public health by sharing expertise and innovative approaches to translational science as part of the national consortium. We will bring strengths to the CTSA consortium, including developing novel health informatics tools, leveraging our strength as a leading center on research in standards and ontologies; new approaches to community-based research developed with our community; testing and disseminating ontology-based methods to share translational image data; and one of the few full service Drug Development Services in the consortium.  With a CTSA we will 1) accelerate the development, implementation and dissemination of new healthcare interventions and their translation into the community through innovative research across the T1 through T4 spectrum, 2) train and develop an excellent and diverse workforce to ensure that translational researchers and their teams have the skills and knowledge to advance translation of discoveries, 3) build a translational science pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources and combines data analysis methods to discover diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive interventions, and 4) streamline clinical research processes with a focus on quality to enhance recruitment of special populations across the lifespan and groups with health disparities, and accelerate multi-site clinical trial initiation. Building on our unique strengths will enhance both our local and national CTSA network capacity through collaboration and sharing expertise and resources.

"9270064","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a detailed plan for the development of an academic research career in cardiovascular disease modeling with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The principal investigator (PI) is an Instructor in the Department of Pathology at Stanford University with 85%-15% split between research and clinical attending duties in Molecular Genetic Pathology. The support provided by a K08 award will facilitate the additional training in genomics and stem cell disease modeling that is needed for the PI to fully prepare for a career as an extramurally funded independent investigator. The PI is mentored by Joseph Wu (Director, Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford) and Advisory Committee members Carlos Bustamante (Professor, Genetics, Stanford), Thomas Quertermous (Chief, Cardiovascular Medicine, Stanford) and Elizabeth McNally (Director, Center for Genetic Medicine, Northwestern University). Stanford University, and the Wu laboratory in particular, offer an environment uniquely suited to developing the PI into an independent investigator whose expertise merges the stem cell, cardiovascular, and genomics fields.  iPSCs enable direct observation of genetic disease at the single cell level, presenting an opportunity to rapidl phenotype the genome. iPSCs that carry the genetic information of patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are thus the ideal tools for efficiently characterizing the individual HCM phenotype in vitro. Toward this end, this proposal will determine the genetic, morphological, transcriptional, and functional properties of cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs (iPSC-CMs) from two families exhibiting heritable HCM. Preliminary data suggest that significant disease can be observed in the morphologic and electrophysiological properties of HCM iPSC-CMs. Targeted DNA sequencing using a novel next generation sequencing platform will elicit the unique variants that may be influencing development of disease in the two families. Furthermore, RNA sequencing of HCM iPSCs during cardiac differentiation from the embryonic stage will identify biological pathways that are unique to early HCM, as well as those pathways that are shared with later stages of HCM and other classes of cardiomyopathies (e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy). Finally, using innovations in genome editing that allow for rational, targeted alterations of genomic DNA in live cells, this proposal will directly address the challenge in discerning true HCM-causing genetic mutations from benign variation. In particular, CRISPR/Cas9 will be used to modify selected variants in iPSCs and determine their individual pathogenicity through a series of functional assays of the resulting iPSC-CMs. In the coming decades, data gained from projects such as this will constitute one of the most promising primary building blocks of cardiovascular precision medicine."
"9277747","OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY Barrett?s esophagus is an increasingly prevalent, preneoplastic disorder resulting from acid/bile reflux and chronic inflammation at the GE junction. This application is a renewal of a long-standing multicenter, translational research program from Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. The team, which has been highly productive, will now focus on the role of microbiota and the tumor microenvironment in the development and progression of Barrett?s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma. The group has added additional collaborative sites at MIT, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Munich Technical University, and will utilize heavily a new Microbiome and Metabolomics Core at Penn- CHOP. Thus, the team comprises broad and unique expertise in mouse models, genomics, microbiology and clinical research. The application is built around the hypothesis that the inflammation-dependent tumor microenvironment, modulated by the GE junction microbiome, is critical for early progression of esophageal carcinogenesis. The proposal will utilize both the novel transgenic (L2-IL-1?) and innovative 3D organoid models, along with a cross-sectional study of 100 BE patients. Project 1 will study the role of microbiota and myeloid cells in the L2-IL-1? mouse model of Barrett?s esophagus. This project will incorporate germ-free housing, antibiotic eradication, colonization with defined flora, myeloid cell ablation and correlative human studies. Project 2 is focused on the characterization of microenvironment drivers in BE, and will include FACS/IHC analysis of CAFs and immune cells (MDSCs/Tregs) in BE patients, along with 3D organoids in culture. The role of IL-6 in response to epithelial TP53 mutations and immune cell activation will be defined. Finally, Project 3 will seek to identify novel biomarkers and gene signatures related to the microbiome and microenvironment. The study will analyze bile acids, a product of microbes, and minimally invasive tests such as saliva/breath test/tethered capsule sponge to analyze microbes to develop screening/surveillance strategies. Overall, these projects will advance the science of the microbiome and microenvironment in BE that will hopefully lead to translational applications."
"9479897","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cocaine-induced stroke and hemorrhage in the brain are among the most serious medical complications. The mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood but are likely to reflect in part its vasoactive effects that may be exacerbated with repeated drug exposures. Our poor understanding of the cerebrovascular effects of cocaine are due in part to technological limitations in our ability to concurrently assess and thus distinguish cocaine's neuronal effects from its vascular effects. Here we aim to apply our newly developed optical/ fluorescence imaging techniques (OFIs), to study separately the neuronal and cerebrovascular effects of acute and chronic cocaine exposures. OFIs integrate (1) dual-wavelength laser speckle imaging to enable concurrent detection of cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood volume (CBV), and tissue hemoglobin oxygenation (StO2) at high spatiotemporal resolutions across a large field of view, (2) digital-frequency-ramping Doppler optical coherence tomography for in vivo 3D quantitative imaging of the neurovascular network, (3) Rhod2 fluorescence imaging to measure intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), and (4) a micro-catheter probe (mOFI) to assess cocaine's effects on subcortical brain regions in real time and at high spatiotemporal resolution.  Our pilot study has shown that acute cocaine decreases CBF while increasing deoxyhemoglobin content and increasing intracellular Ca content and that there is sensitization to these effects with repeated exposures. Since increases in intracellular [Ca2+]i are associated with neuronal death following ischemia, we hypothesize that these sensitized responses with chronic cocaine exposures increase the vulnerability of neuronal tissue to damage from hypoxia. To test these hypotheses, we will use OFIs to concurrently measure the effects of acute and chronic cocaine on cerebrovascular responses (CBF, CBV), tissue oxygenation (StO2) and neuronal [Ca2+]i changes in cortical and subcortical brain regions. We will use an animal model of compulsive cocaine self- administration (short and long access) that mimics key aspects of human addiction. In addition, we will examine the efficacy of calcium channel blockers in preventing cocaine-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ content, as a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce cocaine's cerebrovascular toxicity. We propose the following Specific Aims: Assess the neuronal and vascular effects of acute and chronic cocaine on cortical (using OFI, Aim 1) and subcortical regions (using mOFI, Aim 2); Characterize the 'ischemia-like' neurovascular dysfunction resulting from chronic cocaine exposure (Aim 3), and examine the efficacy of calcium channel blockers to ameliorate cocaine-induced intracellular [Ca2+]i and hemodynamic changes in brain (Aim 4).  The proposed studies will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie cocaine's cerebrovascular toxicity, which could help develop therapeutic interventions to counteract this toxicity. In addition, the proposed studies will introduce an imaging capability that could be applied to studies of the effects of other drugs of abuse and to studies of other brain disorders for which there are pertinent animal models."
"9292230","Project Summary: Core F The overall goals of the Imaging Core are to obtain the highest caliber structural and functional imaging data on ADRC participants; to make these data available to a wide spectrum of investigators at Stanford; and to make the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data more accessible to investigators from non- imaging backgrounds. The Imaging Core, capitalizing on Stanford's strength in imaging brain networks, will focus on measures of functional and structural connectivity. Dr. Glover and Dr. Bammer, Core Co- Investigators, have made critical contributions to the acquisition and analysis of resting-state fMRI and diffusion-weighted imaging, respectively. Dr. Greicius, the Core Director, has made important advances in the application of functional connectivity measures to the study of Alzheimer's disease. A second major focus of the Imaging Core will be to make the acquired data available to and readily used by researchers across disciplines and schools at Stanford. To this end, the Imaging Core will take advantage of the neurobiological imaging management system (NIMS) built by Dr. Dougherty, the third Core Co-Investigator. NIMS has been in place for more than two years and provides a user-friendly interface for investigators to download brain imaging, and related, data. The Imaging Core will use the NIMS infrastructure to provide researchers with subject imaging data in three stages of processing: raw, processed, and abstracted summary measures. The imaging data will be linked to subjects' ancillary data (including neuropsychological measures, spinal fluid proteins, plasma proteomics, etc.) This will allow the widest possible set of Stanford investigators, with or without imaging expertise, to test hypotheses using the ADRC data. In parallel with the imaging data acquired through the ADRC, the Imaging Core will provide investigators across the Stanford campus with a curated,  turnkey version of the ADNI dataset. Dr. Greicius' imaging group has extensive experience with the ADNI dataset and has developed a pipeline for quality control and data processing. The ADNI imaging data and associated ancillary data such as spinal fluid proteins, genotypes, etc. will also be available on NIMS. As with the ADRC data, this should greatly amplify the number of researchers who can benefit from the incredibly rich, multimodal ADNI data."
"9267505","Atherosclerosis is now recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease, and Project Leaders of our PPG have contributed seminal information to the widespread recognition that immune mechanisms play a central role in modulating atherogenesis. Leveraging information gained in the first cycle, we propose studies of the roles of macrophages, T cells, B cells, Natural antibodies (NAbs) and innate TLRs on inflammation and atherogenesis. Project 1 will pursue their seminal observations that foam cell formation in the peritoneum of cholesterol-fed mice exhibited an unexpected suppressed inflammatory gene phenotype, which was due to accumulation of desmosterol, a potent LXR ligand, leading to inhibition of inflammatory gene expression. They will study the transcriptional mechanisms by which this occurs, and determine if novel therapeutic approaches can be exploited based on use of desmosterol-like agents that inhibit inflammatory activity. Project 2 will pursue their findings that PPARy is expressed in Treg  cells in peri-aortic adipose tissue, which surrounds the aorta at key anatomical sites where atherogenesis is enhanced. They will explore the hypothesis that this is mediated by a proinflammatory gene network that can be modulated at the transcriptional level by PPARy and REVERBa/p, regulating vital functions of Treg and Th17 cells. Project 3 will pursue their recent identification that oxidation specific epitopes (OSE), as occur on OxLDL or apoptotic cells, are major targets of innate NAbs. They will focus on defining the prevalence of OSE-NAbs in humans and mice, the mechanisms by which they are atheroprotective, and define transcriptional mechanisms by which GR and LXR regulate B-1 cells, which generate NAbs. Overall, these studies should provide vital insights into novel and as yet unexplored mechanisms by which adaptive and innate immunity regulates inflammation and atherosclerosis, and may lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for cardiovascular disease."

"9294085","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmission application seeks to renew support for a training program that prepares highly qualified pediatricians to assume leadership positions as investigators in Pediatric Infectious Diseases. Based in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Boston Children's Hospital, the program takes advantage of the rich academic and research resources of Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, and affiliated teaching hospitals to bring together outstanding didactic experiences and research opportunities relevant to infectious diseases of children. Support for four positions per year is requested. Pediatricians enter the program for a minimum of three years of integrated clinical and research training that includes at least two years of supervised research under the mentorship of a member of the teaching faculty. Research training of pediatricians is fully integrated with that of PhD postdoctoral trainees in the laboratories of the teaching faculty. The 31 members of the teaching faculty are accomplished investigators and experienced mentors chosen from the Division of Infectious Diseases at Boston Children's Hospital and affiliated units at other Harvard institutions. Under the guidance of the research mentor and the Program Steering Committee, an individualized curriculum is designed for each trainee in one of three broad areas of investigation: microbial pathogenesis, host response and vaccines, or epidemiology and health outcomes. Trainees in the epidemiology and health outcomes pathway have the opportunity to earn a Master of Public Health degree from the Harvard School of Public Health as an integral part of the training program. Trainees in the other pathways also receive training in epidemiology, biostatistics, clinical trial design, and analytic methods. All trainees have seminars and tutorials in grant preparation and scientific writing that supplement the mentored research experience. An individual Scholarship Oversight Committee is appointed for each trainee to monitor progress and to provide career guidance. During the second or third year, trainees are expected to present their work at national meetings, to prepare one or more manuscripts for publication, and, in most cases, to apply for a K08, K23, or other career development award to support the transition to independence as an investigator. During the initial five years of this training grant, 11 pediatrician trainees and 4 PhD postdoctoral fellows have been supported by the grant. Of the 13 fellowship program graduates during this period, 12 have academic faculty or government research appointments. Six have received competitive individual fellowship and/or grant awards including 5 K08 or K23 awards, 2 R21, 1 R03, and a New Innovator award from NIH."
"9417264","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nephrotic syndrome is a major cause of kidney failure, and patients with this condition develop large amounts of proteinuria and elevated levels of plasma lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol). The immediate goal of the PI / applicant is to study in detail the mechanisms behind the development of hypertriglyceridemia in nephrotic syndrome. The PI's long term goal is to develop specific mechanism-based therapy for hyperlipidemia in nephrotic syndrome. The career development plan has been developed by the applicant, the primary mentor, and the two co-mentors to provide new and enhanced training in lipid biology, proteomic techniques, cell signaling, communication and presentation skills, grant and manuscript writing, and responsible conduct of research. There is a progressive increase in independence and greater involvement of the co-mentors in the later years of the grant. Timelines for each Specific Aim, allocation of independent laboratory space, periodic meetings of the applicant with the mentoring committee, expectations from the applicant and the specific role of each mentor are addressed in detail in the career development plan. In addition, the applicant is expected to write smaller foundation grants in the earlier years, and a R01 application in the last two years of the K Award. Research work currently being conducted by the PI has revealed an important role of Angiopoietin-like-4 (Angptl4) in the development of nephrotic syndrome in primary glomerular diseases like minimal change disease. Angptl4 is a secreted glycoprotein that is a known inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase and increased plasma levels of this protein result in the development of hypertriglyceridemia (a component of hyperlipidemia). Studies conducted by the PI reveal that increased secretion of this protein from the podocyte results in the development of proteinuria (Clement LC Nature Medicine 2011). In this proposal, the applicant will study the regulation of Angptl4 gene expression in the podocyte by glucocorticoids, and investigate the development of hypertriglyceridemia resulting from podocyte secretion of Angptl4 into the circulation in nephrotic syndrome. Hypothesis: The upregulation of podocyte Angptl4 expression in minimal change disease is reduced by treatment with glucocorticoids, and is mediated via binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to a negative glucocorticoid response element in the Angptl4 promoter. In primary glomerular disease, the sialylation of podocyte secreted Angptl4 influences its ability to leak into the circulation, inhibt lipoprotein lipase activity, and produce hypertriglyceridemia. Circulating Angptl4 is transported on the surface of HDL and inhibits endothelium bound lipoprotein lipase directly, and via its interaction with apolipoproteins C-II and C-III. In Specific Aim 1, the regulation of the Angptl4 promoter activity by glucocorticoids will be studied. In Specific Aim 2, the influence of sialylatin and other forms of posttranslational modification in the leakage of podocyte secreted Angptl4 into the circulation and the resulting development of hypertriglyceridemia will be investigated. In Specific Aim 3, putative interactions of Angptl4 with apolipoproteins C-II (activator of lipoprotei lipase) and C-III, (inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase) on the surface of HDL will be studied."
"9480137","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Methamphetamine (MA) dependence is a significant health problem in South Africa and the U.S. In South Africa, a shift in policy focus is required away from allocating health resources primarily to HIV/AIDS and TB and toward the financial, social and personal consequences of untreated stimulant addiction. In response to PAR 14-331, this application proposes to build capacity for a new linkage of productive teams of clinical researchers at UCLA and the University of Cape Town to conduct studies on the neurobiological foundation of treatment for stimulant dependence. The research direction is innovative in linking findings from neuroscience with clinical outcomes using contingency management (CM) to identify changes in brain structure and function that emerge during purely behavioral therapy. The knowledge gained may guide development of optimally effective behavioral and/or medication therapies. The application design will correlate MA-abstinence outcomes from an 8-week program of voucher-based incentives using an escalating schedule for 30 treatment-seeking, MA-dependent individuals with scores on tasks of working memory and assessments of neuropsychological and demographic status. At the beginning and end of the CM program, participants will participate in MRI scans while performing a working memory task, and will complete a battery of select neurocognitive and psychological assays to address two specific aims: (1) to determine whether changes in neural function within front striatal circuitry from baseline to end of the 8- week CM program are associated with parallel changes in measures of cognitive control and impulsivity and with MA abstinence outcomes; (2) to determine whether structural changes in front striatal circuitry over the 8-week CM intervention correspond with neurocognitive, psychological and MA abstinence measures. Findings from this study will describe associations between: (1) functional and structural indices of brain areas that support working memory, cognitive control/inhibition; (2) performance on select neurocognitive and psychological assessments; and (3) associations between these with MA abstinence outcomes. Study activities and the neuroscience data generated will provide preliminary data for a larger, adequately powered study that will test ways to optimize behavioral therapies for treating stimulant use disorder."
"9480122","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the importance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis to the recovery process following extended access methamphetamine intake. Research into understanding the neurobiological basis of addiction and relapse has significantly progressed, but to date few treatments are known to reverse the drug-induced neuroplasticity changes that convey vulnerability to relapse. Understanding the neuroplastic changes that underlie the relapse stage of addiction can help generate better treatment options for addiction. One potential mechanism to accelerate brain repair during withdrawal is stimulating the generation of neurons from adult neural stem cells - a process known as adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Neural stem cells persist in the adult hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is involved in some aspects of methamphetamine addiction, as reinforcing doses of methamphetamine reduce proliferation, differentiation and neurogenesis of neural stem cells in the SGZ. However, the effects of withdrawal from methamphetamine on these stages of hippocampal neurogenesis are unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear if the process of adult neurogenesis can be stimulated during withdrawal; the types of neurons that can be replaced during withdrawal and their ability to integrate into preexisting circuitry. In the proposed studies, innovative genetic, electrophysiological and immunohistochemical techniques and behavioral models will be used to specifically label, stimulate or inhibit adult-generated neurons in the setting of extended access methamphetamine intake. Using these approaches, we will test our central hypothesis that hippocampal neurogenesis contributes to repair after withdrawal from extended access methamphetamine via neuronal replacement; thus, inhibiting this process will impair recovery and stimulating this process will augment recovery and reduce or prevent relapse. Studies in Aim 1 will characterize the long-term survival and integration of adult-generated neurons after methamphetamine self-administration. Experiments in Aim 2 will determine if adult neurogenesis is critical to the prevention of relapse. In Aim 3, we will determine whether adult neurogenesis during withdrawal contributes to functional recovery and prevents relapse."
"9275659","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Discoveries in reproductive biology have had a remarkable impact in science and medicine, leading to several Nobel prizes in Physiology or Medicine in the past decade. Despite these advances in science that were produced by experts in the reproductive biology, the number of reproductive science trainees is dwindling at an alarming rate. To help reverse this trend, we have established this T32 Training Program in Reproductive Development from Gonads to Fetuses (RDGF). The purpose of this program is to tap the large, diverse and highly qualified pipeline of graduate students (PhD or MD/PhD) and postdoctoral fellows (MD or PhD) that matriculate at the University of Pittsburgh each year and recruit them to pursue training and careers in the reproductive sciences. This training program will enhance the recruitment of reproductive biology researchers into the unique environment at Magee-Womens Research Institute where graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, medical residents, medical fellows and junior faculty (119 total trainees) work side by side in state of the art research facilities and experience on a daily basis how fundamental research discoveries impact reproductive medicine and patient care. The overarching objectives of the Program are to select and recruit the most qualified candidates (3 PhD students and 3 postdocs/year) into the reproductive sciences and pair them with well-funded, productive mentors who are committed to the training mission of the program and the University of Pittsburgh/Magee. The program will provide trainees with the education, resources and technical experience to conduct impactful science, while adhering to the principles of responsible conduct of research and scientific integrity. Rigorous oversight and progress review of Trainee/Mentor teams will ensure that trainees are fully immersed in all aspects of academic career development, including career development coursework, publications, grant submissions and attendance/presentation at local and national/international meetings. Research productivity milestones (e.g., publications, grants and awards) combined with connections made in the reproductive biology community at meetings will set the stage for advancement to the next stage of career development. Full immersion of trainees in all aspects of their academic endeavors will endow them with a sense of ownership of their research productivity and increase the likelihood that they will be retained long-term in reproductive science-related careers. Graduate students (PhD or MD/PhD) can remain in the training program for a maximum of five years and postdoctoral fellows can remain in the program for a maximum of three years. However, our program requires that all trainees write and submit and individual training grant application during their second year of training. This is a valuable skill for a career in science and the turnover as trainees transition from institutional to individual awards will help maximize the number of trainees and impact of the program. We anticipate training a total of 6 graduate students and 6 postdoctoral trainees during the five year award period."
"9320405","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of the proposed research is to yield a more precise, developmental understanding of drug-related HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk among African American female adolescents in the Southern United States. The proposed study will use an integrative data analysis (IDA) approach to pool and harmonize existing data from 4 completed HIV/STI prevention trials conducted among African American female adolescents. IDA is a framework for conducting simultaneous analysis of data pooled from multiple studies. The study team will use an accelerated longitudinal design, a method for linking multiple cohorts by age, to assess developmental relationships between drug use and HIV/STI risk across adolescence. Specifically, the proposed research will 1) create a pooled data set with harmonized variables and corresponding codebook combining data from 4 HIV/STI prevention intervention trials conducted among African American female adolescents aged 14-24 years (N=2,243). The study will then use the pooled, harmonized dataset to: 2) examine the influence of drug use behaviors on the natural course of sexual risk behavior (e.g., multiple sexual partners, vaginal sex without a condom) across adolescent development; 3) examine the influence of drug use behaviors on the natural course of STI acquisition across adolescent development and 4) evaluate the extent to which HIV/STI prevention interventions reduce drug use behaviors across adolescent development. Findings from this research will be useful for advancing interventions to reduce drug-related HIV/STI risk among African American adolescent females in the South."
"9272008","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This four-year K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide me with advanced training and mentorship to become an independent investigator in implementation research, integrating methods from epidemiology, social science, and economics to increase engagement of young female sex workers (FSW) in HIV prevention services. My long-term goal is to become a leading investigator in implementation research that addresses health disparities in HIV prevention and care among hard-to-reach populations, with a focus on young key populations. The proposed work includes training and research that capitalize on the rich interdisciplinary research environment of RTI International. Training represents the foundation of this proposal and includes senior mentors and advisors with complementary expertise, didactic education, skills development, and mentored research so that at the completion of the award I will be well positioned for an independent research career. The training plan was developed in parallel with the mentored research plan to ensure that newly acquired knowledge and skills are immediately applied to the relevant aspects of the research project. The following objectives will be accomplished during this award: (1) obtain training and practical skills in implementation research methods, including methods to improve and evaluate implementation and delivery of combination health interventions in order to increase demand, uptake, retention and compliance to services by young key populations; (2) obtain training and practical skills in costing and cost-effectiveness analysis of combination health interventions; (3) become an independent investigator in implementation research by contributing to the field through scientific publications, being mentored by subject matter experts, and generating pilot data for a future R-series award. The goal of the proposed research component is to comprehensively evaluate a multicomponent HIV prevention project in Zimbabwe targeting young FSW <25 years of age, to determine methods of delivery that result in the highest uptake, retention, and compliance. Young FSW are a vulnerable population at greater risk for HIV acquisition than their older counterparts, yet thei engagement in HIV services remains low. Funding has been secured to implement an evidence-based, HIV prevention pilot project for young FSW, integrated within Zimbabwe's National Sex Worker Programme (NSWP) clinics. This research will comprehensively evaluate the pilot project at 8 NSWP clinics, benefitting from the infrastructure, resources, and wealth of programmatic data available from all 36 NSWP sites nationally. Specific aims are to: (1) determine barriers and facilitators to implementation and uptake of the HIV prevention pilot project; (2) implement and evaluate the pilot project using a randomized stepped wedge design; and (3) estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of the different HIV prevention components. This study will provide quantitative and qualitative evidence to determine if a future trial to scae up and evaluate the intervention's effectiveness/cost-effectiveness is warranted."
"9479905","DESCRIPTION: In the last decade, HIV incidence rates among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in U.S. urban centers have steadily increased. To shed light on these trends, since 2009, we have been conducting a cohort study of n = 600 racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse YMSM, informed by a theory of syndemics, to: (1) develop and test theoretically informed measurement models of the covariance of illicit drug use, unprotected sexual behavior, and mental health burden among emergent adult HIV-negative YMSM within and across time; (2) assess whether patterns of behavior are continuous, discontinuous, or some combination of both; (3) delineate the risk and protective base (physical, relational, and psychosocial factors) that predict the development of syndemics: and (4) determine the extent to which the development of syndemics is moderated by race/ethnicity, social class, and homelessness/housing stability. At baseline, participants were 18-19 years old and are returning for semi-annual follow-up visits; to date we have high levels of participant retention (e83%) across study visits. Presently, we seek to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the health of this new generation of YMSM. This will be accomplished by (a) continuing to investigate the original study aims as participants mature to ages 25-26; and (b) including two new, complementary study aims to: (1) describe the social and sexual networks of YMSM, and examine the relationship between social and sexual network-level structural characteristics, social support and normative influences on syndemic production in YMSM, singly and in combination with physical, psychosocial, and relational predictors, both within and across time; and (2) describe the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically, gonorrhea chlamydia, and syphilis, among YMSM within and across time, and to determine whether physical, relational, and psychosocial factors explain STI acquisition within and across time. We will continue to test syndemic production over time as well as to examine how this comprehensive range of physical, psychosocial, and relational predictors are related to syndemic production using additive and multiplicative (synergistic) models. Next, for YMSM in this study who have seroconverted as well as those who may seroconvert, we include an exploratory aim to describe HIV clinical treatment markers (i.e., HIV viral load, ART uptake and adherence, HIV care) and to assess the extent to which physical, relational, and psychosocial factors are associated with these clinical markers, both within and across time. We seek to extend our cohort study through the addition of semi- annual data collection for 7 additional waves of data collection. We will recruit an additional n = 329 to add to our extent study sample. New recruits will be 21-22 years old at enrollment, and with our original n=471 active and available YMSM participants, will yield a sample of n = 800 at the first assessment of our competing continuation study. As with our current study we will utilize complex modeling (Structural Equation and Latent Growth Curve Analysis and Survival Analysis) to answer our study questions."
"9231364","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal muscle disease caused by the loss of dystrophin. Dystrophin is a cytoskeleton protein that anchors neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to the sarcolemma. Without dystrophin, nNOS is lost from the muscle cell membrane. Sarcolemmal localization of nNOS is crucial for muscle health because it allows short-lived vasodilator nitric oxide (generated by nNOS) to reach the surrounding vasculature to counteract sympathetic vasoconstriction during exercise. In dystrophin-deficient mdx mice and human patients, the loss of sarcolemmal nNOS abolishes protective sympatholysis during contraction and aggravates muscle disease. We recently identified dystrophin spectrin-like repeats 16 and 17 (R16/17) as the nNOS-binding domain in mice. R16/17 is encoded by exons 42 to 45. In-frame deletion of these exons abolishes sarcolemmal nNOS expression in patients, suggesting R16/17 is also the nNOS-binding domain in human. To study the therapeutic effect of sarcolemmal nNOS, we expressed synthetic dystrophins with or without R16/17 in mdx mice and found that R16/17-containing dystrophins (but not the ones without R16/17) improved blood flow and enhanced exercise performance. The immediate next question is whether the mouse results can be translated to large mammals. Several groups have tried to tease out the relevance of nNOS to disease severity in human patients by genotype-phenotype analysis. Unfortunately, deletion mutations that destroy nNOS binding often disrupt the normal phasing of dystrophin spectrin-like repeats. Since both factors (nNOS localization and spectrin-like repeat phasing) contribute to disease severity, it has become extremely challenging (if not impossible) to separate the two effects. Indeed, the published results are controversial. We reasoned that a well-designed hemodynamic study in the canine DMD model using normally phased dystrophins (with or without the nNOS-binding domain) can yield critical insight on the therapeutic significance of sarcolemmal nNOS in large mammals. Hence, we introduced R16/17-containing dystrophin to DMD dog muscle. Unexpectedly, it did not anchor nNOS to the membrane, suggesting canine dystrophin is unique. Such species-specific difference in dystrophin has never been observed before. We hypothesize that the nNOS-binding domain is located in a different region in dog dystrophin and we further hypothesize that an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector can be generated to deliver an nNOS-binding domain-containing canine dystrophin gene to dog muscle. Our specific aims are (1) to localize the canine dystrophin nNOS-binding domain using a combinatory approach of plasmid/AAV gene transfer and the epitope mapping of revertant fibers; (2) to develop a dog dystrophin AAV vector that carries the canine nNOS-binding domain. This vector will be used in future studies to test whether sarcolemmal nNOS can benefit a dystrophic large mammal (affected dogs)."
"9264564","DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The proposed Training Program will train predoctoral students in the mechanisms of learning across development and species. Learning is fundamental to adaptive behavior. It involves acquiring and modifying information, behaviors, and skills. Learning also is productive: it extends itself through induction, deduction, and integration. Mechanisms of learning is a critical area to target for predoctoral research training because learning has pervasive impacts in both adaptive and maladaptive behavior, and must be an integral part of any successful mental health or educational intervention. The Training Faculty is drawn from the Department of Psychology, the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, and the interdisciplinary Neuroscience Graduate Program, all of Emory University. The primary training sites are the Department of Psychology and the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. The 16- member Training Faculty approach study of the mechanisms of learning as they manifest from birth to old age in healthy and clinical populations using genetic, comparative, computational, developmental, neurobiological, and neuropsychological techniques. They examine how changes in the brain during infancy and childhood relate to developmental changes in learning, how the elderly adapt with their aging brains, and how diverse species acquire and modify knowledge ranging from simple associations to culturally-mediated rituals and traditions. The diversity of ages, species, and circumstances in which learning mechanisms are studied at Emory provides rich opportunities for accumulation of converging evidence about these mechanisms, and thus for equipping the next generation of scientists with the skills necessary for understanding basic mechanisms of learning. The training site affords a uniquely well- suited environment in which to accomplish one of the goals of the NIH-to unite the study of developmental change from infancy to senescence with the study of adult cognition within a neurobiological framework. We request four predoctoral trainees per year, each of whom will be trained for 3 years. Trainees will be drawn from among students in Emory's highly-selective Laney Graduate School. Trainees will complete all departmental or program requirements for the Ph.D. This training program will provide added value through at least five training enhancements: 1) explicit co-mentoring and collaborative research experiences across species, ages or methodologies; 2) intensive training in grant writing, 3) advanced training in ethics and the responsible conduct of research; 4) participation in courses, workshops and research fairs specific to research on learning across development and species; and 5) application of empirically supported best practices in graduate student training."
"9455621","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Clinical consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI) have significant musculoskeletal morbidity. One complication, heterotopic ossification (HO), has an increased incidence of up to 20-30% in SCI patients. With HO, function can be impaired through loss of joint mobility and pain. Formation of HO is thought to be analogous to other examples of bone formation in the body, such as in fracture healing. Interestingly, SCI patients also show increased fracture callus after bony injury. Fracture healing occurs through endochondral ossification (EO) and there is evidence that HO does as well. Putting these two clinical scenarios together, it appears that SCI patients have an exaggerated EO response. In looking at growth factors that are associated with SCI and EO, Progranulin represents a potential target. Progranulin is upregulated after SCI and is associated with the BMP-2 pathway. We hypothesize that progranulin is responsible for the increased EO seen after SCI. We aim to test this hypothesis using proganulin knockout mice in a model of SCI, with experimental fracture or HO. Understanding the mechanism by which SCI patients produce excess EO can help to develop therapies to reduce HO in these patients and increase fracture healing in non-SCI patients."
"9284220","TITLE: Racism, Residential Racial Segregation, and Breast Cancer Survival Disparities among Black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic White Women ABSTRACT/SUMMARY Racial disparities in breast cancer survival are significant, with only 68% of US Black women diagnosed with breast cancer remaining alive 10 years post-diagnosis, compared to 84% of White women. However, the size of the racial disparity in breast cancer mortality varies geographically across the US, from no observable state- level disparity between Black and White women in Minnesota and Massachusetts, to a mortality rate ratio of over 1.60 in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Wisconsin. Further, although the national survival gap between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites is small, national numbers mask substantial variation among subpopulations of Hispanics and poorer outcomes among Hispanics in some localities. Such geographical variation suggests that disparities are not inevitable, and this variation has not been explained. Racism and racial residential segregation are widely considered to contribute to health disparities, and may partially explain geographical variation in the size of the disparity. While some studies have shown that segregation is related to poor survival, others have found that this is not always the case, and some studies highlight the case of ethnic enclaves, which may be protective. Additionally, we have recently shown that a measure of racial bias in housing is associated with breast cancer survival among Black women in the Milwaukee area. We propose to build upon our previous work to undertake a national study of segregation and breast cancer survival with three aims: (1) Construct new and existing metrics of racism and segregation at the local level for the largest US metropolitan areas, and determine (a) how measures co-vary, (b) whether segregation measures predict stressors, social resources and opportunities at the local level, and (c) whether relationships differ by metropolitan area, (2) Determine whether measures of segregation are related to breast cancer survival disparities among Black, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White women, and whether relationships are mediated by local stressors, social resources, or opportunities, and (3) Explore the ways in which Black and Hispanic breast cancer survivors in a highly segregated metropolitan area navigate cancer survivorship in the context of segregation. The interdisciplinary research team is well-positioned to conduct this work, with expertise in breast cancer, health disparities, geography, biostatistics, epidemiology, large database analysis, mediation analysis, qualitative research, and community engaged research. Further, we have established partnerships with numerous local community organizations working directly with breast cancer survivors in the Milwaukee area through a regional community advisory board, and have drawn upon these relationships to convene an advisory board specific to this project, engaged to guide and support data collection and interpret and disseminate research findings. The successful completion of the proposed work will support the development of future multi-sectoral interventions to reduce disparities by targeting local systems and policies."
"9269943","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competitive renewal application requests continuation of a predoctoral training program at the University of Florida (UF), which was first funded in 2003. The purpose of this program, consistent with the chief goal of gerontology/geriatrics, is to train predoctoral researchers in strategies related to: (a) identifyig potential antecedents of functional independence in older adults, and (b) designing and evaluating interventions that may prevent disability. Secondarily, for those elders who have already experienced substantial loss of function, this predoctoral training program focuses on identifying policies and practices that may reduce negative consequences and iatrogenic effects of treatment. Acute events like stroke, hip fracture, and chronic conditions including circulatory and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and cognitive impairment all constitute widely studied precursors of disability and also represent potentially modifiable factors to reduce progression down the disability pathway. Informed by major theories of functional independence, we aim to prepare pre- doctoral trainees for postdoctoral fellowships and subsequent research placements in settings including traditional disciplinary departments, clinical research environments, and multidisciplinary gerontology programs. With the co-location and collaboration between UF's health science and liberal arts campuses, UF is uniquely positioned to offer training in the biopsychosocial components of independence, as well as health care, technology, and policy aspects of care for aged persons with disability. Disciplines represented in this proposal include applied physiology and kinesiology, geriatric medicine, health services research, linguistics, neurology, neuropsychology, neuroscience, nursing, occupational therapy, psychology, sociology, and speech pathology. Core program components include (1) assignment of each student to a frequently convened multi- disciplinary mentoring team (2) formation and close tracking of productivity goals in the areas of research, education, and service ; (3) a weekly campus-wide colloquium series featuring top national speakers, local researchers in aging, and professional development; (4) required supplemental coursework and other didactics in Aging and Statistics/Methodology, as well as Responsible Conduct of Research. Our mentoring team approach allows us to actively engage energetic newer faculty (mentors in training) in primary mentoring roles, while supplementing and complementing them with seasoned, productive senior investigators. Funds are requested for six (6) predoctoral trainees. Students who have successfully completed the first year of doctoral study are eligible, although preference is given to students who have completed doctoral qualifying examinations, thereby selectively investing resources in committed, productive students who have already completed major program milestones. Of our 23 funded trainees since program start, 6 are now in faculty positions, 10 are in postdoctoral/research associate positions, 5 are still in training, and 1 has left academia. Six (27%) of the trainees are members of under-represented groups."
"9288280","Abstract:  Veterans from the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War (GW) are af?icted with Gulf War Illness (GWI) which is characterized by a constellation of unexplainable symptoms that include chronic pain, memory impairment and fatigue. Consequently, veterans with GWI have limited function and activities of daily, resulting in loss of productive years. Research studies provide compelling evidence that GWI may have been caused by exposure to chemicals, such as an anti-nerve agent pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and different types of pesticides (GW agents). In particular, the types of pesticides to which GW veterans were exposed are also those implicated in chronic neurodegenerative conditions associated with aging, such as Alzheimer' disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). A concern also raised by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in their recent reports. Imaging studies show that the brain structures involved in processing and storing memory and brain pathways involved in controlling pain and fatigue are altered in GW veterans with GWI. Many of these brain structures (i.e. the hippocampus) are also affected in neurodegenerative illness. Over the last two decades, important clinical discoveries have been made which show that immune/in?ammatory and metabolic disturbances are contributors to the pathology of GWI.  The Roskamp Institute (RI) scientists have been at the forefront of research aimed at identifying therapies for treating the central nervous system (CNS) symptoms associated with GWI. Previously, RI scientists developed a novel mouse model of GWI using GW agents (pyridostigmine bromide [PB] and pesticides) which exhibits neurobehavioral de?cits that are similar to symptoms reported in veterans with GWI. At chronic post- exposure time-points, GW agent exposed mice had astroglia and microglia activation in the brain, suggesting a presence of neuroin?ammation. Biochemical investigations show that GW agent exposed mice had abnormal phospholipid (PL) pro?les for species that contained ether linkages and omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). In this well-characterized GWI mouse model, there were also dramatic decreases in cardiolipins (CL) and acylcarnitines, lipids that are speci?c to mitochondrial function. We also observed changes in omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, mitochondrial CL and acylcarnitines and very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) and branched chain fatty acid (BCFA) that are speci?c to peroxisomal function in the blood samples from veterans with GWI compared to GW era controls. Since these lipids are speci?c to immune/ in?ammation and mitochondrial and peroxisomal functions, our ?ndings suggest their involvement in GWI pathogenesis. Many of these lipids are those which contribute to oxidative stress and in?ammation associated with neurodegenerative illnesses.  We therefore hypothesized that targeting omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA and mitochondrial and peroxisomal lipid metabolism may be useful in developing therapies which target in?ammation and metabolic disturbances associated with GWI. Targeting these lipids may also prevent GW veterans from developing neurodegeneration later in life. In this proposal, we will test novel natural compounds which target the above mentioned lipids in order to determine if these compounds can ameliorate cognitive dysfunction and astroglia and microglia activation in the brains of GW agent exposed mice. These studies will facilitate development of innovative intervention strategies which can be rapidly translated into clinical use for maximizing their bene?t in treating ill GW veterans who have been suffering from this condition for 25 years."

"9330263","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Moderate or low-risk alcohol consumption (defined by the NIAAA as ?4 drinks on any single day AND ?14 drinks per week for men or ?3 drinks on any single day AND ?7 drinks per week for non-pregnant women) has been associated with a wide variety of health outcomes in both positive and negative directions. These associations have sparked incredible controversy, largely because definitive evidence about its health effects has been lacking. As a result, guidelines about alcohol use diverge dramatically from each other. In response to this ongoing controversy, and in collaboration with NIAAA, we recently initiated a large-scale, global, long-term randomized trial of daily alcohol consumption, entitled the Moderate Alcohol and Cardiovascular Health Trial (MACH15; U10AA025286). The trial will randomize nearly 8,000 adults at advanced cardiovascular risk to either consumption of 15 grams of alcohol daily in their beverage of choice or to complete abstention for six years. The trial will eventually comprise some 16 field centers and four coordinating centers situated worldwide, including a biospecimen repository to foster future research. In this application, we propose a unique symposium model that will maximize the transparency of the trial, regularly expand the reach of the study and its pool of ancillary investigators, and foster collaboration and data access to the larger biomedical community in accord with the Plan for Increasing Access to Scientific Publications and Digital Scientific Data from NIH Funded Scientific Research. Specifically, we propose to hold an annual symposium that will open the regular operational meetings of MACH15 investigators to attendees at large, content-concordant scientific conferences. This approach will 1) allow external investigators to observe trial operations and bring outside expertise to identified challenges; 2) encourage external investigators to propose new measurements [either study-wide or in site-specific ancillary studies] in real time during the trial; 3) share preliminary results related to trial process and operation with the larger scientific community; 4) familiarize trainees and junior investigators with the data elements available in MACH15; 5) recruit junior and senior investigators with limited experience in alcohol-related investigation to participate in the study of the health effects of alcohol; and 6) disseminate the trial?s ongoing conduct and opportunities to diverse sites and scientists worldwide. With this new yet generalizable model, we will convene the core MACH15 investigators, who bring some of the most extensive experience in both alcohol feeding studies and complex clinical trials worldwide, and share their expertise and resources with investigators, clinicians, policymakers, and trainees on a global basis."

"9280285","Brain imaging in schizophrenia patients reveals excessive loss of gray matter, already visible in young adults at the first psychotic episode. Post mortem brains from schizophrenia (SCZ) patients have decreased numbers of synapses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region involved in executive function and working memory. However, it is not known whether synapse loss results from excessive developmental pruning or why schizophrenia often becomes clinically apparent during adolescence. Dendritic spine density on layer 3 pyramidal neurons is dramatically reduced in SCZ patients, suggesting a synapse and circuit- specific mechanism of vulnerability. As the PFC integrates information from multiple brain regions, defects in pruning could significantly impact synaptic connectivity, cognitive function, and behavior. Our goal is to map the development and refinement of PFC synapses (Aim 1) and to interrogate the functional and behavioral consequences of local and global defects in synaptic pruning (Aims 2?3). We have identified C4A and the classical complement cascade as key mediators of synaptic pruning in the mouse postnatal visual system (Sekar et al., 2016)(Project 2); however, it is unknown if it is also necessary in the cortex and circuits relevant to SCZ and if aberrant pruning affects anatomical and functional connectivity and the behaviors dependent on it. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that over-activation of the complement cascade enhances pruning in the PFC, perturbing anatomical and functional connectivity as well as behavior. We will use global complement KO mice (C1q, C4KO) and novel hC4A-overexpressing mice (Project 2) to ask if early postnatal pruning defects impact cortical connectivity and function later in life. We will also use viral strategies to test if circuit-specific and temporally restricted activation and inhibition of the complement cascade is sufficient for circuit-specific phenotypes. In Aim 3, we will seek to understand how second hits (genetic or environmental) on a background of genetic risk (increased copy number of C4A) combine to impact neural circuit development and behavior. We hypothesize that a second genetic hit (e.g., loss of CSMD1) or environmental hit (immune challenge) might worsen synaptic and behavioral phenotypes in mice over-expressing the human C4A risk allele. To link the central and peripheral effects of C4 expression explored in Projects 1 and 2, we will investigate the potential role of the choroid plexus, a major source of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), in the regulation of complement and cytokine levels in the brain in Aim 3. This will lead to a better understanding of the cellular and molecular players linking peripheral immune dysregulation to brain dysfunction and may identify novel biomarkers."
"9216328","ABSTRACT Home visiting intervention and prevention efforts to prevent child maltreatment have gained popularity and national funding support. However, little is known about the ability of existing prevention programs to intervene with birth parents reunified with their infants or toddlers who were once placed in the child welfare foster care system. One important reason for this lack of information is that evidence from existing programs do not represent the higher risk population of reunified birth parents (Lee, Aos, & Miller, 2008). Birth parents of young children who have been placed into foster care are a highly vulnerable population of caregivers. They are more likely to have been foster children themselves and survivors of childhood maltreatment (Marcenko, Newby, Mienko, & Courtney, 2011). They are at a much higher risk for co-morbidities, including mental health disorders, substance abuse, poverty, low education, and homelessness (Marcenko, Lyons, & Courtney, 2011). Their infants and toddlers, similarly, are not only at risk for serious emotional, behavioral, neurological and physiological health problems, they are also at risk for continued relationship disruptions throughout their life course with multiple placements (Fuller, 2005). In this application we will evaluate the effectiveness of a community based, home visiting intervention program with a population of birth parents recently reunified with their child under the age of five after a foster care placement. In order to do this, we will first adapt the program by adding material relevant to reunified birth families and adapt the material for older children. We will evaluate the effectiveness of Promoting First Relationships (PFR; Kelly et al., 2008) to meet the parenting needs of this vulnerable population. Promoting First Relationships was originally designed for children birth to three, and we will expand the curriculum to meet the needs of children aged birth to five. Through a strong, established community partnership between the state, a community mental health agency, and the University of Washington, we will 1) adapt Promoting First Relationships (PFR) for reunified birth families and older children; 2) test the effectiveness of PFR to improve parental quality and parent-child interaction as compared to a Resource and Referral service; 3) test the effectiveness of PFR on reducing social, emotional, and behavioral problems in a population of children at risk for elevated emotional and behavioral disorders; 4) test the effectiveness of PFR in reducing referrals to CPS and re-entry into foster care; and 5) test a proposed PFR theoretical model, linking the PFR intervention to improved parental insightfulness and emotional competence, which then contributes to parental sensitivity and improved child outcomes."
"9262980","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tendinopathy is a progressive degeneration of the link between a skeletal muscle and its bony insertion. The shoulder is the most common site of tendinopathy, with 30% of individuals over 60 years of age experiencing rotator cuff-related injuries. Clinically, these injuries manifest as shoulder pain, weakness and stiffness, and impairments in activities of daily living. Tendinopathy is a progressive condition, so as tendon tear size and duration of injury increase, more severe atrophic changes in the muscle are observed. These changes: muscle retraction, atrophy, fibrosis, and nerve injury are associated with poor treatment outcomes, as muscles become resistant to conventional rehabilitation. Our central hypothesis is that rotator cuff tears induce a continuum of muscle atrophy and fibrosis, leading to a critical threshold, beyond which rehabilitation exercise compounds muscle fibrosis and degeneration, further impairing functional recovery. However, the biochemical, cellular, and mechanical characteristics of muscles associated with the spectrum of rotator cuff tendon tear severities are poorly defined in humans. In this proposal, our goal is to understand the structural, mechanical and physiological properties of these muscles. To achieve this goal, Specific Aim 1 will use MRI and direct tissue measurements to quantify muscle architectural changes associated with rotator cuff tears and repairs. Using tissue harvested intraoperatively, Specific Aim 2 will measure the whole muscle, muscle fascicle, and single muscle cell passive mechanical properties and protein-concentrations to identify the mechanism of increased muscle stiffness. Following a defined bout of pre-operative exercise, Specific Aim 3 will identify which patients respond to exercise with muscle hypertrophic, fibrotic, and adiopgenic expression profiles. These patients will be followed for six months post-operatively to measure strength and muscle recovery. These experiments will elucidate the structural, mechanical, physiological health and the adaptive potential of rotator cuff muscles after tendon tear. This contribution is significant because it is the first step in a continuum of research that is expecte to lead to novel exercise, pharmacological, and surgical interventions aimed at reversing atrophic muscle changes that obstruct patient recovery. The proposal is innovative, in our opinion, because it utilizes novel tissue testing and MRI methods to measure muscle structure, function, and adaptation in living humans. The absence of which has limited our understanding of atrophic muscle changes in all patients with tendinopathy. Their successful completion will have an immediate impact on the clinical treatment of rotator cuff tears because they will provide direct evidence and a non-invasive method for identifying patients who will respond and not respond to standard clinical care. In the long-term, these data will aid physical therapists in the design of unique, individualized rehabilitation strategies for patients with tendinopathy-related muscle atrophy."
"9262164","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Selenium (Se) has been thought to hold great promise as a cancer chemopreventive agent. However, the negative efficacy outcomes of recently concluded human trials in North America with seleno-methionine (SeMet) for prostate cancer (PCa) prevention (SELECT, HGPIN trials) have caused many to conclude that there is no hope for using Se to prevent cancer. We, however, beg to disagree with such a mainstream opinion. A costly lesson from these well-executed clinical studies is that whatever preclinical efficacy data that existed at the time the decision was made to conduct these trials DID NOT support the choice of SeMet for human efficacy validation, NOR did cell culture-based studies. In contrast, many pre-clinical studies from our group and others have shown inhibition of the genesis of cancers of the prostate and other organ sites by supra-nutritional intake of other Se forms, especially methylseleninic acid (MSeA) and Se- methylselenocysteine (MSeC), the presumed precursors of in vivo active anti-cancer methylselenol pool. Our recent data with a proteomic approach question the validity of the methylselenol paradigm and suggest unique potential molecular targets for MSeA vs. MSeC with little overlap. Our latest data with organ specific Pten- knockout (KO) driven prostate carcinogenesis suggest a super-activation of p53-p21-senescence pathway by MSeA to suppress neoplastic prostatic lesion growth in a preclinical mouse model, heralding in a new prevention paradigm through inducing irreversible terminal arrest of early lesion cells in vivo.  Our central hypothesis is that MSeA/C will prevent prostate carcinogenesis in preclinical rodent models each by regulating distinct sets of molecular targets and signaling pathways (e.g., p53-p21-senescence; p53- apoptosis; suppressor/oncoprotein balances). We propose testing this hypothesis with 3 Specific Aims: 1. To contrast the in vivo preventive efficacy of MSeA/C with (the lack thereof) SeMet against epithelial adeno- carcinogenesis in the prostate specific Pten-KO mice and to critically assess the contribution of the p53-p21 senescence pathway to their efficacy using Pten and p53 double KO mice. 2. To contrast the in vivo preventive efficacy of MSeA/C with the lack thereof by SeMet against chemically-induced, androgen-promoted prostate carcinogenesis in rats and to determine whether p53-p21 senescence activation is involved. 3. To identify proteomic signatures and molecular targets in the prostate gland and prostate carcinomas from studies of Aims 1 and 2 of MSeA and MSeC in addition to the p53-p21-senescene pathway and validate identified key targets. The results are expected to provide solid in vivo efficacy data for MSeA/C from multiple preclinical models of prostate carcinogenesis representing diverse human PCa etiologies and different mammalian species (mice and rats). Positive efficacies in multiple models increase the translatability for human application. The results may help to resurrect and advance the field of Se-prostate cancer chemoprevention research, redefining and changing mechanism paradigms of active Se form(s), cellular processes and molecular targets."
"9479866","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our overarching goal is to determine whether genetic markers can be used to optimize smoking cessation pharmacotherapy to enhance efficacy, medication adherence, and reduce side effects. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death and disability, and smoking cessation reverses the risk of mortality. However, cessation failure is common despite available cessation medications, which are associated with different efficacy, side effects, adherence, use constraints, and costs. This challenge can be addressed by improving current treatments via personalized medicine based on individual genetic markers to maximize efficacy and minimize side effects. Our recent work suggesting that the nicotinic receptor gene CHRNA5 alters response to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) has been replicated in a meta-analysis. Our new preliminary data suggest that CHRNA5 may be a useful marker for medication choice, because patients with CHRNA5 variant rs16969968 AA/GA genotypes may benefit from NRT and those with GG genotypes (conferring poor response to NRT) may benefit from varenicline, a medication with higher cost and use restrictions. Similarly, other genetic variation such as the nicotine metabolism gene CYP2A6 also alters response to NRT. Currently there is insufficient evidence to support the clinical use of genotype based smoking cessation treatment, because these findings are based on retrospective pharmacogenetic analyses of different trials with markedly different placebo and counseling effect sizes and dissimilar designs. For clinical translation, we need head to head comparison of state-of-the-art interventions, use of key genotypes implicated by current research, and valid assessments of side effects/ adherence. We propose a first, prospective, genotype-based stratified randomization trial to compare the two most effective smoking cessation medications (combination NRT [patch and lozenge], varenicline vs. placebo for 3 months) in 720 smokers with known genotypes. Leveraging the Principal Investigator's observational genetic follow-up study of smoking cessation with existing genotypes, this study uses a stratified randomization trial design based on a subject's pertinent genotype for smoking cessation. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine if CHRNA5 genotype moderates the effect of medication (combination NRT, varenicline, vs. placebo) on abstinence. In Aim 2, we will determine if CHRNA5 genotype predicts medication adherence and side effects. In Aim 3, we will incorporate multiple genotypes and other predictors in order to develop a clinical treatment assignment algorithm for cessation success. This proposal is an innovative smoking cessation trial leveraging existing genotyped smokers and a genotype-based randomization design to build the evidence base to support a genotype based algorithm that can optimize smoking cessation pharmacotherapy in terms of efficacy, side effects, adherence, and improve overall smoking cessation success. This work can result in improved physician care of patients who smoke, overall smoking cessation success, and prevention of cancer, heart, and lung disease."
"9479904","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hypothalamus acting through the pituitary is important for organismal adaptation to homeostatic challenges. Dysfunction in these systems impairs health, increases addictive behaviors and is a common cause of relapse. Elucidating the molecular cellular mechanisms is therefore critical for understanding, preventing, or treating a variety of associated disorders including substance abuse.  The hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and pituitary pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates. They control organismal responses to aversive stimuli through regulating circulating neuropeptides and glucocorticoids. However, it remains poorly understood how CRF and POMC neurons are regulated by both external environment and internal neural states. Neuromodulatory systems are involved, but because of the pleiotropic action of most neuromodulatory systems, it has been difficult to understand their role in CRF-POMC regulation in cell type- and gene-specific manners.  Dopamine (DA) is a classical neurotransmitter that is best known for its role in signaling reward. Dopamine also plays a critical but poorly understood role in hypothalamic-pituitary regulation in a variety of species including humans, dogs, rats, mice, and fish. Recently, we have uncovered that dopamine (DA) regulates CRF-POMC function in larval zebrafish through both D1 and D2 receptors. This study will employ the transparent and highly accessible larval zebrafish system and advanced molecular genetic technologies to understand the mechanisms by which dopamine regulates CRF-POMC function.  This study will unveil new molecular and cellular mechanisms on how DA neurons interact with CRF and POMC neurons to regulate their function. The findings will provide new insights into the development function and evolution of these important neural systems in the context of organismal survival and wellbeing. Equally importantly, this proposal will establish broadly applicable tools for genetically dissecting neuromodulatory systems in complex behaviors."
"9277751","PROJECT SUMMARY  Barrett?s esophagus (BE) is the replacement of the normal squamous esophageal epithelium with an  incompletely intestinalized columnar epithelium. It occurs in response to chronic acid and bile reflux injury to  the esophagus and is the most substantial risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a disease whose  incidence has risen at an alarming rate. Therefore, improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of BE  and its progression to EAC is a critical research imperative. A key lesson of recent genomic studies led in part  by this team has demonstrated that many potentially pathogenic somatic mutations are present in the BE  epithelium of those who do not progress to dysplasia or cancer, highlighting the important role of processes  other than genomic mutations for promoting disease onset and progression. Here, we focus on the pivotal role  of the tumor microenvironment in the pathogenesis of BE and EAC pathogenesis through aims that are  integrated and complementary. We provide new and compelling data implicating a subset of infiltrating  activated fibroblasts and immune cells in an interconnected web of mutually reinforcing signaling pathways  with BE epithelial cells that enhances carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that these tumor-promoting cell  populations in the BE microenvironment are key to understanding how and why BE progresses to EAC and  that characterization of these cells and regulatory pathways will serve as a foundation for developing  new approaches for screening and therapeutics. This hypothesis will be pursued through the following  inter-related Specific Aims: 1) To determine the nature and function of the immune cells and fibroblasts  present in human BE and EAC patients. 2) To demonstrate how IL-6 secreted by cancer associated  fibroblasts and TP53 mutant epithelium promotes BE pathogenesis and progression to EAC. 3) To examine  the effect of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSC) and regulatory T-cells (TReg) on the progression of BE  to EAC.

"9270543","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Satiety hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (Glp1) are secreted in response to feeding and activate neural processes that subsequently suppress food intake. While the satiety effects of Glp1 have been known for over 15 years, the mechanism mediating this effect is not clearly defined. This is significant since some Glp1-based therapies for type 2 diabetes display modest weight loss effects. Understanding how Glp1 regulates food intake may, therefore, lead to the design of therapeutic interventions with improved efficacy for weight loss. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the anorectic effect mediated via the central Glp1 receptor (Glp1r) is integrated with hypothalamic signaling proteins that respond to changes in circulating glucose. Activation of the hypothalamic Glp1 receptor (Glp1r) inhibits the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Considering that the anorectic effects of leptin, insulin and glucose are mediated in part by inhibition of hypothalamic AMPK, we hypothesize that this is also a mechanism by which Glp1 suppresses food intake. We also show that inhibition of AMPK by the Glp1r agonist Exendin-4 (Ex4) in hypothalamic cell lines occurs only with increasing glucose concentration. Ex4 also stimulates glucose uptake and metabolism in a glucose concentration-dependent manner. Since increased glucose metabolism inhibits AMPK, we hypothesize that central Glp1r activation inhibits AMPK and subsequently reduces food intake by stimulating central glucose metabolism. Supporting this hypothesis, we show that inhibition of glycolysis in the brain blocks the anorectic effect of Ex4.  Contrasting the effects of glucose, central administration of fructose attenuates the anorectic effect of Ex4. Fructose activates hypothalamic AMPK. This suggests that by activating hypothalamic AMPK fructose can short-circuit the Glp1r signaling pathway and promote central Glp1 resistance. This could partially explain our observation that mice fed a sucrose diet, which provides fructose and glucose, eat more compared to mice fed an isocaloric starch diet that only provides glucose. This also has clinical implications based on the association between increased fructose consumption and the obesity epidemic, particularly in children.  Since the Glp1r is expressed in multiple hypothalamic nuclei, the first aim is to identiy hypothalamic regions mediating the anorectic effect of Glp1r agonists. The second aim will combine hypothalamic nuclei- specific modulation of the Glp1r with pharmacological agents that target processes we hypothesize are downstream of the Glp1r - glucose metabolism and AMPK activity. The final aim will assess whether dietary fructose is an inhibitor of the satiety effects mediated by central Glp1r activation.  The long-term goal of this application is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate multiple aspects of feeding behavior. Defining the mechanisms by which the central Glp1r regulates food intake will identify key control points that could be sites for disruption by obesogenic factors and targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9383903","Project Summary / Abstract The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) plays a central role in the normal adaptive response to stress, and has been implicated in general anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and stress-induced drug abuse. Most existing knowledge about intrinsic and extrinsic BNST circuit connections is derived from classic anatomical studies which do not reveal functional synaptic connections. Due to previous technical limitations, many aspects of the intrinsic circuitry and local circuit organization of synaptic inputs in the BNST are not well understood. We propose to apply recent technological advancements in genetic cell targeting and photostimulation-based circuit mapping to build a high resolution functional map of the synaptic circuit organization of specific BNST neuron types. We hypothesize that strong local inhibitory connections are a major organizational principle in the anterior dorsal BNST, and that the relative balance of local BNST inhibitory synaptic connections underlies functional interactions between the anxiolytic and anxiogenic promoting subregions. To test this hypothesis, in Specific Aim1, we will use laser scanning photostimulation to map local synaptic input connections to three non-overlapping neuron types in the anterior dorsal BNST, including non- GABAergic CaMKII? expressing neurons, GABAergic somatostatin-expressing (SOM) and corticotropin- releasing hormone expressing (CRH) neurons. In Specific Aim 2, we will complement and extend laser scanning photostimulation studies with optogenetic stimulation-based circuit mapping to analyze inputs from specific neuronal subsets within the local BNST circuits. If successfully implemented, the proposed studies will lead to important progress toward understanding cell-type based local BNST circuit organization and function."
"9327665","Abstract Epigenetic regulators are crucial in regulating normal hematopoiesis and are frequently mutated in hematopoietic diseases. Recent genome-wide analyses in samples from MDS patients revealed that epigenetic regulators and splicing factors are frequent mutational targets. Seminal studies published by our lab demonstrated that conditional loss of de novo DNA methyltransferase 3A (Dnmt3a) leads to dramatic self-renewal and inhibited differentiation in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). DNMT3A is mutated in 10-13% of MDS patients and is the most frequent mutational target in clonal hematopoiesis. Our preliminary data suggest that DNMT3A directly impacts RNA splicing in the hematopoietic system through interaction with spliceosome-associated factors. This novel finding is significant, as the role of DNMT3A in maintaining normal hematopoiesis has not been extensively studied beyond DNA methylation. The overarching objective of this study is to delineate the functional role of DNMT3A in RNA splicing and determine how DNMT3A-deficient HSCs disrupt normal hematopoiesis. We will test the hypothesis that DNMT3A influences the RNA splicing program in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and may contribute to MDS pathogenesis in part through loss of splicing fidelity. Using co- immunoprecipitation assays, nucleic acid treatments, and pathogenic DNMT3A mutants, we will investigate the mechanistic basis of the interaction between DNMT3A and splicing factors. Additionally, we will delineate the role of DNMT3A in RNA splicing through in vivo deletion of DNMT3A in human cord blood HSPCs using CRISPR/Cas9 strategies. We will identify key groups of genes that are differentially spliced after DNMT3A knockout through deep RNA sequencing. We will also perform colony-forming assays with DNMT3A knockout HSPCs in the presence of H3B-8800, a splicing inhibitor that has recently gone into clinical trials. Additionally, analysis of RNA-sequencing data from Dnmt3a KO HSCs showed aberrant splicing patterns compared to WT HSCs. Therefore, we will attempt to rescue these aberrant splicing patterns through an inducible system that re- expresses DNMT3A in mouse HSCs. These studies will reveal the functional role of DNMT3A in RNA splicing, increasing our understanding of the mechanisms that govern normal hematopoiesis. As current therapies for MDS are ineffective, delineating DNMT3A's role in splicing may provide an avenue for developing novel therapeutic targets to combat this disease."
"9482807","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies identified a nonsynonymous SNP (rs16969968) within the CHRNA5 gene that encodes for the ?5 nicotinic receptor (nAChR) subunit. This SNP produces a twofold higher risk for heavy smoking and increases the risk for lung cancer. Consistent with the human genetics, our preliminary studies showed that the ?5 nAChR is necessary for the expression of the nicotine withdrawal syndrome. The ?5 nAChR also regulates sensitive to nicotine-induced behaviors and controls nicotine self-administration at high doses. In these proposed studies, we will investigate ?5's mechanistic action on the midbrain dopamine (DA) systems that reinforce rewarding and addictive behaviors. We will examine the effect of the rs16969968 SNP on DA signaling from its source in the midbrain to its main targets in the striatum, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) which is important for processing reward. Our in vivo multi-tetrode recordings show that nicotine increases the phasic burst firing of DA neurons, and our cyclic voltammetry and in vivo microdialysis data show that nicotine-induced changes in DA neuron firing are translated in a target-specific manner in areas that process reinforcement and reward, including the NAc core and shell. However, little is known about the role of the ?5 subunit or the rs16969968 SNP and about the role of the ?5-subunit in regulating the relationship between DA neuron firing and DA release in targets. Our working hypothesis is that nicotine acts via the ?5-nAChR subunit to modulate DA signaling both at the source (i.e., DA neurons in the midbrain) and at the targets (including the NAc and the dorsal striatum). The aims examine the hypothesis that nicotine-induced changes in the DA system evolve during chronic nicotine exposure and during the withdrawal period. The significance of the study originates from the expectation that these nicotine-induced activities and changes in the DA system contribute to the transition from initial nicotine use to addiction. Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and these studies provide a mechanistic basis for nicotine addiction and for developing therapies to aid smoking cessation."
"9480136","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large disparities in HIV rates in black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are not explained by higher engagement in risky behaviors and are particularly high among younger MSM. Despite the efficacy of several prevention interventions, reducing these disparities requires approaches that maximally engage these men's social and sexual networks. Because of frequently transient life circumstances, disruption of social and sexual networks and HIV transmission overlap with other groups, criminal justice involved (CJI) BMSM who use substances represent an important target for intervention. Although effective behavioral and structural interventions exist that target CJI populations, their successful implementation for CJI BMSM networks and communities has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, research to determine intervention impact at these larger social units is costly and does not readily lend itself to the randomized control trial approach. This proposal aims to utiliz a systems dynamic approach using an agent-based model (ABM) to estimate the effectiveness of HIV prevention and substance-abuse interventions for CJI substance-using BMSM.  Our project brings together investigators with a proven track record in the study of BMSM, criminal justice settings, substance-abuse intervention, social network analysis, ABMs and HIV clinical care provision. We will adapt a previously developed core open access ABM platform (using Repast Simphony) that includes baseline national data on people and households by geography, as well as the dynamic features of the target population such as incarceration, health center, and activity (time-use) data. We will scale the ABM to three counties: Harris TX, Los Angeles CA, and Cook IL where our team has collected data for model parameterization. Our approach will assess the interplay between social and behavioral variables and viral and host factors in a matter that will be adaptive to temporal, network and setting-specific changes. Our aims are to: 1) Build upon our flexible ABM by incorporating HIV transmission and suppression probabilities at the individual level, including host/viral factors and biologic/behavioral data from HIV prevention and substance-abuse intervention studies; 2) Parameterize this ABM with multiple network data sources available to investigators in each city on specific transition periods of BMSM from the community, to jail, and back to the community/ supervision; such shocks lead to social and sexual network formation and disruption. We will supplement these data with newly collected data (n=50/city) specifically on network shocks and HIV prevention and treatment utilization during these critical transition periods; 3) Simulate HIV prevention interventions within criminal justice contexts using the model parameterized in Aim 2. Because our open access Repast Simphony ABM platform is widely used, we will make model parameters, specifications and variables publically available. This will allow for external validation of our findings and for additional use of the core model by others for context and community-specific integrated HIV prevention and treatment planning in at risk populations."

"9266234","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autophagy in Metabolic Distress and Cardiac Function: Regulation by the HDAC-FoxO Axis Recent work has demonstrated that histone deacetylase [HDAC] inhibition [HDACi] is a promising strategy to target pathological cardiac hypertrophy, a process that can eventually lead to heart failure (HF). We have conducted studies in clinically relevant models of heart disease in vivo, demonstrating that pharmacological suppression of Class I and II HDAC activity inhibits, and even reverses, cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload. At the same time, HDAC inhibition preserves ventricular size and systolic performance and diminishes interstitial fibrosis. In parallel work, we have also identified the transcription factor FoxO3 as a central element in the governance of cardiac catabolic pathways, especially the autophagy-lysosomal process. Furthermore, strong evidence has suggested that Class I and II HDACs (HDAC3, 5, and 9) regulate metabolic processes controlled by FoxO transcription factors (FoxO1 and 3). Moving forward, a leading hypothesis is that HDAC inhibition suppresses maladaptive autophagy and metabolic derangements in pressure overload and metabolic stress induced cardiomyopathy. HDAC inhibitors could target both maladaptive autophagy in hypertension and ameliorate metabolic stresses in diabetes. These agents can potentially turn into powerful ways in preventing and treat heart failure, especially in the current era of epidemic hypertension and diabetes. Also importantly, the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat is a FDA-approved and clinically well tolerated anti-cancer agent. Based on these data, we propose studies to decipher the mechanisms of HDAC-FoxO axis in regulating autophagy and metabolic pathways, a novel mechanism and therapeutic target of cardiomyopathy and HF. HYPOTHESES: HDAC inhibitors suppress cardiomyopathy-promoting maladaptive autophagy and metabolic derangements through regulating the function of FoxO transcription factors. SPECIFIC AIMS: Specific Aim 1. To define the role of HDACs and HDAC inhibition in regulating the function of FoxO transcription factors and autophagy in vitro. Specifi Aim 2. To characterize the role of Class I and II HDACs in regulating cardiomyocyte autophagy and the role(s) of FoxOs therein. Specific Aim 3. To characterize the impact of HDACs (HDAC3, 5 and 9) and HDAC inhibitors on the function of FoxO1 and FoxO3 in models of metabolic stress. Studies proposed here will provide critical insight into how Class I and II HDACs regulate the function of FoxO1 and FoxO3 in the heart; how disturbance of the HDAC-FoxO pathway contributes to maladaptive autophagy, metabolic stress, cardiomyopathy, and pathological cardiac remodeling; how HDAC inhibition suppresses maladaptive autophagy and correct metabolic derangements by inhibiting the function of FoxO transcription factors under a variety of pathological conditions and protects cardiac function. At the same time, this work will move HDAC inhibition forward as a potentially promising therapeutic strategy in heart failure."
"9437668","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application Chicagoland TrialNet Clinical Center is in response to the RFA -DK-13-010 Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Clinical Centers (U01). Here we describe a joint effort from the University of Chicago and Advocate Children's Hospital (ACH) sites (Park Ridge and Oak Lawn, Illinois) and Advocate Health Care (AHC) to create a new Clinical Center in the Chicagoland area. These organizations along with our other affiliate (Lurie Children's Hospital) and partner sites saw over 9000 patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in 2012. Together, these practice sites along with other participating key adult and pediatric diabetes practitioners from Chicago reach over 12 million individuals within a two-hour drive of a screening location. The Chicago community, strong supporters of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and American Diabetes Association (ADA), has been under-represented in clinical trials for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). This partnership will bring together the resources of major medical centers committed to T1D research and clinical care to reach more of the estimated 100,000 individuals with T1D in the Chicagoland area (about 0.8% of the area population) and their families, as well as the 2000 projected new cases of T1D and their families each year. This outreach will involve diverse communities from some of the wealthiest to some of the most underserved in the United States. We will build on our success in creating the largest database for monogenic diabetes in the United States. We will engage the greater Chicagoland community through innovative social media and direct communications combining media support, direct visits to local practices, community events supported by our institutions and partners and outreach to large networks of faith communities. The University of Chicago has been committed to diabetes research for over 100 years, and together with Advocate Children's Hospital and other partners we will bring a new sense of energy, organization, and purpose to TrialNet recruitment and screening in the Chicagoland region."
"9230425","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung inflammation and alterations in endothelial permeability play a major role in the pathophysiology of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the conditions associated with high mortality rates. Low efficiency of current therapies may be explained in part by focus on drug treatments aimed at prevention of the onset of ALI, while endogenous feedback mechanisms which subside inflammatory activation and endothelial barrier dysfunction, although much more clinically relevant, remain poorly understood.  Our studies in the previous cycle identified a novel role of microtubule peripheral network in the control of lung endothelial barrier function. We discovered that stimulation of microtubule peripheral growth by barrier enhancing agonists, such as hepatocyte growth factor, promoted Rac GTPase-dependent and attenuated Rho GTPase-dependent signaling, thus leading to downregulation of vascular leak. We defined a novel paradigm of dual regulation of Rac and Rho pathways by microtubule-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factors Asef and GEF-H1 and demonstrated essential role of the microtubules in the mechanisms of Rac-Rho crosstalk and control of endothelial permeability. However, the entire mechanism of microtubule-dependent regulation of onset and resolution of ALI, and specifically, microtubule-dependent modulation of inflammatory cascades, remains poorly understood.  During the screening of potential signaling proteins associated with the microtubules in control and inflamed pulmonary endothelium, we discovered an association of a negative regulator of inflammatory signaling, SOCS1, with the microtubule fraction. This serendipity finding suggested a novel link between the microtubule cytoskeleton and control of endothelial inflammation and inflammation-induced permeability. Currently, a role of microtubules in the modulation of endothelial barrier response to bacterial wall compounds, cytokines, etc., remains virtually unknown. We hypothesize that cellular feedback mechanisms modulating cell inflammatory response critically require microtubule-assisted SOCS1 targeting to the submembrane compartment, where it interacts with its cytokine receptor- and TLR-associated protein targets. Using cell, ex vivo, and in vivo models of LPS-induced ALI this application will characterize regulation of LPS-induced inflammation by SOCS1, investigate involvement of microtubules in control of SOCS1 anti-inflammatory function, and will identify molecular mechanisms of active microtubule-assisted SOCS1 transport and submembrane targeting. The results of this project will delineate novel microtubule-dependent mechanisms regulating lung barrier dysfunction and inflammation, which may lead to discovery of a new group of pharmacological molecules for the treatment of ALI/ARDS."
"9271165","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microglia is an immune cell type unique to the CNS that plays a pivotal role in immune surveillance, phagocytosis, and neuroinflammation1. Microglia resides in the brain parenchyma and help maintain the homeostatic immunosuppressive environment partially due to their expression of CX3CR1 receptor for which Fractalkine (FKN/CX3CL1) is the only known ligand. FKN is constitutively expressed by neurons and astrocytes leading to tonic inhibition of microglial activation2. However, we have found that in the presence of medulloblastoma (MB), FKN signaling is altered due to expression of FKN by tumor cells, and as such microglia play a major role as phagocytes displaying certain up-regulated cell surface makers consistent with an activated phenotype. This contrasts with other reports showing that infiltrating monocytes play the major role in neuronal destruction and promote a pro-inflammatory environment3, 4. Because the precise role of microglia in the tumor microenvironment has yet to be elucidated, further investigation is warranted.  New and innovative approaches to cancer treatment are necessary to combat many cancer types, especially solid tumors. Available evidence now favors the view that physiological immune surveillance by members of the innate and adaptive immune systems play an essential role in suppressing tumor development in vivo, and that deficiency in this surveillance mechanism favors tumor development and metastasis formation5, 6. Additional challenges exist when solid tumors develop within the central nervous system (CNS), as immune surveillance within the CNS is further complicated by the presence of the blood brain barrier (BBB). MB is the most common malignant CNS neoplasm in the pediatric setting, accounting for 20% of pediatric CNS malignancies overall. It is a WHO-Grade IV primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) that develops in the cerebellum and often invades into surrounding structures including the fourth ventricle and the brain stem7. While treatment modalities and, more importantly, management of post treatment cognitive monitoring have improved overall outcomes, surviving patients still suffer cognitive sequelae including but not limited to verbal ability, perceptual organization, social perception, and psychomotor skills8. Hence there is a need for new treatment options that avoid direct toxicities associated with CNS surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiotherapy approaches. Understanding the mechanisms by which tumors escape detection and/or elimination by the innate and adaptive immune systems is imperative for developing new immune based therapeutics. FKN signaling may provide the key signal leading to microglia-mediated immune suppression within the CNS. Therefore, characterization of FKN signaling in the MB microenvironment will provide critical insight into the immunosuppressive capacity of tumors that will lead to more effective immunotherapeutic approaches."
"9256507","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Aggression is a normal innate behavior utilized for access to food, territory and mates by essentially all species of animals, including humans. Levels of display of aggression vary widely among individuals, however, and it generally is not known how much of this heterogeneity is genetic and how much is socially induced. Probably both mechanisms influence the expression of the behavior in all organisms, and the proportions of each that are involved vary widely between individuals. Unbridled aggression, in the form of violence, is a peculiarly human manifestation of this behavior, and when one adds the use of weapons capable of inflicting deadly damage to individuals and masses of individuals, it is a serious problem in society. Indeed weapons allow the least fit of individuals to become dominant protagonists in our society. In animal species, conspecifics sometimes kill opponents as well, but more commonly members of the same species engage in ritualistic stepwise-increasing-intensity-displays of fighting abilities. Winning and losing decisions can be made anywhere along the steps of such an intensity ladder. The roots of aggression are biological but there is little concrete information of how and where in the nervous system the seeds of violence are sown. In this application we propose to use a Drosophila model of aggression that we pioneered the use of in its modern form. Of all the available models for aggression, the Drosophila system offers the greatest ease and reproducibility of genetic manipulation within the nervous system down to single neuron levels. These manipulations can readily be combined with quantifiable behavioral measures in attempts to understand this complex behavior. Recently, using a novel strategy called intersectional genetics, we identified and manipulated in behaving animals single serotonin, dopamine and octopamine (fly equivalent of norepinephrine) neurons that all are involved in aggression. Thus, a single pair of serotonergic neurons found via this route, facilitat going to higher levels of aggression during fights, while a single pair of dopaminergic neurons are required to generate short term winner effects. In this application we ask a series of questions about the high-level aggression used by males to win fights. (1) What neurons and circuits are involved in going to high-intensity levels during fights, how do they work and how do they form during development? (2) What genetic or wiring differences exist in the nervous systems of the parent strain of flies and a hyper-aggressive line we generated called bullies that fight at higher intensity levels and always win fights against the parent strain? (3) Can we explain at cellular and circuit levels the learning and memory that takes place during fruit fly fights and accompanies the generation of winner and loser flies with changed aggression profiles? This application addresses the question of whether science and the study of model organisms can explain even a small part of the serious and pressing issues surrounding the root causes of human violence."
"9284987","PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to develop statistical methods for the analysis of the local covariance structure between measurements in multimodal biomedical imaging studies. Despite the rise of multi-modal imaging studies and the proliferation of derived measures available from each modality, very little work has explored relationships between modalities. Notably, brain structure and function evolve dramatically in the context of adolescent brain development, but typical analyses usually evaluate each imaging phenotype separately. We propose to develop tools for measuring relationships between brain imaging phenotypes provided by disparate imaging modalities. Covariance structures at the subject level will allow identification of local relationships between measures, through weighted regressions and singular value decomposition-based techniques. These techniques will be extended to accommodate any number of imaging modalities and incorporate repeated measures. We will use extensive test-retest data provided by the Consortium of Reproducibility and Reliability (CORR) for validation, and to identify coupling measures that are particularly reliable. The rich multi-modal imaging data and associated clinical phenotypes from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) will allow us to delineate how inter- modal coupling evolves in normal brain development, and also establish how such relationships are altered in association with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. This proposal builds upon established collaboration between the PIs and capitalizes on their complimentary expertise in imaging statistics, developmental neuroimaging, psychopathology, and intimate familiarity with the PNC dataset. Upon completion, this project will provide powerful new tools for the neuroscience community, as well as novel insights regarding brain development and early psychosis-spectrum symptoms."
"9268399","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application of a training grant currently in its 35th year of funding. The overall goal of this proposal is to train postdoctoral M.D. and Ph.D. fellows for academic careers in investigational dermatology. Its first objective is to provide laboratory training for dermatology-trained physicians. Its second objective is to train Ph.D. basic scientists in laboratory-based translational investigative dermatology. Its third objective is to train M.D. dermatologists and Ph.D.s in clinical and translational research. Trainees will commit to a minimum of two years of research training, which will occur under the supervision of one of sixteen primary preceptors. Laboratory-based fellows (M.D. and Ph.D.) will learn to formulate hypotheses and to design, perform, and analyze experiments, utilizing a multidisciplinary approach that emphasizes the use of human skin tissue as an experimental system. M.D. trainees in clinical/translational research will acquire proficiency in hypothesis-driven clinical research design and methods and in statistical analysis of data, while gaining an appreciation of the basic science knowledge underlying their clinical observations and interventions. To maximize multidisciplinary training, and to broaden our outreach into the broader University community, we have added highly qualified primary preceptors from outside the Department of Dermatology. In addition to mandatory participation in selected departmental didactic activities, introductory and advanced courses in clinical research methods and a molecular biology course for clinician-scientists will be available for trainees through the Medical School and the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR). Also, face-to- face training in the responsible conduct of research will be provided at the departmental and University-wide levels. In order to attract more dermatologists into academic careers, we have incorporated research fellowship opportunities in cutaneous oncology and dermatopathology, and expanded our traditional clinical research base in skin pharmacology to encompass a wider spectrum of interventions, notably ultraviolet light and appearance-based interventions. We have also changed our resident selection procedure in order to identify and attract NRSA-eligible M.D.s with strong research potential, with excellent results. We have also added a MICHR-sponsored Translational Research Training Program for Ph.D.s. Finally, we have created a Web site for dissemination of detailed information about our program to all potential trainees. By training M.D.s and Ph.D.s in state-of-the-art dermatological research at both the basic and clinical- translational levels, we will maximize the clinical impact of research, enhance the abilities of our trainees to teach future physicians, and increase the basic knowledge upon which our specialty increasingly depends."

"9259943","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The final form of the adult skull is achieved through a complex series of morphogenetic events and growth, largely during post-embryonic development. Many common human congenital defects in the skull have their foundation in these developmental events. The treatment options in human patients are far from perfect, and improvements demand a more complete understanding of the biology underlying post-embryonic skull formation. However, by their complex development and relatively late occurrence, these clinically relevant stages in skull development have been less accessible in experimental organisms. The zebrafish displays fundamental similarity in skeletogenesis to mammals, including in formation of the vault of the skull and the cranial sutures. Although the later events of skull and suture formation have been relatively less well studied in zebrafish, they are nonetheless accessible for manipulations and imaging, making the zebrafish an ideal system to further our understanding of these complex events. Through a set of interconnected Aims, we propose to establish and make available to the community tools that will lay the foundation for the use of zebrafish to examine skull and suture formation. We will first construct an online, interactive atlas of normal skull development, encompassing the stages during which the vault of the skull is forming. The foundation of the atlas will be images generated by high-resolution computed tomography (micro-CT), which will be annotated and available for download. These will be complemented by images of transgenic zebrafish expressing fluorophores in critical cell populations, such as chondrocytes and osteoblasts at different stages of development. For the transgenics, we will optimize recently developed methods for fixation and clearing of large (>1 mM) tissue samples and use a versatile zoom macro-confocal scope. This approach will allow creation of lower resolution data sets from which we can generate three-dimensional reconstructions of gene expression in an entire skull, and will also allow high resolution imaging of specific structures. The transgenic lines used for the imaging studies will also serve as the basis for a transgenic system, using phiC31 recombinase, to allow replacement of the transgene coding sequences in genomic context while preserving tissue-specific expression patterns; the reagents (fish lines and plasmids) will available to the community. Finally, both of the laboratories in this application are engaged in ongoing genetic screens to identify mutations causing defects in the juvenile or adult skull. Using a select set of mutants with clinically relevant phenotypes, we will apply the imaging approaches above to describe the defects in morphology and gene expression during skull development. Through the combined generation of a comprehensive atlas and a set of transgenic and genetic tools, we will substantially advance the use of zebrafish in the study of skull development, and greatly facilitate comparative studies with mammals that will advance treatment options in human patients."
"9251776","The Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) supports high priority, innovative, pilot or phase I institutional trials focusing on initial early phase testing of a candidate agent or device for the diagnosis, prevention, detection or treatment of cancer. Potential institutional trials arise from LCCC's Research Programs and are developed within disease-focused groups. Letters-of-intent (LOIs) are submitted to LCCC's Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) Committee for scientific review and prioritization. If the proposed trial is requesting internal funding and is approved by PRMS, the LOI and PRMS reviews are forwarded to the Resource Allocation Subcommittee for Investigator Initiated Trials (RACIIT). RACIIT identifies those trials that are eligible for and merit Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS) or institutional funding. Once a PRMS-approved LOI is assured of funding, a full protocol can be written and submitted back to PRMS for final approval. If approved by the PRMS and the Institutional Review Board (IRB), previously committed funds are released to provide support for research nursing and/or data management through the Integrated Clinical Research Management Office (ICRMO), and, if designated, for correlative studies. The translation of basic science to the clinic has resulted in the testing of a series of agents that have been developed at LCCC. The strong emphasis on translational research and drug development is reflected in the development and clinical testing of agents targeting growth factors, oncogenic mutations, activated pathways and, more recently, immune checkpoints. These early phase clinical trials are developed on a background of bench-to-bedside-back to bench translational research. Thus, clinical trials can be born out of institutional basic science research (e.g., CDK4/6 inhibition in Gl cancers); out of a combination of clinical research interconnected with basic science research (e.g., PPARy + RXR agonist; Nilotinib + Cetuximab); or clinically driven research that requires strong basic scientific correlates (e.g., rational combination of temsirolimus plus capecitabine; a pilot study of stereotactic radiosurgery with concurrent gemcitabine, a pilot study of tremelimumab in patients with hepatocellular cancer, and studies testing the feasibility of using conditionally reprogrammed cells to predict treatment outcome)."
"9348983","Project Summary Studies on the health effects of sex tourism report that sex workers are one of the most vulnerable groups for acquiring HIV due to their high rates of sexual risk behaviors1 and their disadvantaged positions to negotiate safe sex because of social, economic, and cultural factors.2 In low prevalence countries with concentrated epidemics, HIV prevalence rates among sex workers are often 3 to 4 times that of the general population.3 This risk is often perpetuated by the availability and accessibility of illegal drugs in tourism zones. While studies have examined the association between HIV risk-related behaviors including drug use and sexual risk-taking and the social and physical environment that characterize neighborhoods;4, 8-11 there is a fundamental gap in the current scientific evidence-base about which extra-individual contexts, ?activity spaces? (spaces in which daily activities occur) and social interactions or networks interact, and how that impacts HIV risk behavior. The goal of the proposed research is to utilize innovative spatial-temporal and social network methodology to describe the relationship between activity spaces and social network characteristics of male migrant sex workers in tourism zones in the Dominican Republic (DR), and to assess how such daily activity patterns and networks jointly affect HIV risk behavior, testing and infection. Considering that the DR has one of the largest sex tourism industries in the Caribbean and is currently experiencing a dramatic increase in the use and transport of illegal drugs, spurred by a shift in smuggling routes to the United States,27, 28 the country provides a unique environment for examining how environmental and social structures shape HIV risk and related behaviors among sex workers. A deeper understanding of the multiple factors that influence day-to-day experiences of male migrant sex workers is paramount for reducing the HIV burden in the DR, and for preventing international transmission through tourism and migrant routes. This study has three specific aims: (1) To utilize novel spatial-temporal methodology to characterize the activity spaces of male migrant sex workers in the Dominican Republic by linking activity space GPS data to already collected, novel ethnographic mapping data from a current NIDA-funded R01, and to examine the impact of risky activity spaces on HIV risk and related behaviors, specifically drug use, risky sex, HIV testing, and self-reported HIV; (2) To describe the social networks (e.g. size, composition) of male migrant sex workers, and assess the role social networks have on HIV risk and related behaviors in this population; (3) To examine the interaction between daily activity space and social network characteristics on HIV risk and related behaviors. If activity spaces can be identified and play a significant role in drug use and other HIV-related behaviors?including their combined role with network characteristics?it will provide critical information for creating effective structural and interpersonal HIV prevention interventions. To address the current barriers to HIV prevention and treatment, it is paramount that we focus not only on multiple social determinants, but also on the social experiences and lives of at risk populations."

In this second funding cycle we continue to make substantial progress in the further development of our training program, particularly with regard to a translational multidisciplinary training environment, strong professional development and a highly successful minority recruitment and training program. The outcomes for all of our Trainees have been outstanding both in publications and placement. The ERP training environment strongly emphasizes the building of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary teams, the members of which are both MD and PhD. To that end we have recently been joined by MD fellows undergoing graduate degree study in a newly developed Degree Fellowship Track created within ERP. While MD candidates are not candidates for support under this T32 Predoctoral application, we wish the reviewers to be aware of its existence. We believe all MD and PhD trainees benefit from a collective 'translational dialogue' of the research projects in hand and such a dialogue promotes the development of both theoretical and practical models for translational work in the future. The end result is a stronger, more vibrant training environment with the continuing recruitment of additional faculty, for all to enjoy. This blended training environment is very much needed if we are to maintain a future pool of interdisciplinary translational research team members at a time of otherwise reduced support for research faculty and increasing demands on clinicians to be in the clinics. Finally we have achieved considerable success in recruiting and graduating students of diversity. While the details of our multifaceted approach are detailed in the proposal, this has been an outstanding success and we have one of the highest levels of URM participation and indeed graduation success, of which we are understandably proud."

"9353024","Therapeutics Core Abstract Antiretroviral therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection. While having dramatic effects on disease morbidity and mortality, it demands life-long adherence.

Nanoformulated long- acting antiretroviral therapy with half-lives measured in month(s) require infrequent administration but with equivalent or superior therapeutic efficacy compared to standard drug regiments. These have the potential to revolutionize current antiretroviral therapy. Cell-targeted nanoformulations provide yet another boost by improving drug delivery to viral reservoirs and by providing novel opportunities for viral eradication.

"9404239","PROPOSAL SUMMARY Live attenuated vaccines have proven to be the most efficient human vaccines for many serious infectious diseases. When compared to their dead counterparts, live vaccines induce superior immune protection and lasting memory. But despite the efficacy of live vaccines, concerns over their safety have led to vaccine refusal by some and withholding their administration to the very young, the elderly and immunocompromised. Preservation and delivery of live vaccines especially to impoverished areas in developing countries is difficult and expensive. Understanding the molecular basis for the efficacy of live vaccines is significant because it would enable targeting of the relevant immune pathways that induce optimal and long-lasting protective immunity. Importantly, it would set the stage for the development of vaccines that are safe and afford the same protection as live vaccines, alleviating public fears and increasing the segment of the population that is vaccinated. We began our work eight years ago with the hypothesis that innate immune cells sense microbial viability as a distinct set of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and we identified bacterial messenger RNA (mRNA) as a vita-PAMP that signifies bacterial viability and mobilizes a tailored immune response not warranted for dead microorganisms. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling adaptor TRIF plays a central role here upstream of inflammatory type I interferon and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways. Adding bacterial mRNA to dead bacteria recapitulates these innate responses, and supplementing a dead vaccine with bacterial mRNA (what we call a vita-vaccine) augments its performance in mice. A vita-vaccine performed similarly to a live vaccine in uniquely eliciting a follicular T helper cell response (that helps B cells), germinal center formation, and B cell isotype class switching, all in a TRIF-dependent manner. These studies provide strong evidence that vita-vaccine versions of existing vaccines could represent a significant advance in being able to combine the efficacy of live vaccines with the safety of dead vaccines. The three overlapping areas we will investigate in this project are: 1. We will determine how adaptive immunity elicited by the supplementation of a dead bacterial vaccine with the vita-PAMP bacterial mRNA compares to that elicited by PAMPs such as bacterial lipopeptides and others. 2. We will investigate how bacterial mRNA impacts the performance of subunit vaccines. We will test vita- vaccine versions of the licensed anthrax subunit vaccine and Influenza A virus monovalent subunit vaccine. 3. We will test a vita-vaccine version of a trivalent inactivated Influenza virus vaccine and compare it to the live attenuated influenza vaccine.  The completion of these studies should provide sufficient experimental evidence to warrant the use of bacterial mRNAs as superior vita-adjuvants that restore the signatures of microbial viability to dead vaccines and improve existing inactivated and subunit vaccines for protection against either bacterial or viral diseases."
"9270054","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the current application is to elucidate novel molecular networks underlying mammalian meiosis and develop a mammalian cell culture system for in vitro meiosis. Meiosis, a process unique to germ cells, involves pairing synapsis, recombination, desynapsis, and segregation of homologous chromosomes. Genetic abnormalities resulting from meiosis are a leading cause of birth defects, pregnancy loss, and infertility in humans. The structural and functional properties of meiotic chromatin, which undergoes extensive reorganization, are undoubtedly the central themes of meiosis. Despite rapid progress in understanding meiosis, the complex interplay between chromatin organization and meiotic processes remains largely unexplored. In particular, the progress in understanding mammalian meiosis has lagged far behind meiotic studies in other model organisms, due to several critical barriers, including high cost, long duration, and the lack of sequence conservation of many meiosis-specific proteins across distant species. To overcome these roadblocks, we have developed cost-effective genomics and proteomics approaches to systematically identify a large number of uncharacterized mammalian meiosis factors. The current application will utilize an innovative combination of genetic, cell biological, and biochemical approaches to determine the role of our newly identified novel/uncharacterized factors and their interacting proteins in regulating meiotic recombination in mice. The proposed studies will focus on mechanistic insights into the regulation of meiotic recombination in three largely unknown or poorly understood aspects: second end capture, crossover formation, and homologous chromosome segregation. Progression through meiosis is a critical barrier to in vitro derivation of germ cells and a robust cell culture system for in vitro meiosis in multicellulr organisms remains elusive. Therefore, using a unique GFP reporter to monitor progression of meiosis in vitro, we plan to interrogate culture parameters in a stepwise manner to develop a cell culture-based in vitro meiosis system. Undoubtedly, development of an in vitro system for mammalian meiosis will not only drive basic mechanistic research on meiosis but also revolutionize regenerative medicine in the treatment of male infertility in humans."

Selection of trainees occurs through a competitive process mediated by a Training Grant Advisory Committee. A total of six predoctoral trainees and eight postdoctoral trainees are proposed for a primary training faculty of 28 individuals experienced in basic and applied studies of age-related neurodegeneration. In all cases, the main criteria for successful candidates is dedication and interest in aging and neurodegeneration research and the highest level of academic achievement in their previous training. Students are required to participate in special neurodegeneration courses, seminars, journal clubs and symposia. Close monitoring of student progress and career advising provide an effective structure for the entire training process. The purpose of the Program is to create a framework within which the best training of future researchers devoted to problems in aging and neurodegeneration can take place, and the already extensive collaborative interactions among the Program faculty can be propagated at all levels, from student to Professor."
"9347632","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) afflicts 14% of US adults and represents a foremost challenge facing public health. CKD patients have a higher prevalence of co-morbidities and represent a population that often requires medical intervention. However patient management is confounded because contrast media routinely used with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is contra-indicated in patients with moderate to severe CKD. CT contrast media can cause acute and irreversible kidney injury to renally impaired patients. Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) used as MR contrast media are directly linked to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in renally impaired patients. The prevalence of co-morbidities and the risk associated with contrast media both increase with decreased renal function. Thus as patients grow increasingly vulnerable physicians are forced to make key decisions with limited radiologic information or to use contrast media and place the patient at high risk for renal failure or for NSF. There is a major unmet medical need for a safer contrast media alternative.  GBCAs have also recently been shown to deposit small amounts of gadolinium in the brain and other organs, even in patients with normal renal function, and that Gd deposition increases with increasing exposure. While the medical implications of these deposits are still unknown, this is an area of active concern for the FDA.  Reveal Pharmaceuticals is developing a gadolinium-free contrast agent based on technology developed at Massachusetts General Hospital. Our lead compound, RVP-001, is a very stable manganese chelate with equivalent imaging properties to GBCAs but without using the toxic gadolinium ion. RVP-001 is 100,000 times more stable than Teslascan, another manganese-based compound previously used in clinical imaging. RVP- 001 is functionally equivalent to GBCAs having similar relaxivity and biodistribution, and is excreted from the body intact. RVP-001 enhanced MRI is equivalent to GBCA enhanced MRI in the same animal model. Our ultimate goal is to develop RVP-001 for use in renally impaired subjects and as a general purpose MR contrast agent.  It is critical that RVP-001 does not lead to Mn accumulation in the body and result in a toxicological effect. In this FastTrack application we will use the positron emitting Mn-52 isotope (t1/2 = 5.2d) to study the retention and excretion of Mn under acute and subacute dosing with comparison to unchelated Mn and to GBCA. We will also perform preclinical safety evaluations of RVP-001. For clinical development and ultimately to compete with GBCAs we will need a very cost effective synthesis that does not involve HPLC purification. We have identified different synthetic routes to RVP-001 and these will be systematically evaluated and a chemical process with analytical controls will be developed."
"9269899","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Carolina Population Center (CPC) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) requests a five-year continuation of NICHD support for its training program in demography and the social and health sciences. The CPC training program combines a firm base in a social science or health discipline with formal training in core demography and research-based training in population. Hallmarks of the program are its multidisciplinarity, the integration of the social and health sciences, and the interdisciplinary and team orientation of much of the training and research. Continued support is requested for 10 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral traineeships per year. Sixty-five faculty fellows of the Carolina Population Center, holding primary appointments in 16 UNC-CH departments, provide an unusually rich environment for interdisciplinary research as training faculty and potential preceptors. In addition, Center research support services for trainees and faculty are truly outstanding. CPC's predoctoral training program combines disciplinary degrees with training in population research. Predoctoral trainees meet the course, dissertation, and other requirements of their home departments. They also meet Center requirements, including: a research practicum supervised by a CPC faculty fellow; completion of at least four approved graduate-level population and population-focused methods courses; training in the responsible conduct of research; participation in interdisciplinary population seminars and workshops; and attendance at the annual meeting of the Population Association of America (PAA). The 42 predoctoral trainees during AY 2012-13 are registered in the PhD programs of 10 departments across campus. The postdoctoral training program is designed around the mutual population research interests of trainees and faculty fellows. The 12 postdoctoral scholars during AY 2012-13 hold doctorates in eight disciplines. Postdoctoral scholars are admitted directly to the Center and collaborate with individual faculty preceptors, generally for a period of two years.

All trainees have office space at the Center and with it many opportunities for interdisciplinary exchange with faculty and other trainees."
"9205241","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) and the Fo motor (FoM) of ATP synthase are the only known rotary protein motors driven by transmembrane ion potentials. The flagellar motor is the organelle of locomotion in many bacterial species, while the FoM drives the synthesis of ATP, the universal cell fuel. Both proteins play a fundamental role in the lives of cells. The mathematical models developed until now describe the functioning of the motors phenomenologically. That is, the interactions between the stators and the rotor are treated by constructing driving potentials that are artificially tuned to fit the measured behavior This is good enough in the absence of a detailed molecular structure. However, recent experiments have elucidated many of the component structures of these motors to the point where we can address directly how intermolecular forces conspire to generate the rotary torques. A structure-based model will provide an explanation for how transmembrane ion potentials are converted into rotary torque, and how the binding of CheYP to the rotor reverses the torque. This process controls the alter- nation of 'runs' and 'tumbles' of the bacterium, which is the basis of its chemotaxis. In Aim 1, we will address the physical mechanism by which torque is generated by the stator of the BFM using the available structural information of the stator and rotor proteins. This work is based on the 'proline hinge' mechanism proposed by D. Blair as the power-stroke driving the rotation of the flagellar motor. This mechanism is based on the bending of the ?-helices constituting the stator induced by a proline residue. Thus, when a cation hops onto the ion-binding site of the stator, the hydrogen bonds in the vicinity of the site rearrange thereby inducing a 'kink and swivel' movement of the ?-helix about the proline residue. Existing molecular dynamics simulations, supported by our energy-based calculations, show that this is an energetically plausible mechanism. In this work we will develop mathematical models describing the power-stroke mechanism and focus on explaining the following experiments: (i) degradation of motor efficiency due to mutation of important charges on the stator and the rotor, (ii) torque-speed curves, (iii) step-size distributions, and (iv) motor reversals. Our studies of te flagellar motor have convinced us to revisit our previously published models of the Fo motor. In Aim 2, we show that the electrostatic power stroke mechanism we proposed previously should be re- placed by a conformation power stroke that is structurally similar to the proline hinge mechanism in the flagellar motor. Using this new mechanism we will address a number of unresolved issues in powering rotation of the FoM. These studies will present a unified mechanochemical mechanism for both the rotary motors and may help in understanding how they are related from the viewpoint of their evolution."
"9343416","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY - Project 3  Topological mapping of chromatin architectures for hormone-independent gene transcription Long-range chromatin interactions between ER?/AR-bound enhancers and promoters are necessary for coordinated gene regulation in breast and prostate cancer cells. These interactions occur via the formation of 3D chromatin architecture that brings enhancers and transcription factor complexes into close contact with target genes. To decode this complex regulation, we and other investigators have previously used Hi-C to map topologically associated domains (TADs) in different cell types. In a further study, we have identified a cancer- specific TAD on chromosome 17q23 that can be partitioned into an ER?-regulated transcription hub. Concordant up-regulation of its target genes is found to be associated with short disease-free survival in a subgroup of ER?-positive breast cancer patients, irrespective of their anti-hormone treatments. Emerging evidence has also shown AR-specific TADs are present in the prostate cancer cell genome. Therefore, we hypothesize that 1) frequent hormone (i.e., estrogen or androgen) stimulation leads to the formation of ER?/AR-related TADs that dynamically regulate transcription of multiple genes for aberrant proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cells and 2) in the presence of antagonists, a subset of these chromatin domains, herein termed transition TADs, continue to be exploited through chromatin redeployment for hormone- independent transcription. Whereas the majority of ER?/AR-related TADs are functionally suppressed by antagonists, transition TADs may partially escape this blockade for constitutive regulation of gene transcription. To test these hypotheses, we will use a modified Hi-C method, called tethered conformation capture (TCC), to investigate dynamic changes of TAD structures in hormone-sensitive and -resistant cancer cell lines exposed to agonists or antagonists (Aim 1). ChIP-seq of repressive, active, and gene-body histone marks and CTCF insulator will also be conducted in this cell line panel. MNase-seq and MBDCap-seq datasets will be acquired to map euchromatinized and heterochromatinized TADs. To integrate omics-seq data, we will develop a computational model, PRAM3D, which applies a Poisson Random effect Architecture Model (PRAM) to recapitulate 3D chromatin architectures (Aim 2). A Bayesian hierarchical model will predict putative transition TADs that concordantly regulate hormone-independent transcription of target genes. Furthermore, we will use a nucleosome density method to classify transition TAD subdomains into different regulatory categories, i.e., active, repressive, or bivalent transcription hubs. CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing of critical chromatin regions may functionally disassemble spatiotemporal organization of these TAD-associated hubs (Aim 3). Proliferation and invasion/migration assays will determine whether this genome editing partially re-sensitizes cancer cells to anti-hormone treatments. We will also interrogate mechanistic contribution of histone modifications and other epigenetic modulators for the establishment of transition TAD structures. In silico expression profiling and single-cell RNA seq will be conducted in primary tumors of TCGA cohorts and in cancer cell subpopulations, respectively, and determine whether concordant regulation of TAD-associated target genes is intrinsic predictors of hormone resistance in breast or prostate cancer."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A multiple family group (MFG) is a family-centered, group delivered, evidence-informed, manualized intervention that targets the most common reason for referral to publicly funded clinics: youth oppositional defiant and conduct disorders. MFGs target family factors which have been consistently implicated in the onset and maintenance of childhood behavioral disorders and integrate components of existing evidence-based practices (EBPs). The MFG service delivery model was developed in collaboration with urban parents and service providers to address the serious challenges associated with EBP roll-outs: low rates of family involvement; poor uptake by providers; clinic and provider impediments to maintaining fidelity; and attenuated child outcome effects. The proposed study, in response to RFA 15-320, Clinical Trials to Test the Effectiveness of Treatment, Preventative, and Services Interventions, will employ a mixed methods Type II effectiveness-implementation hybrid research design. In collaboration with the NYS Office of Mental Health (OMH), this longitudinal study will be conducted across the NYC OMH licensed child behavioral health clinic system (n=134). We will use mixed methods, and involve 268 providers and 2,688 adult caregivers of youth (7 to 11 years). The following Specific Aims guide this study: To examine 1) short-term and longitudinal impact of MFGs on urban youth with ODD and CD (replication); 2) family-level mediators (e.g. parenting, family process) of child outcomes; 3) clinic (readiness to adopt an innovation, leadership support and climate) and provider level moderators (preparedness, motivation and fidelity) of MFG implementation and integration and; 4) the impact of CITs on clinic and provider level moderators of MFG implementation and integration. In this RCT, clinics will be stratified by borough (Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, Brooklyn, Staten Island) and randomly assigned within borough to 3 study conditions: 1) MFG+CITs; 2) MFG (with standard research training and consultation) or; 3) Standard Care. Data will be collected baseline, 8 and 16 weeks and 6 mo. follow-up) in Phase 1 (focus on implementation) and Phase II (integration). Our team includes the highest level of NYSOMH research and policy leadership. McKay and Hoagwood are the co-Directors of the NYS Clinic Technical Assistance Center, the NIMH-funded Advanced Center on Implementation of Evidence-based Practice for Children in State Systems (IDEAS; P30 MH09032) and the Center for Collaborative Urban Child Mental Health Services Research (CCCR; P20 MH085983). Advanced methodological expertise (Jaccard, Palinkas) and policy (Hogan, Bradbury, Goldman) consultation from IDEAS/CCCR Center advisors position the study for maximum public health impact. This team is uniquely prepared to build on an existing research and service infrastructure within a state public mental health system to conduct this study. Because of the nationally- focused centers and the partnerships with NYSOMH, the findings from this study are immediately actionable."
"9460740","Contact PD/PI: Kimberly, Robert P The vision of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Hub is to reduce health disparities in diseases disproportionately represented within the Deep South as we accelerate discovery to improve human health.

The complexity and intertwining of proteomics, metabolomics and bioinformatics strongly indicated that the most beneficial and logical step for this round of application is to group these three entities under one umbrella allowing for closer and more effective use of technology to the advantage of research conducted by center?s investigators. Each component of this ?Omics Core (Proteomics led by Dr. Ciborowski, Metabolomics led by Dr. Siuzdak and Bioinformatics now led by Dr. Guda) brings extensive respective expertise supported by close collaboration during the past five years of CHAIN funding. Support of CHAIN Center and its investigators with advanced analytical and bioinformatics technology platforms will be accomplished according to the following specific aims: 1. To provide analytical technologies in proteomics and metabolomics via mass spectrometry and bioinformatics platforms for comprehensive data analyses; 2. To provide expertise in experimental design, data analyses and software tools in support of studies needed by investigators associated with this center; 3. To develop new approaches and analytical techniques for proteomic and metabolomics studies to meet the current and future needs of CHAIN investigators; 4. To enable genome-scale technology and state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools for the needs of the Center; and 5. To coordinate efforts of this core at all levels within the neuroAIDS and Center?s communities. These specific aims are designed to meet the Center?s goals, and the three Core investigators not only bring significant expertise in proteomics, metabolomics and bioinformatics but also have a good understanding of chronically developing condition such as HIV and its neurobiology, and experience in neuroAIDS studies, which facilitate the likelihood of success of CHAIN Center investigators. One of expectations is that results of proteomics experiments will be integrated with metabolomics data, and through the use of bioinformatics analysis tools in this Core a collaborative effort will result in integrated data collection, sharing and analysis capabilities that are simultaneously divers and integrated, not only enabling our investigators to meet their scientific aims but generating a unique resource for HIV infection of the central nervous system and ageing. Further integration of this core, will enable its leaders to recognize which researchers of this center would benefit from the other omics support. Moreover, all information will be shared via mechanisms provided by the administrative core in form of in-person (mini symposia) or on-line (webinars) meetings as well as multiple educational avenues, i.e. tutorials associated with databases, monographic and textbooks.

"9277720","DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Developmental Funds have played a key role in facilitating scientific growth and increased interdisciplinary collaboration at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC). Over the previous funding cycle, $185,000 per year of awarded funds were expended on new faculty recruitment, one pilot project per year, and support of developing shared resources, of which one is being put forth as a competing shared resource as part of this renewal application. In the upcoming project period, MCC is requesting $280,000 per year to recruit 6 new investigators over 5 years as part of a planned expansion of MCC programs, fund up to 3 pilot projects per year, and offset the purchase of shared services from other NCI- designated cancer centers. While the requested CCSG funds will be more than matched with MCC and institutional funds to accomplish these planned recruitments, pilot projects, and the purchase of shared services, the CCSG funds provide critical leverage to obtain matching funds from other sources. In alignment with the MCC Vision 2016 strategic plan, a total of 39 investigators were recruited to MCC since 2011. Of the 39 recruitments, 34 were considered strategic, fulfilling targeted needs identified by senior leadership. MCC has dedicated over $13.5 million in committed funding to ensure the success of these recruits. Of the 34 strategic recruitments, 6 received CCSG support. Four of the 6 faculty recruits supported by CCSG funds have been awarded funding from the NCI. Of the 39 total recruits, 12 have been awarded NCI funding (30%), with $13.2 million (total costs, all years), and an additional $6.5 million (total costs, all years) in NIH and other peer-reviewed extramural funding. Peer-reviewed extramural funding is held by 19 (~49%) of the total investigators, with more than 66% of the funding coming from the NCI. Total funding generated by the new recruits over the past 5 years totals over $19.7 million (total costs, all years). Over the past 5 years, our Pilot Research Grant Program (PRGP) received a total of 182 concepts for review, with a total of 125 invited to submit full proposals, resulting in 52 (28.6%) approved for funding. Of the 43 pilots funded between 2011 and 2014, 13 of the 43 pilot projects funded (30%) during this period resulted in extramural peer-reviewed funding totaling $16,324,252 (total costs, all years). Total funding of the pilot projects equaled $1,657,303 during this period, resulting in an overall ?return on investment? ratio of more than 9.4:1. During this same time period, the CCSG provided support for 5 pilot projects. Three projects resulted in extramural peer-reviewed funding. Of these 3 projects, 2 have resulted in new R01s and a R21 from NCI. The data and results produced from these CCSG-funded pilots generated $3,623,885 in extramural, peer-reviewed funding (total costs, all years). Total funding for the 5 projects was $209,999, resulting in an overall ?return on investment? ratio of over 17:1 for CCSG-funded pilot project awards."
"9479906","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is fundamentally different from acute nociceptive pain in its underlying mechanisms, symptoms and especially, in response to treatment. There is a high comorbidity of chronic pain with diseases such as anxiety and depression. Some studies suggest that during chronification of pain, the affective/emotional features of pain become more dominant. Critically, achieving a positive clinical outcome with current analgesic therapies appears to be negatively correlated with pain chronicity. Neuroimaging studies in chronic pain patients have identified brain regions with altered opioid and dopamine function, suggesting that impairments in these neurotransmitter systems could underlie the transition from acute to chronic pain. We have recently demonstrated in animal pain models that relief of ongoing pain is rewarding and requires dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Moreover, these behavioral and neurochemical measures of pain relief depend on endogenous opioid neurotransmission in the cingulate cortex (ACC), an area encoding aversiveness of pain. Chronic pain may produce sustained opioid signaling in the ACC resulting in progressive changes in opioid transmitter-receptor function in this region, and over time, in reduced analgesic efficacy. Determining whether there is a causal relationship between pain, brain neuronal maladaptations and analgesic effectiveness of pain therapies in humans is difficult and potentially unethical. Therefore, we will employ a rat model of chronic neuropathic pain to perform longitudinal studies over a six months period to more closely mimic the human chronic pain condition. In Aim 1 we will investigate the temporal changes in opioid and dopamine neurotransmission in the brain regions encoding affective and motivational aspects of pain. We will use fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and fast scan controlled adsorption voltammetry (FSCAV) techniques pioneered in our laboratories that allow measurements of phasic and tonic levels of dopamine in awake behaving animals with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. The phasic release of dopamine may be influenced by chronic pain-related changes in tonic dopamine levels. Additionally, we will use a novel in vivo microdialysis method involving online preservation coupled with LC-MS3 detection to measure the low levels of endogenous opioid peptides in the ACC in behaving animals in control and pain conditions. Aim 2 will investigate whether pain chronicity is related to reduced efficacy of opioid and dopamine signaling. Our laboratory demonstrated that in animals, relief of pain aversiveness produces negative reinforcement that can be assessed behaviorally using conditioned place preference (CPP). CPP can be viewed as the animal's self- report of analgesic efficacy that encompasses learning as well as motivational and affective features of ongoing pain and therefore provides information that is likely of translational relevance to the human pain experience. We will use the CPP paradigm to evaluate progression of ongoing neuropathic pain and to assess the efficacy of opioid and non-opioid analgesics over time. Aim 3 will establish if normalization of dopamine and opioid function can be achieved with reversal of chronic pain using methods currently in clinical trials. The proposed studies address gaps in our knowledge that include causality, chronicity and reversibility of pain- related brain dopamine and opioid function. Additionally, these studies may allow for objective quantification of chronicity and serv as a biomarker of effective pain relieving treatments that may speed translation and discovery of new pain therapeutics."

"9471461","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this K01 proposal is to determine the significance of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) derived microRNAs (miR) in the genesis of systemic insulin resistance (IR) associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). In this proposal, we posit a key role for miR-223 in the pathogenesis of obesity/DM2. Our overarching hypothesis is driven by three key sets of preliminary data: a) miR-223 is the most upregulated miR in VAT of humans, correlating strongly with markers of IR and inflammation, b) miR-223 regulates multiple targets involved in insulin signaling, and c) plasma exosomes derived from obese/IR patients are enriched in miR-223 compared to controls. We propose to test the significance of visceral adipose macrophages (VAT-?) miR-223 as part of an ongoing inter-disciplinary investigation that will significantly enhance my training and propel my career towards independence. In Aim 1, we will compare miR-223 expression in VAT-? with plasma exosome-miR-223 levels in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery vs. non-obese controls, following post- surgery/post-weight loss exosome miR-223 levels compared to markers of BMI, IR, etc. We hypothesize that VAT-? and exosome miR-223 strongly correlate with markers of glycemic control, IR, and inflammation. Next, we will test the in vitro effects of miR-223 overexpression on target genes relevant to IR as predicted by computational bioinformatics. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that VAT-? are an important source of plasma exosome miR-223. We will assess the temporal course of miR-223 expression in various compartments [VAT- ?, liver ? (Kupffer cells), and plasma exosomes] and further hypothesize that exosome-miR derived from VAT-? may contribute to regional (paracrine) and endocrine (liver) disruption of insulin signaling. To investigate this, we will assess in vitro transport of fluorescently labeled macrophage-derived exosomes containing miR-223 to human hepatocytes and adipocytes in co-culture assays. The effect of exosome-miR-223 on validated targets in human hepatocytes and adipocytes will be assayed. Finally in Aim 3, we hypothesize that miR-223 antagonism in VAT-? accomplished via regional delivery of targeted antagomiR-223 nanoparticles will decrease functional plasma exosome miR-223, beneficially impacting whole body insulin sensitivity. Collectively, the experimental findings from this proposal should help drive new understanding of VAT-derived miRs as pleiotropic modulators of processes in IR/DM2."
"9307950","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The polarization of epithelial cells is essential for the integrity and function of most tissues and organs, and defective epithelial polarity is associated with a broad range of diseases, including more than 90% of cancers. Maturation of epithelial polarity correlates with cell differentiation during development. However, whether polarity controls cell fate signals and how deregulated polarity is linked to disease progression is still poorly understood. The long term OBJECTIVE of our work is to gain much needed mechanistic insight into the cues bridging epithelial cell polarity and cell fate, and to understand how deregulation of these signals drives defects in the developing and adult respiratory system. There are three evolutionarily conserved protein complexes that govern apical-basal epithelial polarity: the Crumbs, Par and Scribble complexes. Our HYPOTHESIS is that the apical-basal dynamics of these polarity complexes directs intracellular signals required for specifying cell fat in the respiratory epithelium. Our prior and preliminary studies demonstrate that the Crumbs family member, Crb3, and the polarity-regulated Par1b kinase mediate the localization and activity of the transcriptional regulator YAP. YAP is a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway that has vital roles controlling cell proliferation, survival and cell fate. Our preliminar work indicates that the nuclear-cytoplasmic dynamics of YAP localization directs cell fate specification in the developing and adult respiratory epithelium of the mouse, and that YAP localization is regulated by the apical-basal dynamics of Crb3 and Par1b. We have uncovered a novel Par1b-induced posttranslational modification that directs YAP activity, providing a direct mechanism for how polarity proteins control YAP localization, and ultimately how polarity may govern cell fate. Our AIMS are to: 1) dissect the relationship between Par1b and YAP, and define how this affects respiratory epithelial progenitor cell fate; and 2) determine how the apica determinant Crb3 controls YAP localization and assess how the loss of Crb3 affects respiratory epithelial development and homeostasis. Taken together, our studies will provide insight in the mechanisms directing epithelial organization and define crucial signals linked to the onset of diseases, such as cancer. As such, we anticipate our work will generate promising leads for epithelial-related diseases, and will provide a framework for understanding fundamental developmental events."
"9275537","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Over the past 10 years human genetics studies made unprecedented numbers of discoveries relating genome variation to common diseases. While it is unquestionably true that we have learned substantially from the discoveries made to date, we must also acknowledge that with respect to the identification and characterization of the genome variation affecting risk of common human diseases - those accounting for the overwhelming majority of public health care expenditures - our discoveries have not generated nearly the knowledge of disease etiology that we would have expected given the sheer number of these discoveries. The combination of these observations coupled with the dramatic reduction in the cost of sequencing is driving the case for moving to whole genome sequencing studies for common disease. We have focused our application on three critical challenges for methods development and analysis of whole genome sequence data. While there has been substantial progress in methods development for analysis of exome sequencing, with gene-based tests that are relatively robust to the direction of effects of rare coding variants as well as the proportionof the gene's rare variants contributing to phenotype, it is clear that methods integrating the analysis of common and rare variation as well as functional genomics data will be essential for appropriate analysis of whole genome sequence data. Thus, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to develop novel methods, software and analysis pipelines for integrated analysis of common and rare variants for the analysis of whole genome sequence on 50,000- 100,000 individuals for any given common disease, and in Specific Aim 2 to develop and apply novel approaches for prioritizing results from these large-scale sequencing studies using BioVU, the 200,000 member biobank at Vanderbilt that is associated with 30 years of high quality electronic health records, and in Specific Aim 3 to develop queriable results databases and a comprehensive web portal to serve results of our studies on the sequence data for both the internal sequencing community and for the broader scientific community."
"9237064","PROJECT SUMMARY: Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease mainly characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and deteriorated bone quality/strength. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) may not only act as precursors of osteoclasts but also produce cytokines important for osteoclast differentiation and function, and thus represent major systemic cells for bone metabolism. DNA methylation as an important epigenetic regulator of gene expression may have significant and potentially sex-specific effects in the etiology of human complex diseases. However, the significance of global DNA methylation profiles underlying osteoporosis risk is largely unknown, particularly in males who suffer significantly higher mortality rate upon osteoporotic fractures than females. Our Hypothesis is that altered DNA methylation profiles in PBMs and the associated changes in gene expression and osteoclastogenesis contribute to variations in peak BMD and bone quality/strength in males. Our Goal/Expectation is to i) identify significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in PBMs associated with osteoporosis risk in Caucasian males; ii) assess the potential sex- and ethnic-generality/specificity of the significant DMRs; and iii) ascertain the DNA methylation mediated epigenetic mechanisms of osteoporosis, that is, how the DMRs regulate the expression of the target genes and subsequent osteoclastogenesis. We will accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) Identification and validation of DMRs significantly associated with peak BMD and bone quality/strength (QCT and FEA) in Caucasian males. We will perform PBM methylome profiling analyses with double restriction-enzyme reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (dRRBS) assays in 200 discordant Caucasian males (?Discovery cohort?) at peak bone mass ages of 20-30 years old, including half with high peak BMDs and the other half with low peak BMDs, and validate the most significant DMRs in both of the ?Discovery cohort? and an independent ?Replication cohort? of 200 Caucasian males discordant for peak BMDs. 2) Evaluation of the sex-, ethnic-, and maturation stage- generality/specificity of the significant DMRs/genes. The validated DMRs/target genes will be tested in three independent BMD-discordant samples, including a) 200 African American males, b) 160 Caucasian females, and c) 160 Chinese males, and d) in 1670 US children from the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study. 3) In-depth functional investigation of the roles of DMRs in regulating gene expression and osteoclastogenesis. We will identify the DMR-regulated target genes by correlating the DNA methylation and the mRNA expression levels of candidate target genes in the same sets of PBMs from the total 400 Caucasian males, and conduct in vitro cell-based assays to determine the contribution of DNA methylation at these DMRs in regulating target gene expression and subsequently influencing osteoclastogenesis. The results will reveal novel and fundamental insights into the general and sex-/ethnic-/development specific epigenetic mechanisms underlying osteoporosis. The knowledge gained may ultimately lead to novel approaches to better prevention and treatment of osteoporosis."
"9272856","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The favorable outcome of umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) is compromised by prolonged time to engraftment, delayed immunologic reconstitution and late memory T cell skewing. Zebrafish and mouse studies have shown that transient ex vivo prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) exposure increases HSC number, homing and engraftment in vivo. We performed a Phase Ib clinical trial of double UCBT (dUCBT), using one untreated and one ex vivo PGE2-treated UCB unit, to determine safety and engraftment parameters. We demonstrated a significant reduction in the median time to myeloid engraftment compared with historic controls, and PGE2- derived hematopoiesis. We determined, that short exposure to PGE2 induced stabilization of b-catenin in UCB T cells and dendritic cells (DCs). In UCB T cells PGE2 modified the Wnt signaling cascade through EP2/EP4 receptors and cAMP-mediated phosphorylation of Gsk3, resulting in stabilization of ?-catenin and TCF-mediated transcription. PGE2 induced Wnt target genes, including components of the Wnt pathway but also Wnt receptors, suggesting that ex vivo PGE2 treatment primes T cells for Wnt/?-catenin signaling in vivo. Wnt/?-catenin signaling in mice has been demonstrated to promote the generation of highly potent stem cell memory CD8+ T cells. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that T cells in PGE2-UCBT recipients displayed limited in vivo expansion, increase in CD62+ cell fraction in the CD8+ population and molecular features of central memory-like cells characterized by increased expression of transcription factors TCF7 and EOMES and low levels of KLRG, all of which are regulated by Wnt signaling. Furthermore, compared to control dUCBT recipients, PGE2-UCBT recipients had improved quantitative and qualitative thymic reconstitution as determined by TREC values and by immunoSEQ assay. These patients displayed potent antiviral immunity and reduced incidence of CMV and EBV viremia. These outcomes are of particular importance in allogeneic HSCT and specifically UCBT where delayed immune reconstitution is characterized by late memory T cell skewing and prolonged impairment of thymic function. Our clinical and laboratory findings suggest that the engrafting advantage of PGE2-treated HSC might allow for the use of a single UCB unit in adult patients, and that PGE2 might alter reconstitution of the innate and adaptive immunity by priming immune cells for Wnt mediated signaling in vivo. To these ends we will undertake the following studies to: 1) Determine the clinical outcome of single ex vivo PGE2 incubated UCB unit transplantation. 2) Examine the effect ex vivo PGE2 incubation of the UCB on the differentiation, polarization and function of T cells. 3) Examine the effects of ex vivo PGE2 incubation of the UCB on the molecular and functional properties of DC."
"9480398","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A series of five annual conferences is proposed that will: a) facilitate the exchange of information among researchers representing diverse approaches to the study of mathematical thinking and learning; b) provide a unique venue for sharing cutting edge findings, building new collaborations, designing innovative measures, and developing research agendas; c) welcome and promote the involvement of the next generation of researchers in this field by supporting the attendance of doctoral students and junior investigators, and d) disseminate the outcomes of these meetings in an edited book as well as a series of scholarly articles in special issues of leading scientific journals. These meetings, to begin in 2013, will cover a wide variety of critical topics ranging from the neurobiological substrates of basic numerical processing in vertebrates to testing the efficacy of cognitively-based instructional strategies for improving proficiency in arithmetic concepts and skills in children and adults with mathematical learning disabilities. Currently convening professional societies do not meet these goals because researchers who contribute most significantly to the study of mathematical learning and development do not belong to any single scientific or professional association. Furthermore, these investigators publish in a tremendously wide range of scholarly journals, reducing the likelihood of fully and consistently informing one another's work. This regrettable situation has impeded the timely development and communication of innovative research approaches, novel measures, and cutting edge theoretical developments. Consequently, bringing together top researchers from these diverse subfields is needed to advance more integrative approaches to studying the development, acquisition, and instruction of mathematical concepts and skills. The proposed series of conferences will provide a unique opportunity to achieve these objectives, producing a more comprehensive roadmap for future research, training, and improvements in instructional practices, as well as recruiting doctoral students and junior scientists into the field."
"9446072","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching aim of this grant from its inception in 1990 has been to use animal models to gain a better understanding of neuronal systems that may be dysfunctional in schizophrenia. The neuronal networks that we have focused on have included dopamine innervated regions, and the glutamatergic regulation of these regions. While studies supported by this grant and work by others have provided a number of potential novel targets for treating schizophrenia, the enthusiasm that we will discover treatments that will cure or even provide far more superior efficacy than current antipsychotic medications has been dampened by our increased appreciation of the complexity of genetic and non-genetic causes of schizophrenia. It is increasingly evident that, by the time the illness presents itself, he damage (the miswiring resulting in functional lesions) may be irreversible. Thus, one of our best chances for treating this illness is to prevent its progression. Specifically, the clinical fild has advanced toward identifying individuals at the prodromal phase of the illness who are at high risk for psychosis, the great majority of whom are adolescents or young adults, with the hope that appropriate interventions in these individuals will prevent transition to the psychotic illness. The efforts to design safe and mechanistically driven interventions, however, are hampered seriously by our poor knowledge of the neurobiology of the adolescent brain. The overarching aim of this application is to gain a better functional understanding of neuronal systems that may be relevant to adolescent vulnerability to develop schizophrenia. The experimental design is guided by complementary clinical findings in individuals at-risk (AR) for schizophrenia and our own basic findings in adolescent rats. Human imaging findings in AR individuals report that the onset of psychosis is preceded by abnormal presynaptic dopamine activity in the associational as opposed to ventral regions of striatum, and that this measure correlates with altered prefrontal cortex (PFC) function. Our animal studies identify key differences in presynaptic dopamine activity in the dorsal striatum, and in the processing of salient information in the dorsal striatum and PFC of adolescent compared to adult rats. Collectively, these parallel findings suggest that the disruption of cortical networks that regulat dopamine projections to cortical and dorsal regions of the striatum may be relevant to increased vulnerability to transition to psychosis. Given this, we propose the working hypothesis that midbrain dopamine systems, and their interactions with striatal and PFC areas, are regulated differently in adolescents compared to adults. We address this hypothesis at multiple levels of analysis by using state-of-the-art methods to compare local and global functions of dopamine neurons in adolescents and adult rats. Regardless of the outcome, the data generated by the proposed experiments will inform us about brain circuits that subserve affective and cognitive behaviors in adolescents, and will provide a platform for future investigations toward intervention strategies in AR individuals."
"9479828","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A revolution in technology has moved genetic studies forward at a remarkable pace over the last 5 years, and clear genetic contributions to smoking behavior have been identified. Our group was the first to report the association of nicotine dependence with the chromosome 15q25.1 region, which includes the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 cholinergic nicotine receptor subunit genes. The strongest genetic association findings for nicotine dependence, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease then converged to implicate this region. Our studies and several meta-analyses have convincingly shown that SNPs in the CHRNA6-CHRNB3 receptor subunits and nicotine metabolizing gene CYP2A6 are also associated with heavy smoking and nicotine dependence. The goal of this project is to further identify and characterize genetic findings for nicotine dependence and to integrate how these associations contribute to successful smoking cessation. Specific Aim 1 is to catalogue, characterize, and test identified variants and fine map nicotinic receptor genes and nicotine metabolizing genes. This aim will build upon custom targeted sequencing from the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) to catalogue variation in the nicotinic receptors and nicotine metabolizing genes in almost 3,000 nicotine dependent or non-dependent subjects. Specific Aim 2 is to evaluate genetic associations for nicotine dependence in large-scale studies, including our own replication sample and through participation in meta-analyses and consortia. Specific Aim 3 is to evaluate genetic associations for smoking cessation in large-scale studies. We will actively generate and participate in meta-analyses and consortia assessing smoking cessation related phenotypes, and we will also build upon our collaboration with Dr. Timothy Baker, who has data from smoking cessation trials along with phenotypic and genetic data from the Pfizer clinical trial of varenicline (Chantix(R)). This project will continueto accelerate the discovery of variation in molecular pathways that govern the development of nicotine dependence and extend our work toward the understanding of smoking cessation. By capitalizing on the resources and collaborations we have previously developed, this study will take an important next step along the cutting edge of genomic science and move the field to the next level of understanding the genetics of nicotine dependence and smoking cessation."

"9086767","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Development Award (K08) will enable the applicant to develop expertise designing and implementing studies using performance-based tasks as a methodological tool for investigating etiological processes that are not easily accessible via introspection. Alcohol is the most commonly used drug in adolescence, with higher levels of drinking being robustly associated with cannabis use (the second most used drug) and externalizing and internalizing problems. Dual-process models explain heterogeneity and co-morbidity of alcohol use by postulating individual differences in motivation and cognitive control as risk factors for problematic drinking Different theoretical perspectives have emerged; some construe motivation as individual differences in reinforcement sensitivity, others as drug-specific memory associations. Motivational and cognitive control risk factors have been shown to predict externalizing and internalizing psychopathology, and hence dual-process models can elucidate who is at risk for drinking, and why drinking frequently co-occurs with other drug use and externalizing/internalizing problems. This project will be the first to concurrently test alternatie conceptualizations of motivation in dual-process models, and to examine the multi- dimensional structure of cognitive control in dual-process models. A better understanding of specific mechanisms in the development of drinking can inform our theoretical understanding of addictions, and potentially lead to interventions that target idiosyncratic etiological mechanisms.  Training involves original data collection; 150 18-20 year olds are proposed to be sampled from a larger NIAAA funded project examining the development of drinking milestones. A battery of performance-based tasks will be administered to the sub- sample upon completion of participation in the larger study; tasks will measure different facets of motivation (reinforcement  sensitivity, drug specific memory associations) and cognitive control (set-shifting, inhibition, working memory capacity). Web-based survey methods will be used to provide a short-term prospective test of dual-process models as applied to: alcohol and cannabis use/problem use, and symptoms of externalizing and internalizing psychopathology. The association of alcohol involvement with cannabis use, and externalizing and internalizing symptoms is expected to be attenuated after accounting for shared etiological mechanisms. This research will lead to subsequent R01 grant applications involving: 1) different pathways to the initiation of drinking, 2 the emergence of alcohol and cannabis use disorders in late-adolescence/young adulthood, and 3) transdiagnostic etiological models of alcoholism and psychopathology. This K08 will train the applicant for an independent research career in the field of addictions by expanding the breadth and depth of my programmatic line of research."
"9346956","Project Summary: In severely resource-limited rural settings, scale-up of services to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV (EMTCT) has failed to provide effective HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage for women in highest prevalence southern African regions. All HIV-infected pregnant women are now eligible for life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART), regardless of CD4+ cell count (Option B+) but retention among women enrolled through Option B+ programs remains sub-optimal. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) it is common for women to require male partner approval to access and remain engaged in HIV-related health services. Despite the likelihood that male involvement would improve program coverage and adherence, the evidence base for effective interventions to involve male partners in HIV testing and treatment through ANC point of care is very limited. Furthermore, whether such strategies are indeed cost-effective for improving outcomes of HIV- diagnosis and treatment in pregnancy is unknown. Our proposal seeks to address these key gaps in the evidence base and guide scale-up by evaluating a promising male engagement intervention (?Homens para Saúde? (HoPS)+ [Men for Health]) targeting EMTCT in Mozambique through a clinic-randomized trial. We will engage 24 ANC clinics; 12 intervention and 12 standard of care, with 40 HIV-infected couples per clinic where currently >60% of couples attend their first ANC visit together. The planned intervention addresses social- structural and cultural factors influencing EMTCT through the creation of couples-centered integrated HIV services, including: (1) ANC-based couples HIV testing, ART enrollment, and care for sero-concordant HIV+ expectant couples; (2) Couple-based treatment in the post-partum period; (3) Couple-based education and skills building; and (4) Treatment continuity with the support of expert-patient (peer) supporters from couples who have successfully navigated EMTCT. Given that 8.0% of all pregnant women and 7.2% of their partners tested HIV-positive during ANC visits in 2015 (FGH monitoring and evaluation [M&E] data), our pioneering work in Mozambique's rural Zambézia province suggests that innovative strategies are essential to engaging HIV-infected male partners in antenatal care (ANC) in order to achieve EMTCT and to improve substantially the health of the mothers. Our team of Mozambican and U.S. investigators has a proven record of international HIV research success and we have specific recent experience with EMTCT cluster randomized trials, male-engagement in ANC services, and cost-effectiveness analysis of HIV programs. The specific aims of this study are: (1) To implement and evaluate the impact of male-engaged, couples-centered services on retention in care, adherence to ART, and early infant diagnosis among HIV+ pregnant women and their HIV+ male partners through a cluster-randomized RCT; (2) To investigate the impact of HoPS+ on hypothesized mechanisms of change; and (3) To use validated simulation models to evaluate cost-effectiveness of the HoPS+ intervention with the use of programmatic provincial M&E data and data from our trial results."
"9272429","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited access to care is a major contributor to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and unintended pregnancy for U.S. adolescents and contributes to significant health disparities, including rates of STIs that are 6-7 times higher for uninsured youths than for insured youths. Racial/ethnic disparities also exist, with African American and Hispanic adolescents evidencing    pregnancy rates that are 4 times higher than White youths. The emergency department (ED) represents an important but underutilized location for reaching large numbers of sexually at-risk adolescents with limited access to evidence-based care and there is growing support for use of the ED to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes. Because few proven interventions are available in the ED to motivate youth to safer sexual behavior and provide health services (e.g., STI testing, condoms), novel interventions are needed. Dr. Miller, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and the candidate for this Career Development Award, is committed    to conducting patient-oriented behavioral research to improve adolescent health outcomes, focusing on underserved communities. Together with a strong multi-disciplinary mentorship team, Dr. Miller has created a four-year career development plan which includes structured mentoring, completion of a Master of Science in Clinical Research, and focused training in the use of health behavior change theories to develop multi-level interventions, research methods and statistical analyses for behavioral intervention trials, effective counseling strategies for health behavior change, health care system and payment models, and responsible conduct of    research. Dr. Miller's training activities will be complemented by an innovative project that will facilitate practical application of these new skills. The goal of the project is to enhance and tes a previously piloted ED SexHealth intervention that uses a dedicated health educator to provide risk reduction counseling, point-of care health services, and referral for ongoing care. Following intervention refinement, Dr. Miller will conduct a randomized trial of the enhanced intervention versus a standard information arm to determine the effect size of rates of health service uptake and enhanced intervention feasibility. We hypothesize that the intervention will result in higher health service uptake and increased condom use versus a standard information arm. The    rationale is that it will produce the first controlled data on an intervention designed to improve adolescent sexual health outcomes using a novel and effective method of delivering care. We expect to use these critical effect size estimates to inform the design of a larger clinical trial o evaluate efficacy. Dr. Miller's training efforts will culminate in the submission of an R01 proposa to fund this trial. This training and research plan are consistent with the mission of the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Healthy People 2020 objectives from the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and the 2009 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference."

"9401969","Project Summary Mucosal barriers and innate immune responses protect us from invasive infection by many non-pathogenic bacteria. However, certain bacterial pathogens have evolved strategies to cross mucosal barriers and consequently establish severe, life-threatening systemic infections. Our studies have revealed a weak link in the innate immune response that we hypothesize is exploited by these pathogens during their establishment of systemic disease. These recent studies implicate natural killer (NK) cells as a major source of interleukin (IL)- 10 production during systemic infection by the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. IL-10 is a cytokine that many pathogenic bacteria exploit during the establishment of severe infection. It was not previously appreciated that NK cells are the major source of ?pro-bacterial? IL-10 production. We further found that a secreted L. monocytogenes bacterial virulence protein, p60, promotes NK cell IL-10 production by stimulating dendritic cells (DC) to produce IL-18 and other essential factors. Our studies here address mechanisms by which these factors coordinate NK cell activation to produce IL-10. We also investigate the impact of NK cell IL-10 on the ability of these pathogens to cross different mucosal barriers to establish systemic disease. The mechanistic information obtained through these studies may reveal strategies to promote or inhibit NK cell IL-10 production to improve human health."
"9353022","Abstract: Imaging Core The Imaging Core of the Chronic HIV Infection, Aging and NeuroAIDS (CHAIN) Center consists of two laboratories, the Preclinical Imaging Laboratory (M. Boska, Co-PI) and the Human Structural and Functional Neuroimaging Laboratory (T. Wilson, Co-PI). The primary goals of the Core are to support CHAIN PIs and other neuroAIDS investigators in the identification and quantification of HIV-related alterations in brain function, structure, and metabolism, and to aid in understanding how emerging therapeutics modulate brain function to ameliorate and/or reverse these HIV-related alterations. Discovery of neural biomarkers of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) and the basic mechanisms of HIV-related brain injury remains a high priority, with 35-70% of all HIV-infected patients developing HAND in the post cART era. Surprisingly, despite this persistently high prevalence, there are currently no diagnostic tests or any specific biomarkers that can precisely pinpoint HAND, be used to monitor disease progression, or as an assay of an emerging treatment?s beneficial effects. The CHAIN Imaging Core has been designed for biomarker discovery and optimization, as the same imaging assessments can be performed in parallel in animal models and human trials. Such a parallel approach allows bidirectional feedback between animal and human studies, and will enhance abilities to diagnosis, monitor, and predict HAND in humans, while providing targets for detailed histological and biochemical studies of the underlying mechanisms. Alterations will be assessed with regard to age, viral status, sex, drug treatment, and effects of drugs of abuse. In short, this Core will use animal models of HIV-infection to provide noninvasive imaging indicators of altered neuronal function and neurotoxicity, and investigate the biochemical mechanisms of these functional abnormalities in collaboration with the Omics Core. Potential biomarkers of altered function can then be tested in humans in the Imaging Core using advanced structural and functional imaging in collaboration with the Developmental Core. Conversely, as functional deficits are detected in human studies, regions identified as demonstrating abnormal neuronal function can be targeted for more thorough investigation in animal studies to (1) replicate the findings using similar imaging methodologies in a better controlled model (e.g., without lifestyle issues) and (2) investigate the cellular and biochemical source(s) of these functional abnormalities in collaboration with the Omics Core and the Cell, Tissue, and Animal Core. These studies will provide new diagnostic capabilities, uncover the biochemical and functional deficits associated with HAND, and allow monitoring of the effects of new therapies on brain biochemistry and function in animals and humans."
"9482033","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Craniofacial microsomia (CFM) involves the asymmetric underdevelopment of facial skeletal bones and soft tissue and occurs in over 1 in 3500 births. Typically affecting the jaw and ear, CFM impairs basic functions such as hearing, speech, respiration, and/or chewing, in addition to its aesthetic effects. It can be life- threatening due to airway compromise. Animal models of teratogenesis have demonstrated a relationship between the features of CFM and vascular disruption (bleeding, clotting, or disruption of blood vessel formation). The only large epidemiologic study of CFM showed associations with maternal exposures that influence the risk of bleeding or clotting, such as pseudoephedrine use and cigarette smoking during pregnancy. CFM-like features have also been observed together with disrupted vasculogenesis in animals lacking genes related to the activities of retinoic acid (a transcription factor) and endothelin (a vasoconstrictor). Common variation in such genes could alter their activity and thereby influence the risk of CFM. Our specific aims are to address the vascular disruption hypothesis of CFM etiology by assessing its association with variation in candidate genes involved in vasculogenesis and hemostasis. We will implement a novel case-parent triad hybrid approach that incorporates data from control parents. We will extract and amplify DMA from existing buccal specimens banked as part of a multicenter case-control study of CFM (172 case-parent and 382 control-parent sets). We will perform single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery in genes related to retinoic acid activity by resequencing two sample populations. We will select tagSNPs that comprehensively characterize the variation in each of these and other candidate genes (totaling 19) involved in the activities of retinoic acid, endothelin, and thrombin, a key coagulation factor. We will genotype cases, their parents, and the parents of controls by using a high-throughput genotyping platform. We will estimate the association between CFM and offspring and maternal genotypes by fitting log-linear models and perform gene-wide tests of significance. Combining data from case-parent triads and parental controls allows one to capitalize on the advantages offered by the two different study designs and test assumptions of the log-linear model. Epidemiologic, clinical, and teratology studies have strongly supported the vascular disruption hypothesis for CFM. However, further research is necessary to elucidate the pathogenic processes involved in the vascular etiologies of this condition. The proposed research addresses this gap in knowledge through a state-of-the-art tagSNP approach. This will be the first molecular epidemiologic study of CFM. The results of our proposed research could lead to the development of interventions that reduce CFM incidence. The findings should also improve understanding of craniofacial development."

"9292229","SUMMARY, Core E The primary goal of the Outreach, Retention and Education Core (OREC) is to identify, recruit, enroll, and retain patients (of certain diagnostic types and racial/ethnic backgrounds) and healthy controls into the Stanford ADRC. We target patients with mild Alzheimer s dementia (AD); amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI); mild-to-moderate Parkinson s disease (PD) without MCI or dementia; PD with MCI; dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) of no greater than mild dementia severity and mild-to-moderate parkinsonism, as well as patients with other disorders as needed to fill specific research needs of the Center; and age-equivalent older adults without cognitive impairment or parkinsonism. We are targeting 20% enrollment of Hispanic/Latino patients from these diagnostic categories over the life of this project. We will begin recruitment of American Indian elders in the third year with their target being 5% of total new enrollment. Fulfillment of this primary aim will be facilitated by use of innovative strategies, in collaboration with academic and community-based partners (e.g., Stanford Geriatric Education Center; Palo Alto Medical Foundation; Alzheimer s Association; American Parkinson Disease Association; and the Indian Health Center of Santa Clara Valley). Our efforts start with the caregiver who will be recruited with the patient, to participate in educational and stress reducing programs that will vary according to diagnosis and /ethnic/linguistic factors. They will be introduced to tools such as Fotonovelas and webnovelas, which are available to assist Hispanic/Latino families to understand the dementias and to deal with caregiver-related stress. In addition, we plan to train Promotoras (indigenous health workers) in case-finding methods and screening for dementia. Additional OREC aims include: to build and strengthen research capacity of our community-based partners; to provide state-of-the-art training to medical students, residents, and Fellows, as well as medical and allied health professionals who work with patients with AD, MCI, PD and other targeted diagnostic categories and families (particularly Hispanic/Latino and American Indian); and to collaborate with other Cores (Admninistrative, Clinical, Neuropathology, and Biostatistics) to further overall Center recruitment and retention goals. Evaluation of our effectiveness at reaching these aims will be guided by a Logic Model approach developed for this Core, which includes measurement of primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes and uses approaches that incorporate both quantitative and qualitative methods. Taken together, these methods and measures will provide rich data for guiding future Core directions. Secondary aims include conducting qualitative research with Hispanic/Latino and American Indian patients and caregivers to understand facilitators and barriers to full participation in the Center, emphasizing culturally - based attitudes towards autopsy/ brain donation and gaining insight to guide future research. In addition, caregiver questionnaire data will be collected to assess depressive symptoms and perceived burden, to understand better how the impact of caregiving may differ across the different groups we are studying."
"9353020","DEVELOPMENTAL CORE Abstract The Developmental Core is committed to accelerating the growth of neuroAIDS investigators by supporting innovative and collaborative research, particularly between basic and clinical investigators; conducting a robust, peer-reviewed pilot grant program; assisting in the mentoring and establishment of new/junior investigators; supporting the transition of established investigators to HIV, aging, and neuroAIDS work; and promoting formation of multidisciplinary teams involving both early-career and senior investigators in cutting- edge issues emerging in HIV, aging, and CNS research. In this renewal application, we propose an innovative approach - pairing junior investigators with experienced senior investigators to form mentor-mentee teams that will meet regularly, participate in a workshop on career development, and present their work at the annual CHAIN retreat. We realize that for this approach to succeed, having a pool of skilled volunteer mentors is critical. One important aspect will be to leverage this with ongoing mentoring programs at University of Nebraska Medical Center such as the Faculty Mentoring Program for mentees and mentors and the ?Women?s Mentoring Program (WMP)? the mission of which is to promote and nurture the careers of early-stage women scientists. It must be clarified that the focus of this core is not to exclusively foster the careers of only ?women scientists,? but we are cognizant that increased mentoring is necessary in the current climate of research training and career advancement. We will significantly expand our mentoring capacities to take advantage of all opportunities and sources of expertise. While the CHAIN Developmental Core has a broad mission, its primary goal remains to support and entice investigators from other disciplines into the HIV/aging arena. Applications will undergo rigorous peer review and will be prioritized on the basis of scientific merit, translational relevance, emerging concepts that are high risk/high payoff, addressing key scientific problems like HIV and aging, HIV infection in women, and new biomedical approaches to prevention. Our previous successes support our likelihood for success, and the additional funds procured from UNMC will greatly enhance our ability to enable these investigators to successfully enter the field."
"9277722","CANCER INFORMATICS CORE SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Cancer Informatics Core (CIC) was established to meet the growing needs for informatics support of biomedical research. The overall objective of the core is to facilitate biomedical and translational research at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) by providing methods and tools to record, integrate, manage, analyze, and visualize various biomedical, behavioral, and clinical data. This objective is met by providing high-quality informatics services through innovative systems developed to access and analyze MCC and VCU biomedical data. CIC services include consultation, data integration and honest broker services, feasibility assessment, and cohort identification. These services rely on the CIC Universal Data Store (UDS), which consists of linked data from VCU Health?s various clinical-related data systems including electronic medical records (EMR), scheduling, billing, and claims systems, as well as data from the VCU Cancer Registry and the Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. The CIC staff use off-the-shelf tools when possible, as well as innovative custom-built applications to perform their research-related services. Custom- built systems include analyst toolsets for navigating the data in the Massey Data Analysis System (MDAS) and the Clinical Trials Eligibility Database (CTED) software suite, which grew out of the commercially unmet need for a clinical trials patient identification and screening tool. These tools are based on community standards, are designed for interoperability, extensibility and scalability, and follow the highest standards with respect to patient security and privacy. CIC?s most frequent users are investigators from MCC?s clinical trial enterprise requesting feasibility assessments and patient cohort identifications. CIC closely collaborates with the Biostatistics Shared Resource on study design and data quality monitoring, as well as on bioinformatics projects. The CIC routinely supports the Tissue and Data Acquisition and Analysis Core (TDAAC) by regularly providing annotations for the banked biospecimens and by supporting a dynamic inventory dashboard. To support MCC?s efforts in precision medicine, the CIC closely collaborates with bioinformaticians at the Center for Clinical and Translational Research and the VCU Clinical Genomics Laboratory. In CY2015, the CIC expertise was utilized in 130 research projects involving members from all 4 research programs. The supported projects were led by 36 investigators. The CIC is directed by Tamas S. Gal, PhD, and is supported by 6 FTEs. The CIC is an MCC-managed resource. Employees are available for consultation by appointment between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. Certified users have access to CIC's online resources 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. CIC services add value to the research of MCC members as the services cannot practically obtained through alternative vendors."
"9325231","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Aging and Mechanisms of Aging-Related Disease, organized by Drs. Kazuo Tsubota, Shin-ichiro Imai, Matt Kaeberlein and Joan Mannick. The conference will be held in Yokohama, Japan from May 15-19, 2017. Populations are aging rapidly worldwide, particularly in Asia, driving a strong interest in aging/longevity research. This conference will capture the cutting-edge front of this exciting field of science, covering essential aspects of aging/longevity research, including critical signaling pathways and regulators, inter-tissue communication, stem cells, stress and damage responses, cellular senescence, physiological rhythms, human genetics and mental well-being (happiness). Because aging is a systemic phenomenon, it is important to address various layers of the aging/longevity- controlling hierarchy, particularly focusing on metabolic regulation, including mitochondria, NAD+, oxidative stress, inflammation, protein homeostasis, autophagy and many other age-associated pathophysiologies. The outcome of these studies needs to be translated to resolve social and economic issues caused by rapidly aging societies. Novel therapeutic and preventive interventions have been explored and developed as a growing attempt to meet the needs of our aging societies. These new aspects of aging/longevity research and the gaps in knowledge between the basic science and practical applications will also be covered in the conference. There is a growing body of evidence that our modern lifestyle, such as the heavy use of blue light in smart phones and tablet computers, affects physiological rhythms and metabolism, promoting age- associated diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and depression. Therefore, it is now time to think differently about what we can do to deal with all these problems in light of recent progress in this exciting field of science."
"9285805","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Program Project Grant brings together seven principal investigators committed to understanding the principles by which RNA molecules fold into their biologically active structures. The proposal comprises four Projects and a Resource Core, all bound together by a central hypothesis: RNA folding can be understood and eventually predicted from a reductionist perspective. RNA looked like a simple messenger in the early days of structural and molecular biology. The last two decades have demonstrated diverse biological, chemical, and physical roles of RNA, and yet our mechanistic understanding remains limited. Deep investigation of the physical behavior of RNA will enable a full description of gene expression and its control. In particular, a predictive and quantitative understanding will catalyz rational RNA engineering at the molecular and systems biology levels and ultimately facilitate rational therapeutic interventions that target or involve RNA. Our component projects build from simple to complex. Project 1 studies the ion atmosphere that surrounds simple helices and uses an integrated experimental-computational feedback loop to develop an understanding of electrostatics, the largest and most general force influencing the behavior and interactions of RNA. Project 2 focuses on helix-junction-helix motifs, the building blocks of RNA tertiary structure. We will develop and apply novel experimental and analytical approaches to fully describe the conformational ensemble for these elements. Project 3 determines the conformational ensembles of RNAs in their unfolded, folded, and intermediate states and defines the energetics of the transitions between these states. We will compare the behaviors of P4-P6 RNA and RNA/protein complexes to the behavior predicted from the properties of their elements, as delineated from Project 2. We thereby directly test the hypothesis that the energetics and behavior of complex RNAs can be understood from the 'sum of their parts', a hypothesis that if true, will lead to a general ability to predict RNA folding and energetics. Projct 4 builds on the reductionist framework developed in the other projects to now address RNA folding kinetics, testing quantitative predictions and developing novel systematic approaches to dissect the influence of co-transcription folding. Together, these studies will uncover basic properties and behaviors that define the physical, chemical, and biological behavior of RNA and catalyze a transformation from a descriptive to quantitative predictive understanding of RNA."
"9276481","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Somatosensory neurons project peripheral axons to the skin early in development to detect touch stimuli. Although the cutaneous terminals of these axons are often a proportionally small component of the total peripheral axon length, they are critical for function, since they are the sites where touch stimuli are first detected. Cutaneous axon endings are particularly vulnerable to damage by injury, diabetes, and inherited syndromes, notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases. All of these conditions cause debilitating peripheral neuropathies characterized by chronic pain or the inability to sense touch. Characterizing how cutaneous sensory endings are formed, maintained, and respond to injury is thus essential for understanding these conditions and developing effective treatments. We have developed a larval zebrafish model to study the development of somatosensory peripheral axons and the skin cells that they innervate. Because zebrafish larvae are fertilized externally, develop rapidly, and are optically clear, the zebrafish somatosensory system offers unparalleled experimental access to the early stages of skin innervation. By contrast, studying these cutaneous sensory terminals in mammals is challenging, since they develop in utero and their complete three-dimensional structures are difficult to visualize. Most anatomical and molecular features of somatosensory axon territories in the skin are well conserved from fish to mammals, making zebrafish a relevant model for uncovering potential disease mechanisms. Our studies of the past few years have revealed that skin cells play several critical roles in the development, repair and function of somatosensory axon terminals in the skin. The goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize the molecular dialogues between axons and skin cells that regulate the establishment and maintenance of somatosensory axon territories. Using a unique and powerful set of molecular techniques and transgenic tools that we have developed in recent years, we will investigate three questions about the nature of axon/skin interactions during specific stages of somatosensory neuron ontogeny. First, how are sensory axons guided to the skin? Second, once in the skin how do axons become structurally associated with skin cells? And third, how does the skin respond to axon damage and contribute to repair? We will address these questions with a powerful combination of live imaging, embryology and molecular perturbations. Collectively, these studies will provide the first molecular insight into the regulation of several newly discovered functions of skin cells in the development and maintenance of the somatosensory system."
"9416725","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 1) Study Objectives: Our study will examine the individual and joint impacts of air quality and lifestyle on cardiovascular and cognitive health in the elderly and will assess whether these impacts are modified by social and neighborhood factors using data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative, on-going, longitudinal survey of the elderly. NSHAP data include participant-specific information on a variety of demographic, health, social, psychological, and physiological markers, including residence location, health biomarkers, mobility, social connectedness, stress, health status, and cognitive function. These factors were assessed for each participant in two waves, in 2005-2006 and in 2011. We will link NSHAP data to daily and monthly PM2.5, ozone, temperature exposures that will be estimated using well- validated GIS- and satellite-based spatio-temporal models. In so doing, we will create a progressive, detailed and comprehensive record of the exposure, health, and well-being of each participant. We will use these data to achieve four aims: to (1) examine the relationship among air quality, lifestyle, emotional, physical, and functional health; (2) assess whether short term air pollution and temperature exposures are associated with increased blood pressure and c-reactive protein; (3) evaluate relationships between long-term air quality and impaired cognitive function and stress, and (4) investigate whether the cardiovascular and cognitive function response to air pollution is modified by social, neighborhood, and health factors. 2) Study Approach: We will compile individual-specific health, lifestyle and health data for over 3,000 NSHAP participants living across the US. We will link these data to neighborhood characteristics and to daily and monthly air pollutant exposures and temperature estimated using GIS-based spatio-temporal models. We will test our aims using our linked health, lifestyle, neighborhood, and exposure data and standard and novel data analysis methods, including multi-level mixed models, kernel regression machine, mediation analyses, and hierarchical regression techniques, controlling for confounders and multiple testing adjustment. Primary analyses will be performed for air pollution and temperature measures. 3) Expected Results: We will provide new, national evidence of air quality- and lifestyle-mediated risks of poor cardiovascular and cognitive health for our nation's elderly, a large and growing population who may be particularly susceptible to air pollution exposures, extreme temperatures, and social stressors. Results will help to assess susceptibility to pollution and climate change and determine important biological and sociological pathways through which air quality damages cardiovascular and cognitive health. In so doing, our study will help decision-makers address margin of safety issues, examine the individual and joint impacts of air pollution, climate change, and lifestyle on an aging US population, and design intervention strategies to reduce these risks."

"9481461","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Superfund Research Program at The University of Iowa (ISRP) is a joint endeavor involving basic, mechanistic, and applied research projects in biomedical and environmental research areas addressing semi- volatile polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The overall goal of the ISRP is to identify atmospheric sources, exposures, and potential consequences to human health of semi-volatile PCBs. To achieve this goal, the ISRP addresses volatilization, transport and resultant exposure of lower halogenated PCBs, especially those PCBs that are associated with contaminated waters, former industrial sites, and buildings (especially school buildings). We plan to identify routes of exposure with an eye to preventing or limiting exposure and ameliorating the effects. The ISRP brings together 17 scientists, representing 7 departments in 5 colleges, and two universities. Working together, we will measure sources, transport and environmental exposure of PCBs (Projects 4 and 6); their distribution, metabolism and toxicity in animals and humans (Projects 1, 3 and 7); and novel methods of phytoremediation (Project 5). Proposed studies include a community-based participatory research project-an of exposures to citizens who live or work in the vicinity of sources of lower chlorinated PCBs in the Chicago Metropolitan area. We enjoy the cooperation of citizen groups in Chicago, IL and East Chicago, IN where many ethnic-minority citizens are living below the poverty line near de- industrialized sites. Our research projects and overall efficiency are supported by six cores: Administration, Synthesis, Analytical, Training, Research Translation and Community Engagement - which assist the projects in coordination, information transfer, design and analysis of experiments, and assessment of research. The Synthesis Core synthesizes all compounds/mixtures to be studied, while the Analytical Core provides critical compositional information from metabolism to movement. Community Engagement and Research Translation Cores transmit research findings to a variety of stakeholders and involve those stakeholders in research activities. A Training Core and the research projects provide for the training of 16 students and postdoctoral scholars each year (70 have been trained in the previous funding period). The assessment / evaluation process culminates in an annual meeting of our 8-member External Advisory Committee. Overall this multidisciplinary program brings a broad range of experience and expertise, and institutional resources, to bear on problems associated with Superfund chemicals that are critical to the Midwest and the nation."
"9270562","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latina paradox is robust, but not uniformly protective against adverse pregnancy outcomes. Latinas are at risk for poor birth outcomes like inappropriate weight gain, pregnancy-induced hypertension / eclampsia, and inappropriate gestational weight gain. Despite work indicating the importance of country of origin (nativity) for Latina health, minimal work has explored the role of nativity. Documentation status- another source of social stress- also differs across subgroups with implications for POs. Further, Latinas, particularly undocumented women, tend to reside in under-resourced neighborhoods, which puts them at risk for higher rates of food insecurity and increased risk of adverse POs. Our long-term goal is to develop successful interventions to promote the reproductive health of Latina women and their children over the life-course. The objective of this study is to identify how nativity and documentation status shape adverse PO (inappropriate maternal weight gain, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)/eclampsia, PTB, term BW, small for gestational age (SGA)) and how the residential context exacerbates risk for adverse health. To accomplish this objective, we are partnering with Multnomah County Health Department (MCHD) to analyze data from the Citizen Alien Waived Emergent Medical (CAWEM) Plus program. It provides prenatal care to Medicaid-ineligible women including undocumented Latinas. Linking CAWEMPlus undocumented status with geocoded MCHD birth records (2009- 2014), we will undertake the following specific aims: Aim 1: Identify associations between nativity, documentation status and POs (inappropriate weight gain, PIH/eclampsia, PTB, term BW, SGA) among Latinas. The working hypotheses are that (a) foreign-born Latinas will have better POs than native-born; and (b) among the foreign-born, documented Latinas will have the most positive POs. Aim 2: Characterize the residential context (poverty level, food access) of documented versus undocumented Latina women. The working hypothesis is that undocumented Latina women live in higher poverty neighborhoods characterized by an unhealthy food environment (more fast food, fewer grocery stores). Aim 3: Identify joint effects of nativity, documentation status and neighborhood context on POs among Latina women. The working hypothesis is that among Latinas, neighborhood context mediates the relationship between nativity and immigration status and MCH outcomes. Summary: Aim 1 will allow us to disentangle the independent effects of nativity and immigration status on MCH outcomes; Aim 2 will help clarify the role of neighborhood context in shaping risk for adverse Latina outcomes; and Aim 3 will specify differential area-induced vulnerabilities by nativity and documentation status. Impact: The results from the completion of this community-based participatory research project will inform program and policy interventions designed to improve Latina health. Further, disentangling the effects of nativity from documentation status can refine our intervention efforts to target the most vulnerable women to reduce maternal and child health disparities."
"9480133","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco and alcohol often are used simultaneously by young adults, and their co-use is associated with greater likelihood of a dependence diagnosis in adulthood, disease, and eventual death from both substances. With wide reach and engagement among users, social media offer phenomenal opportunities to engage young people in an intervention for tobacco use and heavy drinking, and to foster socially supportive communities in which individuals can help each other reduce risky behaviors and maintain these changes over time. Preliminary work by our group has shown that young adults have an interest in using Facebook to quit smoking and that an intervention tailored to readiness to quit would be well received. Funded with a career development award from NIDA, the Principal Investigator has developed the Facebook Tobacco Status Project (TSP), a motivationally-tailored smoking cessation intervention for young adults based on US Clinical Practice Guidelines, and we have strong preliminary results. The present study seeks to determine whether adding an alcohol component (TSP +ALC) can lead to improved individual or combined tobacco and heavy episodic drinking (HED) outcomes among young adults who engage in both health risk behaviors. Phase I will develop TSP+ALC based on focus groups with young adults who smoke and have HED (5+ drinks for men, 4+ for women), the existing TSP, US Clinical Practice Guidelines for smoking cessation, and National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for changing alcohol use. We will then use Facebook to recruit and conduct usability testing with 30 young adults who use tobacco and alcohol and revise the intervention according to feedback received. Phase II will evaluate, in a pilot randomized trial, the feasibilit and initial efficacy of TSP+ALC compared to TSP, with 160 US young adults recruited online. Young adults who smoke and have HED will be randomized to receive TSP or TSP+ALC. Both interventions will assign participants to a private Facebook group tailored to their readiness to quit tobacco and deliver a 90 day intervention including Facebook postings and weekly The Dr. Is In sessions with a trained counselor to guide group sessions. All participants will be offered  2-week introductory supply of nicotine patch. Participants will complete baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months follow-up assessments online. The primary outcome will be biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence at each timepoint. Secondary outcomes include days of HED, dependence symptoms, readiness to quit, and thoughts about abstinence for smoking and HED. Facebook data will determine patterns of engagement, types of posts that attract the most and quickest user activities, and the relationship between user activity and tobacco use and HED in each group. Results will be used to design a randomized clinical trial powered to detect significant effects across groups. This line of research will inform new digital substance use interventions for young adults with great potential for cost-effectiveness and widespread dissemination."

I have devoted my research career to understand mechanisms, nature and time-course of white matter pathology in schizophrenia. I am an Associate Professor in Departments of Radiology and Psychiatry at Brigham and Women?s Hospital, Harvard Medical School. I also serve as Associate Director of Psychiatry Neuroimaging Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry at BWH, and as a co-Director of Center for Morphometric Analysis, Department of Psychiatry, and Massachusetts General Hospital, where I have a secondary appointment as research scientist. I have been conducting an NIH sponsored research since 2003, when I received my first R03 award. I am currently PI on an NIMH R01 award, focusing on Development of New Neuroimaging Biomarkers of Risk, Onset and Outcome of Schizophrenia. I am also a PI on NIA funded R01 on understanding mechanisms of brain development, maturation and aging through a set of neuroimaging tools and their validation in rhesus monkeys. Those two grants together have the potential of delivering validated neuroimaging biomarkers, which could be used to diagnose and monitor neurobiological changes due to myelin loss and neuroinflammation in schizophrenia, aging, and a whole list of other neuropsychiatric diseases where those changes are involved. Besides my research, I am also involved in mentoring Harvard, MIT and BU undergraduate and graduate thesis students, postdoctoral fellows (including T32 and K23 awardees), foreign fellows, and summer students. I am also involved in administrative work, as head of two large laboratories, at BWH and at MGH, and various local and regional committees. Finally, I am getting involved in nonclinical and non-POR research (through my ongoing and pending animal projects), and that takes away from both my mentoring and my POR research. The K24 would protect time and help me to focus on most important for my career development- mentoring (30%), further training and new POR (20%), while devoting remaining 50% to ongoing neuroimaging research in biomarkers of white matter changes in aging and schizophrenia."
"9317515","Non-heritable risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental delay (DD) include maternal conditions associated with metabolic dysregulation, most notably pre-pregnancy obesity, excessive gestational weight gain, and complications associated with poor metabolic health, including chronic and gestational forms of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S., with more than half of pregnant women overweight or obese. Racial and socioeconomic disparities are profound. The proposed research plan will explore physiological characteristics of maternal obesity that may be involved in neurodevelopmental compromise in a non-human primate model. We will compare inflammatory and metabolic changes to the gestational milieu in obese and normal-weighted mothers, as well as histologic and epigenetic modifications to the placenta and infant brain. Additionally, we will evaluate the effectiveness of two maternal intervention strategies, gestational weight maintenance and daily administration of the pharmacologic agent pravastatin through pregnancy, in reversing the effects of maternal obesity on the maternal and placental environments. Weight management has been recommended by both the Institute of Medicine and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for management of obesity in pregnancy, and the pharmacological properties of pravastatin provide biological plausibility for its use in preventing the systemic, placental and fetal consequences of maternal obesity. This proposal strives to utilize fully the unique resources inherent in the third trimester rhesus monkey model to address this serious clinical problem with substantial public health impact. Our interdisciplinary team weaves the expertise of investigators with extensive collaborative experience in maternal health and fetal development, reproductive physiology, nutrition, immunology, epigenetics, metabolomics, lipomics, biostatistics and neurodevelopment in both humans and non-human primates. The specific aims of the project will: 1) explore the physiologic effects of maternal obesity that underlie neurodevelopmental impairment and 2) determine whether two interventional strategies will prevent the effects of maternal obesity. The outcome of these studies will have direct translational value by informing women and their health providers of the risks of maternal obesity to the developing brain and will provide information on preventive options to help obese women and their health care providers lessen risk for their babies."
"9480161","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Training Program, Mechanisms of Hypertension and Cardiovascular Diseases, Suzanne Oparil, MD, PD/PI, offers multidisciplinary postdoctoral training in fundamental aspects of the pathophysiology of hypertension and related cardiovascular disease (CVD), in innovative approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions and in translating basic and clinical research findings to the population level. This Training Program advances the spectrum of available training in the following Thematic Focus Areas: Basic Science (fundamental training in mechanisms of inflammatory vascular injury and repair and oxidative stress/free radical injury; T0); Translational Science (translation-to-humans,  early clinical trials, testing basic science discoveries for clinical applicability; T1-T2) Clinica Science (research to improve knowledge of new therapies, medical applications and clinical interventions; T2-T3), and Population Science (clinical trials to wide-spread evidence-based practice that improves the overall public health; T3-T4).  Faculty Mentors offer training in these rapidly evolving research areas: behavioral, epidemiologic and population/prevention research, state-of-the-art clinical trials, comparative effectiveness research, biostatistics/quantitative sciences, genomics, health disparities research, other-Omics, and regenerative and reparative medicine. Trainees will have a 2-3 year experience in laboratory, clinical/translational or population- based research under the mentorship of T32 Program Faculty Mentors. Trainees will spend at least 80% of time in investigation, coursework, and in career development activities. The goal of this Program is to prepare trainees for careers in fundamental, clinical, translational and population-based research in hypertension and CVD. The educational experiences available to our trainees will equip them with the technical skills and theoretical background needed to make them competitive for faculty positions in prestigious academic institutions, in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry or in health care delivery research.  An  important goal of this Training Program is to build productive, efficient, and cutting edge interdisciplinary research and training programs. Thus, this Program and its Faculty Mentors partner with the UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS). The mission of the UAB CCTS is to transform UAB's environment by building interdisciplinary research teams through educational ingenuity, regulatory reorganization, resource coordination, and methodological innovation. The UAB CCTS is one of 62 nationwide CTSA Centers, and the ONLY CTSA Program in Alabama.  Relevance: There is a shortage of basic, translational, clinical and population scientists trained to use cutting edge approaches to problems related to hypertension and CVD, a leading cause of death and disability in the US. This is the only Training Program in Alabama that provides highly integrated bench to bedside postdoctoral training. The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the United States (US) is steadily increasing, in part due to the aging of the US population, increased prevalence of conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and the metabolic syndrome and the emergence of high-risk populations, i.e., racial/ethnic minorities such as African-Americans and Hispanics, and persons infected with HIV/AIDS. These increasing health needs underscore the importance of training basic scientists, clinical scientists and population scientists in an environment conduciv to multidisciplinary team research in order to test more effective approaches to the prevention and treatment of hypertension and related vascular disease and other comorbidities. This Training Program addresses these goals, and is the only postdoctoral Training Program in the state of Alabama with a primary focus on hypertension and CVD. (End of Abstract)"
"9327056","This research will determine if red blood cell (RBC) units from iron-deficient volunteer blood donors fail to meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards for 24-hour post-transfusion recovery. Over 15 million RBC units are donated annually in the United States. Despite fulfilling all requirements for blood donation, almost two- thirds of the women, and half of the men, who are regular blood donors are iron deficient. RBCs from iron- deficient donors may be specifically damaged by refrigerated storage, thus decreasing their post-transfusion recovery and lifespan in circulation. Our overarching hypothesis is that a substantial proportion of RBC units from iron-deficient volunteer donors are suboptimal. To this end, we propose a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of iron-deficient, regular blood donors. In Aim #1, we will determine whether RBCs from iron-deficient blood donors meet the FDA standards for 24-hour post-transfusion recovery. In Aim #2, we will determine whether intravenous iron repletion improves the 24-hour recovery of a second, similarly stored, autologous RBC unit. This project will fill critical gaps in knowledge by (i) identifying an unrecognized source of impaired RBC recovery in standard products, (ii) identifying an innovative way to identify donors whose RBC units have impaired tolerance for refrigerated storage using RBC zinc protoporphyrin levels, and (iii) developing a clinical strategy to avoid these adverse effects through iron repletion. This new information will help identify ways to improve the safety and efficacy of RBC transfusions. For example, RBCs that do not circulate cannot deliver oxygen. Thus, measures to improve post-transfusion RBC recovery could lead to sustained improvements in patient outcomes, particularly in those requiring chronic transfusion, where long-term circulation of the maximal number of transfused RBCs is vital, such as patients with sickle-cell disease and ?-thalassemia."
"9361924","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen, capable of causing life-threatening infections in a variety of host tissues. Osteomyelitis, an invasive and debilitating infection of bone, is one of the most common manifestations of staphylococcal disease. Indeed, osteomyelitis accounts for approximately 2-3 of every 1,000 admissions to pediatric hospitals in the United States, and complicates up to 25% of open fractures. Bone infections are notoriously refractory to treatment due to widespread antimicrobial resistance and pathogen-induced bone remodeling, which limits penetration of antibiotics into the infectious focus. S. aureus is by far the most common cause of musculoskeletal infection, yet the mechanisms by which staphylococci survive within and ultimately destroy bone are poorly understood. The overarching objective of this proposal is to understand how S. aureus regulates its virulence and metabolic programs to survive within bone during osteomyelitis.  Bone, like most mammalian tissues, is inherently hypoxic. Moreover, maintenance of skeletal health requires constant bone turnover by resident bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. These skeletal cells, in turn, require a specialized metabolism characterized by high rates of glucose uptake, which is expected to limit the carbon sources available to invading pathogens. In order to better understand how S. aureus thrives within this hypoxic and metabolically unique environment, we created a powerful murine model of osteomyelitis capable of precise quantification of both bacterial burdens and bone turnover. By applying transposon sequencing (TnSeq) to this osteomyelitis model, we identified >200 staphylococcal genes important for survival in bone. Importantly, bacterial responses to hypoxia were found to be critical determinants of survival during osteomyelitis, as hypoxic growth not only dictates the energy production strategies used by staphylococci, but also augments the production of quorum-dependent virulence factors that participate in bone destruction. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that S. aureus survival in bone is facilitated by (a) quorum-regulated virulence factor expression in response to hypoxia, and (b) specific nutrient utilization programs that enable growth in the unique metabolic environment of bone. The proposed Aims will test this hypothesis to determine (i) the mechanism by which hypoxic growth triggers increased staphylococcal virulence, (ii) the metabolic pathways that support bacterial growth in bone, and (iii) the role of host hypoxic signaling pathways in antibacterial immunity and bone remodeling during osteomyelitis. Completion of these studies will elucidate microbial survival strategies during invasive infection, determine the impact of hypoxia on bacterial pathogenesis, and help to meet a critical need for new osteomyelitis therapeutics by defining putative antimicrobial and anti-virulence targets."
"9383631","Project Summary/Abstract Chlamydia is one of the most important infectious agents from a public health perspective. More than 1.5 million cases of chlamydial infections are reported to the CDC annually, making it the most commonly reported infectious disease in the U.S. Chlamydia causes an unusual intracellular infection in which there is conversion between two developmental forms of the bacterium: the elementary body (EB), which is the infectious but dormant form, and the reticulate body (RB), which is the intracellular, replicating form. Gene expression is limited to RBs, and transcriptional silencing in EBs has been attributed to DNA condensation by two histone-like proteins, HctA and HctB. We hypothesize a second silencing mechanism in which RNA polymerase in EBs is inhibited in a reversible manner that is controlled by Type 3 secretion (T3S) activity. In Aim 1 we will study how a T3S chaperone Scc4, together with two other T3S proteins, coordinately regulates RNA polymerase activity and T3S secretion activity. In Aim 2, we will investigate a second T3S chaperone Scc2 that we propose as a T3S-regulated silencer of chlamydial transcription. In Aim 3, we will study the histone-like proteins to determine if they silence transcription uniformly or in a promoter-specific manner. These studies will define the mechanisms of transcriptional silencing in EBs, which is a central feature of developmental gene regulation in the intracellular Chlamydia infection and a potential therapeutic target."
"9272341","The oxidative, genotoxic and inflammatory stress-regulated transcription factor NF-KB is activated with aging and in numerous aging-related degenerative diseases, but how it is activated with aging and its role in driving aging is unclear. Using an NF-KBeGFP reporter mouse, we demonstrated that NF-KB is indeed activated in a greater percent of cells in multiple tissues of old and progeroid Ercc1-/delta mice compared to young adult mice. Interestingly, although we only detect age-associated activation of NF-KB in a small fraction of cells, for example in the podocytes of the glomeruli of the kidney, there is clear evidence of senescence, cell death and degenerative changes in other cell types in the kidney and distant tissues where NF-KB activation is limited or not detected. NF-KB also plays a key role in driving aging, demonstrated by the fact that genetic depletion of the key subunit of NF-KB, p65, delay the onset of numerous age-related pathologies including osteoporosis, sarcopenia, intervertebral disc degeneration, anemia, vision loss, loss of islets, urinary incontinence and neurodegeneration in Ercc1-/delta mice as well as reduced cellular senescence. Similarly, inhibition of NF-KB activation by systemic administration of several different inhibitors ofthe NF-KB activating IkB Kinase (IKK) delay the onset of age-related pathology, reduced the percent of senescent cells and extended the healthspan of Ercc1-/delta mice. Surprisingly, inhibition of IKK/NF-KB activity, either genetically or pharmacologically, significantly reduce the amount of oxidative DNA damage in Ercc1-delta and in naturally aged mice. Collectively, these data suggest that NF-KB also functions via cell non-autonomous mechanisms to promote aging. We hypothesize that NF-KB activation by cellular damage in not only cell autonomous effects such as senescence, but also regulates secretion of soluble factors that can effect the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, cell senescence and tissue degeneration both locally and systemically. Thus the goal of this Project is to determine if stochastic damage to cells, in particular DNA damage, preferentially drives NF-KB activation in a cell autonomous or non-autonomous manner and to determine the impact this has on neighboring cells and distant tissues in driving aging."

"9343413","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY - Outreach Core The goals of the Core are to enhance the awareness and knowledge of cancer systems biology, recruit next- generation trainees interested in epigenomics, and expand the scope of early-stage and established investigators to engage in omics analysis as part of their research portfolio. Two experienced Core leaders, Dr. Nameer Kirma (UTHSCSA) and Dr. Pearlly Yan (OSU), will coordinate outreach/training activities within the two center sites. In Aim 1, knowledge of advances in cancer systems biology will be disseminated through seminar series and annual symposium. Workshops will provide practical training of novel omics technologies. To maximize exposure and capitalize on our existing expertise, these symposia and workshops will be held every year alternating between the two center sites. In Aim 2, we plan to train new scientists and retool established investigators in systems epigenomics. Postdoctoral fellows and early-stage investigators will have the opportunity to participate in cross-pollination training beyond their current expertise, facilitating a more rounded understanding of systems biology. Early-stage and established investigators will have the opportunity to re-sharpen their research skills in omics analyses through the three proposed projects in our center and the release of annual RFA for supporting two Intra-center Pilot Projects (IPPs). In addition, the Core will organize summer programs for at least six undergraduate students and visiting scientists who will have the opportunity to engage in short-term research projects using omics approaches. Given that both sites have access to a great pool of minority and underserved students in South Texas and Appalachia, we will encourage them to apply for these programs. In Aim 3, we plan to interact with investigators in the RCCSB Consortium and other genomics communities. Working with the leaders of our Administrative Core, we will send a delegation consisting of 10 senior and early-stage investigators and IPP awardees to participate in the annual RCCSB Consortium Steering Committee meeting. Through platform and poster presentations and face-to-face meetings, our investigators will find opportunities and niches for collaboration and data sharing with scientists in the Consortium. Furthermore, we will make contact with members of the NIH-funded 4D nucleome programs and other genomics forums, such as the Cold Spring Harbor Nuclear Organization and Function Symposium, to share our epigenomic findings. To disseminate knowledge on epigenomic advances, we will work with the staff in the Data Analysis and Management Core to set up searchable databases. Ongoing and to-be- developed toolkits will be made available to researchers through our website portal. Collectively, these integrative efforts are expected to nurture next-generation trainees in the area of systems biology and to foster a collaborative spirit with investigators in the RCCSB Consortium and other genomics communities."
"9481940","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The UNC-CH Program's multidisciplinary research will address scientific issues that underpin the assessment and reduction of risks to human health associated with high priority chemicals at Superfund sites. The overall specific aims are to improve the scientific foundation for risk assessment, elucidate mechanisms responsible for inter-individual susceptibility, advance approaches to assessing exposure to hazardous chemicals, and more efficiently reduce risks by remediation of hazardous waste sites. In this competing continuation, we will focus on three major classes of chemicals ~ polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), halogenated hydrocarbons, and heavy metals ~ in three biomedical and two non-biomedical projects, two Research Support Cores, a Research Translation Core (RTC), and an Administrative Core. Research themes that cross multiple projects and cores include: (1) developing biomarkers of exposure and effect for human and experimental models of environmental disease over a range of exposure levels to improve low-dose quantitative risk assessment; (2) applying new molecular tools in a systems biology framework to understand metabolic pathways critical for environmental disease, predict in vivo inter-individual differences in susceptibility and risk, and evaluate complex microbial communities in bioremediation systems; (3) using advanced analytical tools to identify mechanisms of genotoxicity; (4) using advanced statistical and bioinformatics methods to evaluate gene-environment interactions; and (5) quantifying the chronic exposure and bioavailability of toxic compounds in environmental systems. This work will also be integrated by sharing methods and resources across projects and cores, by regular meetings of all researchers, and by co-advising of trainees by faculty in different projects and cores. Working with investigators, the RTC will enhance the capacity of government agencies to provide technical assistance to communities, develop improved decision-support tools, and promote the commercialization of our research products. This Program is highly relevant to Superfund by addressing high-priority chemicals and by focusing on mechanisms underlying health effects, exposure assessment, and remediation to mitigate exposure and toxicity."
"9277723","FLOW CYTOMETRY SHARED RESOURCE: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Quantitative cytology as facilitated by flow cytometry is an essential tool of cancer researchers. The objective of the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FCSR) is, therefore, to provide cost-effective and state-of-the-art cell analysis and cell sorting instrumentation and services in support of the basic, translational, and clinical cancer research activities of Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) members and the MCC research programs. The FCSR additionally provides instrumentation and services in support of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), a sensitive method for the label-free determination of the selectivity and affinity of interactions between diverse biological molecules. The FCSR supports this mission by maintaining 6 major instruments?2 advanced multi-laser cell sorters, 2 multi-laser cell analyzers, an advanced imaging cytometer, and a dual-channel SPR instrument. The resource is directed by Daniel Conrad, PhD, and is supported by 2 FTEs. The resource director and/or staff support MCC programmatic science by providing: consultative services for experimental design and data interpretation; education to certify end-users in the use of the equipment; operator-assisted cell sorting, cell analysis, and SPR; method development; and instrument maintenance. All FCSR services are located in a single central location within easy walking distance of MCC. The FCSR is a jointly managed (MCC and VCU) resource, and standard hours for the facility are 8 AM until 6 PM, Monday through Friday. Trained and certified users have access to the facility 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Equipment time and technician-assisted activities are tracked and charged back. The services provided by the FCSR add significant value for MCC-member research, as the nature of these services (often involving live cells) requires that they be available locally, and they would in any case be cost prohibitive if sourced from a commercial provider. The work supported by the FCSR continues to have a positive impact on cancer research by allowing MCC members to pursue their research objectives in a cost-effective and efficient manner. Indeed, in CY2015 FCSR supported the research of 38 MCC members (representing 58% of the total user base). MCC-member usage came from representatives of all 4 MCC research programs."
"9269222","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests a five-year renewal of the Penn State NICHD National Research Service Awards Institutional Training grant for Family Demography Training: Contextual, Developmental, and Biobehavioral Processes. We request continued support for the current four predoctoral and one postdoctoral training slots. This program builds on our nationally ranked and Graduate School awarded dual-discipline Ph.D. program in Human Development and Family Studies (developmental psychology) and Demography and in Sociology and Demography. Specifically, our predoctoral program integrates individual developmental science and biobehavioral science with our strong (eight-course minimum) training in core demography/population science (methods, theory, and population processes - fertility, health/mortality, migration/immigration, aging, family status change) for a manifestly interdisciplinary training experience for a new generation of family demography research scientists. The postdoctoral program is focused on enhancing research in family demography and individual development. The training program brings together 29 research-active, primarily advanced, academic-rank population faculty with expertise in contextual, developmental, and biobehavioral scholarship related to family demography, and whose grant activity is supported by the strong research infrastructure of Penn State's Population Research Institute. This intellectual environment provides rich opportunities for pre- and postdoctoral trainee research apprenticeships. Predoctoral trainees are recruited from the approximately 315 annual applicants to, and students currently enrolled in, the two participating academic departments. Over the past ten years of our T32 grant, 100 percent of all NICHD pre- and postdoctoral trainees have either been awarded their dual-Ph.D in Demography or completed their program, or are currently enrolled and on track to successfully complete their program. Our trainees have moved into positions in academia, government, and research and policy organizations, where they continue to produce high quality research and publications, and influence national programs and policies that affect the health and well-being of families, communities, and societies."
"9266457","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women face unacceptably high risks for disability and death in developing countries and there is urgent need for evidence-based interventions to reduce the burden of disease. By virtue of their training and clinical expertise, obstetrician-gynecologists (Ob-Gyns) are uniquely positioned to contribute to the global effort to improve the health of women. Yet, there are surprisingly few opportunities for young Ob-Gyns who seek to develop research careers in this growing field. One of the few existing programs is based at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), where the faculty leading this application have directed a post-residency fellowship since 1999. Despite the academic success of the program's trainees - six past and present fellows have published nearly 130 articles and raised $195 million in grant funding over the last decade - the fellowship has been offered only sporadically. Without dedicated funding, the program has been heavily reliant on project-specific budgets and supplemental department resources, both of which have limited its scope. In this application, experienced research mentors from Zambia, Malawi, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) aim to build upon these past successes and establish the premier training program for global women's health. Like its predecessor, the new UNC Global Women's Health Fellowship will prioritize two years of dedicated research time abroad, where trainees will learn the professional and cultural nuances of international settings, ensure proper oversight of research activities, and foster the collaborations so critical to success in this field. With T32 program support, the program will be further enhanced by four key improvements: (1) Consistent program funding will allow us to institutionalize the current fellowship and provide a sustained training opportunity for Ob-Gyns pursuing academic careers in global women's health. (2) Trainees will complete degree requirements for a Master's of Science in Clinical Research, providing the necessary theoretical framework for later practical training. (3) The new fellowship program will leverage the vast global health expertise at the UNC School of Medicine and Gillings School of Global Public Health to expand the scope and depth of academic mentorship. (4) In addition to the established Ob-Gyn post-residency training in Lusaka, Zambia, the fellowship introduces UNC Project-Malawi (Lilongwe, Malawi) as a second training site for women's health research. Trainees will thus have access to two established, internationally renowned institutions where they can gain valuable field experience and mentored research training. A unified focus on trainee progress and program evaluation will ensure that the rigorous academic requirements of this fellowship are met. By the end of the three-year fellowship, graduates will obtain the necessary skills and experience to become independent investigators - and leaders - in the field of global women's health."
"9260921","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Left ventricular (LV) enlargement (remodeling) after myocardial infarction (MI) is a consequence of infarct expansion, extension of the infarct borderzone (BZ), and hypertrophy of the remote myocardium in addition to the effects of neuro-humoral compensatory pathways. Post-infarct LV remodeling is a strong predictor of mortality and a high incidence of heart failure (HF). Acellular hydrogels that limit LV remodeling when injected into an MI or BZ are receiving increasing attention. We term this therapy matrix-assisted infarct stabilization (MAIS) and suggest that MAIS works by decreasing myofiber stress in the infarct, BZ and remote myocardium thereby decreasing infarct expansion, improving BZ contractility and decreasing hypertrophy of the remote myocardium. Optimal design parameters of MAIS need to be determined and although initial work using finite element (FE) simulations and animal experiments to determine the effect of injection volume and hydrogel stiffness have been performed, a systematic investigation of MAIS design parameters is clearly needed. Therefore, Aim 1 seeks to determine optimal MAIS design parameters using FE element models validated with diastolic and systolic regional LV strain and LV volumes measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after MAIS in sheep. Sheep for validation studies will have MAIS performed with a tunable non-degradable hydrogel (semi- interpenetrating polymer networks; sIPN) injected 1) directly into the MI and BZ and 2) by intracoronary injection. In Aim 2 the effect of MAIS on regional LV stress, infarct expansion and contractility will be calculated in sheep with MI + BZ sIPN injection, intra-coronary sIPN injection and in the optimal MAIS design determined in Aim 1. The proposed work will continue our focus on BZ contractile dysfunction that was begun during the previous funding period where recent studies in sheep after antero-apical MI revealed a critical role for intracellular (IC) matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) as a mediator of contractile protein and mitochondrial dysfunction. Further, recent studies have characterized two IC MMP-2 isoforms. First, full length IC MMP-2 cleaves contractile proteins troponin I and myosin light chain 1 (MCL-1) in the setting of oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species: ROS). Second, an N-terminal truncated constituitively active isoform (NTT-MMP-2) is induced by ROS and predominately located in the mitochondria where it is associated with abnormalities in mitochondrial ultrastructure and respiration. Further, transgenic mice with NTT-MMP-2 develop progressive LV hypertrophy and eventual HF. Based on preliminary studies, we believe that MAIS will prevent BZ injury by interrupting a process mediated by mechanical stress, ROS, and activation of the IC MMP-2 that causes damage to BZ contractile proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired ATP production. Aim 3 therefore seeks to determine the effect of optimized MAIS on ROS, IC MMP-2 expression, mitochondrial function and ATP production."
"9346708","Abstract Imanis is a reporter gene imaging company which has chosen to emphasize NIS technology over other reporter proteins. NIS is the sodium iodide symporter, which mediates the uptake and concentration of iodide in the thyroid gland, providing the basis for diagnostic thyroid radioimaging and radioiodine therapy. NIS reporter gene technology allows accurate, sensitive, high-resolution visualization of NIS-modified cells, genes and viruses in living mammals (mouse to human). Additionally, NIS lacks immunogenicity (NIS is a self-protein) and is harmless to targeted tissues, allowing for longitudinal imaging throughout the lifespan of the animal. NIS-expressing cells and tissues can be imaged with a variety of readily available anionic radiotracers such as 125I, 124I, 125I, B18F4 (tetraflouoroborate) and 99mTcO4 (pertechnetate) NIS-expressing cells can also be destroyed using beta- or alpha- particle emitting anions (131I, 188ReO4/perrhenate, or 211Astatide). The overarching goal of this SBIR application is to generate NIS variants that can be used to enhance the sensitivity of NIS reporter gene imaging to monitor virus, gene and cell therapies. During Phase I part of the award, we screened a large number of NIS mutations. We have subsequently identified and generated NIS mutants that demonstrated superior isotope uptake and met the agreed milestone of the Phase I grant. In this Phase II application, we will build on those findings and will develop, validate and market the next generation of NIS reporter genes tailored specifically for optimal performance with 99mTcO4 and B18F4 radiotracers. These NIS variants will be commercially developed to provide the scientific and medical community with vastly improved in vivo reporter gene imaging solutions."
"9284509","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Pediatric Emergency Medicine Research Training Program (PEMRTP), established in 2001, offers unique multi-disciplinary training for MD and PhD biomedical researchers to acquire the skills necessary to conduct investigations of the acute illnesses and injuries that form the clinical basis for the subspecialty of pediatric emergency medicine. Twenty-eight percent of acute care in the US begins in the emergency department. Nineteen million children make more than 29 million visits to emergency departments in the United States each year. A parent can think of no more important research agenda than that their acutely ill and injured child receive the best, evidence-based care with the most effective diagnostics and treatments possible. The NIH recognizes the importance of emergency medicine research and has recently designated a trans-NIH Office of Emergency Care Research (OECR) within the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) to foster basic, translational, and clinical research and training for the emergency setting. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Director is one of four members of the OECR Steering Committee. This T32 competing renewal leverages the assets of Boston Children's Hospital, which includes the largest pediatric emergency medicine faculty in the world, and draws on core strengths to create a culture of rigorous research and research training to: (1) prepare individual trainees as independent researchers; and (2) fill the critical need for early and mid-career research mentors for the next generation of pediatric emergency medicine trainees here and elsewhere. Trainees develop toward independence in three interrelated phases: (1) a mentored research project; (2) formal course work; and (3) preparation of a research grant. Trainees complete either an MMSc or MPH degree. They are mentored in their laboratory of choice. And finally, with guidance from a faculty mentor, they prepare a K-99/R00 or similar mentored research grant application to facilitate their transition to independent faculty. Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, by the breadth and depth of their research laboratories, operational, real-world clinical systems, formal academic programs, experienced faculty, and linkages to multisite research networks, provide an unparalleled environment for mentoring trainees to become future leaders. PEMRTP specifically builds on the international reputation of Boston Children's Hospital in biomedical informatics and genomics, and seeks to train our fellows to use the tools from these fields to exploit the pediatric emergency department as a laboratory for clinical and population research."
"9397646","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure is the most important risk factor for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in men and women in the United States. Importantly, the pathogenesis of CS-related lung disease remains unclear thereby creating a major obstacle to generate improved treatment strategies. Cadmium (Cd) is a major component of cigarette smoke and a leading environmental toxicant with a biological half-life of greater than 20 years. Cd significanty contributes to CS- induced lung disease but it is not known exactly how Cd enters the lung or how it mediates pathological manifestations once in. The long-term goal of this project is to determine the role of the human zinc transporter, ZIP8, a transporter of both zinc and Cd, in lung pathogenesis in the context of first hand (FHS) smoke exposure. Our central hypothesis is that inflammation driven by CS exposure will induce the expression of ZIP8 in lung epithelia thereby increasing Cd entry, immune dysfunction, and lung pathology. This hypothesis is predicated on recent published and preliminary observations by our group demonstrating that ZIP8 expression, not naturally abundant in lung epithelia, is up-regulated by NFkappaB (NF-?B), a key signaling pathway that is activated by CS exposure, and that increased ZIP8 expression enhances Cd uptake into lung epithelia which is further enhanced by zinc deficiency. The rationale for our approach is that establishment of the functional role of ZIP8 within the lung microenvironment in the context of CS exposure, immune activation, and dietary zinc intake, will improve our understanding of CS-related lung disease and foster innovative micronutrient surveillance and treatment strategies. Guided by strong preliminary evidence, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims that: 1) Evaluate the effects of FHS exposure on oxidative status and immune dysfunction in vivo relative to ZIP8 in BTZIP8 overexpressing mice (compared to wild-type matched controls); and 2) Determine the impact of zinc nutrition in vivo as a predisposing factor in ROS formation, immune dysfunction, and lung damage following prolonged FHS exposure. To accomplish the goals of aim 1 and 2 we will pursue novel studies in animal models that explore the role of ZIP8, redox status, immune dysfunction, and zinc nutrition in vivo. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it will for the first time critically evaluate the role of zinc metabolism in the setting of CS-related pathogenesi. This is important because it will define the functional significance of a novel pathway that regulates redox and immune function thereby revealing new molecular insight into CS-related lung disease that will lead to innovative strategies to prevent or better treat this lethal disease"
"9268804","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal responds to PAR-12-198 (Improving Diet and Physical Activity Assessment). It will develop and test novel multilevel statistical methods to examine the effects of subject-level parameters (variance and slope) of time-varying variables in ecological momentary assessment (EMA) studies of physical activity. Low level of physical activity heightens the risk of numerous deadly diseases (e.g., heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes) throughout the life course. The use of EMA in physical activity research is growing rapidly because real-time data capture methods supply novel insights into determinants of this behavior. In EMA studies, it is common to have up to thirty or forty observations per subject, and this allows us to model subject-level parameters such as variances (e.g., how erratic is a subject's mood?) and slopes (e.g., how much does a subject's mood change across contexts?) of time-varying variables. For example, in our recent EMA work, we have found that more physically active children have greater positive and negative emotional stability than children who are less physically active. However, current multilevel modeling strategies are restricted to treating subject-level variances and slopes as outcomes. As a consequence, statistical models do not have the ability to test whether subject-level variance and slope parameters have predictive, mediating, and moderating effects on physical and sedentary activity. For example, we are unable to ask important research questions such as whether erratic mood mediates the effects of depression on physical activity, or whether the effects of living in a highly walkable neighborhood on physical activity are attenuated for individuals with unstable self- efficacy beliefs. This modeling restriction severely limits our ability to capitaliz on the full potential of the time- varying nature of EMA data to enhance physical activity research. To address this critical methodological gap, we propose to develop multilevel models, software, and strategies to test for the effects of these parameters in EMA studies. We will apply these modeling strategies to secondary analyses of pooled data from five federally- and foundation-supported EMA studies of physical activity with a combined sample size of N = 553 participants (including children and adults). The primary aims are (1) to develop novel multilevel modeling strategies and software to test whether subject-level variance and slope parameters have predictive, mediating, and moderating effects on subject-level physical and sedentary activity outcomes and (2) to apply these novel modeling strategies and software in secondary analyses of existing EMA datasets to examine the effects of subject-level variance and slopes of time-varying variables such as safety, stress, fatigue, and self-efficacy on physical and sedentary activity. This study has the potential to make novel methodological and substantive contributions for analysis of EMA data in physical activity research. The methods to be developed can easily generalize to a variety of chronic disease-relevant research areas."
"9277734","DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objectives of the Developmental Therapeutics (DT) program are to develop new insights in to the mechanisms of action of new and established anti-cancer agents, and to exploit these findings by translating them into the clinical arena in the form of innovative phase I and II trials. The scientific goals of the program are to: (1) elucidate the mechanisms of action of new and existing therapeutic agents and approaches, and to seek opportunities for beneficial therapeutic interventions based upon promising discoveries in cancer biology emanating from the DT program and other Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center (MCC) programs; (2) develop strategies capable of overcoming drug resistance of human malignancies to single targeted agents through the design of rational drug combinations that circumvent multiple compensatory survival pathways characteristic of cancer cells; and (3) advance emerging concepts for the treatment of human cancers into early-phase clinical trials, focusing on concepts emanating from DT program member laboratories as well as those of other MCC programs. To advance these goals, research in the program has been organized into 4 interdigitating themes with the goal of maximizing fruitful intra- and interprogrammatic interactions. These research themes include: (1) structural and computational biology and drug design; (2) mechanism-of-action studies involving new and existing drugs; (3) rational combinations of targeted agents in clinical and preclinical studies; and (4) translational implementation of emerging strategies into investigator- initiated trials. The DT program has 43 members representing 13 departments and 3 schools.

"9479915","This grant application seeks to better understand the role for microRNAs in the molecular mechanisms by which cocaine remodels the striatum and thereby drives the emergence of addiction-relevant behavioral abnormalities. A major accomplishment during the previous funding period was showing that disruption of the microRNA biogenic machinery in striatum profoundly decreases cocaine intake in genetically modified mice. This finding supports a key role for striatal microRNAs in regulating the reinforcing properties of cocaine. Subsequently, we established that two closely related microRNAs, miR-212 and miR-132, are induced in the striatum of rats demonstrating compulsive-like cocaine-taking behaviors. miR-212 exerts an inhibitory influence on cocaine-taking behavior through a mechanism involving enhanced striatal CREB signaling and diminished MeCP2/BDNF signaling. By contrast, our recent data suggests that miR-132 may enhance the motivational properties of cocaine through, as yet, unclear mechanisms. We hypothesize that the balance between miR-212 and miR-132 signaling influences resilience vs. vulnerability to addiction. In this competitive renewal, we will use cutting edge molecular, cellular and behavioral approaches to define the precise mechanisms by which miR-212 and miR-132 control drug intake. The research plan builds logically and innovatively on the progress made during the last funding period. In Specific Aim I, the cellular mechanisms by which miR-212 and miR-132 act in striatum will be investigated. To accomplish this aim we have successfully constructed two new lines of transgenic mice: those with ?floxed? alleles for the miR-212 or the miR-132 gene. Using these mice, we will conditionally delete miR-212 or miR-132 in D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) or in D2-MSNs, the two major cell populations that together represent ~95% of total neurons in striatum. The effects of these cell-specific lesions on cocaine self-administration, and other addiction-relevant behaviors, will be investigated. In Specific Aim II, the molecular mechanisms by which miR-212 and miR-132 control cocaine intake will be investigated. We will use High-Throughput Sequencing of RNA isolated by CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to identify genes targeted by miR-212 and miR-132 in D1-MSNs and D2- MSNs. We will verify that identified genes are direct targets for miR-212 and/or miR-132 using 3?UTR luciferase reporter assays, RNA expression analysis and protein immunoblotting. Under Specific Aim III, we will use in vivo CRISPR technology to investigate the contribution of the most promising gene targets whose expression is controlled by miR-212 and/or miR-132 in regulating the motivational properties of cocaine. These studies promise to yield significant new insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms of cocaine addiction."
"9431352","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Diabetes Program: Innovation & Leadership in Engineering Technologies and Therapies (ILET2) is a unique, cross-disciplinary postdoctoral training program in cell- and tissue-based therapies and novel insulin delivery technologies for insulin-dependent diabetes (IDD). IDD is a significant health problem affecting millions of people in the U.S and worldwide. Compared to current treatments based on insulin injections or open-loop insulin pumps, new generation therapies have the potential to provide a less invasive, more physiologic and ultimately less costly regulation of blood glucose levels, potentially reducing long-term complications and revolutionizing diabetes care. There is a critical need for cross-disciplinary training of bioengineers and bioscientists in the complex problems relating to developing living biological substitutes for beta cell replacement and the artificial pancreas, which encompass fundamental science, bioengineering and translational medicine.  ILET2 is a joint training program between the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University School of Medicine. This program will train the future research experts in this field by providing trainee with expertise in the following areas critical to advancing the next generation therapies for diabetes: 1) the ability to develop new islet encapsulation and engraftment systems, including new biomaterials and processes; 2) the ability to engineer immune acceptance of islet allografts and xenografts; 3) the ability to engineer non-beta insulin- secreting, physiologically responsive cells as an alternative to islets; and 4) the ability to develop new methods for glucose sampling and insulin delivery towards a closed loop artificial pancreas system. Research-based training in cell-based therapies will specialize in encapsulated systems for islets and other insulin-secreting cells; the engineering of potentially autologous beta cell surrogates; the development of vasculogenic hydrogels for improved islet engraftment; methods to conduct non-invasive monitoring of islet transplants; and development of immune acceptance protocols for free and encapsulated islet allografts and xenografts. Training specific to insulin delivery methods will focus on the engineering of microneedle technologies for glucose sampling and delivery of insulin, including microfabrication and biomaterials, ultimately as part of a closed loop artificia pancreas system.  The research training program will encompass exposure to the clinical aspects of diabetes management and patient care, as well as the industrial aspects of biotechnology development and commercialization. Upon successful completion of the program, trainees will be prepared to move into leadership positions in industry and academia and develop new, cutting-edge technologies and therapies for diabetics aimed at improving the quality of life of patients and reducing the economic burden on the diabetic population and the overall healthcare costs."

"9268812","Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of these investigations is to understand the circuit plasticity underlying the association of an arbitrary sensory stimulus with an arbitrary action. Understanding this circuitry is likely to have an impact on the diagnosis and treatment of clinically important central neuropathologies, including Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, addiction, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder. The central goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that differential plasticity at the cortical projection to two different neuronal subpopulations in the striatum underlie the acquisition of a sensorimotor discrimination behavior. We use mice as a model system because they allow sophisticated interrogation of genetically defined subpopulations of neurons. In Aim 1 we use in vitro electrophysiological methods in acute brain slices to study the strength of corticostriatal synapses in animals trained on a simple task associating sounds with a left or right choice. In Aim 2 we will use the same methods to study animals trained on a task requiring greater behavioral flexibility. Finally in Aim 3, we test whether association of the sound and action leads to differential changes at the two subpopulations of striatal neurons. These studies will provide insight into how animals acquire arbitrary associations, and provide a foundation for further study of role of these neurons in normal function and disease, facilitating the development of treatments for psychiatric and neurological diseases."
"9275863","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the misassembly of protein and nucleoprotein complexes is implicated in many regulatory disorders, we have extremely limited knowledge of the mechanisms by which these complexes assemble in vivo. Because many proteins must associate into higher-order assemblies in order to carry out their biological functions, predicting the self-assembly of these complexes is crucial for understanding the organization and regulation of the proteome. Experimental investigations of the assembly of these complexes are complicated by the fact that many essential complexes, including the ribosome and the proteasome, contain dozens of subunits that assemble in a highly cooperative manner. Furthermore, it is now known that assembly in vivo differs signi?cantly from reconstitution experiments conducted under dilute conditions, particularly due to the presence of molecular chaperones that act as assembly co-factors. New theoretical approaches are thus needed to cope with this complexity and to identify the physical principles governing robust self-assembly and regulation at the proteomic level.       Building on a powerful theory of self-assembly that I have recently developed to describe DNA-based nanostructures, I shall establish a novel theoretical approach for predicting the assembly pathways of protein and nucleoprotein complexes. This approach will provide a considerably more complete picture of the mechanism of assembly than can be obtained from experiments alone and is orders of magnitude more ef?cient than conventional simulations. Leveraging this ef?ciency to perform computational screens that were previously intractible, I shall test the hypothesis that nucleoprotein complexes have evolved to optimize the rate of assembly. I shall also investigate the sensitivity of self-assembly to variations in subunit stoichiometries, and I shall apply the theory to examine the role of chaperones in promoting accurate assembly. These theoretical predictions will be tested with two case studies of speci?c model systems.       This work will lead to an improved understanding of regulation at the proteomic level. A physically rigorous theory will establish general principles of the self-assembly of macromolecular complexes. Understanding the mechanisms of chaperone-assisted self-assembly will also enable the rational engineering of biomimetic chaperones, which hold great potential for altering the production of complexes in vivo, thus guiding the development of therapeutic strategies for a wide range of protein-misassembly disorders."

"9398839","PROJECT SUMMARY It is difficult to overstate the impact Yersinia pestis, the bacterial agent of plague, has had on human history. It is of great concern as a potential agent of bioterrorism because of its highly virulent nature, and it consistently infects thousands of people per year in endemic foci around the world, including the southwestern United States. Despite these facts, there is much that is unknown about the ability of Y. pestis to infect both flea vectors and mammalian hosts, and its ability to undergo successful transmission between them. The goal of this project is to determine the genetic and molecular mechanisms of resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) in Y. pestis, and the role this resistance plays in allowing it to successfully infect fleas. Data from our lab revealed that numerous Y. pestis transposon mutants that were unable to maintain successful flea infections also showed in vitro hypersensitivity to CAMPs. Two mutants contained insertions in genes predicted to block modification of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide, and we recently published data that this was in fact the cause of the mutants' CAMP sensitivity. Several mutations however were in novel or hypothetical genes not previously known to be involved in CAMP resistance. Additionally, disruption of genes involved in biosynthesis of the enterobacterial common antigen resulted in unexpected CAMP-susceptibility in Y. pestis by an unknown mechanism. These data, along with the recent discovery of the plasmid-mediated mcr colistin resistance genes, indicate that CAMP resistance is more complex, and less well understood, than previously thought.  The first specific aim of this project is to investigate structural and genetic changes present in these CAMP- susceptible mutants to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of CAMP resistance. Since CAMPs, such as polymyxins, are often one of the only classes of antibiotics with activity against multi-drug resistant bacterial infections, identifying novel mechanisms of resistance is of critical importance. The second specific aim involves constructing a comprehensive, ordered transposon mutant library of all non-essential genes in Y. pestis KIM6+. This library will be screened for mutants that are susceptible to structurally diverse CAMPs in order to identify additional and potentially novel mechanisms of resistance. Mutants identified in this screen will be analyzed using the biophysical and genetic approaches from the first aim to elucidate their mechanisms of CAMP resistance. The third specific aim is to determine the potential role of different mechanisms of CAMP resistance in transmission by testing the ability of the mutants to maintain infection, and by determining the distribution of mutants in a natural flea vector. The knowledge obtained from this project on CAMP resistance mechanisms will open up a number of new trajectories in plague and antimicrobial resistance research, and the ordered mutant library could stimulate additional investigation into the biology of this important human pathogen. Improving our understanding of CAMP resistance is crucial given the status of polymyxins as WHO ?Critically Important Antimicrobials,? and the recent discovery of transmissible (mcr-1) resistance. Loss of this class of antibiotics could herald the era of untreatable infections. !"
"9436184","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disordered renal epithelial ion transport results in hypertension and hyperkalemia, which confer increased risk of cardiovascular complications and death. Data from humans and mouse models indicate that inhibition of with-no-lysine (WNK) kinases in transporting renal epithelia has the potential to ameliorate hypertension and hyperkalemia. Recent work has shown that in vitro, Cl- binds to the WNK active site and inhibits its activation. What is unknown, however, is whether Cl- regulates WNK-dependent transepithelial ion transport. To understand this, the ability to measure and manipulate Cl- in a WNK-regulated epithelium is required. However, this is difficult to achieve in mammalian renal tubules. The applicant's long-term goal is to better understand disease-relevant epithelial ion transport mechanisms by using the Drosophila melanogaster renal tubule. This innovative approach harnesses the ease of genetic manipulation in a physiologically accessible transporting epithelium. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop methods to measure and manipulate intracellular Cl- concentrations within the fly renal tubule. The rationale is to enable a future phase of the project, studying whether and how intracellular Cl- regulates transepithelial ion transport through regulation of WNK signaling. The applicant has previously demonstrated that hypotonicity stimulates WNK-dependent transepithelial ion transport in the fly renal tubule. In other renal epithelia, there is a two-phase decrease in intracellular Cl- after hypotonicity-induced swelling. First, there is a dilutional decrease in intracellular Cl-. This is followed by a further decrease in Cl- as cells undergo compensatory regulatory volume decrease mediated by efflux of KCl. Efflux occurs through potassium-chloride cotransporters (KCCs), and/or parallel K+ and Cl- efflux through channels. In Drosophila cultured cells, bestrophin-1 is the swell-activated Cl- channel. The hypothesis here is that inhibition of bestrophin-1 under conditions of hypotonicity-induced swelling will blunt the lowering of intracellular Cl-, while expression of constitutively active KCC will lower intracellular Cl- in isotonic conditions, in the absence of cellular swelling. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: In aim 1, the applicant will determine the optimal means for measuring intracellular Cl- in the Drosophila renal tubule, testing the feasibility of using a transgenic ratiometric fluorescent Cl- sensor. Aim 2 will determine whether bestrophin-1 mediates swell-induced Cl- efflux from tubule epithelial cells by measuring intracellular Cl- in isotonic and hypotonic conditions, with or without bestrophin-1 inhibition by knockdown or dominant-negative transgene expression. In aim 3, mutations will be introduced into predicted phospho-regulatory serines and threonines to generate a constitutively active KCC. Intracellular Cl- will be measured in isotonic (non-swell) conditions. The proposed research is significant, because it will facilitate development of drugs targeting WNK-dependent epithelial ion transport processes, with beneficial effects on hypertension and hyperkalemia, that have decreased risk of off- target effects due to the unique mechanism of kinase regulation by intracellular Cl-."

Based on fully developed and validated technology (more than 45 markers have been validated, including transcription factors and intracellular cytokines), the core will analyze myeloid cells (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, DCs), and lymphocytes (T cell subsets, B1a, B1b, B2) in the wall of aortas of wild-type C57BL/6, Apoe-/- or Ldir-/- mice. We will also analyze the leukocyte content in periarterial adipose tissue, in paraaortic lymph nodes, in distant lymph nodes and in the spleen. There are three specific aims: 1. To provide leukocyte phenotyping and sorting of mouse aortas to all projects; 2. To provide separate leukocyte phenotyping in intima and media, adventitia, and periaortic adipose tissue; 3. To provide leukocyte phenotyping in paraaortic (draining) lymph nodes, other lymph nodes and spleen. The key procedure is obtaining a single cell suspension from mouse aortas, with a high level of viability (>70%) and nearly complete extraction. This procedure is done in each ofthe projects, so no live animals will be used in the core. An experienced technician will train postdocs and technicians from the three projects in harvesting. During the enzymatic digestion step, the aortas will be transported to LlAl in a thermally controlled container. All labs are local and within a few minutes of each other.

"9260916","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects about 5% of adults in industrialized countries. Chronic, recurrent nocturnal sleep disruption and arterial bloo oxygen desaturations cause, or exacerbate arterial hypertension and metabolic disorders, increase the risk of stroke, and contribute to fatal accidents. OSA occurs in individuals whose upper airway anatomy predisposes them to upper airway collapse when the airway is not protected by sufficient activation of upper airway dilator muscles. Distinct neurotransmitter systems responsible for the maintenance of upper airway muscle tone during wakefulness and its decline during sleep have been identified using as a model hypoglossal (XII) motoneurons that innervate important upper airway dilators. Norepinephrine is a major wake- related modulator that drives upper airway muscle tone. The most relevant premotor noradrenergic neuronal groups are the A7, sub-coeruleus (subC), A5, A2 and A1, but their relative contributions to activation of XII and other motoneurons, to the central respiratory and cardiovascular activation, and to the arousal response differ. In this segment of our project, we will employ transgenic rats with Cre element expressed in tyrosine hydroxylase- synthesizing neurons, which allows us to directly and selectively activate distinct groups of brainstem noradrenergic neurons by means of optogenetic stimulation. Because we have previously identified the pontine A7 group as a major source of wake-related excitatory drive to XII motoneurons, we hypothesize that activation of A7 neurons will have the most selective and strongest effect, but our goal is to measure the relative contributions of A7 and other noradrenergic groups to activation of upper airway muscles vs. cardiorespiratory activation and systemic arousal. Our Specific Aim (SA) #1 is to measure the magnitude of XII motoneuronal activation elicited by graded optogenetic stimulation of different noradrenergic neuronal groups and measure any concurrent effects at other motor, cardiorespiratory and arousal-related outputs. These experiments will be conducted under anesthesia to ensure stable experimental conditions and allow us to verify the neurochemical nature of the responses by delivering appropriate neurotransmitter receptor antagonists to selected output sites within the studied networks. Our SA #2 is to determine the differential effects of optogenetic stimulation of distinct groups of noradrenergic neurons on activity of lingual muscles, including the genioglossus, sleep-wake behavior, and respiratory rate and depth in chronically instrumented, behaving rats. To achieve this, we shall stimulate different pontomedullary noradrenergic groups during different sleep-wake states. Our SA #3 is to determine how the contributions of different noradrenergic neuronal groups to upper airway muscle tone are altered in rats exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia used as a model of a major component of OSA. Collectively, these studies will characterize the key sources of noradrenergic drive to upper airway motoneurons and establish the basis for targeting different components of the central noradrenergic system with potentially therapeutic interventions for sleep-disordered breathing."
"9281799","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disease with major cardiovascular and neurocognitive consequences and yet current therapies are unacceptable for some patients. While CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) can be transformative for some patients, adherence to this treatment is highly variable and alternative therapies suffer from incomplete efficacy. We have recently observed evidence of neuromyopathy in OSA using some newly developed sophisticated electrophysiological techniques. These data have corroborated the findings of other groups showing either sensory or motor impairment of upper airway neuromuscular reflexes in OSA. However, we remain unclear whether the observed findings are indeed clinically important. We plan to define the variability in reinnervation (a marker of nerve injury) in OSA compared to matched controls, also trying to identify predictors of this pattern for clinicians to use. We will further assess the importance of these findings by assessing tongue protrusion force and fatigability as well as the potential impact of neuromyopathy on upper airway mechanics during sleep. We will also conduct a pilot clinical trial to assess the impact of muscle training exercises on OSA patients with and without evidence of reinnervation. Ultimately, we hope that our research will help to define new therapeutic targets at least for a subset of OSA patients."

"9351703","Project 3: Impact of the FGF21-Adiponectin-Ceramide Axis on Healthspan Abstract Adipocytes secrete numerous lipid and protein factors with profound effects on systemic energy homeostasis. One such adipokine that we first identified in the early 1990's, adiponectin (previously referred to as Acrp30), has garnered significant attention as a potent mediator of insulin sensitivity and cell survival. FGF21 is another factor released by a number of cell types (including adipocytes) that has beneficial effects on metabolism. In genetically diabetic and diet-induced obese mice, FGF21 lowers blood glucose levels and enhances insulin sensitivity only when adiponectin is functionally present. We have shown that both FGF21 as well as adiponectin lower systemic and tissue levels of ceramides, a class of lipids that has been tightly linked to insulin resistance, inflammation and apoptosis. FGF21 is also a potent secretagogue for adiponectin in adipocytes. This is also in line with two recent papers that argue that the FGF21 receptors, FGFR1 and ?- klotho, exert their primary effects through their presence in adipocytes. Our colleagues Kliewer and Mangesldorf in Project 1 have previously demonstrated that FGF21 overexpressing mice show longer lifespan in mice. Additional clinical data suggests that adiponectin may be a longevity gene. Based on this broad set of preliminary data that argues for the FGF21-adiponectin axis to be a major player in health-span and longevity, we propose the hypothesis that FGF21, via adiponectin, lowers age-related `lipotoxicity' and controls metabolic health- and lifespan by effectively lowering systemic and tissue ceramide levels. We are in a unique position to experimentally test this hypothesis, because the necessary mouse models to address this question have just recently become available. Teaming up with the 3 other laboratories that are part of this PPG, each bringing a unique tool set and expertise to the table, allows us to shed light on this very important axis with major implications for health-span and longevity. Specifically, we will address this topic with 3 distinct Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will establish whether adiponectin has an effect on health-span. This has never been tested preclinically. We will systemically analyze thymic lymphopoiesis and assess T cell repertoire diversity (Project 2) and mitochondrial function (Project 4) as a function of age and adiponectin. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the contributions of adiponectin on FGF21-mediated healthspan and lifespan. We will examine the effects of the presence and absence of adiponectin on FGF21-mediated benefits on aging in the context of FGF21 transgenic mice. This aim will be performed in close collaboration with Project 1 and Core B. In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate whether FGF21/adiponectin mediated lowering of age-related increase in ceramides controls adipose tissue inflammation and functional decline. We already have generated inducible models of acid ceramidase in adipocytes and hepatocytes that dramatically improve insulin sensitivity. Combined, the proposed studies should shed new insights into the physiology of FGF21/adiponectin mediated aging, and will establish whether these effects are exerted through a lowering of ceramide species."

"9277732","CANCER MOLECULAR GENETICS PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The central theme of the Cancer Molecular Genetics (CMG) program is to identify and characterize the critical genes and genetic and epigenetic alterations that promote or suppress cancer initiation, progression, and therapeutic resistance, with the ultimate goal of translating this information to develop new strategies for more effective disease surveillance and more effective and less toxic treatments for cancers. The scientific goals of the program include the following: (1) identifying and functionally characterizing the key genes that contribute to cancer development by affecting immortalization, DNA synthesis, clonal dynamics, evasion of apoptosis and autophagy, invasion and metastasis, and angiogenesis; (2) determining the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms regulating expression of key genes in both normal and cancer cells; (3) identifying mechanisms by which genetic, epigenetic, and immunologic processes in cancer cells can be exploited to selectively induce cancer cell death; and (4) developing strategies for translating this knowledge into innovative approaches for the treatment of human cancers. The research projects addressing these goals fall into 2 major thematic areas, Tumorigenesis and Metastasis and Gene Expression and Epigenetics, and a third developing thematic area, Immunogenomics and the Tumor Microenvironment. Within each of these thematic areas, the scientific efforts are highly cancer-focused and range from basic discovery to translational and preclinical research. The CMG program has benefitted from a number of strategic recruitments over the past grant period, key among which is Seth Corey, MPH, MD, who has joined Jolene Windle, PhD, as co-leader of the program. The CMG program consists of a multidisciplinary group of 27 investigators from 11 academic departments representing 4 schools. The program has a funding base of over $3.8 million in annual direct costs, of which more than $1.3 million is from the NCI. CMG program members have many well-established and productive collaborations, which have resulted in multiple jointly funded research initiatives and high-impact publications. Half of the 400 publications from CMG program members in 2011-2015 involved collaborations with other Massey Cancer Center members (including greater than one-third with intraprogrammatic and one-third with interprogrammatic collaborations). In addition, greater than half involved interinstitutional collaborations. The CMG program provides a highly interactive and collaborative research environment that facilitates scientific exchange within the program and with members of other programs. The CMG program is also strongly committed to mentorship of its junior faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, and doctoral students to train the next generation of cancer biologists and therapists. Through these efforts, the CMG program creates a synergistic environment that promotes the success of its members to advance our scientific understanding of cancer and translate these advances into more effective preventative and therapeutic measures."
"9281461","Project Summary The Molecular Systems Pathology Core will provide expert morphological and molecular evaluation of normal and tumor samples of human and experimental models to investigators of this Program Project. It will investigate the potential clinical relevance of pathways and lead compounds identified from the preclinical models in the projects. The Core will assist in the generation and validation of data regarding genetic alterations associated with tumorigenesis and temporal maps of early versus late tumor progression. The Core will support the overall goals of the Program through the application of novel technologies in the areas of object-oriented image analysis and quantitative biomarker multiplexing, allowing for integration of phenotype- genotype, and providing patient-specific risk profiles. It will also participate in the integration of data between Projects, and especially between Core B (Levine) and our Core C. The Core has ample tissue resources and will assist all Projects. These include well-characterized cohorts of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), breast carcinomas, lymphoma and leukemia cases, plus multiple tissue microarrays, all cases linked to outcome data. Tissue specimens will be provided for laboratory studies under strict guidelines. The Specific Aims are: (1) To confirm histopathology and morphometric parameters of human tumors and murine models developed by all Projects. More specifically, well-characterized HCC cases will be use for the assessment of oncogenic gain of function of certain p53 mutants [Prives (Project 1) and Lowe (Project 4)]. (2) To develop and perform quantitative phenotypic assessment of in situ signaling pathways in the primary patient specimens and mouse models using multiplex immunofluorescence/multiplex immunohistochemistry combined with image analysis [e.g., Stockwell (Project 2) and Prives (Project 1) to determine and validate expression levels of biomarkers of ferroptosis and p53-regulated genes in mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway]. (3) To further enhance and conduct qualitative and quantitative microscopy assessment of heterochromatic marks to assist in the analysis of oncogene-induced chromatin transitions and DNA damage response (DDR) [e.g., Petrini (Project 3) analyses of pre- and post-oncogenic stresses with high resolution assays, such as ?H2AX, that allows quantification of foci in nuclei of cells of interest). (4) To characterize context dependencies of wild-type and mutant p53 effector programs, and p53-mediated gen repression in tumorigenesis and tumor maintenance [e.g., Lowe (Project4) pre- and post-treated analyses of transgenic mice with B cell lymphomas).

"9263922","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Treatment for children with cancer has progressed over the past four decades so that, today, over 80% of children diagnosed with a malignancy will become long-term survivors. Currently, there are over 350,000 survivors of childhood cancer living in the United States; nearly 250,000 of these individuals are younger than age 40 years. Unfortunately, treatment for childhood cancer continues to require agents designed to destroy malignant cell lines, and normal tissue is not always spared. While early treatment-related organ specific toxicities are not always apparent, many childhood cancer survivors report symptoms that interfere with daily life, including exercise induced shortness of breath, fatigue, and reduce capacity to participate in physical activity. These symptoms may be a hallmark of premature aging, or frailty. Frailty is a phenotype most commonly described in older adults; it indicates persons who are highly vulnerable to adverse health outcomes. Frailty may help explain why nearly two thirds of childhood cancer survivors have at least one severe chronic health condition 30 years from diagnosis, why childhood cancer survivors are more likely than peers to be hospitalized for non-obstetrical reasons, and why they have mortality rates more than eight times higher than age-and-gender matched members of the general population. The aims of this proposal are to enumerate the prevalence of physiologic frailty over time in a group of young adult survivors of childhood cancer, to describe the association between frailty and the development or progression of chronic conditions, and to describe the associations between personal factors, cancer-related treatment modalities, health behaviors, and frailty in this population."

The Clinical Core fulfills this role through human subjects recruitment, evaluation, data collection, registry, and analyses. The Stanford ADRC focuses on patients with mild changes of Alzheimer s disease, Parkinson s disease or both, and on cognitively normal older adults, optimizing the ability of investigators to discover early markers of disease specificity. We will create innovative research opportunities focusing on the overlapping spectrum of these two common neurodegenerative disorders, facilitating interdisciplinary investigations that make use of standardized clinical data, biospecimens, novel biomarkers, and neuroimaging (via Core F). In association with Core D, there is a strong emphasis on autopsy participation. Specific aims are to: (1) recruit participants within specified diagnostic categories to support anticipated research needs of participating ADRC investigators (we target 20% Hispanic/Latino participation, a group traditionally under-represented in medical research); (2) characterize participants neurological, cognitive, behavioral, and biomarker status; provide consensus diagnoses; and follow participants longitudinally: (3) perform Uniform Data Set assessments at entry and annually; and to collaborate with the Database Management & Biostatistics Core on the efficient transmission of these de-identified data to the National Alzheimer s Coordinating Center; (4) collaborate with the Imaging Core to facilitate innovative neuroimaging research by ADRC participating investigators; (5)ensure availability of biospecimens and postmortem tissues, in collaboration with the Neuropathology & Biospecimen Core, from well-characterized participants within a Normal Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease spectrum and from other clinical populations as needed to facilitate participating investigators research; and (6) support ADRC small R01 Project 2, pilot research projects, clinical trials, and research needs of externally funded investigators who could benefit from Clinical Core resources."
"9228029","ABSTRACT Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder of undetermined etiology and without effective therapeutics. Recent advances in genomic approaches have led to the identification of over 65 ASD risk genes. Despite the genetic heterogeneity of ASD, several lines of evidence suggest that these genes share common molecular underpinnings. Therefore, we hypothesize that these genes will converge upon shared phenotypes when inhibited in model organisms and that these phenotypes will be the most central to the neuropathology of ASD. Identifying such convergent phenotypes requires a high-throughput system for modifying many ASD genes in parallel and assaying their effect(s) on embryonic brain development. Here we propose to leverage the diploid vertebrate tetrapod, Xenopus tropicalis, and the CRISPR/Cas9 system to identify convergent phenotypes among ASD genes during brain development. By injecting Cas9 protein and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) against an ASD gene at the two-cell stage, animals will be generated in which exactly half the body (separated by the midline) is mutant, allowing for direct comparison of mutant and control cells in the same animal. This will be performed for approximately 65 ASD risk genes, and the effects of ASD gene loss will be assayed by imaging neurons throughout embryogenesis using fluorescent reporters and by in situ RNA hybridization for neuronal cell fate specification markers. By employing fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), next generation RNA sequencing, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), convergent transcriptional signatures of ASD gene loss will be characterized. The biological pathways indicated by these convergent signatures will be validated through targeted manipulation of key genes. Importantly, the validated biological pathways may provide clues about the observed convergent phenotypes. By combining the high-throughput capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system and a tractable vertebrate model organism with a reliably-associated set of ASD genes, this study aims to understand the neuropathology of ASD at a critical developmental period, which should provide critical insights into the etiology of this disorder."
"9271220","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema together are the third leading cause of death in the United States. COPD and emphysema are recognized to be heterogeneous diseases, but its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood and there is a lack of precise, biologically based and clinically applicable definitions of emphysema and COPD. In particular, certain subtypes of emphysema have been found to correlate with different risk factors and are therefore likely to represent different diseases. Computed tomography (CT) imaging provides rich in vivo information on the lung parenchyma, airways and vasculature but use of this information is limited. Current approaches for CT-based emphysema quantification and subtyping rely on either crude methods that discard most of the spatial information in CT scans (e.g. thresholding) or on approaches based on supervised learning that simply replicate radiologists' interpretation or use physiological measures as labels. This project will develop the missing computational tools and perform the clinical correlation studies required to exploit CT lung imaging as a new 'microscope' for lung structure examination and will define quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES) for clinical and research use. To reach this goal, we will: (1) develop novel and robust image processing tools for the extraction of emphysema radiological features on thousands of CT scans, (2) perform unsupervised clustering of emphysema radiological features on the large MESA cohort of patients to discover QES and, (3) quantify the levels of normality for QES among homogeneous populations of non-smoking normal participants without respiratory symptoms and disease. We will then, starting at the latest in Year 3, demonstrate the clinical relevance of the QES by correlating with symptoms, functional status, respiratory outcomes (hospitalization and death) and examine associations with genotype (genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms and exomic rare variants). The power of the analysis is provided by the exploitation of three (MESA, SPIROMICS, EMCAP) very large cohorts of Lung studies - containing CT lung images, respiratory and genetic measures - from normal volunteers and COPD patients. Longitudinal progression of QES in the general population over 10 years (MESA study) and over 5 years among smokers (EMCAP study) will confirm the sensitivity of patients' follow up with CT scans. At the end, QES will be validated to be used to phenotype emphysema into subtypes that have major prognostic significance, contribute to symptoms and have a genetic underpinning. The proposed QES, being derived from automated processing tools, are therefore efficient, low-cost, reproducible, comprehensive, and highly translatable into clinical practice."
"9267508","Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease involving a complex interplay between resident vascular wall cells and infiltrating immune cells. Loss of T cell homeostasis contributes to both plaque development and inflammation. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) inhibit atherosclerotic development and progression through suppression of immune responses, including the actions of pro-inflammatory T helper  17 (Th17) cells. We identified the expression of the nuclear receptors PPARy and REVERBa/B in thoracic periaortic Tregs and Th17 cells, respectively. Our underlying hypothesis is that the development of the atherogenic lesion is driven by a pro-inflammatory gene network that can be modulated at the transcriptional  level by PPARy and REVERBa/B. Our approach is to employ complementary loss-of-function and drug? mediated gain-of-function mouse studies, as well as genome-wide transcriptomic and cistromic studies, to define the molecular mechanisms of PPARy and REVERBs actions in atherogenesis. In Aim 1, we will employ a novel Treg-specific PPARy knockout mouse in combination with PPARy agonists, to understand the role of PPARy-dependent signaling in visceral adipose tissue-resident Tregs during the development of atherosclerosis. In Aim 2 we will determine PPARy's genome-wide chromatin binding sites, define the PPARy-dependent transcriptome, and map the translatome (Ribo-seq) of peri-aortic fat Tregs in order to determine the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms of PPARy action in Tregs. In Aim 3 we will examine the role of REVERBa/B in attenuating pro-Inflammatory Th17 cells in the context of atherogenesis. These REVERBs naturally oppose RORy, the Th17 lineage specifier. Our approach is to utilize mice with selective deletion of both REVERBa and REVERBB in T cells, in combination with the biologically-available REVERB agonist, SR9009, to determine the consequences of REVERB signaling on the differentiation of Th17 cells and the resultant effects on the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Similarly, in Aim 4 we will identify direct and indirect target genes of REVERBa and REVERBB by comparing their genome?  wide chromatin binding sites to the REVERB-dependent transcriptomes in Th17 cells, thereby shedding light on the mechanisms of REVERB-mediated repression. These highly integrated Aims employ biochemical, molecular, genetic, pharmacologic and physiologic approaches to clarify the competing roles of the immuno? suppressive Tregs and the pro-inflammatory Th17 cells in this disease. Characterization of the roles of these therapeutically-accessible nuclear receptors in these immune cell populations may lead to the development of novel small molecule drugs for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis."
"9260023","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelomeningocele (MM), the most common type of spina bifida (SB) (>90% of cases), affects 1 in  2,500 live births in the United States and is the most severe subtype of neural tube defect (NTD) compatible with survival. Mexican Americans (MexA) have the highest prevalence rate in the US with Caucasians Americans (CauA) second. An estimated lifetime of medical care costs (up to 65 years of age) for an individual affected with MM is ~$806,000 (2007 dollars). Occurrence of MM represents a significant economic and public health burden. Genetic contribution to formation of NTDs is complex as is illustrated by the e 240 known mouse models. However, the majority of these mouse models have rostral NTDs while only a handful present with the SB phenotype indicating that SB is more genetically homogeneous. Genetic variation underlying susceptibility and the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the development of human MM is largely unknown. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is the most cost-effective tool to discover all frequency of variations in the exome. We hypothesize that the genetic architecture of MM is comprised of novel/de novo genetic variants identifiable in the exomes of MM subjects by WES, unique variants present in genes known to associate with MM, and genetic variation in novel genes. This proposal utilizes WES to investigate the extent to which rare, novel or de novo variants play a role in human MM.  Our immediate objective is to characterize the full spectrum of allelic variations in genes and pathways unique to the exomes of MM subjects to reveal the genetic variability. We will use an enhanced WES protocol to interrogate genetic variations in the exomes of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects. Ethnic specific variations will be filtered using an exome variation database built from 1,547 MexA exomes of the T2D-GENES project and from 2,649 CauA exomes of the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project to obtain novel variations. De novo variations will be determined by examining unaffected parents. Characterization of deleterious variants will be determined by functional prediction algorithms. To identify variants influencing MM susceptibility, we will perform logistic regression analysis and gene-based burden tests on genes and pathways according to the rare allele frequency. We will identify variants influencing MM susceptibility prioritized by effect sizes and predicted functional impacts. We will verify association of genes influencing MM susceptibility. Significance of variations in genes and pathways will also be evaluated by meta-analyses. We will replicate ten genes prioritized by occurrence of novel variants, effect sizes and functional impacts in an additional cohort of 250 MexA and 250 CauA MM subjects to verify their influence on MM susceptibility. Completion of the proposed project will define the role of novel/de novo variants to MM susceptibility and create an MM specific exome variants resource that can facilitate future research directions including translation to clinical diagnosis, prediction of outcome and designing treatments."
"9343415","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY - Project 2 Fine-scale nucleosome repositioning of enhancers for hormone-independent genomic function The cognate receptors AR and ER? can remain active for tumor progression after anti-hormone treatment for patients with prostate and breast cancers. Despite intensive efforts to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, little information is available concerning AR/ER? genomic function for promoting hormone resistance at the nucleosome level. In preliminary studies, we observed this genomic function is well orchestrated, relying on precise nucleosome organization within cis-bound enhancers for hormone-dependent transcription. Interestingly, we also found that this epigenetic mechanism can be hijacked by hormone-resistant cells to gain their growth and invasion advantages. Therefore, we hypothesize that altered nucleosome positions, or nucleosome repositioning, in and near AR/ER?-bound enhancers is being exploited for hormone-independent genomic function in advanced cancers. In Aim 1, we will conduct ChIP-ePENS and MNase-seq to comprehensively map nucleosome boundaries of AR/ER?-bound enhancers in a panel of hormone-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells. RNA-seq will be conducted to determine differential expression patterns of corresponding genes in these cell lines. The NucPat computational pipeline will be deployed to seamlessly process complex omics-seq data (Aim 2). We will use a Kernel Density Estimation algorithm to determine nucleosome positioning and spacing when AR or ER? establishes direct contact with its binding motif. Using a Hidden Markov model, we will identify active nucleosome states that maximize DNA-protein contact for AR/ER? genomic functions. In addition, pioneer factor FOXA1 and chromatin remodelers participate in this nucleosome repositioning even in the absence of agonists or in the presence of antagonists. To confirm this computational modeling in vivo, ChIP-ePENS and MNase-seq will be conducted in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) lines carrying hormone-sensitive and -resistant tumors (Aim 3). A nucleosome-phasing index (NPI) will be established to quantitatively assess the nucleosome states of AR/ER? redeployment in different PDX lines. This integrative omics analysis will be extended to a cohort of primary tumors, categorized into high- and low- risk groups. Again, we will calculate individual NPIs and correlate the data with clinicopathological features of patients. This translational study is intended to determine whether nucleosome phasing for AR/ER? redeployment is already present in high-risk primary tumors. Patients with this intrinsic phenotype are expected to have an adverse clinical outcome, irrespective of their anti-hormone treatments. Therefore, our proposed study will address a previously uncharacterized mechanism of hormone resistance and provide experimental evidence that nucleosome repositioning plays an integral role in redefining AR/ER? genomic function for advanced development of prostate and breast cancers."
"9307949","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The airway epithelial tree is sculpted in the embryo via branching morphogenesis, a process in which new daughter branches sprout laterally off a main stem (domain branching) or split from the tip of a parent branch (planar or orthogonal bifurcations). These branching events are physical by nature and occur within a dynamic mechanical environment which includes the contractility of the epithelium itself, static and phasic contractions of the surrounding airway smooth muscle, and distending transmural pressures from the presence of fluid within the lumen of the tree. Although abnormal development of the embryonic lung is frequently observed in fetuses with defects that cause mechanical alterations in these tissue compartments, the physical contributions of each that are responsible for driving the branching process are unknown. Signaling downstream of Wnts regulates airway branching and smooth muscle differentiation, and is likely responsive to mechanical alterations in the developing lung. Here, we hypothesize that the mechanical behavior of airway smooth muscle plays a central role in driving branching morphogenesis, and that both epithelial contraction and luminal fluid pressure regulate branching in part by altering signaling pathways that control smooth muscle differentiation and contractility. We will combine transgenic reporter mice with high-resolution real-time spinning disk confocal microscopy, microfluidic devices, three-dimensional traction force microscopy, and computational modeling to define how the mechanical behaviors of the airway epithelium, smooth muscle, and luminal fluid collaborate to direct branching morphogenesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will use transgenic reporter mice to determine how airway smooth muscle differentiation and contraction affect domain branching and terminal (planar and orthogonal) bifurcations of the airway epithelium. In Specific Aim 2, we will use microfluidic devices to control the transmural pressure across embryonic lung explants and define the role of transmural pressure in airway smooth muscle differentiation, epithelial branching, and mechanical signaling. In Specific Aim 3, we will characterize the contractility of the airway epithelium, quantify the forces exerted by the epithelium during branching, and determine how epithelial contractility directs mechanical signaling in the surrounding mesenchyme. This work will provide a complete mechanical portrait of the tissue compartments during morphogenesis, and define how each component contributes to the physical changes required to sculpt a new branch. We expect that the mechanical behaviors and signaling pathways revealed by this work will uncover new therapeutic options to treat fetuses and neonates who present with abnormalities in lung development."
"9269597","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent efforts to add genetic data to population-based studies have substantially increased our understanding of the interplay of genetic and social environmental factors in shaping health and wellbeing. However, the genetic information found in these studies is typically limited to fixed genetic characteristics (i.e. DNA sequence and its variants). Much less is known about the influence of social environments on variable genetic characteristics such as telomere length (TL) and DNA methylation (DM). This proposal seeks funds to examine levels of and changes in TL and DM among child and adolescent participants in The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) and to identify early social environmental predictors of these variable genetic characteristics. The FFCWS is uniquely positioned to advance our understanding of the influence of social environments on young children's variable genetic characteristics. The FFCWS has emerged over the past decade as a leading source of information about the social environment and its influence on child health and wellbeing. Four aims are:  1) To assay TL and DM for children from saliva collected at ages 9 and 15 and to substantially expand  the number of fixed DNA markers by reanalyzing 9-year DNA with a custom array (72 genes, 200 SNP  variants) that includes genes related to neurodevelopmental, dopaminergic, serotonergic and other  behaviorally-relevant pathways.  2) To examine the interaction between the social environment from infancy through early adolescence  and: (a) telomere length and changes in telomere length between ages 9 and 15, (b) DNA methylation  and changes in DNA methylation between ages 9 and 15, and (c) fixed genetic variants (i.e. SNPs).  3) To examine the influence of the interaction of children's measured genetic differential sensitivity and  their social environment on telomere length and DNA methylation.  4) To strengthen the mode experiment in the NICHD funded 15-year FFCWS survey by conducting an  additional 250 in-person adolescent interviews. DM and TL will be assayed using saliva samples collected in the year 9 data collection and the year 15 data collection. We expect to find significant changes between ages 9 and 15 in both TL and DM. Some of the change will be due to time and development while other changes are expected to follow the animal model findings that family social environment significantly influences variable genetic traits. With the addition of telomere and methylation data to FFCWS, it will be the only data set currently available to combine: 1) a population-based design, 2) richly detailed longitudinal data on the child since birth, 3) a sample with especially large exposure to harsh environments, 4) DNA markers on important neurotransmitter, neurodevelopmental, and related systems, and 5) telomere length and DNA methylation measures at two time points. Thus data gathered in this study will allow for several new explorations into the interplay of genes, environment, and health."

"9251765","The Cancer Prevention and Control Program (CPC) represents a realignment of the former two population sciences programs (Cancer Control and Carcinogenesis, Biomarkers and Epidemiology). As the nexus for population science-focused research at Lombardi, the mission of CPC is to conduct population sciences research across the translational spectrum from discovery to interventions to policy. To accomplish this mission, we conduct research around four distinct themes and one cross-cutting theme. Theme 1 - Liver and Bladder Cancer focuses on investigation of environmental, genetic, and behavioral risks and biomarkers associated with liver and bladder cancer occurrence and early detection. Theme 2 - Translational Genomics focuses on investigations of cancer genetic/genomic risk testing to inform prevention, improve patient outcomes, and develop interventions to enhance clinical and policy translation. Theme 3 - Treatment and Survivorship focuses on cancer treatment and survivorship outcomes and the development of interventions to improve these outcomes. Theme 4 - Modeling focuses on population risk prediction and the impact of cancer control interventions to inform clinical practice and policy debates about the most effective and cost-effective care. In addition to these distinct themes. Cancer Disparities is a cross-cutting theme that is integrated within each ofthe four distinct programmatic foci. The program has 24 members, led by Marc Schwartz, PhD, and Christopher Loffredo, PhD, and includes faculty from 7 Departments and 2 institutions. Total direct funding is $11M in the last budget year, of which $6.7M is from the NCI (direct costs). Program members published 357 peer-reviewed publications during the current funding period of which 34% were intraprogrammatic, 22% were interprogrammatic and 63% involved external collaborators. Program members used all but one of the Shared Resources. The CPC addresses the cancer control needs of our catchment area through a strong research program focused on lifestyle, cancer-related behaviors, and health system factors. Research in the catchment area is facilitated through two community-based research sites! the Capital Breast Care Center and a new community-based center for disparities research and outreach located in Southeast DC.

The core will provide the administrative and organizational resources to foster synergy both between the project cores and with existing departmental initiatives, support training and outreach, and planning and evaluation activities. The director of the center will be Beth Stevens and she work closely with CoPIs, McCarroll and Carroll to ensure the tasks of the center are efficiently delegated and executed in a coherent manner. The team will include a part time administrative assistant, who will assist with operational tasks and an Research Administrator who will be responsible for creating and updating website content, organizing and corresponding with SAB members and symposium speakers. In addition to augmenting interdisciplinary training, the administrative core will coordinate dissemination and outreach work to both to the scientific community and the public, including establishing and maintaining a website, a biannual interdisciplinary scientific symposium (spanning genetics, immunology, and developmental neuroscience) and a biannual meeting for educators and clinicians on youth mental health. The latter will bring together middle school and high-school teachers with care providers including school counselors, mental health social workers, nurses, child & adolescent psychiatrists, and students of these disciplines for a series of talks, workshops and discussion forums on brain development and psychiatric disorder. Finally, the core will spearhead the creation and operation of our platform for resource sharing."
"9272343","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The Proteomics Core (Core D) will be responsible for providing the investigators of this Program Project with the proteomics data necessary to achieve their experimental aims. Unique methods (differential mass spectrometry) and extensive experience with proteomics on complex biologic materials will be utilized to discover circulating biomarkers of old age and proteins released from cells that promote cell senescence or tissue regeneration. By coordinating proteomic analyses within this Core, it will be possible to standardize methods and quality control, which will dramatically improve the sensitivity ofthe proteomics approaches. Comparisons between data sets produced for individual projects will significantly increase the value of each data set. For example, are factors secreted by young stem cells, which promote tissue regeneration (Project 3), also detected in the serum of Ercc1-/delta mice chronically treated with an inhibitor of NF-kB (Project 2) or a potent mitochondrial-targeted radical scavenger (Project 1), both of which promote health span and longevity? Comparisons between data sets will also greatly facilitate establishing priorities for which proteins/peptides to pursue. For example, a pro-longevity/anti-senescence factor is predicted to be secreted from young stem cells but not old stem cells or senesent cells/tissues. The same factor might also be induced by pro-longevity interventions (anti-oxidants, NF-kB inhibitors, stem cell therapy) but should not be induced by damaging agents (oxidants, genotoxins, old stem cells) allowing biology to dictate relative importance. In contrast, a single proteomics analysis for one project is comparatively extremely difficult to interpret because it yields a list of proteins/peptides and their relative abundance, which is not necessarily a determinant of biological importance. Hence this proteomics core as part of this Program Project is optimized to overcome several barriers impeding progress in the field and to have the greatest likelihood of identifying secreted and/or circulating factors that affect health span and lifespan. This will yield novel information about mechanisms of aging at the molecular level."
"9217405","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Elderly patients comprise half of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population and are particularly vulnerable to loss of muscle mass, strength and function - changes that lead to frailty and increased morbidity and mortality. Many factors contribute to the decline in muscle mass and function in the elderly uremic, and apart from aging and co-morbid conditions, wasting is worsened by inactivity. Studies in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients have shown that regular exercise, including aerobic, resistance or combined modalities, can counteract the loss of muscle mass and function in these patients. However, most studies have not specifically targeted the elderly, have involved small numbers or lacked controls, and the impact on long-term outcomes is unknown. Nevertheless, despite substantial evidence indicating that exercise is beneficial and cost-effective, it is not part of the routine care of MHD patients. In contrast, among patients with cardiovascular disease and other conditions associated with muscle wasting, regular exercise is regarded as standard of care. Some protection against uremic muscle wasting can also be afforded by an adequate protein-calorie intake. Amino acids (AA) from this source serve as substrates for protein synthesis and also directly activate the mTOR signaling pathway which further stimulates protein synthesis. In normal subjects, if AA are ingested at the time of resistance exercise, anabolic signaling and protein synthesis are enhanced and this leads to increased muscle mass. Whether the exercise and AA-stimulated signaling response is intact in elderly MHD patients is unknown, and there is little information regarding the cellular processes invoked. Taking this all together, we plan to test the hypothesis that a home-based exercise program, effective in cardiac patients, will improve cardiopulmonary function and muscle mass and function in elderly MHD patients. In addition, in a pilot study we will examine whether a protein supplement acutely enhances exercise- stimulated anabolic signaling. Functionally impaired MHD subjects aged 65-80 years will be randomized into two groups of 30 each, one undergoing exercise training and the other usual care. After 3 months, half of each group will receive a one-time protein-calorie supplement while the other half will receive placebo during an acute bout of exercise, and muscle will be biopsied for examining the signaling response. Assesments at baseline and 3 months will include cardiopulmonary function, muscle strength and function, thigh muscle volume and composition, whole body composition, quality of life (QOL), cognitive function, nutritional, inflammatory, lipid and biochemical status, and morphologic and molecular analyses of biopsied muscle. We anticipate that home-based exercise will counteract muscle wasting, enhance cardiopulmonary and muscle function and QOL, and reduce surrogate markers of long-term outcome. New insights into mechanisms whereby exercise and nutrient supplementation induce an anabolic response in muscle of elderly MHD patients will be provided, which may serve as a basis for devising strategies to counteract loss of muscle mass and function in these individuals. Finally, we anticipate that our exercise program will be user-friendly and may thus form part of routine care of elderly, and perhaps younger MHD patients. If short-term benefits are evident from this study in the elderly, it could form the basis for a broader long-term outcomes study."
"9480138","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): School-based, family-centered interventions for reducing substance use in adolescence have been shown to be highly effective and result in reductions in problem behavior, achievement problems, depression, and substance use over time. Although these interventions have been shown to be effective in efficacy trials across the United States, few schools have the resources to implement these interventions without substantial support. Barriers such as low staffing, poorly trained staff, and limited resources prevent the successful uptake of family-centered interventions in schools, yet most school systems are supportive of enhancing family-school partnerships. The proposed study will build upon our successful program of research by developing and testing the efficacy of an online version of the Family Check-Up (FCU) for schools that parents can use either at the school or at home. The FCU-Online will incorporate the successful components of the original FCU, such as a strengths-based assessment that is norm referenced, feedback using motivational interviewing, and follow-up modules that focus on enhancing parenting skills and family management in early adolescence. In the proposed research, 300 families will be randomly assigned to receive middle school as usual, the FCU-Online web/mobile only, or the FCU-Online web/mobile+coach version. Research on the delivery of mental health interventions via the Internet suggests that a coach or in person contact enhances outcomes; however, programs that require no coaching or in-person contact may have a larger public health impact. A coach version of the intervention will be compared with an online-only version that requires no staffing at schools. We will test the efficacy of this online version with respect to changing key parenting constructs, such as positive parenting and parental monitoring. We predict that changes in parenting will lead to reductions in risk behavior, such as problem behavior at school and substance use. This research will significantly contribute to our understanding of effective interventions for adolescents that reduce risk behavior and substance use during the transition to high school, and it can significantly contribute to the overall uptake and dissemination of family- centered interventions in schools."

The Learning for Early Careers in Addiction and Diversity (LEAD) program provides training to early-stage research scientists from underrepresented groups or disadvantaged backgrounds, aiming to increase the number of racial/ethnic minorities who conduct behavioral or pharmacological treatment research in drug abuse treatment. LEAD builds on the platform of the National Institute on Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN), a network of scientists and treatment providers that offers a broad infrastructure for multi-site testing of science-based therapies. The training program also benefits from strong connections to training programs and faculty conducting clinical research at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and the presence of the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Our specific aims are to: 1) Match trainee scholars with senior scientists in the CTN who will provide scientific mentoring and professional guidance, 2) provide scholars with support to conduct pilot research as a pathway to subsequent NIH applications, 3) assist scholars in developing grant-writing skills, with the goal of submitting competitive NIH applications during the LEAD training period, 4) offer training in cultural tailoring of evidence-based treatments, 5) provide scholars with knowledge and skills to address ethical, regulatory, and project management issues encountered in clinical trials, and 6) provide a networking structure to build relationships with leading experts in drug abuse clinical trials research. Scholars will participate in a 3-year training, consisting of a yearly 4-eek summer intensive program of seminars and meetings at UCSF, mentoring and training during the academic year, and participation in CTN national research and training meetings. Scholars will be matched with NIDA CTN senior investigators who will mentor them through the 3-year training period. In the first year, scholars will design and complete a financially supported pilot study, attend seminars to help them develop fundable grant proposals, and participate in CTN trainings to learn about current research topics and to network with national leaders in drug use research. In their second year, training will be focused on grant-writing incorporating preliminary data from the mentored project to support a training (i.e., K) or research (i.e., R03, R21, or R01) application to NIDA. In the third year, training will be focused on the re-submission of NIH applications, if necessary, preparation of manuscripts for publication, and dissemination of research findings at scientific meetings including the annual CTN Steering Committee meeting. A successful award for research or career development is the planned measurable outcome for the 9 early-stage investigators who participate in the program. The program addresses the need for investigators who have expertise in conducting culturally-competent drug abuse treatment research in diverse samples in the U.S. The long-term goal is to increase the number of PIs from underrepresented minority groups conducting drug abuse research."
"9482537","In the US, men who have sex with men (MSM) represent the largest proportion of AIDS deaths, people living with AIDS, and HIV incidence. While numerous prevention efforts targeting MSM have successfully reduced HIV incidence in the US, many men are not reached, including gay couples. Several epidemiological studies attribute high rates of new HIV infections to condomless anal sex within male primary partnerships, but few prevention interventions are available to address and reverse this trend. Several factors have recently changed the HIV prevention landscape, including advancements in biomedical strategies, an increased desire to develop interventions that can be scaled up efficiently and a need to develop cost-effective programing due to decreases in prevention dollars. Multi-session individual- and group-level in-person sexual risk reduction interventions for MSM were the gold standard for many years. Behavioral interventions have also been delivered via the internet, since they are convenient, able to reach large numbers of individuals and less labor intensive to implement, compared to interventions delivered via multiple in- person sessions. It is important to examine the optimal modes of providing prevention interventions in the context of this changing prevention landscape. The majority of prevention interventions targeting MSM are individual-focused. However, over the years, our research has identified unique prevention needs for gay couples that have not been sufficiently addressed in individual-focused interventions. For example, while most gay couples have agreements about sex with partners outside the relationship, many couples have difficulty negotiating their agreements, some have difficulty adhering to their agreements and those who break their agreements have difficulty disclosing the break to their partner; all of which could pose potential HIV risk for the couple. Our study team has led the field in examining relationship dynamics among gay couples. With a goal to develop a theory driven yet empirically-informed intervention, we have been studying the nuances of relationships and determining the HIV risk factors that either persist or change over time. Several years of longitudinal quantitative and qualitative studies, have yielded the evidence for an empirically- driven model that provides a foundational framework for the proposed intervention. Additionally, due to a dearth of prevention interventions for gay couples, there is little documented knowledge about the best modes of intervention delivery. Specifically, we do not know if it is efficacious for couples to participate in an intervention in-person or online. We also do not know if particular topics are best addressed using one of these modes or the other. To address these questions, we propose in an R01 application, to test the efficacy of our theory-based and empirically-driven HIV risk reduction intervention for gay male couples using a randomized controlled trial."

With a portfolio of basic, translational, clinical and population-based research, BC focuses on three broad themes: Theme 1 is focused on understanding mechanisms of responsiveness to endocrine therapy. Key accomplishments in this theme include the award of a Center for Cancer Systems Biology that supported development of the first roadmap for mathematically modeling estrogen receptor signaling (Clarke). Theme 2 elucidates nutritional, environmental and genetic risk factors of breast cancer susceptibility. Noteworthy accomplishments include demonstrating the role of epigenetic modifications in establishing and maintaining transgenerational mammary cancer susceptibility in rats (Hilakivi-Clarke). Theme 3 explores clinical, therapeutic, molecular, and social factors that impact the treatment and progression of breast cancer. Key accomplishments include a study led by Swain that changed clinical practice by showing the survival benefit of adding pertuzumab to standard therapy in metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer. Led by Robert Clarke, PhD, DSc, and Claudine Isaacs, MD, the Program has 24 members representing eight Georgetown University departments and two MedStar hospitals. The Program also includes 10 breast cancer patient advocates. From 2009 to 2012, 42 therapeutic trials have accrued 231 patients. BC research is highly collaborative and interdisciplinary, and would not be possible outside of a Cancer Center that adds value through substantial institutional support ($11.6M) and access to nine state-of-the-art Shared Resources, all of which are used by BC members. Members are supported by $5.1M in peer-reviewed funding (direct cost), including $3.1 M of direct NCI funding. BC is home to three multi-investigator grants. Productivity is demonstrated by 357 cancer-related, peer-reviewed publications, of which 35% are intra- and/or interprogrammatic, the latter including collaborators from all three other Programs. 52% of publications involve external collaborations. Additional noteworthy features include: a strong junior investigator mentorship program; development of novel investigator-initiated clinical trials across MWHC and MGUH with correlative studies using cellular reprogramming and functional genomic technologies; and outreach and research initiatives in the Black and Hispanic communities within our catchment area."
"9261591","?

We request funds for two positions in Year 1 and four positions each subsequent year. The area of brain circuitry as applied to understanding psychopathology is a rapidly growing domain with great potential to inform the understanding of the causal pathways and mechanisms of affective mental illness. The Center for Neuromodulation in Depression and Stress (CNDS), in collaboration with multiple University of Pennsylvania (PENN) departments, centers and institutes is well poised to launch this novel post-doctoral fellowship based on established innovations in imaging, as well as the range of related expertise offered by the proposed multidisciplinary mentor group. The proposed training recognizes that the tools necessary to understand brain circuitry pathology require training across psychopathology, human neuroimaging methodology, statistics, engineering, neuroscience, genetics and basic translational models with associated imaging, such as optogenetics. The program will be guided by Dr. Yvette Sheline, (neuroimaging of depression and stress). Dr. John Detre (clinical neuroscience and methods development in functional neuroimaging) will be Associate Director. They are joined by numerous investigators at PENN with a rich track record of experience in imaging of affective disorders, including a cadre of investigators at the forefront of new methods development; many of these labs will be co-located, along with trainees, in a new facility. Research taking a brain circuit approach to psychopathology using a neuroscience model is a novel approach for training. The program mentors provide a unique multidisciplinary training environment in which to pursue this exciting new approach, given the established collaborations between neuroimaging researchers in the clinical and basic departments of the Perelman School of Medicine and their interface with the Biomedical Graduate Studies program. The University's role at the forefront of neuroimaging and translational neuroscience offers an opportunity to help train the next generation of young scientists who can pursue fundamental questions about abnormalities in brain circuitry in affective illness from the perspective of core psychological, neural and translational mechanisms that can inform and span traditional boundaries of psychopathology and lead to more effective treatments and identification of new targets for prevention."
"9272949","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infantile fiber-type I hypotrophy with simultaneously occurring severe onset of cardiomyopathy were previously reported in Dutch and Italian families and genetically linked to the MYL2 gene encoding for the human myosin regulatory light chain MLC2ventr/slow expressed in the ventricles and in slow-twitch skeletal muscles. Shortly after birth the patients experienced progressive slow-twitch skeletal myopathy and ultimately died of heart failure between 4 and 6 months of age. Dominant mutations in MYL2 have been known to cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) of extensive diversity in the course of the disease, age of onset and severity of symptoms. The mutation-specific dysregulation of the molecular events that trigger pathological remodeling of the heart, will be assessed using our transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the malignant: R58Q and D166V and benign: K104E mutations in MLC2ventr/slow. In addition to cardiac phenotypes, this application for the first time will include the slow-twitch skeletal muscle and the study of the splice site IVS6-1 mutation in MYL2 shown to cause severe myopathy in humans and premature death of IVS6-1-homozygous patients. AIM 1: Identify molecular mechanisms responsible for cardioskeletal dysfunction caused by MLC2ventr/slow mutations. We hypothesize that the mutation-induced structural changes trigger pathological remodeling of the heart and slow skeletal muscle leading to altered contractility and cardioskeletal myopathy. Proteomics study will be employed to identify the signaling pathways involved in cardioskeletal dysfunction associated FHC mutations. Structural phenotypes specific to MLC2ventr/slow mutations in the heart will be correlated with the respective phenotypes in the slow-twitch skeletal muscles using small angle X-ray diffraction patterns. Histopathology and electron microscopy (EM) will complement the effect of mutations on structural reorganization of the sarcomere in the heart and soleus muscle. Measurements of contractile force, force-pCa relationship and the myosin cross-bridge kinetics in skinned papillary/soleus muscle fibers from all proposed Tg mouse models of FHC will complete the phenotypic characterization of MLC2ventr/slow-specific cardioskeletal myopathy. Importantly, we will also study the IVS6-1 mutation associated with premature infantile cardiac death. AIM 2: Determine FHC induced cardiac phenotypes in vivo and explore novel rescue mechanisms in transgenic mice expressing constitutively phosphorylated P-MLC2. We hypothesize that by altering the Ca2+-dependent regulation of muscle contraction, D166V and R58Q mutations increase the propensity of affected patients toward malignant disease phenotypes. We also hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms relate to the steric inhibition of myosin light chain kinase dependent phosphorylation of MLC2. These hypotheses will be addressed using our recently developed double mutant Tg-S15D-D166V rescue mice, designed to mitigate the effects of the malignant D166V mutation with a constitutively phosphorylated Ser-15 (S15D)."

Our proposal is solidly grounded in our experience over the last 25 in harnessing clinical care data to the research enterprise. In creating PIC we propose to focus on: 1. Enable the identification and retrieval of all data that pertain to individal health by creating a data sharing architecture that is capacious enough for all relevant data types and that enables patient and institutional autonomy to be respected. 2. Test fully-scaled implementations of the proposed architecture early in the development process, with the active involvement of a committed user community that seeks to use allowed us to refine our designs to facilitate subsequent robust dissemination and adoption. 3. Provide commodity workflows that can be used to 'clean' and complete the often noisy and sparse data gathered in the course of observational studies. 4. Embrace decentralization while enabling the construction of a nationally or regionally-scaled patient-centered information commons. 5. Encourage the selection of standards through the tools that enable the construction of patient-centered information commons. 6. Employ diagnostic classification and prognostication as figures of merit to measure how well a patient-centered information commons adds the understanding of patient populations.

"9328531","Project Summary/Abstract Adolescent alcohol use/misuse remains a substantial public health concern in the United States, given its acceleration across this developmental period and resulting negative consequences (e.g., drunk driving, academic/occupational impairment, morbidity and mortality). While alcohol use, on average, increases across adolescence into emerging adulthood, research has also identified subgroups of adolescents whose drinking follows distinct patterns, or trajectories, over time. These distinct trajectories have differing implications for long-term health outcomes (e.g., later alcohol and substance use disorders), necessitating research on the multifaceted and developmentally-specific contributors to trajectory membership. Developmental theories posit multiple pathways to alcohol use that are influenced by diverse, intersecting risks whose salience change across developmental stages. Given the salience of peer influences in adolescence, high-risk peer environments may promote membership in more problematic adolescent drinking trajectories. Further, the association between peer environments and alcohol outcomes may be modulated by underlying genetic propensities through gene-environment (G×E) interactions. Although peer socialization in adolescent alcohol use, whereby adolescents match their peers' drinking and risky behavior, has been well-documented, research on G×E interaction effects on membership in alcohol use trajectories has been limited. Genetic differences in peer environmental effects may be conferred by both candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in alcohol metabolism genes as well as additional genetic variants associated with alcohol use/misuse in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Specifically, alcohol dehydrogenase gene variants may attenuate peer socialization, such that adolescents carrying protective variants are less likely to follow problematic drinking trajectories than noncarriers. This project will perform secondary data analyses on a longitudinal, population-based cohort of over 15,000 adolescents to test the independent and interactive associations of genetic (i.e., polygenic risk scores involving candidate alcohol metabolism genes and SNPs identified in an exploratory GWAS) and peer-based (i.e., peer alcohol/substance use and disruptive behavior) contributors to membership in adolescent drinking trajectories. Findings would advance our understanding of the multifaceted contributors to the etiology and acceleration of alcohol use/misuse across the critical adolescent period."
"9314932","Project Summary  This proposal aims to apply an imaging technique for three-dimensional (3D) visualization and mapping of the tumor and microenvironment including cancer cells, stromal cells, immune cells, and vascular cells. The capability to determine the location, density, and functional orientation of different cell populations throughout a tumor would be a powerful tool not only for cancer biology but also for improving diagnosis and advancing the development of effective therapies. Although immunohistochemistry (IHC)/immunofluorescence (IF) staining has long been used in cancer diagnostics, conventional IHC/IF methodology is based on localization of antigens in single thin sections. Considering that most cells in the field of view may be only fragments, interpretation of thin section staining is subject to multiple artifacts. Significantly, IHC/IF may fail to demonstrate important features such as pushing margin, lymphocytic infiltrate, or squamous change, leaving room for diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties.  Recent progress in tissue optical clearing and light microscopy enable 3D fluorescent imaging of normally opaque, thick tissues and organs. Dramatic examples include progress mapping neuronal connectivity in whole rodent brains at subcellular resolution. I sought to adapt these strategies to advance analysis of inflammatory infiltrates, drug delivery, and therapeutic responses in whole mouse tumors and human tumor biopsies. In order to advance 3D tumor imaging, I optimized optical clearing, cell staining, high resolution imaging, and computational reconstruction. Eventually, I developed a 3D tumor imaging method, Transparent Tumor Tomography (T3), as a tool to visualize and map tumors at single cell resolution. In this project, I will apply T3 for spatial analysis of tumor immunology and immunotherapy. T3-mediated 3D tumor imaging will provide integrated spatial information regarding antibody drug distribution and immune contexts in whole tumors which will be useful as a new assay tool for cancer immunotherapy research."
"9266746","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with overall 5-year survival rates in the United States of 15% but approaching 50% when diagnosed at an early stage. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported that low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduced lung cancer mortality by 20% in adults who were at high risk of lung cancer. These dramatic results come with high human and societal cost because of the extremely low yield associated with the screening criteria and high false positive rate by LDCT. NLST entry criteria, based on smoking history and age, yielded 1 lung cancer for every 156 screened. One quarter of those screened required expensive, sometimes invasive diagnostic work-up, yet 96.4% of them turned out to be false positives. A better lung cancer risk prediction model can provide better selection criteria and make LDCT more effective in balancing benefit versus harm. This study team has developed 10 blood-based biomarkers (protein: pro-SFTPB, HE4, IGFBP2, LRG1; lipid: DAS; autoantibody: LTF, ADCK1, STK10, TRIM10, KM2) and validated them using pre-diagnostic sera from the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial. Pro-SFTPB was further validated on the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Screening Study and Physician Health Study and shown to complement lung cancer risk prediction models based on epidemiologic data. Recently, 4 circulating inflammation biomarkers (CRP, IL-1RA, BCA- 1/CXCL, MDC/CCL22) were found to be independently associated with lung cancer risk. The proposed study will incorporate these 14 biomarkers into PLCOm2012, a 6-year lung cancer risk prediction model developed and validated by this team using PLCO epidemiological data, to improve lung cancer risk prediction. In Aim 1, using a nested case-control study design these 14 biomarkers will be assayed using sera collected at baseline from 549 lung cancer patients diagnosed within 6 years after baseline and 1,098 matched controls, and then incorporated into the PLCOm2012 model to improve lung cancer risk prediction and the selection criteria for LDCT. In Aim 2, sera collected annually up to five years since baseline for these subjects will be analyzed using two Bayesian models to incorporate biomarker trajectories to improve early detection of lung cancer. In Aim 3, the models from Aim 1&2 will be evaluated for their potential clinical utilities. If successful, the proposed study will challenge the paradigm of epidemiological modeling (age, smoking history, etc.) for lung cancer risk prediction and single threshold for early detection, improve selection criteria for LDCT screening, increase yield of lung cancer by LDCT screening, reduce LDCT-associated harm, and improve early detection of lung cancer."
"9324347","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective: The goal of this proposal is to investigate the novel concept that oxidant-modified self-peptides produced by free radical producing myeloid-derived regulatory cells (MDRCs) can trigger airway hyper- responsiveness (AHR). We recently characterized MDRCs as critical regulators of airway inflammation in both mice and humans. MDRCs use reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) to enhance T cell proliferation and exacerbate AHR. Our recent studies show that MDRCs induce nitrative and oxidative modifications of self-peptides which are immunogenic neo-antigens for which tolerance has not been established. Consequently, these neo-antigens can elicit pathologic inflammatory responses that represent a novel form of autoimmunity. MDRCs thus are regulators of balance between tolerance and inflammation. In Aim 1, we will identify modified self-antigens/antigenic peptides produced by pro-inflammatory airway MDRCs in asthmatics. We will determine the peptide repertoire bound to HLA-Class II molecules of O2.-- producing airway MDRCs isolated from normal and asthmatic subjects, and define the ROS- and RNS-induced modifications of these self-peptides. These studies will be conducted by eluting the Class II-bound peptides from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) MDRCs, and identifying the nitrative and oxidative modifications of these peptides by mass spectrometry. In Aim 2, we will determine if modified self-proteins presented by ROS- producing MDRCs in asthmatics are true neo-antigens. Peripheral blood T cells and airway MDRCs purified from healthy and asthmatic subjects, and in-vitro modified self-proteins/peptides will be used in functional assays, limiting dilution analyses and co-cultures to investigate T cell proliferative responses, clonal proliferations and Th polarization. We will use a murine model of asthma to examine molecular mechanisms of MDRC-mediated Th polarization. These studies will provide evidence of a major role for MDRCs as regulators of immune tolerance and inflammation in asthma, and elucidate a new pathogenic paradigm for asthma. Identification of post- translational modified peptide neo-antigens can help define biomarkers to characterize asthma phenotypes. These studies also have the potential to enable development of new and improved therapeutic strategies to target MDRCs for disease control of subsets of asthma phenotypes (i.e., a precision/personalized medicine approach). We will obtain insight for potential novel peptide immunotherapy strategies targeting antigen- specific T cells with novel synthetic peptides representing modified T cell epitopes. ."
"9296968","Project Summary Chronic viral infections are major causes of chronic inflammation and cancer. A well characterized example is virus-induced liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, the second leading cause of death world-wide. Using virus-induced liver disease and cancer as a model, we aim to develop sophisticated computational tools to investigate the host cell reprogramming induced by viruses during cancerogenesis. Leveraging and enhancing advanced computational approaches, we will develop an integrative genomic framework to identify the regulatory modules driving transcriptional and proteomic reprogramming associated with persistent viral infection and carcinogenesis. More specifically, we will develop a toolbox that allows for inferring regulatory mechanisms from time course data derived from different viral infections associated with similar disease biology and multiple functional genomics levels in an integrated manner. We hypothesize that the computational toolbox developed within this program will contribute to understand viral carcinogenesis and identify novel strategies for cancer prevention."
"9270093","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulatory technique that applies weak electric currents to the head. tDCS is proposed to modulate cognitive function with few known side effects and is under investigation for the treatment of diverse neurological or psychiatric conditions such as pain, depression, and stroke. The conventional assumption for the mechanism of action of tDCS is that a positively charged electrode increases cortical 'excitability' and this 'enhances' function attributed to the targeted cortical area. However, this simplistic excitability assumption does not explain the diversity across studies and specificity within studies of reported cognitive effects, and has not been reliable at predicting outcomes of clinical trials. To guide and accelerate the development of new treatment protocols, it is important to clarify the cellular mechanisms of direct current stimulatin (DCS). We propose that DCS acts via a modulation of endogenous synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Support for this comes from pharmacological experiments in humans as well as direct evidence that DCS can boost synaptic plasticity in brain slices. The goal of this proposal is to determine the cellular mechanisms by which DCS modulates long-term synaptic plasticity. We have recently demonstrated robust effects of DCS on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) using standard plasticity induction protocols such as tetanus and theta burst stimulation. We will probe well-established cellular mechanisms of these induction protocols in hippocampal slices, which provide unique control of the effects of stimulation on different cellular compartments. In Aim 1 we explore the specific hypothesis that DCS modulates LTP/LTD by polarizing dendrites directly affecting calcium dynamics through voltage dependent calcium channels. In Aim 2 we test the specific hypothesis that DCS modulates LTP by polarizing cell somata, thus modulating post-synaptic firing rate. A series of predictions that result from these specific hypotheses will be tested using two-photon calcium imaging, stimulation and recordings from multiple pathways, patch-clamp recordings, and pharmacological interventions to determine involvement of calcium and sodium channels as well as neuro-modulators such as brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). Finally, all experimental results will be synthesized in biophysically realistic computational models. Our basic proposal provides a mechanistic explanation for observed functional specificity, because only networks undergoing plasticity are boosted by DCS. Importantly, if confirmed, our specific hypotheses link the mechanisms of DCS with well-established mechanisms of LTD/LTP, which are in turn linked to learning and disease. This has important clinical implications. For instance, it suggests that tDCS will be most effective as an adjunct to behavioral interventions that foster plasticity and it provides answers for clinically relevant questions such as how long the effects of tDCS persist. The results of this project will provide a precise and quantitative framework to understand the cellular mechanistic of DCS, which is required in order to advance the science and treatment of tDCS."
"9268043","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that allergic airway inflammation leads to the generation of specialized pro-resolving mediators that engage innate immune effector mechanisms, including innate lymphoid cells, to limit adaptive inflammation - a regulatory mechanism that is disrupted by viral infection in the setting of asthma exacerbation.  Although we are accustomed to viewing the increase in airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness during asthma exacerbations as the result of an over-abundance of pro-inflammatory stimuli, the severity and duration of an asthma exacerbation could also result from insufficient endogenous anti-inflammatory effectors. Cysteinyl leukotrienes are well appreciated to play pro-phlogistic roles in asthma, but not all lipid mediators initiate inflammation. There are now several families of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) that have been identified and characterized in acute inflammation. These protective mediators are enzymatically derived from essential fatty acids and serve as agonists at specific receptors to transduce cell type specific functional responses, including many that are relevant in asthma. With several drugs already developed to block leukotriene formation or action, the notion that select endogenous lipid-derived mediators are generated to promote resolution of asthmatic airway responses would turn conventional thinking on its head, and identify these natural pro-resolving mediators as novel templates for drug design.  To test our hypothesis, we propose three specific aims to:  Establish the time course for SPM biosynthesis in house dust mite-driven allergic airways responses; Determine innate immune mechanisms for SPM bioactions on innate lymphoid cells; and Examine the disruption of SPM formation and actions by viral infection. This proposal's specific aims are directed towards uncovering basic mechanisms that govern the resolution of allergic airway responses in health and disease."
"9444321","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondria are essential organelles for mammalian cells. They produce energy (ATP) and TCA cycle metabolites for biosynthetic processes, regulate intracellular Ca2+ flux and Fe-S cluster synthesis, and initiate apoptosis. To assemble a mitochondrion, proteins and RNAs encoded by both the mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (gDNA) genomes are required. In humans, only 13 of >1,000 proteins that comprise a mitochondrion are encoded within maternally inherited ~16.6kb mtDNA, but these 13 proteins are essential components of the electron transport chain that enables cellular respiration. Mutations in mtDNA affecting the translation, assembly, or function of these 13 proteins results in > 200 named mitochondrial disease syndromes that affect high energy organs such as the brain, muscle, or heart and often result in early death. Unfortunately, there are no effective therapies or supportive measures for mtDNA diseases. The main hope is to eventually correct or compensate for deleterious mtDNA mutations. However, an almost complete field block exists for altering mtDNA, in contrast to comparatively ready access for altering gDNA sequences.  Numerous labs are trying to develop mitochondrial reverse genetics, in which altering mtDNAs generates phenotypes for study. However, current approaches are inefficient, poorly controlled stochastic processes often with ethical concerns over the cell source materials. Several labs have managed to isolate, modify, and re-introduce altered mtDNA back into mitochondria in vitro and shown transcriptional activity, strongly suggesting assembly into nucleic acid-protein aggregates called nucleoids. However, there is no way to reintroduce these mtDNA engineered mitochondria back into cells for functional, system-wide studies.  Here, we propose to enable mitochondrial reverse genetics and provide an initial approach for correcting devastating mtDNA mutations. In a longstanding collaboration, the Chiou and Teitell labs invented a photothermal nanoblade that can transfer native or engineered mitochondria into mammalian cells and rescue defects in cellular respiration. However, the skill required, slow speed, and bulk system size of our current nanoblade leads to many failed experiments and precludes wide adoption of this approach. To overcome these inhibitory issues, we propose 3 specific study aims. In Aim 1, we will generate a high throughput, compact, microfluidic platform for massively parallel mitochondrial delivery that we call BLAST. In Aim 2, we will deploy BLAST to generate or correct specific mtDNA mutations that cause 3 human disease syndromes with native mitochondrial transfers. And in Aim 3, we will alter mtDNA and utilize BLAST to generate hybrid cell lines by transfer of in vitro modified mitochondria back into cells for thorough evaluation of functional activity, including system-wide carbon tracing studies that have been impossible to perform. Combined, our engineering and molecular biology cross-disciplinary approaches will enable the targeted alteration of mtDNA for both fundamental, basic studies and the beginnings of future translational applications in mitochondrial medicine."
"9267451","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those on dialysis, have a substantially higher prevalence of hypothyroidism (HT) compared to their non-CKD counterparts. In the general population, HT is associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, presumably due to atherosclerosis, platelet activation and thrombosis, and coronary heart disease (CHD) events. CKD patients have an exceedingly high CV mortality, with many of these fatalities related to CHD. However, little is known about the prognostic implications of HT on the CV health and survival of CKD patients.  Dr. Connie Rhee is a nephrologist at the University of California Irvine (UCI) with a strong commitment to the fields of endo-nephrology and drug comparative effectiveness in CKD. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator with a specific focus on thyroid functional disorders in kidney disease. The support of the K23 award will allow Dr. Rhee to achieve the following objectives: 1) investigate the impact of HT and its treatment on CHD risk and survival in CKD patients; 2) gain practical experience in the execution of patient-oriented research; 3) develop proficiency in navigating innovative multidisciplinary collaborations in nephrology, endocrinology, cardiovascular disease, and human subjects research; 4) and acquire expertise in advanced epidemiologic and biostatistical methods.  In order to accomplish these objectives, Dr. Rhee will first examine the longitudinal impact of HT on mortality in a well-characterized prospective hemodialysis (HD) cohort in whom thyroid function will be rigorously defined using a combination of novel and traditional assays (Aim 1). She will then examine the association between HT and 3 specific CV surrogate endpoints (endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery calcification, and platelet activation) that represent major pathogenic mechanisms contributing to CHD risk in CKD (Aim 2). Lastly, she will examine the degree to which the association of HT with mortality is modified by underlying renal function in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients, and if these associations are ameliorated by thyroid hormone treatment using advanced analytic techniques (marginal structural modeling) that improve causal inference (Aim 3). Dr. Rhee will efficiently leverage resources from the NIDDK-sponsored Malnutrition, Diet, and Racial Disparities in CKD multicenter study and the unique strengths of the NIDDK-sponsored national Veterans Affairs (VA) database as she implements these Specific Aims. Findings from this proposed research will have the potential to uncover HT as a novel, modifiable risk factor for adverse CV outcomes in CKD; improve the diagnostic approach and management of this highly prevalent endocrine-renal disorder; and reduce the excess burden of CV death in this vulnerable population. Dr. Rhee will be closely guided by her primary mentor, Dr. Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh, Professor and Chief of Nephrology at UCI whose vast experience in patient-oriented research will be complemented by Dr. Rhee's multidisciplinary co-mentor and collaborator team: 1) Dr. Gregory Brent, Professor, Chair of Medicine at the Greater Los Angeles VA, and renowned leader in thyroid hormone research; 2) Dr. Danh Nguyen, Professor and Director of the UCI Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Unit with expertise in the longitudinal evaluation of CV risk factors in dialysis patients; 3) Dr. Steven Brunelli, Associate Epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Senior Director of DaVita Clinical Research with extensive experience in causal inference methods; 4) Dr. Csaba Kovesdy, Professor and Chief of Nephrology at the Memphis VA widely known for his research in the national veteran population; and 5) Dr. Matthew Budoff, Professor and Director of Cardiac Computed Tomography at Harbor UCLA with expertise in cardiovascular diagnostic imaging methods. Dr. Rhee will also draw upon the wealth of UCI's research environment, which includes the Harold Simmons Center for Kidney Disease Research and Epidemiology and the Division of Nephrology; the Institute of Clinical and Translational Science that is home to the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design Unit; UCI's Departments of Epidemiology and Statistics; as well as the broader research enterprise of neighboring University of California campuses. Dr. Rhee's proposed K23 study, mentorship team, career development plan, and collaborative research environment will catalyze her scientific productivity and provide her with a strong foundation as a future independent investigator and leader in endo-nephrology."
"9308564","Project Summary Title: Models and Methods for Population Genomics Abstract: Understanding genome-wide genetic variation and its role in health-related complex traits in humans is one of the most important goals of modern biomedical research. There continues to be a substantial need for new statistical models and methods that can be applied in these studies, particularly as study designs become more ambitious and sample sizes increase. The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop statistical methods and software useful in understanding population genomics studies that involve genome-wide genotyping, many simultaneously measured traits, and very large sample sizes. Our focus is on flexible modeling that adapts to systematic variation and robustly models data encountered in these modern studies. The specific aims involve (1) developing tests of association immune to arbitrary population structure that work for general distributions of traits, many simultaneous traits, or extreme large sample sizes; (2) introducing new models and estimates of kinship and FST in generalized settings, which will lead to improved quantitative genetic modeling of complex traits; (3) introducing new estimation and testing frameworks for population structure that show superior performance to existing approaches; (4) developing and distributing software; and (5) analyzing important data sets to discover new biology and validate our methods and software."
"9277717","OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Massey Cancer Center (MCC) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) brings together faculty across the university to foster interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research strategies aimed at prevention, control, and ultimately the cure of cancer through translation of basic, clinical, and population science. The overall goal of research at MCC is to improve the health and lives of individuals affected by or at risk for cancer, with a particular focus on the high cancer burden in the MCC catchment area, which has a high percentage of underserved and minority populations. Collaborative research is conducted both within and among the 4 scientific programs in Cancer Cell Signaling, Cancer Molecular Genetics, Developmental Therapeutics, and Cancer Prevention and Control, as well as through cross-cutting scientific themes. As a matrix cancer center organized within the VCU Health Sciences division, MCC promotes collaborative research among faculty in the schools of medicine, nursing, dentistry, and pharmacy. Translational research is facilitated through disease- specific focus groups that engage basic, clinical, and prevention and control researchers, as well as clinical care providers. MCC also engages members from the schools of engineering, humanities and sciences, and social work to maximize transdisciplinary research collaborations. Developmental funds are used to support the initial research endeavors of newly recruited faculty and to encourage innovative collaborative research through peer-reviewed pilot research grants that require at least 2 collaborating investigators. To give members access to new technologies and high-quality methodologies and to facilitate successful research, MCC supports 7 shared resources: Microscopy, Lipidomics and Metabolomics, Flow Cytometry, Biostatistics, Cancer Informatics, Tissue and Data Acquisition and Analysis, and Transgenic Mouse. To accelerate translation and dissemination of research findings, MCC supports a full-service Clinical Trials Office that coordinates movement of programmatic scientific concepts through multidisciplinary and disease-specific focus groups into early-phase clinical trials and supports high-priority NCI-sponsored trials. Both clinical trials and cancer care delivery research are extended to greater Virginia through a Minority Based NCI Community Oncology Research Program (MU-NCORP). MCC members currently hold over $36 million in NCI-recognized peer-reviewed (> 35% NCI) funding and of the 158 grants in the portfolio, 106 (56%) are highly cancer specific. The research highlighted in this application stems from 1700 member publications in peer-reviewed journals (~14% of which appear in journals with impact factors of 8 and above since 2012). The upward trajectory of high-impact peer-reviewed collaborative research, guided by center strategic planning and evaluation, illustrates the effectiveness of MCC senior leadership in organizing and coordinating the faculty and resources of VCU to focus them on resolving cancer-related problems."
"9479923","Project Summary/Abstract  Addiction is a major health concern, and its chronic relapsing nature is perhaps its most insidious aspect. Exposure to drug-associated cues is a risk factor for relapse, and understanding how the brain processes these cues may lead to addiction therapies. Here, I examine the role of projections from the ventral pallidum (VP) to ventral tegmental area (VTA) in a rat self-administration/cue-induced reinstatement model of relapse. I will employ novel, viral-based means of controlling this pathway, including designer receptors (DREADDs) that inhibit neuronal activity when an otherwise inert drug (CNO) is administered, and opsins, which allow control of neuronal activity with light. I have found that projections from the rostral portion of VP (RVP) to VTA are activated during cued reinstatement, and that DREADD-based inactivation of RVP and its VTA projections specifically block this behavior. Here, I explore the mechanisms by which RVP-VTA projections mediate cued reinstatement, and how RVP inputs modulate VTA activity.  In the K99 Aims, I propose confirming and extending my findings that inhibiting RVP projections to VTA in particular with DREADDs specifically blocks cued reinstatement. Next, I propose electrophysiologically examining how RVP inputs to VTA modulate firing of VTA dopamine and non-dopamine neurons, and how inhibiting this pathway affects VTA neuronal activity.  With the training in electrophysiology and opto/pharmacogenetic modulation of brain circuits I receive during the K99 period, I will employ these techniques to further determine the functional roles of the RVP-VTA circuit in cued reinstatement during the R00 period. First, I will determine whether RVP projections to VTA require dopamine in order to have effects on reinstatement behavior, using a transgenic rat line allowing expression of DREADDs specifically in dopamine neurons. Next, I will examine the temporal relationship of RVP-VTA projection activity to transient cue presentations in the reinstatement context using inhibitory optogenetic techniques. I will determine whether phasic, cue-locked activation, or tonic activation of RVP inputs is necessary for conditioned stimuli to elicit reinstatement. These experiments will therefore characterize the mechanisms of the novel, functionally-identified RVP-VTA pathway, which is crucially involved in cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking in a rat model of relapse in addiction."

"9479857","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many youth and young adults are exposed to marijuana and alcohol-related content via social media. Because substance use tracks with perceptions of harm, this promotion of marijuana and alcohol is worrisome for a potential increase in adolescent and young adult substance use. Given its irreversible penetration among young people, social media can be used to help prevent hazardous substance use behaviors. Health organizations can deliver messages to target populations via social media. However, such content might be offset by conflicting posts. In this context, Aim 1 of our study will unravel the nature, extent, and engagement patterns of messages about substance use on a popular social media outlet (Twitter) and describe the engagement patterns of networks Tweeting pro- and anti-substance use messages. Here, we will assess the engagement/influence of marijuana and alcohol Tweets, monitor their temporal trends, and dissect their sentiment/content. In addition, we will assess the Tweets and engagement patterns from popular Twitter handles that daily Tweet about substance use, and study the demographics of people following these handles. We will use social network analytic methods to study the structure and interconnectedness of Twitter users Tweeting about marijuana use, alcohol use, or both substances, and the characteristics associated with being influential players in these networks. It is not enough to study the substance use chatter on Twitter; it is critical to know how exposure is related to substance use behaviors. To assess the behavioral fidelity of our Twitter findings, we will survey 3,000 young adult social media users to study the implications of substance use content exposure across multiple social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook and YouTube). The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) has been used to predict substance use behaviors and will guide our analysis as we underscore how social media messages are associated with individuals' marijuana and alcohol use behaviors and their attitudes/social norms. Results will facilitate more strategic interventions that exploit the content and dynamics of marijuana and alcohol-related information exchanges on social media, and will aid in the tailoring and targeting of both online and offline prevention methods."
"9267509","Innate Immunity plays a fundamental role in atherogenesis and our work has provided an improved understanding of this by demonstrating that oxidation-specific epitopes (OSE), which are generated on oxidatively damaged molecular complexes, such as OxLDL and apoptotic cells, are major targets of innate pattern recognition receptors, such as lgM Natural Antibodies (NAbs). During the first cycle, we demonstrated that 20-30% of all lgM NAbs bind to OSE in both mice and humans, and we proposed that lgM OSE-NAbs have been conserved to provide homeostasis to the many OSE generated in both health and disease. Considerable data support an atheroprotective role for lgM in murine models and lgM titers in humans are inversely related to cardiovascular disease (CVD). In the renewal, we will focus on understanding the role of NAbs in mice and humans, and define the mechanisms that regulate 8-1 cells that generate NAbs.  Specific Aim 1 will define the repertoire and prevalence of OSE NAbs in mice and humans. We will generate  a B-1 cell derived database of lgM NAb heavy chain variable (IGHV) CDR3 sequences and their relative expression in both humans and mice. We will then sort OSE-B-1 cells to annotate OSE NAbs, and will examine their relative expression under experimental models of inflammation and atherosclerosis in mice, and in epidemiological studies in humans. Specific Aim 2 will define the roles of OSE NAbs and B-1 cells in inflammation and atherogenesis. Using transgenic mice expressing OSE antibodies, we will seek to define the mechanisms by which OSE-Abs influence inflammation and atherosclerosis. Because these NAbs target prevalent oxidized lipids in atherosclerotic lesions, these studies should define the importance of these oxidized moieties in mediating inflammation and atherogenesis. Specific aim 3 will test the hypothesis that vital functions of B-1 cells, such as proliferation and secretion of NAbs are positively regulated by TLRs, while the nuclear receptors GRand LXR negatively regulate B-1 cells. We will determine the impact of these immune modulators on transcriptional regulation of B-1 cells in comparison to B-2 cells and macrophages, to provide an improved understanding of the integrated responses to these immune cell regulators. These studies should yield new insights into the important role that innate immunity plays in inflammation and atherosclerosis, and may lead to novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CVD."

"9256512","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual impairment and the most common single gene cause of autism. Research in Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, an animal model of FXS, has identified two major defects in the brain. The first is a structural abnormality in dendritic spines, the major recipiens of excitatory synapses in the cortex, and the second is a functional abnormality in synaptic and experience- dependent plasticity. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy, we and others have identified a developmental delay in the stabilization and maturation of dendritic spines of cortica pyramidal neurons in Fmr1 KO mice, which may be one of the earliest synaptic defects in FXS. Now, we will test the hypothesis that circuit remodeling triggered by sensory experience is intimately tied to the spine dynamics and size, thereby reconciling the structural and functional phenotypes of Fmr1 KO mice. We will also investigate synapse integrity at the ultrastructural level with electron microscopy, as well as the dynamics of axons and their boutons during cortical development, in order to ascertain whether they are also altered in mutant mice. In addition, using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology to record neuronal activity in intact circuits, we have shown that pyramidal neurons in Fmr1 KO mice show abnormally high firing rates and synchrony, which could explain the deficits in learning and low seizure threshold in these mice. Here, we will test the hypothesis that this network hyperexcitability translates into problems with sensory-evoked activity and we will investigate whether these circuit-level problems in KO mice can be rescued with drugs that affect brainstem neuromodulation and inhibitory pathways. The experimental design employs cutting edge in vivo imaging techniques and seeks to address important knowledge gaps and controversial issues in FXS. Because dendritic spine abnormalities and many of the signaling pathways regulated by the fragile X mental retardation protein are also implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders, we believe that our unique synapse-to- circuit approach has a very high significance and is likely to be of broad importance to many types of autism and mental impairment."
"9481528","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Preterm birth, the leading cause of neonatal mortality in the United States, is also associated with a number of chronic health conditions and developmental disabilities that cause lifelong consequences. In Puerto Rico, the preterm birth rate is 17.7% of live births. At 50% above the U.S. average, it is the highest rate of any United States jurisdiction, below only Malawi (18.1%) globally. The researchers investigations suggest that the higher preterm birth rates in Puerto Rico cannot be explained by changes in obstetric practices, and that there is compelling preliminary evidence that exposure to hazardous chemicals contributes to preterm birth. Puerto Rico has 16 active Superfund sites and 200+ hazardous waste sites. Risk of exposure to contamination is high as many of these sites are unlined landfills that overlie Karst aquifers which present highly susceptible pathways for exposure to contamination.    PROTECT (Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats) brings together multidisciplinary researchers study the transport, exposure, health impact and remediation of contaminants, with particular attention to chlorinated solvents and phthalates commonly found at Superfund sites, as both suspect and model agents in the high to preterm birth rates in Puerto Rico. To do so, PROTECT uses an innovative, holistic, source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological, toxicological, and analytical, fate-transport, and remediation studies along with a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized, indexed data repository and a data management system. Administrative, research translation, training and community engagement cores engage and inform stakeholders, provide knowledge-transfer activities to the greater SRP and environmental health community, and provide extensive cross-disciplinary training. PROTECT is responsive to NIEHS, EPA and CDC strategic goals, and addresses priority areas identified by the Institute of Medicine Committee on preterm birth.    Since the Center's inception in 2010, PROTECT researchers have obtained significant and novel results indicating 1) extensive groundwater contamination in the northern Karst region of Puerto Rico; 2) potential mechanisms by which chemicals can stimulate preterm birth; and, 3) suspect chemicals that are elevated in the women in this study. The investigators have also developed a new environmentally-friendly technique for efficient decontamination of groundwater and an improved large-volume urinalysis technique. Research results have been documented in over 50 journal papers and 2 full patent applications. In addition, over 480 pregnant study subjects have been enrolled (200 of whom have completed their pregnancies), and over 70 trainees have participated in the Center. PROTECT will build on these successes with continued research and training to provide the much needed understanding of the role of hazardous chemicals and other environmental factors in preterm birth, and to develop new methods for contaminant remediation in Puerto Rico and beyond. This work will advance environmental health science in general, and potentially lead to a reduction in preterm birth rates."

"9265369","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised application seeks renewal of our T32 training program in Translational Research in Aging at Hebrew SeniorLife (HSL), a geriatric teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School (HMS) and co-founder of Harvard's Interdisciplinary Center of Aging along with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) where this program was previously administered. The program will continue to be directed by Dr. Lewis Lipsitz, MD, Professor of Medicine, Director of HSL's Institute for Aging Research, and Chief of the BIDMC Gerontology Division. Dr. Edward Marcantonio, Professor of Medicine and Section Chief for Research in the BIDMC Division of General Medicine and Primary Care will be the Associate Director. The specific aims of our program are: 1) To provide a 2-year mentored training program in basic, patient-oriented, or population-based aging research for 3 highly qualified, racially and ethnically diverse postdoctoral trainees each year, and to promote their achievement of successful independent research careers focused on the conduct of basic, patient-oriented, or population-based research that will inform the development of interventions to improve the quality of life and well- being of elderly people; and 2) To continuously evaluate our program objectives and related outcomes, and make continuous quality improvements to ensure that we achieve our goals.

"9420704","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The regulation of transcription is central to the proper functioning of all cells. Identifying the NA binding sites for all transcription factors (TFs) would greatly facilitate our understanding of regulatory networks and variations in gene expression, both normal and in disease states, that accompany genetic differences. New high-throughput technologies are generating data about the DNA binding specificity of transcription factors at a greatly increased rate, but good computational methods are required to maximize the biological information extracted from those data. In the previous funding period we developed new, and improved, methods for the analysis of three different types of high- throughput specificity data. In this proposal we will expand on those methods in several ways, including methods for analyzing additional types of data and the development of more complex models that are required for the adequate representation of the specificity of some factors. More complex models are needed for TFs whose specificity is not well represented by position weight matrices (PWMs) which impose the constraint that the positions within the binding site contribute independently to the binding. We will develop models for TFs that allow for higher-order interactions as well as for TFs that can bind in alternative modes and require multiple, independent models to represent them. The improved models will be compared to in vivo location analysis for TFs to better assess which binding sites are indirect or require cooperative binding with other factors. We also take advantage of greatly increased data to develop improved recognition models that can predict the specificity of TFs based on the protein sequence and aid in the design of new factors with novel specificity. This will be done initially for homeodomain and zinc finger proteins, the two largest families of TFs in eukaryotic genomes and the ones with the most available specificity information. We will also take advantage of the vast information available for bacterial genomes to develop specificity models for various bacterial TF families. A new experimental method will be employed to more comprehensively assess the non-independent interactions between protein residues and binding site base-pairs, which should lead to further improvements in recognition modeling. We continue collaborating with experimental biologists, which helps them use our programs and further their research goals, and helps us identify the limitations of the current methods and fosters improvements. We also have a new collaboration that seeks to improve upon methods for predicting specificity in protein-DNA interactions based on molecular modeling, combining their expertise in thermodynamic and structural modeling with our extensive models of TF binding specificity."
"9261560","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In premature infants, O2 toxicity and antioxidant deficiencies contribute to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Affecting up to 10,000 infants annually, BPD represents the impact of injury, including O2 toxicity, to the immature developing lung resulting in arrested lung development. Though clinicians have limited O2 exposure, BPD remains a significant cause of neonatal morbidity. Attempts to prevent BPD by therapeutic antioxidant administration have also failed. Thus, there exists a need for novel approaches to lessen the impact of O2 toxicity and promote normal lung development in premature infants. Recent studies suggest a potential for nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) agonists to enhance endogenous antioxidant expression, preserve GSH levels, and prevent O2-mediated lung injury. Nrf2 significantly influences alveolarization and hyperoxic susceptibility in newborn mice. Thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) is best known for regenerating the active site of oxidized thioredoxin-1 (Trx1). A growing body of evidence suggests that TrxR1 inhibition may be a common feature of Nrf2 agonists. Aurothioglucose (ATG) and auranofin (AFN) potently inhibit TrxR1 and are used clinically to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Our previous studies in vivo demonstrated that ATG treatment increases Nrf2 activation, preserves lung GSH levels, and prevents hyperoxic lung injury in adult mice. We recently demonstrated in vitro that AFN treatment increases Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses and increases GSH levels. The protective effects of ATG and AFN are lost upon GSH system disruption. Our novel preliminary data indicate that ATG lessens O2-mediated lung developmental deficits in newborn mice. Collectively, our data support a working model in which protection by TrxR1 inhibitors are mediated via Nrf2 and GSH-dependent mechanisms. The utility of TrxR1 inhibition to induce Nrf2 activation, enhance GSH levels, and prevent O2-mediated neonatal lung injury has not been tested. The objective of this application, therefore, is to utilize newborn transgenic animal, primary and immortalized lung epithelial culture systems to: 1) determine the impact of altered lung TrxR1 expression on Nrf2 activation, GSH levels and O2-mediated injury; 2) evaluate the safety and efficacy of TrxR1 inhibition to attenuate experimental O2-mediated neonatal lung injury; and 3) distinguish the contributions of Nrf2 and GSH toward these effects. Our central hypothesis is that TrxR1 inhibition will attenuate O2-mediated neonatal lung injury via Nrf2 and GSH-dependent mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that TrxR1 gene dosage alters Nrf2 activation, GSH levels, and O2-mediated neonatal lung injury. In this aim, TrxR1 expression will be genetically altered in vivo and in vitro. We will determine the effect of altered TrxR1 expression on Nrf2 activation, GSH levels, and O2-mediated injury in a BPD mouse model. TrxR1 expression will be altered in vivo using heterozygous and homozygous Club (Clara) cell-specific and alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell-specific conditional TrxR1 knockout mice. TrxR1 expression will be altered in vitro using primary cultured Club and AT2 cells from heterozygous and homozygous TrxR1 knockout mice. TrxR1 will be altered in murine transformed Club cells (mtCC) and AT2 cells (MLE-12) using TrxR1-specific siRNA. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that pharmacologic TrxR1 inhibition attenuates O2-mediated neonatal lung injury via Nrf2 and GSH-dependent mechanisms. This aim will use a BPD mouse model to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ATG to prevent O2-mediated lung injury. The contributions of Nrf2 and GSH will be determined using genetic and pharmacologic approaches. TrxR1 will be inhibited in newborn Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- pups by ATG administration to either 1 d newborn pups or E19 dams. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) will be used to deplete GSH in the pups prior to hyperoxic exposure. In vitro, AFN-treated Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- primary Club and AT2 cells and AFN-treated Nrf2-deficient mtCC and MLE-12 cells will be exposed to hyperoxia in the presence and absence of BSO. The studies outlined in this project, which will be straightforward given the expertise of the assembled research team, will determine the safety and efficacy of TrxR1 inhibition as a novel approach to attenuate O2-mediated neonatal lung injury and arrested lung development. Our findings will establish the rationale for future investigations of TrxR1 inhibitors to prevent BPD, a significant and costly cause of morbidity in preterm infants."
"9267496","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The premise of this application is the following: Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that control the switching of globin gene expression during development and maintain silencing of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in the adult is essential as a foundation on which to design targeted therapy for the major hemoglobin disorders-- sickle cell anemia and ß-thalassemia. Recent findings establish BCL11A as a major transcriptional repressor that restricts mouse embryonic ß-like globin expression to the primitive erythroid lineage and silences human ß-globin expression in mice (harboring a transgene with the entire human ß-globin locus). Pan-hematopoietic or erythroid-specific inactivation of BCL11A alone leads to substantial reactivation of HbF expression, and prevents disease in humanized, genetically engineered mice with sickle cell disease (SCD). Thus, the aims of the current application focus specifically on how BCL11A functions to regulate globin switches, as an improved understanding will provide critical insights into potential strategies to target down-regulation or inhibition of BCL11A expression or function to reactivate ?-globin expression in patients with the major hemoglobin disorders. In order to move forward in the discovery of small molecules that impair the function of BCL11A or its critical partner proteins, we believe it is necessary to define in depth the manner in which BCL11A functions in globin repression by delineating its principal functional domains. To this end, we will employ a BCL11A null adult erythroid mouse erythroleukemia cell line created by genome engineering to determine the domains of the protein necessary for globin repression. Second, we will determine how these domains interact with other proteins; participate in protein multimerization, and/or DNA binding. In parallel, we will explore the potential to humanize mice to express BCL11A in a human rather than a mouse pattern in development in an effort to generate an improved animal model for globin gene switching. A model of this nature would facilitate testing of gene manipulations and small molecules that reactivate HbF, and ultimately contribute to the development of new therapeutics for the major hemoglobin disorders."
"9480123","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-1 exposure is associated with methamphetamine (Meth) abuse. These two factors synergize in aggravating neuroAIDS symptoms and disease progression. One of the important consequences of Meth on innate immune cells is to change the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce inflammatory markers, such as CCR5 and RANTES. These changes are believed to be dopamine-dependent, but we have observed that both ROS and CCR5 can be induced in dopamine-free systems. Interestingly, ROS in the CNS can signal the increase of NFkB levels and phosphorylation, and directly induce activation of promoters of inflammatory molecules. On the other hand, HIV Tat, which also induces ROS, has been shown to potentiate glial activation and neuronal damage induced by Meth and other drugs of abuse. HIV Tat, but not Meth, increases several TATA-box binding components in macrophages in vitro, suggesting that it can have a modulatory effect on promoters of inflammatory molecules that bear a TATA-box promoter domain in the promoter. We hypothesize that transcriptional signaling triggered by Meth-induced ROS interact with a TATA-box-dependent modulatory mechanism in the presence of HIV Tat. We propose to explore the role of ROS-induced pathways in the upregulation of CCR5 and RANTES on astrocytes and microglia by Meth and Tat, aiming to identify the players in a dopamine-independent mechanism. We will also investigate whether the induction of TATA-box binding elements is at the basis of the ability of HIV Tat to modulate ROS and inflammatory markers in the CNS, affect immune cell infiltration and interfere with drug-related stereotypic behaviors. Using an original approach we expect to unveil a basic mechanism of interaction between HIV and Meth in the aggravation of CNS pathology, which will open a new line of investigation with a translational reach."
"9315158","Abstract  Inflammation is well recognized as the underlying mechanism in a multitude of acute and chronic diseases, from injury to pain to cancer. This research proposes to design theranostic nanoemulsion-based agents that have capabilities for imaging by positron emission tomography (PET), near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) optical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and for treating inflammation. The theranostic nanoemulsions will target macrophages, as they simultaneously deliver a COX-2 inhibitor drug (celecoxib), positron emitting radionuclides and a NIRF dye. The core of the nanoemulsion is perfluorocarbon (PFC), which allows for 19F- MRI. The agents developed in this project will lead to broadly applicable treatment and diagnostic strategies for inflammation driven diseases. The PFC nanoemulsion platform (droplet size of 100-150 nm) incorporates hydrophobic small molecule drugs and has a lipid/PEG outer shell that can be readily modified with chelators for labeling with metal radionuclides such as 64Cu and 89Zr. We previously demonstrated that based on its size (120-140 nm) and surface properties, this nanoemulsion specifically targets macrophages and can deliver poorly soluble small molecule anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib) to sites of inflammation in rodent models. Preliminary data show these nanoemulsions reduce inflammation in mice while producing inflammation specific NIRF images of the drug-induced changes of macrophage trafficking in vivo. We hypothesize that addition of chelators for complexation of Cu-64 and Zr-89 for PET imaging will be highly translatable for human imaging to monitor drug delivery. The specific aims will focus on strategies for synthesis of chelators-nanoemulsion constructs that incorporate drugs and PET radionuclides and their characterization in vitro (Aim 1). PET imaging and biodistribution, as well as proof-of-principle validation of the nanoemulsion- mediated drug delivery and efficacy will be performed in a mouse model of inflammation (Aim 2). If successful, we will have a lead theranostic nanoemulsion for PET and drug delivery that can be further examined in models of cancer, pain and other disease states where inflammation plays a major role in morbidity, as part of a future R01 application."
"9267939","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cryptosporidium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii are opportunistic apicomplexan parasites that cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised people. New therapeutics to treat these parasites are a medical imperative. We have identified a compound produced by a mollusk symbiotic bacterium that inhibits intracellular growth of C. parvum and T. gondii without toxicity to the host cell.  Shipworms are marine bivalve mollusks that burrow into and voraciously consume wood. Like most xylophagous animals, shipworms digest wood with the assistance of their symbiotic bacteria but in shipworms, the symbionts are housed within the cells of the gill and export cellulolytic enzymes out of the bacterial vacuole, out of the host cell, and into the lumen of the caecum where they effect digestion of the shipworm's woody diet. Despite the nutrient rich environment, the shipworm caecum lacks a bacterial community suggesting the presence of potent anti-microbial compounds. Shipworm symbionts have been shown to produce anti-microbial secondary metabolites in vivo and it is likely these compounds play a role in maintaining the nearly sterile environment of the caecum. We found that the shipworm gill endosymbiont, Teredinibacter turnerae, produces a compound that inhibits intracellular growth of C. parvum and T. gondii at nM levels in vitro and inhibits C. parvum infection in mice. This compound is also active against the related hemoparasite, Babesia bovis, suggesting a broad efficacy against apicomplexans. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that this compound targets a gene product or process common to T. gondii and C. parvum, and that this activity is effective in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aim:  Aim  1A - Identify the T. gondii and C. parvum infection processes targeted by the symbiont compound. We will evaluate the effect of the symbiont compound on specific parasite processes and test the compound against other apicomplexans, including Type II T. gondii tachyzoites and bradyzoites.  Aim 1B - Identify the target of the symbiont compound's activity in C. parvum and T. gondii. We will employ both genetic and biochemical approaches to identify the gene products targeted by this compound.  Aim 1C - Evaluate the efficacy of the symbiont compound against murine C. parvum infection.  These experiments will provide the foundation for future studies involving target verification, structure-activity relationships, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic evaluation and tests of efficacy in other animal models of C. parvum and T. gondii infection. Shipworm symbionts have never before been investigated for their potential to produce anti-parasitic compounds. Thus, these studies have tremendous potential to open up a new area of anti-parasitic drug discovery, holding the promise of new molecular targets for drug development, potentially with broad application to many intractable pathogens."
"9261399","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Increasing numbers of US Veterans are returning from military ventures suffering from blast exposure and traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is a critical need for a greater understanding of the long term and debilitating impairments in cognition, psychological health, and sensorimotor abilities. To further complicate the injury, combat personnel exposed to repeated concussions could find themselves with long-term sequelae. A significant number of these individuals are presenting with clinical symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. The number of these individuals is increasing with the current war and poses a major challenge for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Answers to fundamental neuroscience questions about the etiology of neurodegeneration in Veterans exposed to combat-related stress and TBI are lacking. Furthermore, it is not known how the acute injury progresses into a chronic pathology and symptomatology. With the large number of Veterans reported to have TBI, it is vital to study the long-term effects of TBI as it relates to the sequelae of neurological events following single or multiple exposures to trauma. One of the goals of this research is to establish a biological basis for identifying chronic TBI which could have a significant effect on diagnosis and differentiation from other neurological conditions. This ability could significantly benefit the patient diagnosis and differentiate it from other neurological conditions. The ultimate goal is to determine if various brain injury mechanisms advance the progression of memory loss and neurodegeneration. The research design involves experimental models of blast TBI. Using military-relevant neurotrauma rodent models, we expect to accomplish the following Specific Aims; (1) to establish the longitudinal effects of both single and multiple injuries in utilizing neurocognitive and behavioral assessments (2) to identify chronic biomarkers which correlate with neurodegeneration following single and repeated injuries and (3) to validate the progression of neurodegeneration using histological and molecular techniques. Understanding the long term consequences of neurotrauma and identifying the mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pathology will help to more effectively identify, treat and optimie rehabilitative strategies for our Veterans with TBI. Recent advances across our laboratories have demonstrated efficacy of rodents to model military-related TBI including multiple mild TBIs. However, data on long term outcomes are lacking and are required to most effectively provide rehabilitation strategies catering to the individual stage of injury and neurodegeneration progression. The ability to understand and measure injury progression makes this research highly relevant to the VA mission."
"9480126","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will use quantitative genetic techniques to identify genes and alleles that influence a constellation of psychologically complex behavioral phenotypes that are associated with drug abuse. Our center capitalizes on a number of recent advances in study design, next-generation sequencing and statistical methods that together create an exceptional opportunity. Whereas the past two decades have seen enormous advances in both forward (phenotype to genotype) and reverse (genotype to phenotype) genetic studies in mice, there has been much less progress developing and applying the same techniques in rats. Although both forward and reverse genetic studies in mice have been extremely fruitful, many important but complex psychological processes are difficult or impossible to study in mice. For this reason we are proposing to adapt a variety of genetic techniques that we have already used successfully in mice, for behavioral studies in rats. In the current application, we propose to employ state-of-the-art tools to elucidate the genetic basis of a variety of behaviors that are relevant to drug abuse in 4,800 rats. A key strength of our center is that we utilize a unique rat heterogeneous stock (HS). These rats, sometimes referred to as N/NIH, are an HS that was created in 1984 by intercrossing 8 inbred rat strains and have been maintained as an outbred population for 65 generations. This has given rise to numerous accumulated recombinations that make them an ideal resource for performing studies that are analogous to human genome wide association studies (GWAS). Significantly, all 8 inbred founder strains have recently been re-sequenced, identifying 7.2 million SNPs. We will genotype these rats using an innovative next-generation sequencing-based method that provides ~100K SNPs at an extremely low cost. We will use these data to infer haplotypes, which will allow us to impute all 7.2 million SNPs in each rat. In addition to identifying associations between these SNPs and the behavioral traits, we will also examine gene expression in 72 behaviorally naive rats focusing on 4 key brain regions. We will use these data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate all of these data to identify specific genes that influece behavior. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also identify co-heritability among these traits, as well as pleiotropic effects of individual loci on multiple putatively related behavioral domains.  Finally,  the proposed center includes numerous educational, career development and public outreach activities. We will implement a program to train high school and undergraduate students. In addition, technicians, graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty will receive career development advice in the form of individual development plans and research performance progress reports. Finally, we will engage in public outreach programs that will draw on diverse communities in Chicago, Buffalo and Memphis."
"9479883","The goal of the renewal proposal is to uncover how developmental programs establish brain circuitry controlling critical social and non-social behaviors. Our previous findings studying amygdala development have lead to a developmental transcription factor-centric model in which we hypothesize that development, connectivity and innate behavioral specificity of limbic subcircuits are differentially controlled by the embryonic expressed transcription factors, Dbx1 and Foxp2. We will test this model in three aims in which we will: 1) determine the limbic connectivity patterns of Dbx1- and Foxp2-derived neurons (Specific Aim 1), 2) the cell adhesion molecules regulated by Dbx1 and Foxp2 (Specific Aim 2) and 3) the function of Dbx1 and Foxp2 in the formation/maintenance of medial amygdala circuit function and social and non- social innate behaviors (Specific Aim 3). Testing of this hypothesis will be accomplished using a diverse and powerful combination of state of the art conditional mouse genetics, neuronal circuit mapping and gene profiling approaches along with electrophysiology and innate behavior tasks. By comprehensively integrating data from multiple levels of analyses, we will uncover how developmental programs establish brain circuitry that controls motivational and innate social and non-social behaviors. Moreover, as amygdala dysfunction is a prime feature of a host of prevalent human social and emotional disorders, including drug-addictive behaviors and autism spectrum disorders, this work is critical toward understanding how brain circuit dysfunction leads to substance abuse and addictive behaviors."
"9277546","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The loss of a spouse is a highly stressful event that puts people at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 20% to 53% of excess deaths during spousal bereavement. Stress, depression, and anxiety enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Indeed, psychological stress and depression promote transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) activation, a prime pathway for upregulating proinflammatory cytokine production. Importantly, inflammation is central to all stages of cardiovascular disease from initial lesion to end-stage thrombotic complications. Inflammation may be a key mechanism underlying CVD among the bereaved. Attachment theory is a useful framework for understanding individual differences in people's ability to adjust to the loss of a loved one. There are two patterns of attachment insecurity: attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance. People with high attachment anxiety use hyperactivating emotional coping strategies. People with high attachment avoidance are uncomfortable depending on others for support and use deactivating coping strategies that inhibit or suppress distressing experiences. Individual differences in attachment style may be prognostic for who is most at risk for enhanced inflammation and ultimately CVD after the loss of a spouse. Cardiac vagal tone (as reflected by respiratory sinus arrhythmia or RSA) is associated with self-regulation. Under stressful conditions individuals with low RSA display poorer self-regulatory control compared to those with high RSA. Low vagal tone is also a risk factor for CVD, partly due to elevations in inflammation. Recent work by this new/early stage investigator suggests that RSA and attachment style may jointly influence adjustment to a loss. This project builds upon these preliminary findings to examine mechanistic connections among attachment insecurity, depression, RSA, and inflammation cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with data on these key dimensions collected 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the spouse's death. Participants will be spouses of patients who recently passed away to stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and matched controls. If inflammation is an important mechanism underlying bereavement, both psychosocial and pharmaceutical interventions aimed at reducing inflammation would be an important step toward the development of treatments for bereaved individuals. These interventions may be especially important for people with certain psychological characteristics."
"9275832","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse is common among adolescents. Unfortunately, alcohol abuse during this vulnerable period of brain development can lead to long-term molecular and behavioral changes. A growing body of research suggests a role for microglia - the resident macrophages of the brain - in the detrimental effects of alcohol. This proposal outlines experiments to determine the long-term effects of adolescent alcohol on microglia and the role of microglia in the long-term effects of adolescent alcohol. Microglia normally exist in a resting state, but in response to insults can undergo activation. There are multiple types of microglial activation, each with different functional outcomes that range from destructive to reparative. Activation is frequently associated with increases in microglial markers, although this does not always indicate what functional changes have taken place. Previous studies find that adolescent alcohol treatment increases levels of microglial marker CD11b, an integrin component involved in process reorganization. However, increased CD11b does not indicate what functional changes - either toxic or healing - AIE has caused in the microglia. Aim 1 will investigate the long- term effects of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) treatment on microglial functional changes. Rats will be treated with AIE and microglia will be isolated during adulthood. Techniques such as flow cytometry, RT-PCR and ELISA will be used to assess changes in microglial markers and expression of pro-inflammatory and anti- inflammatory cytokines. Aim 2 will investigate the long-term effects of AIE on the microglial response to activating stimuli. Increased microglial markers such as CD11b are indicative of a phenomenon known as priming. When microglial are primed, they exhibit an enhanced response to activating stimuli. Various stimuli, such as stress and systemic inflammation, can activate microglia. Rats will be treated with AIE and challenged with either acute stress or systemic inflammation during adulthood. Immunohistochemistry will be used to examine the long-term effects of AIE on the microglial response to these activating stimuli. Lastly, Aim 3 will  determine the role of microglia in the long-term effects of AIE. A microglial inhibitor, ibudilast,  will be administered during AIE treatment. Molecular and behavioral changes caused by AIE, such as increased brain neuroimmune proteins, increased anxiety, and decreased cognitive function will be examined during adulthood. These studies will address important unanswered questions about the consequences of adolescent alcohol abuse. Very little is known about the long-term effects of adolescent alcohol on microglia or the contributions of microglia to the long-term effects of adolescent alcohol. The results have potential to change the way we think about the neurobiology of adolescent alcohol abuse. Given the widespread extent of adolescent alcohol abuse, these studies could help guide preventative strategies, or provide potential targets for pharmacotherapy."
"9328353","Trisomy 21 results from partial or complete duplication of chromosome 21. This disorder results in intellectual disabilities, cardiac defects, and distinct craniofacial abnormalities. Several studies have investigated the genetic origin of these defects. A candidate gene is the dual specificity kinase, Dyrk1a. Dyrk1a is an attractive target, given that Dyrk1a haploinsufficiency results in craniofacial defects as well. While the craniofacial defects induced by these genetic imbalances are distinct, a common feature is midface hypoplasia. Previous work in our laboratory has established Xenopus laevis as ideal organism to study development of the midface and primary palate. Previous investigations, by our laboratory and others, suggest that dyrk1a is expressed in the Xenopus face. I hypothesize that Dyrk1a is an important regulator of midface development and a dosage imbalance of dyrk1a results in the distinct features present in Trisomy 21 and Dryk1a haploinsufficiency. To test this hypothesis, I will utilize Xenopus to examine the expression of dyrk1a during orofacial development. I will investigate the effects of decreased dyrk1a, via pharmacological inhibition with INDY, a Dyrk1a-specific inhibitor, or antisense oligonucleotide morpholinos (Dyrk1a MO). To assess the effects of overexpression I will inject a verified, full-length Xenopus dyrk1a mRNA construct. I will perform simple face measurements and geometric morphometrics to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the effects of dyrk1a dosage imbalance. The cellular requirements and mechanisms of Dyrk1a signaling in the face remain to be elucidated. I will explore this by careful manipulation of the INDY treatment window and assessment of neural crest specification, migration, delamination, and differentiation. I expect to identify a role of Dyrk1a in one or more of these processes. To further investigate the requirements of Dyrk1a in the face, I will perform face transplantation assays with the dyrk1a MO. In Aim 2, I will investigate the role of retinoic acid (RA) in the regulation of Dyrk1a. Dyrk1a was identified our lab as a target of RA, in a large genomic screen of developing embryos with diminished RA signaling. A dosage imbalance of RA, whether increased or decreased, results in midfacial hypoplasia and a midfacial cleft. I hypothesize that RA inhibits the expression of dyrk1a. RA-mediated repression is known regulate levels of fgf8 in the developing embryo and preliminary data from our lab suggest that inhibition of RA can synergize with dyrk1a to produce facial abnormalities. I will examine dryk1a levels in an excess RA paradigm, and examine if artificially modulating RA levels induces the expected change in dyrk1a. If this is the case, increased RA will result in decreased dyrk1a and vice versa. I will conclude this aim by investigating the possibility of forcing the dosage imbalance, increasing the dosage of RA, and rescuing the midfacial phenotype induced by increased dyrk1a. These studies will further the understanding of the role of Dyrk1a during midfacial development and provide insight into the midfacial abnormalities associated with Trisomy 21 and Dyrk1a haploinsufficiency."
"9273891","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Although routine endoscopic screening and early surgical intervention has reduced the incidence of CRC mortality, the five-year survival rate of patients with advanced disease is less than 10%. Genomic studies have suggested key genes that drive CRC initiation and progression but this information has yet to produce effective new therapies, in part, because current models to validate cancer drivers and new therapeutic targets in CRC are slow and cumbersome. This proposal aims to develop and utilize new murine models of colorectal cancer (CRC) to define genetic requirements for cancer progression and therapy response. To this end, we implement a novel approach to validate cancer drivers and therapeutic targets using orthotopic colon stem cell transplants that form focal colon tumors and progress to malignant disease. This circumvents the problems associated with transgenic mouse models, which i) rarely develop colon tumors and ii) do not live long enough to develop metastases due to small intestinal tumor burden. We have previously developed a robust model of APC loss in the colon using short hairpin RNAs targeting APC and showed that APC loss is required for disease maintenance of the primary tumor (14). My plan focuses on two future directions from that study: i) to test if Apc restoration in later CRC stages (Stage II, III, or IV will result in disease regression, and ii) to test if Smad4 mutations abrogate the dependence on hyperactive WNT signaling conferred by Apc loss in CRC. Successful completion of the project will produce new CRC models, validate potential cancer drivers, and identify key determinants that influence the action of WNT pathway inhibitors."

"9253962","SUMMARY Sepsis is a medical condition caused by an overwhelming systemic inflammatory response to infection. Although the underlying infection can now be efficiently treated with antibiotics, there are no effective therapies to control the organ damage caused by the inflammatory response of the host. As a result, sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in intensive care units and is the tenth leading cause of death overall in the US. The ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPDase) CD39 is a cell surface-associated anti- inflammatory enzyme. It has multiple anti-inflammatory actions, which include degradation of the endogenous proinflammatory molecule adenosine triphosphate and triggering of the production of the anti-inflammatory agent adenosine. We have discovered that endogenous CD39 protects mice against polymicrobial sepsis- induced mortality, organ damage, and inflammation. Similarly, injecting a soluble E-NTPDase/CD39 mimic (apyrase) is protective. Based on these results, we propose exogenously administered soluble E-NTPDase as a novel and effective therapy for sepsis. However, apyrase, an E-NTPDase/CD39 mimic of plant origin, is likely to provoke a hazardous antibody response in humans preventing its use as a therapeutic agent for septic patients. To overcome this problem, in the current proposal we will evaluate the effect of an optimized human recombinant soluble E-NTPDase (APT102) in sepsis. Our hypothesis is that APT102 would reduce mortality, organ injury, and inflammation in sepsis. To address this hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the efficacy of APT102 in preventing mortality in polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture in mice. In Specific Aim 2, we will delineate the effect of APT102 on organ injury and inflammation in sepsis. We expect that APT102 will reduce mortality, organ injury, and inflammation in septic mice. The long-term goal of this study is to develop APT102 as a safe and effective treatment option for the management of patients with sepsis."

"9254849","Abstract While highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly improved the health of individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV), available therapeutics largely target virus replication pathways such that treatment interruption results in the rapid resumption of viral replication and decline of immunologic function. Even despite successful therapeutic control of replication, chronic inflammation, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities further threaten the health of an estimated 1.2 million HIV-infected people in the U.S. New therapeutic strategies capable of longer term virus suppression and reductions in the sources of persistent virus would relieve consequences of daily drug compliance and comorbidities for over 34 million HIV-infected people globally. Jericho Sciences? investigational small molecule, FX101, is proposed to target the highly conserved zinc finger domains of lentiviral nucleocapsid (NC) proteins, a well-established therapeutic target for the treatment of HIV. FX101 has demonstrated preclinical safety and antiviral efficacy in multiple in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro models to support continuing translational testing. Zinc finger domains (ZFDs) of HIV nucleocapsid (NC) protein are highly conserved therapeutic targets shared across all lentiviruses, including feline, simian and human immunodeficiency viruses (FIV, SIV and HIV, respectively). Following eight monotherapeutic doses of FX101 over four weeks in chronically FIV-infected cats ? one of the research models for HIV ? blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid viremia remained 85-95% below corresponding pretreatment levels up to 36 weeks following cessation of treatment, in the absence of observed or measured adverse events (p<0.0005; n=6; one-way ANOVA). These results are unprecedented in FIV-infected cats. Concurrently, integrated provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells continued to decrease by 95% from the normalized starting virus load (p<0.0001; n=6; one-way ANOVA). While we have yet to fully elucidate mechanistic implications of the nucleocapsid target profile, the most differentiating feature is the potential long term control of virus production in an apparent systemic reduction of virus replication setpoint. We propose here to conduct translational testing of FX101 in a simian immunodeficiency virus-infected nonhuman primate (SIV/NHP) model to establish the safety profile, therapeutic efficacy, and clinical biomarkers that may implicate this strategic candidate molecule?s potential utility toward a cotherapeutic functional eradication of HIV infection in humans. ."
"9259888","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUDs) are common in HIV-infected patients, little is known about the efficacy and comparative effectiveness of ASUD treatments in HIV-infected populations. Further, because few individuals with ASUD receive high quality ASUD treatment of any type, understanding the factors associated with initiating, engaging, and remaining in ASUD treatment is at least as important as the specific type of treatment. Understanding issues of treatment initiation, engagement, and retention is critical to advancing comparative effectiveness research in ASUD, particularly as provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are implemented. We will use the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) to study the comparative effectiveness and delivery of ASUD treatment in HIV-infected Veterans. VACS is a large multisite, national study with 2 main components: 1) a Virtual Cohort of 44,180 HIV-infected Veterans and 88.360 uninfected comparators on which we have access to administrative, pharmacy, laboratory, pathology, health service utilization, and linked Medicaid/Medicare data; and 2) VACS 8, a prospective cohort of 3631 HIV-infected and 3693 matched HIV-uninfected Veterans that adds annual self-report survey information to data available in the Virtual Cohort. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Compare the effectiveness of initiation, engagement, and retention in different types of ASUD treatment on quality of HIV care, virologic suppression, and costs in HIV-infected Veterans with ASUD; 2) Identify predictors of initiation, engagement, and retention in ASUD treatment in HIV- infected Veterans; and 3) Assess effects of ACA insurance expansion on initiation, engagement, and retention in ASUD treatment for HIV-infected Veterans. Aims 1 and 2 will use the VACS Virtual Cohort and Aim 3 will use the VACS 8 prospective cohort. For Aim 1, we will use a quasi-experimental, propensity-score adjusted, difference-in-differences analysis of outcomes before and after new ASUD treatment episodes in VACS Virtual Cohort participants. For Aim 2, we will conduct time-updated, generalized estimating equations logistic regression analyses to identify independent predisposing, enabling, and need predictors of initiation, engagement, and retention in ASUD treatment among HIV-infected VACS Virtual Cohort participants. For Aim 3, we will use a mixed-methods approach to prospectively assess HIV-infected VACS 8 participants with ASUD over several years as the ACA insurance expansion occurs. Achieving these aims will provide real world estimates of which ASUD strategies are associated with the best outcomes in a national sample of vulnerable HIV-infected patients and identify factors associated with increased engagement and retention in treatment."
"9277731","CANCER CELL SIGNALING PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Cancer Cell Signaling (CCS) program at the Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center (MCC) consists of a multidisciplinary group of 22 investigators from 9 academic departments from the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, and the College of Humanities and Sciences who share a common interest in elucidating the cellular and molecular signaling events that are dysregulated during neoplastic transformation and progression and in developing methodologies to target these cancer-specific signaling events. CCS program members share the overarching scientific goals of: (1) examining the role of bioactive lipids in cancer cell signaling; (2) identifying key signaling networks of cell growth, cell death, apoptosis, ER stress, and autophagy that are perturbed in cancer cells; (3) understanding the interactions among metabolites, inflammation, bioenergetics, and the microenvironment that affect tumorigenesis. By achieving a greater understanding of cancer cell signaling, the initial goal of these themes is to identify potential therapeutic strategies and to move them into preclinical testing. The ultimate goal of these themes is to develop rational bases for combining interventions using these targets in a patient-specific, precision medicine manner and to translate them into more effective therapeutics. The CCS program has a funding base of $6 million in annual direct support, of which $5.5 million are funding of cancer-related projects from NIH and other peer-reviewed funding sources. The funding base includes 7 funded projects from NCI, with a total of $1.27 million in annual direct costs. The CCS program has a strong commitment to training. The CCS program develops and cultivates intra- and interprogrammatic interactions through regular meetings among the program membership, as well as focused discussion groups with overlapping research interests, monthly invited seminars, and an annual retreat. These approaches have led to numerous collaborations that yield novel approaches and collaborative grants as funding sources. The success of this broad, interdisciplinary approach to cancer research is evident from the track record of CCS program investigators, with 424 publications since 2011, of which 20% represent intraprogrammatic collaborations, 36% are interprogrammatic collaborations, and 16% represent to both intra- and interprogrammatic collaborations. Moreover, the CCS program has developed a number of initiatives that have progressed from basic laboratory studies to 9 phase I or II clinical trials."
"9314107","This proposal is for a mentored research award to support Dr. Rosa Xicola's career development while she identifies the molecular etiology of uncommon phenotypes of hereditary cancer. Lynch syndrome (LS), is a multi-cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations in Mismatch Repair (MMR) genes that result in microsatellite unstable (MSI) tumors. Over half of presumed LS cases do not have germline mutations in MMR genes and these are referred to as Lynch-Like Syndrome (LLS). LLS patients are treated as LS patients and go through strict, invasive cancer surveillance. We hypothesize that there is a sizable group of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a genetically predisposing cancer condition due to germline variants in DNA repair genes that trigger genomic instability and consequently cancer development, with or without MSI. This could likely explain a number of the familial occurrences of multiple different tumors, such as breast and CRC. The goal of this proposal is to determine the extent to which mutations in DNA repair genes contribute to cancer development in patients with a strong family history of CRC or breast cancer. To accomplish this objective, this proposal pursues the following Specific Aims:  1) Determine the prevalence and functional implications of DNA repair loss of function variants in the cancer development of LLS patients. 2) Identify the tumor mutation landscape that triggers tumor development in LLS patients. 3) Identify DNA repair gene variants in a highly characterized group of young cancer patients with family history of cancer that lack known mutations in cancer predisposition genes.  This proposal has the potential to have a significant clinical impact; establishing the genetic cause of undefined cancer syndromes could allow us to tailor both cancer prevention and treatment. Moreover, this proposal might identify the missing molecular link to explain familial co-segregation of the most common cancers, colorectal and breast.  Through this award, Dr. Xicola will acquire and hone advanced skills in genetics, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She will also master the techniques required to engineer the genetic changes that she identifies into cell lines and investigate their biological effect on cancer development. The training and career development plan that has been created with her mentor, Dr. Joann Sweasy and co-mentor Dr. Allen Bale at Yale University along with her team of advisors, will support her independence by providing her with a well-defined expertise. After this award, Dr. Xicola will expand her research program as an independent investigator addressing the unanswered questions related to genetic regulation of hereditary cancer."
"9238190","It is generally believed that CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T-cells (Tregs) inhibit effective immunity to microbial pathogens. In humans, we and others have found increased numbers of CD4+Foxp3+ T-cells in TB patients. We also found that in persons with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), Tregs expand in response to Mycobacterium. tuberculosis (Mtb), produce TGF-ß and IL-10 and inhibit IFN-? production by CD4+ and CD8+ cells, suggesting that they may limit tissue inflammation and destruction. However, in humans, some activated T-cells express Foxp3 transiently and these cells lack classical regulatory function. Recently we made a surprising observation that a subpopulation of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells from persons with LTBI inhibits growth of M.tb in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). A soluble factor, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (D4GDI), produced by apoptotic CD4+CD25+ Foxp3+D4GDI+ cells is responsible for this inhibition of M.tb growth in human macrophages and in mice. Our study provides the first evidence that a subpopulation of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells enhances immunity to M. tb, and identified a novel IFN-? independent but T-cell dependent mechanism that inhibits M. tb growth in human macrophages. This proposal will determine the role of D4GDI in M.tb infection through the following specific aims. Aim 1. Determine the mechanisms by which D4GDI inhibit mycobacterial growth. Aim 2. Characterize the phenotype and function of D4GDI-producing FoxP3+ cells in LTBI+ individuals and tuberculosis patients. Aim 3. Determine the relevance of expansion of D4GDI+Foxp3+ cells to progression of LTBI to active TB."

More than 200 human lung disease-relevant iPSC clones, and their gene-edited progeny, are now banked in the Center for Regenerative Medicine (CReM) of Boston University/Boston Medical Center, providing an unprecedented opportunity for any basic scientist to derive an inexhaustible supply of patient-derived lung epithelial, vascular, immune, or interstitial cells. These cells containing each patient's own genetic background are now available for in vitro human lung disease modeling, drug screening of personalized therapeutics, and the development of future lung regeneration cell-based therapies. The most valuable human clones in this bank not only carry the most common lung disease-inducing mutations (e.g. mutations in loci encoding CFTR, Alpha-1 antitrypsin, BMPR2, SPC, SPB, ABCA3, and NKX2.1), but also carry knock-in fluorochrome reporters targeted to specific loci through state-of-the-art gene editing technologies. In parallel, the bank also includes 50 mouse iPSC clones generated from transgenic or knock-in mice that carry well characterized fluorochrome reporters of lung lineages (SPC-GFP, T1a-GFP, Tie2-GFP, SMA-GFP, and Nkx2.1-GFP). We propose to establish this cell bank through four specific aims to accomplish the goals of: a) national sharing of iPSCs that comprise a critical resource in high demand by both basic and clinical lung researchers, b) establishment of quality assurance approaches and methods for banking an exhaustive panel of human and mouse lines carrying the most common gene mutations and lung lineage reporter genes required by the majority of U.S. lung researchers in the years ahead, c) development of a formalized education and training program able to nationally disseminate the expertise required to fully harness these new tools and differentiate them into lung lineages, and d) self-sustained maintenance of the bank financially, logistically, and educationally."
"9270589","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) is one of the most major challenges faced by society today, claiming hundreds of thousands of American lives each year and costing more than 30 billion Medicare dollars annually. The ultimate goal of this research is to create an unobtrusive wearable system for continuously monitoring HF patients in naturalistic settings, automatically assessing their risk of experiencing an exacerbation, and providing feedback to caregivers and the patients themselves. The central innovation that will support these efforts is the proposed measurement of hemodynamic responses to stressors experienced in normal activities of daily living (e.g., walking, climbing stairs). The measurement of such hemodynamic responses will be enabled by wearable ballistocardiography (BCG). The following four specific aims are proposed for the research: (1) to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in the genesis of wearable ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals; (2) to develop novel predictive analytics algorithms for BCG signals measured from HF patients at home; (3) to design and implement a wearable sensing system for estimating cardiac output (CO), blood pressure (BP), and indirect calorimetry from ambulant subjects; and (4) to evaluate the wearable sensing system with healthy and HF patients during cardiopulmonary stress testing, and to pilot the new system at home for a small population of patients. The first aim will build a strong foundation for better understanding the wearable BCG signal - a measurement of body vibrations in response to the heartbeat - and will inform the placement and modality of the sensor for optimizing the sensing. Furthermore, the evaluation of this wearable prototype will include usability testing to assess comfort and robustness to practical challenges (e.g., motion artifacts, the device rubbing on clothing), and based on the results the design will be refined and improved. While we anticipate that the wearable will provide the best solution, the project risk is mitigated through the more mature, existing scale- based system. Successful completion of this project could ultimately reduce HF related hospitalizations, and thus both improve quality of life for elderly Americans, and reduce overall healthcare costs."

"9265435","Project 2: Molecular and clinical inputs affecting optimization of glioma therapy  Project Summary / Abstract:  Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most malignant and common of the primary brain tumors and are divided into  several molecular subgroups denoted PN-GBM, MES-GBM and CL-GBM. Because of a subset of cells with  stem-like properties, these tumors are relatively insensitive to DNA damaging agents, such as radiation (XRT),  and are consequently highly resistant to therapy. In PN-GBM the stem-like cells live adjacent to blood vessels,  in the perivascular niche (PVN). In other GBM subtypes, stem-like cells are distributed throughout the tumors.  In order to identify better GBM therapies, we need to improve our understanding of the biology of stem- and  non-stem-like GBM cells as a function of molecular subtype. We have previously demonstrated that the  dynamic inter-conversion of these two cell types occurs within hours of therapy and can be successfully  mathematically modeled, providing a basis for optimizing radiation schedules to maximize survival in mouse  models of PN-GBM. However, optimum radiation administration schedules for other GBM subtypes are  unknown. Additionally, standard of care calls for the administration of adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ)  concurrently with radiation. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that (1) a mathematical model of  radiation and TMZ response in MES-GBM will be different than that for PN-GBM, (2) a mathematical model of  radiation and TMZ response in MES-GBM will be different than that for PN-GBM, (3) there are biological  characteristics of GBM that, if altered, would fundamentally enhance the responses of all GBMs regardless of  subtype. We propose three specific aims to test these hypotheses: Aim 1: Improve our understanding of the  PVN in PN-GBM and use this understanding to optimize combined TMZ/XRT therapy. Aim 2: Create a  mathematical model of radiation response in MES-GBM where the stem cells are more evenly distributed. Aim  3. Identify strategies that would improve the standard of care for all GBM regardless of subtype. Our goal is to  translate our findings into future clinical trials."

"9269458","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are multiprotein channels that penetrate the nuclear envelope and connect the nucleus with the cytoplasm. Besides controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport, NPCs are involved in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation. Changes in the composition of these structures have been recently linked to myoblast differentiation, suggesting a role for specialized NPCs in muscle physiology. In adults, muscle regeneration and repair requires the efficient function of satellite cells. Upon injury, these muscle stem cells are induced to proliferate, differentiate into myoblasts and fuse to regenerate muscle fibers. Because satellite cells are essential for muscle repair and regeneration, transplantation of these cells represents a promising therapy for the treatment of damaged muscle, muscular dystrophies and sarcopenia. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of satellite cell function has become of great interest for regenerative medicine. Previous studies have found that the expression of the nuclear pore complex protein Nup210 is required for myoblast differentiation and survival, indicating an essential role for this protein i skeletal muscle differentiation and regeneration. Additionally, up-regulation of Nup210 levels in myoblasts has been shown to accelerate myogenesis, suggesting that modulation of its activity could be exploited to stimulate muscle regeneration. The overall objectives of this proposal are to establish the molecular mechanisms through which the nucleoporin Nup210 regulates myogenesis and to define its function in muscle formation and maintenance, with the ultimate goal of defining its potential as a therapeutic target for muscle regeneration. By combining in vivo and in vitro genetic approaches with muscle injury studies we expect to establish the role of Nup210 in muscle formation, growth and repair (Aim 1) and define the molecular mechanisms of myogenic regulation by Nup210 (Aim 2). In addition, we will determine if modulating the activity of this nuclear pore complex component can stimulate muscle regeneration and reverse the myogenic defects of dystrophic myoblasts. Defining the function of Nup210 in muscle physiology and understanding its molecular mechanisms of action are critical steps to determine whether this pathway could be used to develop therapies directed to stimulate muscle healing and prevent muscle degeneration. Our contribution here is expected to be a detailed understanding of the role of Nup210 in myogenesis, muscle development and muscle regeneration. These studies will significantly advance our knowledge of how changes in nuclear pore complex composition and function regulate these processes and could uncover new targets on which therapies to improve muscle function or prevent muscle degeneration can be developed."
"9343414","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY - Project 1  High-order assembly of MegaTrans complexes for hormone-independent enhancer activation Endocrine therapy is commonly used in hormone-driven breast and prostate cancers. A persistent challenge is disease progression caused by hormone resistance during the treatment. Studies for the past 25 years have revealed an essential role of hormones (i.e., estrogen and androgen) and their receptors, ER? and AR, in cancer progression. Increased evidence indicates that epigenetic deregulation of ER?/AR-bound enhancers profoundly alters hormone-mediated transcription machineries, leading to the development of hormone resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this hormone-resistance transition of enhancer function are largely unknown. We have recently discovered that the most active and functionally important ER?-bound enhancers can recruit a large number of DNA-binding transcription factors through protein-protein interactions. These newly identified ER? `co-activators', termed MegaTrans transcription factors (TFs), are required to activate ER?-bound enhancers and also serve as a signature of functional enhancers. Our preliminary data additionally show the presence of MegaTrans TFs in AR-bound enhancers. Because most MegaTrans TFs are signaling-dependent molecules, they may receive other signals from tumor microenvironments to alter enhancer functions. Thus, combinatorial interactions between ER?/AR and MegaTrans TFs make their enhancers respond not only to estrogen or androgen, but also to other microenvironmental signals. We hypothesize that the composition and interaction of MegaTrans TFs undergo dynamic changes during cancer progression, resulting in alterations of ER?/AR enhancer functions that promote hormone-resistance in breast and prostate cancer cells. In Aim 1, we will use a biotin-tagged approach coupled with mass spectrometry and ChIP-seq to investigate dynamic changes of MegaTrans TFs during hormone-resistance transition and their binding patterns at ER?/AR-bound enhancers. We will also use GRO-seq to define nascent RNAs that are differentially transcribed in hormone-sensitive vs. -resistant conditions and use CLIP-seq to identify enhancer non-coding RNAs (eRNAs) that are functionally linked to MegaTrans TFs. In Aim 2, we will use computational algorithms to model changes of ER?/AR-regulated transcription programs that are dependent on different combinations of MegaTrans TFs and other cis-binding factors. Then, we will computationally characterize combinatorial interaction patterns of different TFs and DNA and correlate these changes with signaling networks or microenvironmental cues. In Aim 3, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing and single-cell approaches to prove the functional linkage of candidate MegaTrans drivers and hormone-resistance and metastasis. Consistent with the overall goal of our proposed U54 center, these studies will provide insights into the characteristics or epigenetic changes of ER?/AR- bound enhancers that are influenced by different microenvironmental cues during the progression from hormone-sensitive to hormone-resistant cancers."
"9343412","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY ? Core 1 Data Analysis and Management Core A huge amount of high-throughput sequencing data is expected to be generated from TCC, ChIP-ePENS, BirA-BLRP-seq, ChIP-seq, MBDCap-seq, CLIP-seq, GRO-seq, and population-cell or single-cell RNA-seq assays and proteomic analysis in the three projects of the proposed SA-OSU Research Center for Cancer Systems Biology (SA-OSU RCCSB). Thus, it is critical to establishing a central data process hub in order to meet the scientific missions and goals of our center. The Data Analysis and Management Core (DAMC) will ensure a unified approach to data analysis and management for all three projects, including the following tasks: 1) implementing and maintaining new software tools for computational models developed in the three projects and intra-center pilot projects; 2) designing and supporting the data analysis flow using existing public or our own software tools; 3) managing data submission to public archives, maintaining data repository and exploring data visualization; and 4) coordinating with the Data Coordination Center (DCC) within the Research Centers for Cancer Systems Biology (RCCSB) Consortium. To accomplish these tasks, the DAMC will leverage existing infrastructure and computational expertise at University of Texas at San Antonio of both Health Science Center (UTHSCSA) and Academics (UTSA), the Ohio State University, and Baylor College of Medicine. We will establish a leadership team to develop and coordinate ongoing support of cancer omics research and to communicate monthly with the Executive Committee in the Administrative Core. Members of the DAMC leadership team include the leader of the DAMC and senior investigators of the three projects - Drs. Jin (Chair), Ruan, Weintraub, and Li who have extensive experience in large-scale data management, computational, statistical, genomic and proteomic analyses, and coordination of data analytic efforts within multi-project centers. Members of the DAMC will also be involved in all phases of project planning, from design to execution, to ensure that the flow of data from projects to the relevant cores and is well-coordinated."

"9221542","Project Summary. Despite the development of effective human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, it has been estimated that there will be over 200,000 new cases and over 100,000 deaths due to cervical cancer by 2020 in India, which has 25% of the global burden of cases. Cervical cancer screening by Pap smears and HPV DNA testing has become standard of care in the US and Europe, but has been too expensive and logistically challenging in low and middle income countries (LMICs). A simple, point-of-care (POC) biomarker panel for high-grade dysplasia and cervical cancer could provide a cost-effective means for triage of cervical disease in these countries. HPV infection induces systemic humoral immune responses with IgG antibodies to HPV- derived proteins. We have previously identified antibodies to a panel of five HPV antigens that detect up to 88% of patients with HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer, but less than 4% of healthy controls. Using an expanded panel of 16 HPV antigens, we have detected at least one HPV antibody in the sera of 45% of CIN II/III cervical dysplasia. These results support the development of a rapid, quantitative, and multiplexed assay for the detection of HPV-related cervical disease. We leverage our protein microarray technology with advances in fluorescent technologies to enable a fluorescent, programmable, multiplexed ELISA (serologic) assay for HPV- specific IgG antibodies in a compact and disposable configuration with high analytic sensitivity and rapid, quantitative output. Our preliminary work in this area has demonstrated detection of IgG antibodies to HPV antigens with lower limits of detection in the 10pg/mL range, which is a 100-fold improvement over existing colorimetric approaches. Under our proposed effort, we aim to develop and demonstrate a prototype multiplexed fluorescent programmable point-of-care assay with high analytical sensitivity for the simultaneous detection of 16 individual HPV-specific IgG serologic biomarkers from a single finger stick-sized patient blood sample which can be manufactured for a total reagent cost of less than $1/patient sample. We will leverage our expertise in immunoassay development with expertise in microfluidics, electrical engineering, optics, biomarker analytical and clinical validation to target the device and assays for the LMIC clinical setting. We will also provide a clinical platform and biorepository to rapidly evaluate emerging technologies for cervical screening. This proposal will adapt the engineering and biochemistry for the development of robust POC devices for detection of HPV serology specifically for low and middle-income countries. We will transfer and evaluate this technology, screening 13,000 patients in India, with a team of collaborators in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, India."
"9480135","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Estimates indicate that drug abuse and addiction cost the U.S. economy nearly one half-trillion dollars per year. Addiction to cocaine is characterized by compulsive drug taking behavior, despite adverse consequences. The mechanisms driving this behavior are not well understood, but involve stress, which can trigger craving. In animal models this is attributed to an interaction between the neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and glutamate in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA). However, there remains a lack of understanding of the cellular mechanism underlying this interaction. This hampers the development of effective pharmacological treatment strategies for drug abuse and addiction. The long-term objective of this proposal is to identify cellular abnormalities in the VTA that may provide effective therapeutic targets to restore function and thereby prevent relapse to drug seeking. In dopamine neurons, firing patterns are regulated in part by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which mediate a firing 'pause' through activation of calcium activated potassium (sK) channels. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that cocaine-induced changes in neuroplasticity in VTA dopamine neurons result from a deficiency in post-synaptic glutamatergic neurotransmission. To explore the interaction between CRF and glutamate-inhibition in dopamine neurons, we will record currents mediated by mGluRs that are coupled to inhibitory sK channels. Patch-clamp recordings will be performed in acute brain slices from rats trained to self-administer cocaine and control (yoked saline) rats, before or afte yohimbine-induced reinstatement. The functional impact of and the mechanism underlying the CRF-R2/mGluR receptor interaction is unknown and will be investigated in Aim-1 and Aim-2. Aim-3 will manipulate cellular targets in vivo and validate the changes in cocaine-reinstatement and the underlying mGluR/sK channel inhibition. The hypothesis that is central to this proposal is that the CRF-R2 signaling cascade is upregulated by chronic cocaine self-administration and depresses mGluR mediated inhibition during reinstatement, and that amelioration of this cocaine-induced pathology will inhibit cocaine-seeking. The results of the proposed experiments are expected to positively influence human health because they should identify novel cellular targets for development of improved therapies to treat stress-related drug-seeking behaviors."
"9480142","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cocaine use disorder remains a significant health problem in the United States, and effective and safe pharmacotherapeutic approaches are urgently needed to maximize treatment success and minimize lapses to drug use. The cycling course of cocaine use disorder is tied to a multitude of behavioral and cognitive processes with impulsivity (rapid unplanned reactions to stimuli without regard for the consequences) and cue reactivity (attentional bias toward cocaine-associated cues) cited as two key phenotypes that set up vulnerability to relapse even years into recovery. The serotonin (5-HT) system provides modulatory control over impulsivity and cue reactivity, particularly through the G protein-coupled 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2CR). Data suggest that dampened 5- HT2CR signaling capacity may contribute to phenotypic vulnerability to relapse and that normalization of 5-HT2CR tone may be useful to suppress relapse promoted by impulsivity and cue reactivity. We hypothesize that a small molecule positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the 5-HT2CR that augments the response to endogenous 5-HT and/or an exogenous 5-HT2CR orthosteric ligand is a novel strategy to restore 5-HT2CR function. The present grant is built upon our progress in the rational design, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of new chemical entities based upon the only reported selective 5-HT2CR PAM PNU-69176E. We have synthesized new small molecules (e.g., CYD-1-79, CYD-3-30, CYD-6-16-2) which exhibit initial profiles as 5-HT2CR PAMs (functional signaling in live cells, radioligand binding assays) and reasonable oral and brain bioavailability. In vivo behavioral studies demonstrated that CYD-1-79, at doses that do not affect general motor activity, enhanced the effects of a selective 5-HT2CR agonist in drug discrimination analyses, and suppressed impulsivity and cue reactivity in rats, indicating efficacy in primary animal models pertinent to relapse in cocaine use disorder. Our objective is to optimize 5-HT2CR PAMs with a favorable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK) profile, and analyze select molecules in proof-of-concept behavioral models to support therapeutic potential for cocaine use disorder. To accomplish our objective, we will: (1) design, synthesize and optimize 5-HT2CR PAMs; (2) define selectivity and specificity and DMPK profiles of 5-HT2CR PAMs in vitro; and (3) determine DMPK in vivo and efficacy of optimized 5-HT2CR PAMs in rodent models of impulsivity and cue reactivity. This innovative, potentially high impact small molecule development project will elucidate important new information about the chemical neurobiology of 5-HT2CR allosteric modulation, and drive new concepts and directions in cocaine use disorder and anti-relapse medications."
"9481354","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Superfund Research Program at The University of Iowa (ISRP) is a joint endeavor involving basic, mechanistic, and applied research projects in biomedical and environmental research areas addressing semi- volatile polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The overall goal of the ISRP is to identify atmospheric sources, exposures, and potential consequences to human health of semi-volatile PCBs. To achieve this goal, the ISRP addresses volatilization, transport and resultant exposure of lower halogenated PCBs, especially those PCBs that are associated with contaminated waters, former industrial sites, and buildings (especially school buildings). We plan to identify routes of exposure with an eye to preventing or limiting exposure and ameliorating the effects. The ISRP brings together 17 scientists, representing 7 departments in 5 colleges, and two universities. Working together, we will measure sources, transport and environmental exposure of PCBs (Projects 4 and 6); their distribution, metabolism and toxicity in animals and humans (Projects 1, 3 and 7); and novel methods of phytoremediation (Project 5). Proposed studies include a community-based participatory research project-an of exposures to citizens who live or work in the vicinity of sources of lower chlorinated PCBs in the Chicago Metropolitan area. We enjoy the cooperation of citizen groups in Chicago, IL and East Chicago, IN where many ethnic-minority citizens are living below the poverty line near de- industrialized sites. Our research projects and overall efficiency are supported by six cores: Administration, Synthesis, Analytical, Training, Research Translation and Community Engagement - which assist the projects in coordination, information transfer, design and analysis of experiments, and assessment of research. The Synthesis Core synthesizes all compounds/mixtures to be studied, while the Analytical Core provides critical compositional information from metabolism to movement. Community Engagement and Research Translation Cores transmit research findings to a variety of stakeholders and involve those stakeholders in research activities. A Training Core and the research projects provide for the training of 16 students and postdoctoral scholars each year (70 have been trained in the previous funding period). The assessment / evaluation process culminates in an annual meeting of our 8-member External Advisory Committee. Overall this multidisciplinary program brings a broad range of experience and expertise, and institutional resources, to bear on problems associated with Superfund chemicals that are critical to the Midwest and the nation."
"9314032","7. Project Summary/Abstract The purpose of this K01 proposal is to provide Dr. Jinnie Rhee with the protected time and resources to allow her to pursue the training needed to reach her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator in patient-centered clinical research, and an expert in diabetes epidemiology. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains a challenge due to the complexity of multiple medication regimens that are often needed, and the required pharmacological dose adjustments and contraindications of several conventional antidiabetic medications. Barriers to achieving optimal T2DM management in CKD may include low patient adherence, and conservative provider prescription decision- making, resulting from lack of long-term data on the safety and effectiveness regarding benefits and harms of certain medication classes over others in patients with CKD, particularly for newer medications with which there has been little clinical experience in the CKD population. The objective of the proposed research is to better understand the comparative safety and effectiveness of various strategies aimed to manage T2DM in CKD, and to understand factors that currently influence patient and provider choice of these strategies through a series of quantitative and qualitative studies. In Aim 1, Dr. Rhee will conduct a descriptive study to quantify patterns of conventional and newer antidiabetic medication use across different stages of CKD, and examine proportions of each medication prescribed by an endocrinologist, nephrologist, or primary care physician. In Aim 2, Dr. Rhee will use a detailed administrative database to compare the safety and effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists versus conventional antidiabetic medications by examining associations with cardiovascular outcomes, glycemic control, weight gain, and hypoglycemia-related ED visits and hospitalizations. Effect modification by CKD stage will also be examined. In Aim 3, Dr. Rhee will conduct a qualitative study to understand: (1) the perspectives of patients on the use of antidiabetic drugs, including newer agents, and uncover perceived barriers to, and facilitators of, adherence; and (2) providers? perspectives on prescribing conventional and newer antidiabetic medications, and examine both clinical and nonclinical factors that influence their prescription decision-making. This award will allow Dr. Rhee to transition into a clinically-minded epidemiologist whose work goes beyond quantitative research. It will help her fill critical training gaps in the areas of advanced pharmacoepidemiology, health services research, and qualitative research. The detailed training plan includes formal coursework at Stanford University as well as seminars, meetings, research apprenticeships, directed readings, and attendance at national/international conferences. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant public health and clinical impact. The sum of experiences acquired through this K01 will help Dr. Rhee to successfully transition toward an independent clinical research career."

"9384686","Project Summary  This project brings together structural, biochemical, proteomic and genetic expertise at UCSF to provide a detailed understanding of the structure and post-translational regulation of a key virulence factor in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A hallmark of virulent, intracellular bacteria is their use of specialized secretion systems to inject proteins into mammalian cells. Multiple such systems are known in Gram-negative bacteria (termed the Type I-VI and VIII-IX) systems), but only one is found exclusively in Gram-positive bacteria: the type VII secretion (T7S) system. Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses multiple T7S systems to promote infection through secretion of effectors. In fact, the main genetic difference between the harmless vaccine strain BCG and pathogenic M. tuberculosis is the loss of the ESX-1 T7S system. T7S is also essential for abscess formation in Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogens may require T7S for virulence, as these systems are broadly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria. In this proposal we aim to build on our preliminary data regarding the basic mechanisms of T7S and unravel the biochemical and structural foundations of this complex biological machine."
"9479854","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant consequences associated with cannabis abuse have been identified, and rates of enrollment into treatment for adolescent substance abuse with cannabis as the primary substance continue to rise. Family- based and individual interventions show efficacy, yet, rates of sustained abstinence are low, and the majority fails to reduce substance use substantially. This renewal application proposes to extend our focus on developing efficacious treatments for teen substance use disorders. An initial Stage I project showed that an intervention comprising behavioral therapy (BT), contingency management via clinic- and parent-delivered abstinence incentives (CM), and behavioral parent training (BPT) improved abstinence rates during and post treatment. Findings from a Stage 2 trial indicate that (1) the intervention has a positive effect on abstinence, and (2) BPT does not enhance outcomes above that achieved with BT/CM. Although both studies indicate enhanced outcomes, a considerable proportion of teens did not achieve a substantial period of abstinence and relapse was common. Importantly, we observed that if teens achieved abstinence, this almost always occurred by Week 6. The goal of this proposal is to further develop this intervention to increase rates of abstinence and decrease relapse rates. We will test two novel strategies to enhance outcomes. Working Memory Training (WMT), an efficacious method for strengthening specific cognitive processes, aims to improve factors (e.g., delay discounting / impulsive decision-making) that have shown a strong relation to substance use and treatment response. Second, more intensive and higher magnitude CM (ICM) will be used to motivate abstinence among teens who are not abstinent by Week 6. We hypothesize that these strategies will improve outcomes by modifying a fundamental cognitive system involved in making choices to engage in risky behavior and by increasing motivation to abstain in early nonresponders. Aim 1 will pilot and refine the new procedures in a community clinic in preparation for the randomized trial. A sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) will allow us to determine the most effective first-line treatment and the most effective adaptive strategy (Aim 2). All teens wil begin treatment with BT/CM or BT/CM/WMT. After 6 weeks, responders will continue in their first-line treatments, while nonresponders will be randomized to ICM or to continue with first- lin treatment. Aim 3 will conduct mechanistic analyses to assess whether cognitive changes related to WMT engender increased abstinence, and whether specific tailoring variables moderate treatment effects. Aim 4 will gather formative data on implementation factors to inform future large-scale studies and dissemination efforts. Primary hypotheses are: (1) first-line treatment with WMT will improve abstinence outcomes and reduce relapse; (2) strategies with ICM for nonresponders will result in better outcomes than those without; (3) WMT will reduce delay discounting, which will predict outcome. The unique approach holds promise for reducing multiple types of risky behaviors by affecting basic mechanisms that determine impulsive decision-making."
"9273618","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is being submitted by Anna Zemke, MD PhD and entitled Nebulized Nitrite as a Novel Antimicrobial Therapy in Cystic Fibrosis. Dr. Zemke is a pulmonologist at the University of Pittsburgh and requires additional training in human subjects research to continue her professional development toward the long-term goal of conducting translational pulmonary research, with a focus on chronic bacterial infections. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to: (1) Gain an in-depth understanding of conducting pulmonary translational studies, (2) Become an expert in the biology of pulmonary bacterial infections, and (3) Become proficient at techniques used to study bacterial physiology. Integral to the training plan is the Certificate in Clinical Research Program, which includes needed statistical, ethical, and regulatory training. This work will be conducted within the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care at the University of Pittsburgh, which has a strong history of training physician- scientists and a superb infrastructure for both training Dr. Zemke and conducting the proposed translational research. The central objective of this research proposal is to develop nebulized sodium nitrite as an antimicrobial agent in cystic fibrosis (CF). Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal disease among Caucasian Americans and is marked by progressive respiratory failure and airway infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infects up to 80% of adults with CF, and grows in highly antibiotic resistant biofilms within the lung. Triggerin bacteria to disperse from biofilms may allow for improved clearance by the host and improved antibiotic efficacy. Sodium nitrite (AIR001) is an agent that combines antimicrobial activity, through the suppression of bacterial respiration, with the ability to disperse established biofilms When AIR001 is combined with colistimethate, it has additional activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms. AIR001 has not been tested in the CF population, but it has excellent safety data in pulmonary hypertension patients. The first research aim consists of proof-of-concept studies for developing nebulized nitrite and colistimethate combinations for treating P. aeruginosa airway infections in adults with CF. This aim tests the hypothesis that nebulization of nitrite and colistimethate is safe in subjects with CF and collects proof-of-concept efficacy data. The second aim will test the hypothesis that nitrite disperses biofilms in a nutritionally complex environment and then determine the mechanism of nitrite-induced biofilm dispersal. The combination of (1) formal human subjects research training;(2) hands-on, innovative research experience that includes both early phase safety protocols and further basic science; (3) an experienced, diverse mentorship team; and (4) the strong institutional environment of the Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Division at the University of Pittsburgh will equip Dr. Zemke for a career in translational pulmonary research."

"9328880","Abstract Lysosomal-rich enterocytes (LREs) are a specialized population of enterocytes in posterior mid-intestine of zebrafish that exhibit high fluid-phase endocytosis activity and possess a large supranuclear lysosomal vacuole. These cells resemble premature enterocytes that are found in the ileum of pre-weaning mammals, which are distinct from mature enterocytes for their ability to efficiently uptake and process nutrients, particularly milk macromolecules. The importance of premature enterocytes in the utilization of nutrients during neonatal stage is reported through many studies; however, the cellular processes mediating protein absorption and digestion in these enterocytes remains poorly understood. My long-term goal is to understand the mechanism of protein uptake and utilization in these specialized intestinal enterocytes of neonatal mammals by studying an analogous population of enterocytes in zebrafish, LREs. A recent study from my lab has shown that the expression of the endosomal membrane protein Plasmolipin (Pllp) is enriched in LREs and that Pllp is critical for differentiation and endocytic function of LREs. Building upon our recent discovery of the crucial regulator of LRE function, I will explore the key cellular processes occurring in LREs. The use of zebrafish as a model system will be advantageous for this study because the optical transparency of zebrafish embryos will enable visualization of various cellular processes. Thus, using zebrafish as a model, I aim to uncover the endocytic pathways mediating protein internalization and trafficking in LREs (Aim1) and the regulators of lysosomal vacuole biogenesis and function in LREs (Aim2). The findings of the proposed study will elucidate the cellular processes mediating protein absorption and transport in LREs and provide a novel insight into the mechanism of lysosomal vacuole biogenesis and function in LREs. Additionally, our findings could ultimately contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies to reduce the incidence and severity of neonatal protein malnutrition."
"9277255","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical developmental period during which many psychiatric symptoms first emerge. It has been argued that common alterations within the reward circuitry underlie the development of adolescent-onset psychiatric conditions. Addressing a critical need for the identification of biomarkers early in the course of psychopathologies, this RDoC project examines the neuroimmunology of specific reward processes in adolescents. Specifically, we focus on the clinical phenomenology of anhedonia, a salient feature across psychiatric conditions that often presents as a prodromal psychiatric symptom. However, anhedonia represents a final clinical outcome of several distinct PVS deficits. Therefore, this project examines Reward Expectancy (RE) versus Initial Responsiveness to Reward Attainment (IRRA), reflecting reward anticipation and receipt. This research investigates a novel theory hypothesizing that peripheral inflammation and associated striatal metabolic changes induce specific alterations in the reward circuitry that clinically manifest as anhedonia. We have studied the neuroimmunology and neuronal circuitry of anhedonia and found positive associations between peripheral activity of the kynurenine pathway (KP)-a central neuroimmunological pathway-and anhedonia severity in adolescents. Using MR spectroscopy (1H MRS), we documented associations between blood KP neurotoxins and striatal choline (biomarker for lipid peroxidation) in anhedonic adolescents along with inverse relationships between brain glutathione (antioxidant) and anhedonia severity in adults. Using fMRI, we mapped and identified distinct striatal-based intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) associated with anhedonia. Additionally, we developed the reward flanker task (RFT) that distinguishes between RE and IRRA. Building upon these compelling preliminary data, we propose a multimodal study to examine the neuroimmunology of specific PVS deficits. We will study 100 psychotropic-free adolescents with diverse psychiatric symptomology (NOS, or full syndromes) and 30 healthy controls group-matched, ages 12-18, Tanner e 4. The study will consist of comprehensive, systematic diagnostic procedures that include dimensional assessments of anhedonia, negative affect, fatigue, and sleep. Peripheral inflammatory measures will include KP activity along with activation status of innate and adaptive immune compartments and responses to both psychological and biological stresses. HPA axis will be indexed by saliva cortisol levels. CNS inflammation will be probed by 1H MRS by measuring chemicals reflecting oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial function in the striatum, a key region within the reward circuitry. Specific reward processes will be studied using the RFT and striatal based iFC."
"9277750","SUMMARY The rapid increase in developed countries over the past 30 years in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) suggests strongly environmental influences. Barrett?s esophagus (EAC), a precursor lesion for EAC, is increasing and associated with alterations in esophageal microbiota. Obesity, another risk factor for EAC, is associated with an altered gut microbiome. Gut bacteria are able to promote inflammation and cancer through activation of myeloid cells that contribute to regeneration and immunosuppression. In preliminary studies, we have examined microbiota and myeloid cells in our L2- IL-1? mouse model of BE. This mouse model shows alterations in the GE junction microbiome at 12 months compared to WT mice, and housing in germ-free (GF) conditions leads to reductions in inflammation, metaplasia and dysplasia. Under SPF conditions, L2-IL-1? mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) show alterations in the microbiome and increased GE junction tumors. GEJ metaplasia and dysplasia are also accelerated by treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which alters gastric microbiota, and by IL-8 expression, which mediates myeloid responses to microbes. Finally, we have developed tools (HDC-EGFP and HDC-DTR mice) that allow us to track or ablate immature myeloid cells/MDSCs that respond to microbes and promote gastrointestinal tumors. We propose 3 specific aims: (1) Define the role of gut microbiota in BE/EAC using the L2-IL-1b mouse model. The GE junction microbiota will be analyzed during disease progression using 16S rRNA sequencing, and the role in EAC determined by GF housing or antibiotic suppression, as well as by colonization with defined flora. (2) Do obesity and PPIs promote BE/EAC in part through microbiota? We will examine the effect of bacterial eradication on BE progression by HFD or PPIs. We will examine changes in microbiota in obese or slender BE patients. (3). Do bacteria induce BE/EAC primarily through myeloid cells? We will examine changes in myeloid cell trafficking to the GEJ in L2-IL-1? mice in response to microbiota and IL-8 using HDC-EGFP crosses, and assess their functional role through ablation and adoptive transfer. Taken together, these studies will define the potential role of microbiota in BE/EAC progression."
"9326702","Project Summary Despite impressive developments designing robust genetic circuits into bacteria, progress on the application of these approaches in complex environments has only recently been made and is still a general challenge. This is further complicated by issues arising from the release of engineered microbes into the environment, which may constitute ecological hazards.  The primary goal of this project is to understand the interplay between environmental signals and synthetic genetic circuits. I will first design sensors that can probe and report on the local inflammatory conditions inside the intestine, which could ultimately be used as diagnostics. I will also design sensors that can detect environmental conditions indicative of being outside the gut (e.g., oxygen or drop in temperature) and will trigger a kill switch that will cause any released bacteria to self-destruct. These methods will quantitatively assess how environmental signals regulate engineered pathways as well as facilitate the safe application of engineered organisms into real-world contexts.  The secondary goal is to create a foundation from which novel diagnostics and therapeutics can nondestructively function within the gut: a variable environment that is difficult to access. The gut microbiota maintains an intimate symbiotic relationship with the host; influencing multiple aspects of health, disease, and metabolism. Perturbations to its homeostasis can result in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, transfer of antibiotic resistance, obesity and diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, pathogenic infections, and cancer. Understanding the cross-talk between the host and microbiome will be invaluable for basic and translational research. Toward these ends, I will: 1. Understand signals of inflammation in the gut with bioengineered sensors. 2. Evaluate the environmental conditions necessary to eliminate engineered E. coli in a gut-on-a-chip device. 3. Test the impact of variable environmental stimuli on endogenous and abundant intestinal commensals. If implemented, this strategy could serve as an early detection system for infection, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. Using endogenous bacteria for safe, instantaneous, site-specific, and precise delivery of therapeutic compounds in response to environmental change could be tremendously advantageous for disease treatment and long-term health."
"9267053","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Blood cells need to self-renew, proliferate, and differentiate in a balanced fashion to enable self-sustaining blood systems such as the immune system. The biochemical signaling network that regulates this balance is complex, non-intuitive, and not well understood. Adding to the complexity, blood cells exist as diverse lineages with rare, but critical, subsets within each lineage. Traditional FACS analyses with limited cell surface marker panels have created the false notion of restricted subsets, with abrupt transitions in a lineage trajectory. Such limited subset classification (and analyses of signals herein) has obstructed a full understanding of the function of biochemical networks that regulate the cellular balance between proliferation and differentiation. Our recently pioneered single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) method broke this impasse and has revealed that hematopoiesis in the bone marrow is a continuum with over a hundred identifiable subsets. It is known that aberrant biochemical networks can form the basis for human diseases like cancer, autoimmune diseases, or immunodeficiency Our deterministic and stochastic computational models that explored the topology of Ras signaling predicted distinct patterns of Ras activation as a function of the Ras activator proteins Rasgrp and Sos. Testing these hypotheses, we found that analog Rasgrp1- Ras-ERK or bimodal Sos-Ras-ERK signals can occur in lymphocytes. Our new mouse models now indicate that different perturbation in Rasgrp1 lead to reshaping of the Ras signals and result in cancer, autoimmune diseases, or immunodeficiency. Here we hypothesize that blood cells develop through a continuum in a balanced manner as a function of the topology and character of the Ras signaling network.  In Preliminary Results, we discuss our ordinary differential equation (ODE) and Stochastic simulation compile (SSC) computational models of Ras signaling, details of our CyTOF data collection and computational SPADE and ACCENSE analysis methods, as well as our biochemical phospho-flow analyses on defined subsets of lymphocytes. We also present several lines of evidence that the Ras activator Rasgrp1 shapes the character of the Ras network to balance proliferation and differentiation. Loss of Rasgrp1 leads to immunodeficiency. We present data from our recent 2013 publications on T cell leukemia caused by oncogenic Ras mutations or overexpression of the Ras activator Rasgrp1 as well as a lupus-like autoimmune phenotype in a mouse model with a point-mutated Rasgrp1Anaef allele.  In this proposal we will combine computational hypothesis generation, high-resolution analytic approaches of high-dimensional CyTOF data, and high-throughput biochemical analyses of primary blood cells from mouse models with distinct Ras signals and human leukemia samples to understand the topology of the Ras signaling network in T lymphocytes properly transitioning through the normal continuum in the bone marrow (Aim 1) and thymus (Aim 2). We will also characterize how perturbations of the network's character can lead to immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, or T cell leukemia. Using reiterative loops between the three disciplines, we focus on the T cell lineage here to ensure a productive research plan but will also generate new insights relevant for all hematopoietic blood lineages to spur future investigations."
"9395822","Project Summary/Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnoses and deaths are on the rise ? 5.4 million are currently living with the disease and 700,000 will die in 2016 alone. There is no sure-fire method for prevention, early detection, or cure. The Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study has recruited over 5,000 adults over the age of 65 since 1994, and follows them every 2 years for new dementia and AD diagnoses. ACT data contribute to a living, learning co-laboratory, which serves the research community as a valuable scientific resource for AD and brain aging research. For the past four years, we have held an annual ACT Symposium to highlight new ACT resources, innovative research findings, and cross-disciplinary collaborations. We have done this with minimal support from the ACT parent U01. This conference grant will provide new support for our growing symposia for the next three years. The specific objectives of our conference grant are to: 1) promote appropriate scientific use and understanding of ACT data; 2) promote collaborations across scientific disciplines, institutions, and studies; and 3) provide opportunities for feedback on ongoing and planned work including analyses in progress and new grant ideas particularly for junior investigators. This new funding source will provide support for us to move our conference location to a larger, more technologically advanced facility. It will also provide travel stipends for investigators traveling from out of town so that we may extend our reach to new external investigators. We anticipate that future conferences (in late summer of 2017, 2018, and 2019 in Seattle, Washington) will cover hot topics in aging and dementia research such as resilience, imaging, dementia subtypes, molecular phenotypes, and traumatic brain injury ? topic to which ACT is making significant contributions. Long term, expanding our ACT symposia will increase use of the ACT living laboratory, and advance AD and brain aging research."
"9398764","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background: Food allergy (FA) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects an estimated 8% of children in the United States. Although differences between African American (AA) and White children in the prevalence and severity of other atopic conditions such as asthma and eczema have been well described, little is known about such differences in FA. The limited existing literature indicates that AA children may have worse clinical outcomes, including rates of FA-related fatal anaphylaxis and FA-related emergency department (ED) visits, than their White peers. Phenotypic and endotypic differences, including rates of sensitization and co-morbidities, between AA and White children are beginning to be examined. Data on racial differences in FA management practices are incomplete; preliminary data suggest that AA families spend significantly less on allergen-free foods and FA medications than do White families. Families caring for children with FA experience significant impairments in psychosocial outcomes, including FA-related quality of life (FAQoL); however, these data come primarily from White, privately insured families, and little is known about psychosocial outcomes in AA families. Two recent reviews concluded that existing studies examining racial disparities in FA are far too methodologically limited to draw definitive conclusions, primarily due to reliance on self-report of FA diagnosis and cross-sectional designs. Specific Aims and Methods: Our goal is to prospectively study a cohort of 600 AA and White children (0-12 years) with FA in order to: 1) Determine variability in clinical FA outcomes between AA and White patients via bimonthly remote assessments, biannual clinic visits, and medical chart review over a two-year period; 2) Examine phenotypic and endotypic differences between AA and White children with FA using specific laboratory specimen collection techniques and assays; 3) Identify differences between AA and White children in FA management practices by parent report (e.g. allergen avoidance and epinephrine carriage); and 4) Determine differences between AA and White children in psychosocial FA-related outcomes (e.g., FA-related quality of life, bullying, anxiety, and worry) via the above survey methods. Hypotheses and Expected Results: We hypothesize that compared to White children, AA children will: have higher rates of food-allergic reactions and FA-related healthcare utilization; demonstrate unique FA phenotypes and endotypes; have poorer knowledge of FA management and worse adherence to preventative behaviors; have limited access to medications and allergen-free foods; and report better quality of life. Significance and Effects on Other Research: Confirming and further characterizing differences between AA and White children with FA will provide the data required to develop clinical guidelines, optimize treatment, and build health policies that meet the needs of both AA and White children."
"9332421","PROJECT SUMMARY Matrix stiffening is a defining feature of lung and liver fibrosis. While traditionally viewed as an endpoint, matrix stiffening is now recognized to develop early during fibrosis initiation, and to contribute prominently to disease progression through mechano-activation of myofibroblasts derived from lung fibroblasts (LFs) or hepatic stellate cell (HSCs). Recent studies by our group and others have identified the transcriptional effectors YAP and TAZ as key mediators of LF and HSC mechano-activation, demonstrating that a common molecular mechanism underlies myofibroblast activation in these two organs. Here we propose to dramatically expand our focus on YAP and TAZ not just as responders to matrix stiffness, but as central effectors that initiate, amplify, and maintain the matrix stiffening driven by LFs and HSCs, and thus highlight their potential as targets for therapy directed at matrix stiffening itself. In our first aim we will elucidate the mechanistic roles that YAP and TAZ play in initiation, maintenance and propagation of LF- and HSC-mediated lung and liver stiffening, using xenografting to study cell-mediated stiffening of the intact organ, and cellular remodeling of a model ECM to elucidate specific contributions of YAP and TAZ to matrix stiffening via extracellular matrix contraction, synthesis, crosslinking and breakdown. Recognizing that YAP and TAZ play prominent roles in a multitude of cell types and contexts, in our second aim we seek to identify mechanisms by which LF/HSC-specific pro- fibrotic activation of YAP and TAZ can be selectively ablated. We focus on a mechanistic approach to target G protein coupled receptor signaling through a Gs/cAMP pathway as a cell-specific mechanism to inactivate YAP and TAZ and ablate LF and HSC activation even in the face of pro-fibrotic stiff matrix conditions. Invasive atomic force microscopy (AFM) and non-invasive magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) approaches will be employed to test the efficacy of targeting these pathways in preventing or reversing matrix stiffening in pre- clinical models of lung and liver fibrosis. The proposed studies will elucidate novel molecular mechanisms linking cellular activation to matrix stiffening in vitro and in vivo, and identify new approaches to ablate LF and HSC activation in a cell-specific manner, important first steps toward new therapies targeting matrix stiffness and fibrosis. Validation of MRE as a metric to evaluate therapeutic targeting and clinical progression of matrix stiffening will position us to translate this approach to the clinic for patients with fibrotic diseases of the lung and liver."
"9269108","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and more than 80% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. The global burden of CVD has accelerated the need to better understand its epidemiology, identification, and treatment, particularly in high-risk and understudied population groups. African ancestry individuals have a higher risk of CVD events and mortality compared to European ancestry individuals and this racial/ethnic difference is not explained by traditional CVD risk factors or access to healthcare alone. Although mechanisms for the race differences in CVD epidemiology are complex and multifactorial, it is clear that molecular and genetic differences in susceptibility play an important role. Emerging evidence, primarily from animal models and in vitro experiments, indicates that the Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway plays a role in angiogenesis, vascular calcification, and atherosclerosis. However, less is known about the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in CVD in humans. In addition, human studies have focused on only a limited subset of Wnt related proteins and have not assessed other key components of the Wnt signaling pathway in CVD. Our preliminary data in African ancestry men and women with a functional and race specific missense variant (Ala64Thr) in the Wnt co-receptor, Frizzled-1 (FZD1), revealed greater carotid ultrasound intima-media thickness compared to those with the wild-type genotype (Ala64Ala). In order to more comprehensively quantify the association between the Wnt pathway and subclinical CVD in humans, we will utilize data from our large, ongoing cohort study of African ancestry men aged =40 years. We are currently performing abdominal and chest CT scans for a study of ectopic adiposity and diabetes in 1200 African ancestry men. During this study, we are also obtaining and archiving images of carotid artery ultrasound and brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity. These data will form the basis of the Aims of this proposal, which are to quantify the association between blood levels of Wnt pathway gene and protein expression with measures of subclinical CVD including coronary and aortic artery calcification, common carotid intima-media thickness and adventitial diameter, brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity and ankle-brachial index in 365 men of African ancestry. We will also perform genotype-directed recruitment of 100 men with a known functional variant in the FZD1 gene and test for a difference in measures of subclinical CVD between variant carriers and non-carrier controls that will be recruited from the general study population. The successful completion of these research aims, along with an intensive training and mentorship plan, will provide the applicant with new skills and hands-on training in five major areas: epidemiologic field research, deeper subclinical CVD phenotyping, and training in cardiovascular physiology, molecular epidemiology laboratory training and grantsmanship. This Career Development Award will provide the applicant with protected time for didactic training and development of new skills that will lay the foundation for an independent research career in the molecular epidemiology of subclinical CVD."
"9265534","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A functional nervous system requires both the appropriate development of dendritic spines and their functional plasticity throughout life. Because dendritic spines are the primary sites of contact with presynaptic axons in excitatory neurons of hippocampus and cortex, their structure and function have been studied in great detail. During development, spines undergo marked changes in structure, progressing from motile filopodial protrusions to stable mushroom-shaped spines. Activity-driven structural changes in spines of mature neurons also play important roles in learning and memory. It is therefore not surprising that changes in dendritic spines are one of the first harbingers of neuronal dysfunction in many developmental diseases, such as Fragile X syndrome and autism, as well as neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Actin filaments play important roles in the formation, maintenance and plasticity of dendritic spine structure. Prominent in dendrite shafts, microtubules (MTs) function as stable railways for intracellular transport, but also exhibit bouts of rapid polymerization and depolymerization, termed dynamic instability. We discovered that MTs remain dynamic in dendrites throughout neuronal development and are capable of rapidly polymerizing into and out of dendritic spines in an activity-dependent fashion. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that MT invasion of dendritic spines is a tightly regulated process resulting in motor-driven transport of cargo directly into and out of dendritic spines. Specifically, we will: 1) Determine the molecular mechanism by which MTs target specific spines, 2) Identify motor proteins and cargo that are transported into spines along MTs, and 3) Determine how material is transported out of spines along MTs. This work will provide fundamental insights into synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, because dendritic spines play essential roles in learning and memory and are the structures affected in numerous psychiatric and neurological diseases, these studies hold promise for novel cytoskeletal-based therapies for synaptic dysfunction."
"9397430","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      While ongoing research has suggested there are disabilities associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), few imaging studies have examined the impact of their co- morbidity in Operation Enduring Freedom-Operation Iraqi Freedom-Operation New Dawn (OEF-OIF-OND) Veterans. Ragsdale et al (2013) have reported both increased PTSD symptoms and functional impairments in a group of Veterans suffering from both mTBI and PTSD, relative to a group of Veterans with PTSD alone. Yet even less research is concerned with the recovery these Veterans experience from treatment. The overarching goal of the present study is to investigate the global functional, psychological, and neural network recovery of the OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with this co-morbidity. Specifically, we propose to investigate changes in OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with both PTSD and mTBI who participate in a meditation intervention designed for Veterans (Inner Resources for Veterans; IRV). First we propose that IRV will be associated with improvements in community integration and quality of life. Secondly, we propose that Veterans completing a course of IRV will experience improvements in PTSD and postconsussive, including depressive, symptoms. Finally, we seek to show that practicing IRV meditation will improve functional connectivity in OEF-OIF-OND Veterans with co-morbid mTBI and PTSD. We believe that this proposal will not only help us define the problems of Veterans with co-morbid mTBI and PTSD more clearly, but also shed light on their potential for recovery afforded by effective treatment."
"9292730","Post-surgical complications are most common in older adults. While a number of factors contribute, one key determinant is malnourishment. Malnutrition ? particularly low protein intake ? is seen in up to 86% of older adults at hospital admission; however, the prevalence of malnutrition in older Veterans is unknown. Malnutrition and post-surgical complications are linked through two critical observations: 1) malnutrition dramatically reduces the ability of older adults to overcome postsurgical health stressors, and 2) nutritional status is likely to deteriorate further during hospitalization and after discharge. Despite convincing evidence that perioperative nutrition interventions can improve surgical outcomes, such interventions have not been developed and implemented for our Veterans. Thus, there is a critical need to initiate the required steps to identify and reduce malnutrition in older Veterans who are anticipating surgery. The overall objectives of the proposed research are: 1) to validate screening and assessment tools to quickly and accurately identify perioperative malnutrition in Veterans, and 2) to pilot test a ?perihabilitation? intervention of protein enhanced supplementation to identify its feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability, and 3) to determine the effect size of physical function in preparation for a larger clinical trial. The Perioperative Optimization of Senior Health Program (VAPOSH), a new interdisciplinary program at the Durham VAMC, offers a unique opportunity to develop and pilot test approaches for addressing perioperative malnutrition. Demonstration of the functional impact of perioperative protein supplementation for malnourished older Veterans will support this research proposal seeking to identify and treat perioperative malnutrition and improve postoperative outcomes in older Veterans. The Aims of this project are: 1) to select the appropriate nutrition screening and assessment tools for VAPOSH Veterans and employ them to characterize malnutrition prevalence and severity and establish cut-off values associated with malnutrition, 2) to conduct a pilot randomized controlled 6-week trial of enhanced protein supplementation in a population of malnourished Veterans undergoing elective surgery; 2.1) use a pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of a perioperative protein- enhanced intervention compared to an educational control; and 2.2) to determine the effect size for planned future studies of enhanced protein supplementation in malnourished Veterans, with physical function as the primary outcome of interest.  Aim1 encompasses an observational, prospective study that screens and evaluates 75 VAPOSH patients undergoing elective surgery 1) to report the prevalence of being malnourished or at risk of being malnourished in VAPOSH patients, 2) determine the criterion validity of the Nutrition Risk Screener-2002 and Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment tools, and 3) identify cut-off value associated with malnutrition. Aims 2.1 and 2.2 will pilot test a ?perihabilitation? intervention in malnourished older Veterans undergoing elective surgery to assess 1) the feasibility, fidelity and acceptability of a higher protein supplement before and after surgery and 2) the effects of a higher protein supplement on the primary outcome measure, physical function and secondary outcomes of interest. Malnourished VAPOSH Veterans will be randomly assigned to either an education (nutritional counseling) control arm or high-protein perihabilitation arm. Participants in the high-protein arm will be provided with high quality protein supplements that will bring their protein intakes to at least 30 grams for each of the 3 meals per day.  The successful completion of these aims will provide important findings that will support the development of novel and much needed approaches to intervene for malnutrition in Veterans before, during and after surgery."
"9380234","PI: Anderson, Deborah M  Project Summary   ?Host response and immunity to Yersinia pestis infection? Project Summary  Type I interferons are expressed by eukaryotic cells upon intracellular invasion by microbial pathogens and they induce a potent anti-viral response. Yet during bacterial infection, expression of type I IFN often leads to a pathologic response that depletes populations of immune effector cells necessary to mediate clearance. Our laboratory has shown that type I IFN signaling contributes to neutrophil depletion during infection by Yersinia pestis, a Gram-negative bacterium that is the causative agent of the plague. Bubonic plague is a highly infectious vector borne disease that can be transmitted through the respiratory route and disseminated through the vasculature of its victims. Septicemic and pneumonic plagues involve the rapid development of an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response that causes the clinical collapse of the patient, even with antibiotic treatment. These three forms of plague have been responsible for three major pandemics and still cause annual cases of human disease with a high mortality rate worldwide including a hotspot in the Southwestern United States. To date, little about the host responses that directly or indirectly contribute to the progression of plague. Such responses may present new strategies to approach the post- symptomatic treatment of plague and other acute inflammatory diseases. In this application, we propose to study interactions between phagocytic cells and Y. pestis that are responsible for inducing inflammatory responses that contribute to the progression of infection in a murine model. We have identified the broadly conserved Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) as activated during infection by wild type Y. pestis. Activation of TLR7 by Y. pestis triggers a non-canonical signaling pathway that induces the expression of type I IFN and its downstream IFN stimulated genes which subsequently interfere with the neutrophilic response and promote the progression of disease. In this project, we aim to understand the molecular signaling events of this novel pathway and their role during infection with Y. pestis. Our long term goal is to use the information gained from this program to better understand innate immune response to bacterial infection and develop host-targeted therapeutics that broadly protect from acutely inflammatory infectious diseases such as the infamous pneumonic plague."
