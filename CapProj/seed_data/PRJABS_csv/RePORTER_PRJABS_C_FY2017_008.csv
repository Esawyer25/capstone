"9282887","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes massive epidemics of a debilitating musculoskeletal inflammatory disease. There are currently no approved CHIKV-specific vaccines or antiviral agents. CHIKV initiates infection after the E2 glycoprotein binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the surface of host cells and promotes internalization by clathrin-dependent uptake into the endocytic pathway. Both attenuated and virulent CHIKV strains bind GAGs, and GAG-binding efficiency influences virulence, including in a mouse model of CHIKV disease. However, the molecular basis of CHIKV-GAG interactions is unknown, which precludes a complete understanding of the function of GAGs in CHIKV pathogenesis. Moreover, the host factors that promote CHIKV replication, the precise cellular targets for CHIKV infection in the host, and links between host CHIKV replication factors and disease pathogenesis also remain unclear. The proposed research combines the expertise of the laboratories of Terence Dermody, Michael Diamond, and Thomas Morrison in virus-receptor interactions, RNA virus replication, viral immunology, and mouse models of viral disease to enhance knowledge of CHIKV replication and pathogenesis. Three integrated and interactive specific aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, the mechanisms and pathological significance of CHIKV binding to GAGs will be determined. Specific GAG subtypes bound by CHIKV will be defined using glycan-array screening and genetically altered cell lines with defects in GAG biosynthesis, and sequences in E2 required for binding to GAGs will be defined using structure-guided mutagenesis. The function of GAG binding in acute and chronic CHIKV disease will be determined using mutant CHIKV strains with reduced or abolished GAG-binding capacity and GAG-knockout mice. In Specific Aim 2, the function in CHIKV infection of COPI coatomer subunits and regulatory factors, which were recently identified in a small-interfering RNA screen, will be elucidated. Cells with diminished COPI transport activity will be infected with CHIKV and tested for formation of viral replication compartments, synthesis of viral RNA, and assembly and release of viral progeny. The function of COPI coatomer ARCN1 and regulatory factor GBF1 in CHIKV pathogenesis will be determined using newly established gene-targeted mice. In Specific Aim 3, cell types in the mammalian host that contribute to CHIKV pathogenesis and persistence will be identified. CHIKV strains engineered to contain tissue-specific microRNA seed sequences will be tested for acute and chronic disease in mice and elaboration of chemokines and cytokines, infiltration of musculoskeletal tissues with inflammatory leukocytes, and development of humoral immune responses. Overall, studies in this collaborative proposal will enhance our understanding of mechanisms by which CHIKV binds to GAGs, determine the function of COPI transport in CHIKV infection and pathogenesis, and define specific cells in the host targeted by CHIKV to produce disease. Knowledge gained from the proposed research may illuminate new targets for anti-CHIKV therapeutics."
"9380614","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disruption of sleep and alertness is one of the most disabling non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Mechanisms leading to impaired sleep and alertness in PD are not well understood, and treatment options remain limited. This application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award entitled Circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles in Parkinson's Disease is designed to provide Dr. Aleksandar Videnovic with the research skills and experience to bridge the areas of movement disorders, sleep and circadian biology in order to understand the basis for sleep and wake disturbances in PD. Dr. Videnovic is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at Northwestern University in Chicago. He completed residency training in Neurology at Northwestern University, a clinical fellowship in Movement Disorders at Rush University, and obtained a master's degree in clinical research from Rush Graduate College. Dr. Videnovic's long term career goal is to understand the role of circadian rhythms and sleep on neurological outcomes in movement disorders, and to utilize this knowledge to improve patients' health and quality of life by innovative circadian and sleep based strategies. His immediate goals are to gain knowledge and skills in circadian biology, sleep medicine, and clinical research methodology so as to investigate potential circadian rhythm abnormalities in PD. Dr. Videnovic has assembled a team of researchers who will mentor him during this award. His primary mentor, Dr. Phyllis Zee, and co-mentor Dr. Fred Turek are renowned investigators in the field of circadian biology with complementary expertise in patient oriented and basic science research. Expertise in mathematical modeling of circadian rhythms, statistical analyses, and clinical research in PD, will be provided by consultants, Drs. Elizabeth Klerman, Alfred Rademaker, and Tanya Simuni. The proposed training plan encompasses didactic and hands-on training on the characterization of the circadian system using physiological and molecular markers, assessments of the sleep-wake cycle, applications of circadian based treatments including light therapy, and further training in clinical research methods. The first part of the proposed research will examine the amplitude and stability of the circadian system using biological markers of the circadian system (e.g., melatonin, clock genes and the rest-activity cycle). The primary hypothesis is that disruption of circadian rhythmicity plays an important role in the development of poor sleep quality and daytime somnolence in PD. These markers of circadian rhythmicity will be correlated with sleep quality and degree of daytime somnolence in PD participants and healthy controls. The second part of the project is to test the hypothesis that increasing the strength and stability of circadian rhythms, using bright light exposure, will improve sleep quality and daytime somnolence in PD. Results from this research and the proposed training plan will form the foundation for an independent clinical research program at the interface of sleep, circadian biology and PD which may lead to novel and more effective treatments aimed to improve the health and quality of life of patients with PD."
"9173034","CORE B: Abstract  The Genetics, Genomics, and Informatics Core focuses on the application of genome-level  analyses in neuroscientific investigation, both at the sequence (genetic), and gene expression  and epigenetic (genomics) levels. The explosion of next-generation sequencing-based methods  has made advanced computational expertise and infrastructure needed for all sequencing-  based applications.  The proposed Core aims at providing support for basic and advanced genetics and genomics  experiments in both patient cohorts for translational studies and experimental models for basic  research. Modern genetic and genomic approaches, including epigenetics, rely on sequencing  technology and require substantial bioinformatics expertise and access to solid computational  resources. This core leverages a proven history of expertise, as well as support and  collaboration with other investigators in the Coppola and Geschwind groups with regards to  computational and informatics resources funded by NIH and private foundations. Based on this  proven track record, Core E will provide IDDRC investigators with the necessary expertise and  infrastructure to perform high-throughput, genome-wide genetic and genomic studies. State-of-  the-art analytical methods being developed within the NINDS-funded UCLA Informatics Center  for Neurogenetics and Neurogenomics (ICNN, co-directed by Dr. Coppola) will be used to  analyze NGS, gene expression, and methylation data, and the resulting datasets will be posted  onto a database accessible to IDDRC investigators, facilitating data sharing and collaborative  analyses. Over the past 10 years UCLA computational biologists and statisticians have lead the  field of integrative data analysis (Geschwind and Konopka, 2009) and network-based methods  [Zhang and Horvath 2005; Oldham et al. 2008; Parikshak et al. 2013]. Expertise in the  development and implementation of these methods (including single-cell analysis, network  methods, and integrative approaches), will be made directly available to IDDRC investigators."

"9029342","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many patients requiring stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies are unable to find a suitable HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donor. Transplants using stem cells from umbilical cord blood provide an alternative for these patients, allowing transplantation to proceed with less stringent HLA-matching requirements. Unfortunately, in addition to the risk of relapsed disease, patients undergoing cord blood transplants have a high risk of death from infections due to slow reconstitution of their immune system.    In this clinical observational study, we propose to use high-throughput DNA sequencing of T- Cell Receptor (TCR) and Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes from peripheral blood to study the reconstitution of the adaptive immune system following cord blood transplant. We will use high-throughput sequencing to estimate the diversity of T- and B-cell receptors in each of approximately 240 patients at defined time-points following transplant, and demonstrate a correlation between our measure of adaptive immune receptor diversity and subsequent morbidity and mortality from infectious complications.    Further development of this technique would lead to a Phase III application with a clinical intervention study in which this assay would provide a diagnostic method to identify patients at high risk for infectious complications soon after transplant. Clinical care would be administered for an increased-intensity regimen of antimicrobial prophylaxis to high-risk patients. We expect that early identification of high-risk patients, combined with more aggressive prophylaxis for these patients, will reduce the high treatment-related mortality present in cord blood transplants."
"9174909","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lysosomal phospholipase A2 (LPLA2) plays a major role in lipid degradation and is believed to underlie drug-induced phospholipidosis, which commonly occurs in patients taking cationic lipophilic drugs such as the antiarrhythmic amiodarone. Aberrant LPLA2 activity may also be involved in development of autoimmune disease and atherosclerosis. LPLA2 is 50% identical in sequence to lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), a key enzyme in reverse cholesterol transport from arterial plaque macrophages via high density lipoproteins (HDL). Genetic mutations in LCAT are responsible for Familial LCAT Deficiency (FLD), a devastating disease characterized by low serum cholesterol ester levels and renal failure. There are no reported atomic models for either LPLA2 or LCAT, which do not have significant homology to other proteins of known structure. Thus, the molecular bases for their substrate selectivity, regulation, and disease phenotypes remain poorly understood. In this proposal, we address this critical gap in knowledge via functional analysis of our new 1.8 ? crystal structure of LPLA2, determination of the atomic structure of LCAT, imaging LCAT bound to HDL particles by electron microscopy, mapping somatic mutations known to cause genetic disease, and investigating the structural basis for differences in acyl acceptor selectivity. In support of our aims, we provide multiple high resolution structure of LPLA2 in various ligand states, negative stained images of LCAT-HDL complexes, and a low resolution crystal structure of fully glycosylated LCAT. The expected outcome of these studies is a better mechanistic understanding of a structurally uncharacterized family of eukaryotic enzymes that play key roles in lipid metabolism. Our structural and functional studies will help explain the molecular basis for genetic disease and ultimately assist in the design of improved biotherapeutics and small molecule LCAT activators to treat lipid-related disorders such as atherosclerosis and LCAT deficiency."
"9176030","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dysregulation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) turnover or function may contribute to the excess atherosclerosis in individuals with insulin-resistant (type 2) diabetes and metabolic syndrome. These conditions are characterized by low HDL. However, it is unknown how insulin regulates HDL in normal physiology, or in the pathophysiology of diabetes. FoxO1 is an insulin-repressible transcription factor that has emerged as a key mediator of insulin signaling in liver and the vessel wall. We have determined that FoxO1 regulates multiple genes critical for HDL metabolism and function, and mice lacking hepatic FoxO1 have alterations in HDL lipid and protein content. Thus, we propose that FoxO1 links insulin signaling and HDL. In Aim 1, we will investigate the hypothesis that FoxO1 regulates selective uptake of HDL-cholesterol in liver. We present preliminary data that FoxO1 regulates multiple steps in this process. In Aim 2, we will investigate the hypothesis that hepatic FoxO1 regulates macrophage-to-feces reverse cholesterol transport. We will determine the roles of individual HDL genes in the FoxO1 phenotype, and determine the effects on atherosclerosis. In Aim 3, we will investigate the hypothesis that FoxO1 regulates vasoprotective functions of HDL. We will examine the roles of FoxO1-regulated HDL components in endothelial barrier function and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity. This work will build on novel hypotheses and a key mouse model to bring insight into the dysregulation of HDL during insulin resistance. The proposed studies will shed light on a key unanswered question in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, and reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9351729","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension (HTN) contributes disproportionately to the global burden of disease. In our prior application, we have provided evidence for an important link between particulate matter <2.5 mm (PM2.5) exposure and development of HTN. In this competitive renewal application, we propose to further investigate these links in the context of our findings that inflammation mediated sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation in circumventricular organs (CVO) in the brain represent an integrative mechanism for PM2.5 induced HTN. Our hypothesis is consistent with an evolving shift in our understanding of the SNS as an arbitrator of acute tonal changes in HTN to a facilitator of chronic functional and structural changes via immune mechanisms. We propose to test this hypothesis in both animal models and humans as part of our established inter-disciplinary collaborative group. In aim 1, we will investigate the time course, loci and impact of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation on BP with PM2.5 exposure conducted in a versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (VACES) using C57/Bl6 and NFkB reporter mice. We will directly assess the impact of PM2.5 in exaggerating BP using a model of central SNS activation and also assess the impact of activating inflammation proximally on SNS activation on BP response to FA/PM2.5. Dose response studies and analysis of PM2.5 components responsible for HTN, will be performed in pre-disposed models. In Aim 2, the role of central TLR activation in the CVO organs will be tested by deleting TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF6), selectively in the CVO using UbcCre-TRAF6flox/flox(TRAF6pCNS) mice using Tamoxifen injected intra-cerebroventricularly (ICV), followed by exposure to FA/PM2.5. TRAF6 is a unique member of the TRAF family that functions at nodal points where signals induced via multiple TLRs converge. We will additionally distinguish between neuronal and glial cell specific role of TRAF6 in CNS inflammation in response to PM2.5. In Aim 3, we will test the involvement of central SNS as a relevant pathway in humans, exposed to sub-acute time periods to ambient PM2.5, as part of a blinded randomized cross-over intervention. Our hypothesis is that Guanfacine an approved a2A agonist will obviate the association of ambient PM2.5 with 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP and SNS activity measured by HRV measures. Our experiments are highly relevant to continuing risk posed by air- pollution to people living in urbanized environments."
"9173043","(PRECLINICAL MODELS CORE (PMC): CORE F)  PROJECT SUMMARY Description: The Preclinical Models Core (PMC) supports IDDRC users who seek new treatments for IDD by studying these disorders in 3 kinds of preclinical models: (1) Rodent models: This Core component characterizes behaviors in mouse models of genetic or acquired disabilities. Measured behaviors include learning, memory, social preference, ultrasonic vocalization, sleep and anxiety. (2) Stem cell models: This Core component assists users to create disease models by generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using standard reprogramming technologies or by genome editing, such as CRISPR-Cas, on established iPSC lines. These cells, some derived from humans with IDD, afford a model in which to scrutinize cellular consequences of genetic disease and to evaluate the efficacy of possible therapies. (3) Tissue culture models: This Core component supports users to generate tissue culture models in which to study the development and behavior of enriched or mixed populations of primary brain cells, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia, microglia and endothelia. These cells originate in genetically manipulated rodents or they are normal cells exposed to environmental stimuli, including drugs and toxins. The Tissue Culture Service and Stem Cell Service interact closely, since they share several in vitro methodologies and serve as a conduit to drive and help design rodent behavior testing. The PMC emphasizes training of users and their staff. Trained users can continue studies in their own laboratory or they can utilize the equipment in the PMC at reduced cost. This core interacts with others in the Center. It will exchange protocols, services and best practices with other IDDRCs in the Network. Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The PMC bridges all three domains of ?Genes, Brain, and Behavior?, the theme of the CHOP/Penn IDDRC (see Overall: Overview of Center). The Core was developed in response to a user survey (2014) that emphasized a need for an IDD-focused facility for the study of mammalian behavior and one to address the potential of current stem cell technologies, including CRISPR-Cas. Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to users at other Centers in the Network."
"9181430","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in non-human primates (NHPs) and in humans using a combination of non-myeloablative conditioning and donor bone marrow transplantation (DMBT) that results in transient donor chimerism. However, until now, mixed-chimerism protocols that achieve long-term tolerance of kidney allografts in NHPs have consistently failed to induce tolerance in recipients of heart or lung allografts. It is well known that some organs, such as kidney and liver, are tolerance-prone while others, such as heart and lung, are tolerance-resistant. It has been hypothesized that only protocols that result in durable donor chimerism would be able to achieve tolerance in resistant heart and lung allografts. Remarkably, however, the results obtained during our current funding cycle demonstrate, for the first time, that tolerance of heart allografts can be achieved in NHPs via transient mixed-chimerism as long as host regulatory mechanisms are enhanced in the host. Indeed, our results suggest that it is the ability of a mixed-chimerism protocol to augment or expand regulatory T cells (Tregs), rather than its durability, that determines its ability to induc tolerance to resistant organs. Thus, the unifying goal of this program project is to combine mixed chimerism with novel strategies designed to amplify the contributions of Tregs in order develop a clinical tolerance protocol that can be rapidly translated to human recipients of heart and lung allografts. The Program will be organized in such a way that early advances in Project 3 (examining molecular pathways required to stabilize and promote Treg function in mice), will inform and refine the aims of Project 1 (optimizing mixed chimerism to induce NHP heart allograft tolerance) and Project 2 (optimizing mixed chimerism to induce NHP lung allograft tolerance). The availability of tissue and blood samples for longitudinal analyses will aid the study of immune mechanisms by assessing the consequences of T and B cell regulation, T and B cell memory and pro-inflammatory cytokines on graft survival (Cores A & B). The diverse yet complementary models and approaches that will be used to achieve heart and lung tolerance is a unique strength of this program project. Collaboration between all projects will be greatly enhanced by the fact that most all the investigators have worked together closely for many years. Together, our studies should result in a better understanding of tolerance and contribute to the successful application of tolerance to the full spectrum of deceased donor organ and tissue transplantation."
"9380029","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sports-related concussion is a growing health and socio-economical problem and yet, its biomechanical mechanisms are still poorly understood. Computational models of the human head are important tools to understand how mechanical energy from an external impact is transferred into regional brain mechanical responses sufficient to cause injury. However, current computational schemes require hours on a modern multi-CPU computer or even a supercomputer to simulate a single head impact, and are impractical to handle the amount of computations involved when studying a large athletic population on a large scale in the number of head impacts sustained. We propose to establish a pre-computed model response atlas to specifically address the computational challenges to allow efficient estimates of model responses without significant loss of accuracy. There are two specific aims. First, we will establish and evaluate the performance of a pre-computed model response atlas using a sophisticated finite element model of the human head developed in our group based on a large database of actual on-field head impact exposure. In the second aim, we will utilize the pre- computed atlas to investigate the significance of cumulative effects of repetitive head impacts and evaluate whether accumulated brain responses improve the sensitivity and specificity in concussion prediction and result in stronger and more significant correlations with neurocognitive alterations. These efforts will provide an important research tool to allow rapid exploration of brain biomechanics involved in sports-related concussion and offer an initial understanding on the significance of cumulative effects of repetitive head impacts. This proposal will leverage an existing large database of on-field head kinematics, neuroimaging findings, and clinical outcomes for helmeted athletes generated from previous NIH- and CDC-funded research efforts. The proposed research will accelerate exploration of the biomechanics that occur in individual brains subjected to actual on-field impacts which are expected to advance our understanding of which brain regions and are most susceptible to concussive injury."
"9369899","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease which can be ascribed in only 10-20% of cases to genetics. Epidemiological evidence suggests that PD is more common in rural areas, where its increased prevalence is associated with the use of pesticides, herbicides and heavy metals, including manganese (Mn). Chronic exposure to high Mn levels causes manganism, which has multiple shared features with PD, but the mechanisms by which Mn induces neurotoxicity have yet to be fully established. Mn decreases expression of glutamate transporter GLT-1, which regulates synaptic glutamate levels and prevents excitotoxic neuronal injury. Our preliminary studies indicate that the transcription factor yin yang 1 (YY1) plays a critical role in the effect of Mn on GLT-1. Accordingly, delineating the precise mechanism of Mn-induced dysregulation of GLT-1 expression is critical in advancing our understanding of Mn neurotoxicity. Moreover, identifying molecular targets of Mn-induced GLT-1 dysfunction will have broad applicability, since a plethora of neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are associated with perturbed glutamate homeostasis secondary to GLT-1 dysfunction. Thus, our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms involved in the regulation of GLT-1 expression in relation to the excitotoxic neurodegeneration. Our immediate objective is to determine how YY1 regulates Mn-induced repression of GLT-1. Here, we present preliminary data characterizing a previously unknown role of YY1 in Mn-induced repression of GLT-1. Among our findings, we determined that Mn increases YY1 expression via NF-?B. In addition, epigenetic modifier histone deacetylases (HDACs) serve as co-repressors of YY1, and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) reverse Mn-induced repression of GLT-1 promoter activity. Given these observations, we hypothesize that Mn-induced GLT-1 repression by NF-?B-dependent YY1 activation, with HDACs acting as co-repressors, mediates Mn-induced neurotoxicity. Our proposed work is the first in the field to explore the effect of Mn on GLT-1 expression via YY1 at the transcriptional level. Our hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims: 1) Determine if astrocytic YY1 mediates Mn-induced neurotoxicity by impairing GLT-1 expression and function using astrocyte-specific YY1 conditional knockout mice, 2) Delineate the molecular mechanisms of Mn-induced activation of YY1 and its role in regulating GLT-1 function in vitro using primary astrocytes, and 3) Test if Mn- enhanced YY1 expression and the ensuing GLT-1 repression are regulated by HDAC epigenetic modification. Our studies will provide novel insights into the mechanism(s) underlying the role of the YY1 pathway in Mn-induced repression of GLT-1 function and Mn-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, the outcome of this study will offer novel therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases associated with impairment in GLT-1 function and excitotoxicity."
"9173041","CORE D: Abstract   The foremost objective of the Structural and Functional Visualization Core is to provide state of the art  imaging services to the IDDRC community, including both conventional and confocal microscopy, whole  animal MRI acquisition and analysis support. To attain this goal, the core has been redesigned to provide  comprehensive imaging services for IDDRC researchers working at on any aspect of the genetic and  environmentally-induced developmental diseases affecting nervous system development and function. The  research ongoing in the IDDRC spans basic scientists using reductionist approaches to elucidate the  mechanisms specific to intellectual developmental disabilities (IDDs) to clinicians assessing therapeutic  interventions for patients. To accommodate all of their imaging requirements, we are now providing access  to three light microscopy cores, including a microscopy suite dedicated to IDDRC researchers, two MRI  facilities and the technical support needed to initiate and complete any imaging analysis. Many IDDRC  researchers have imaging systems within their own laboratories, however they are often insufficient to meet  their demand and are never comprehensive. Being able to access the IDDRC-supported microscopy cores  thus both adds capacity and provides technical resources not otherwise available, permitting researchers to  refocus their studies in novel and innovative directions.   A second key objective of the Structural and Functional Visualization Core is to develop new  technologies for visualizing biological samples and in turn provide them to IDDRC researchers. Here, we  focus on [1] developing smaller lighter one-photon miniaturized fluorescent microscopes for live imaging  neural activity in freely moving animals (1-3) and [2] refining the methods for CLARITY, a protocol that  renders tissue transparent (4, 5), thereby permitting unparalleled visual acuity into the complex circuitry of  the brain. These techniques offer the promise of a holistic approach to cutting edge imaging, permitting  IDDRC researchers to translate mechanism into therapy. For example, researchers investigating a specific  intellectual disorder, such as Dup15q syndrome (see model project), will be able perform MRI on patients to  identify the affected region of  the brain, implant miniaturized microscopes in rodent models to perform in vivo i m a g i n g to examine how  the firing patterns of specific populations of neuron are mechanistically altered by the disease, while  concomitantly examining putative aberrant circuit formation using light microscopy coupled with CLARITY.   Finally, this core also supports the efforts of all the other cores, offering IDDRC researchers the  ability to both probe molecular and cellular function at any level from the sub-cellular to living animals  and determine the consequence of therapeutic interventions."
"9173048","(CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL CORE(CTC): CORE B) PROJECT SUMMARY Description: The Clinical Translation Core (CTC) provides investigators with a set of services to enhance the productivity of Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) clinical translational researchers. The CTC focuses on the effective and rapid collection of IDD study populations that are of adequate size and well- characterized. IDDs are highly variable disorders that result from heterogeneous genetic factors which affect brain function in a non-uniform manner. Scientific progress demands that each IDD be well characterized and stratified along more than one dimension in order to control for a degree of clinical heterogeneity that otherwise could confound progress in developing therapies. The CTC addresses this challenge by providing a host of approaches to enable recruitment of very large samples that are well-characterized across relevant dimensions. These supports include (a) Creating new websites for individual projects that will serve as both a recruitment portal and as a mechanism to enable online IRB consent and collection of ?light phenotyping? through use of a common IDD library of questionnaires; (b) Mining the CHOP/Penn electronic health record for recruitment and for study data; (c) Creation of a shared IDD database that is common to all IDDs investigated at our institutions. This shared database will facilitate secondary analyses that discriminate clinical features specific to a particular IDD; and (d) The coordination of the many existing clinical translational resources at CHOP/UPenn, in order to carry out the CTC's aims in the most cost effective manner, and amplify its effectiveness. The CTC also provides expert consultation with (a) gold standard clinician administered assessments, as well as (b) deep phenotyping via a host of novel, technology based approaches for quantifying behavior (e.g., eye tracking, motion capture, use of on online computer adaptive tests). In addition to these crucial supportive roles, the CTC will foster new clinical investigation by creating an infrastructure that will be available to future investigators, which will simplify their entrée to high-quality human research. Relevance to IDDRC Mission: Then CTC is of fundamental importance to the mission of the IDDRC as it facilitates interdisciplinary and translational research in IDD. It is a vital component of the CHOP/UPenn Center's goal of advancing the diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and amelioration of IDDs. The CTC helps bridge all three domains of the organizing theme of the CHOP/Penn IDDRC (see Overall: Overview of Center): ?Genes, Brain, and Behavior?. By centrally focusing on quantifying behavior, as well as facilitation of biosample collection, it is integral the process of successfully understanding and treating the biological bases of the behavioral manifestations of IDD. Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to approved users at other Centers in the Network."
"9173029","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This submission is a new application for the UCLA IDDRC, entitled UCLA Center for Translational Research in Neurodevelopment (UC-TRaN). The fundamental purpose of our Center is to provide an optimal environment for performing outstanding research into the causes, mechanisms, and treatments of intellectual and developmental disorders. The new leadership model in the center emphasizes collaborations among Center investigators, core personnel, and community partners, with support for research spanning basic research and clinical practice. Our aims are 1) to create cutting edge and cost effective infrastructure resources in facilities and personnel for IDD investigators; 2) to provide  integrated services within cores that support research from multidisciplinary teams and multiple levels of analysis; 3) to promote interactions between cores and among research investigators to promote collaborative, multidisciplinary and translational research, and 4) to create educational and outreach opportunities within the center, in collaboration with a West Coast Consortium of IDDRCs and community partners.  We propose five interacting cores: 1) Administration, Education and Outreach; 2) Genetics, Genomics and BioInformatics, which performs genetic analysis, sequencing, expression, and provides Big Data resources; 3) Cells, Circuits and Systems analysis, supporting electrophysiology, human iPSC and cerebral organoid culture development, and optogenetics; 4) Structural and Functional Visualization, which provides access to and analysis of imaging tools from miniaturized microscopes through animal and human MRI; and 5) Clinical Translation, supporting clinical trial development, recruitment, phenotyping across species, and collecting biosamples. The Center proposes an exciting model research project, Neurophysiological biomarkers of cognition in Dup15 syndrome: From mouse models to patients. Dup15q11.2-13.1 is associated with marked cognitive impairment and other symptoms of developmental delay. The study examines a novel EEG biomarker in a cohort of children with Dup15q and in two separate mouse models of Dup15q syndrome, one defined by an overexpression of a single gene, UBE3A, and the other from a full duplication of the region. In the animal model the project will test three mechanism-based pharmacologic treatments: d-serine, rapamycin, and a GABA-A ?5 receptor subunit inverse agonist, to determine whether these treatments change cell activation patterns and behavior. Together, the project and cores support our primary goal of optimizing outcomes of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities by promoting outstanding translational  research."
"9173045","(RESEARCH PROJECT: MEG IN ASD)  PROJECT SUMMARY We have developed magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures that predict both a diagnosis of ASD and the degree of language impairment. Thus, (i) auditory encoding latency (M100) discriminates ASD versus non- ASD; (ii) auditory change detection latency (mismatch field, MMF) predicts severity of language impairment in ASD and in other groups with a developmental disability; and (iii) lexical distinction (word versus non-word low-frequency neural oscillatory activity) both predicts language impairment as well as atypical hemispheric specialization for language in ASD and, perhaps, in other neurodevelopmental groups. Prior imaging studies of ASD (including our own) have focused on an intellectually higher-functioning population (high-functioning autism, or HFA). One reason for this bias is that the majority of imaging studies entail magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which presupposes a participant's ability to remain motionless during the study, thereby disqualifying from study the large ASD population with language delay and intellectual disability (possibly as high as 50%). We seek to investigate the neural basis of autism and associated language and cognitive impairment in an under-studied population of minimally verbal/non-verbal ASD children (MVNV-ASD, N = 40, aged 8 to 12 years). To this end, MVNV-ASD encoding, change detection, and lexical MEG measures will be compared with the same measures already available in age-matched HFA and typically developing (TD) children. Using the same tasks, MEG data will be obtained from a ?positive control? group of children with intellectual disability (ID; N =40) but without ASD, matched for age and non-verbal IQ in order to isolate neural abnormalities specific to MVNV-ASD and not consequent to impairment of general cognitive function. Thus, our primary goals are: (a) A search for pathogenic mechanisms common to HFA and MVNV-ASD, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of disability across the ASD spectrum; and (b) A search for mechanisms of language impairment that are ASD-specific rather than a consequence of more general effects of low cognitive ability. To obtain high-quality MEG data, we will deploy a research strategy we designate ?MEG-PLAN (MEG Protocol for Low-Language/Cognitive Functioning Ability Neuroimaging). The key elements of MEG-PLAN are: (1) Engage stakeholders (parents/providers) as ?partners in research? to develop a MEG scanning protocol that maximizes data collection success; (2) Examine automatic brain responses elicited with passive auditory paradigms, thereby obviating the need for participants to attend to the task or provide feedback; (3) Remove the need for an individual MRI to localize the MEG signal source by using a MEG which is registered to an age-appropriate template MRI; (4) Achieve motion tolerance of up to 2 cm via real-time MEG head tracking/motion compensation. This study addresses focus area #2 in the RFA ? ?Outcome Measures for Interventions or Treatments?."
"9196381","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of heart failure continues to rise with unacceptable rates of morbidity and mortality. Currently, over 6 million Americans have been diagnosed with heart failure with an associated annual health care expense estimated at 35 billion US dollars and rising. The single most important cause for heart failure is ischemic cardiomyopathy, where loss of cardiomyocytes due to ischemic events is the main driver of disease. Due to limited rates of cardiac regeneration (estimated at 1% new cardiomyocyte formation per year during normal aging), the workload on remaining cardiomyocytes is increased, giving rise to cardiac hypertrophy and ultimately heart failure. Since the most important driver of heart failure is loss of cardiomyocytes, the discovery of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) in the adult heart that can give rise to all cardiac lineages when cultured uncovered the possibility of enhancing cardiac regeneration. Up until this point cell therapy using cultured CPCs has been the main method used to enhance cardiac regeneration. However, most injected cells die within weeks and the ultimate improvement in cardiac function is likely mediated by endogenous CPCs. The current proposal will identify ways of stimulating CPCs to enhance endogenous regeneration. Our long-term goal is to understand how endogenous CPCs are activated in response to cardiac injury and what determines CPC fate decisions in vivo with the ultimate objective of finding strategies that enhance endogenous cardiac regeneration. We recently published genetic mouse models that allow lineage tracing of endogenous cardiac progenitor cells and will use these mouse models throughout this proposal. Upon genetic lineage tracing of endogenous CPCs we noted many endothelial cells being generated, but only few cardiomyocytes. However, we hypothesize that endogenous CPCs can be activated to enhance their cardiogenic potential. The proposed genetic mouse models and manipulations of specific signaling pathways will be used to identify strategies to enhance cardiac regeneration. Our specific aims are to 1) Determine whether and how different stimuli activate endogenous cardiac c-kit+ CPCs toward cardiac lineage, 2) Determine whether blocking endothelial fates will activate endogenous c-kit+ CPCs to become cardiomyocytes, and 3) Establish to what extent Notch1 signaling is important for c-kit+ progenitor proliferation and differentiation toward both endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes. The goal of this study is to define pathways that can stimulate endogenous cardiac progenitor cells to produce more cardiomyocytes. Future studies will employ strategies to enhance the proliferation and differentiation of eCPCs to improve cardiac regeneration."
"9381783","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentorship is an integral component of career advancement in academic medicine. There is also an acute need to mentor and nurture the next generation of career scientists in the area of dysphagia, a prevalent condition that places high burden on patient health and quality of life. The candidate proposes to increase the cadre of POR researchers and team scientists in swallowing disorders and respiratory-swallowing interactions with emphasis on discovery of novel methods of objective assessment and evidence-based, targeted interventions that hasten recovery across the course of a disease or condition and facilitate optimal outcomes. Research and career development will take place in a mentorship structure that provides an environment of support for successful patient oriented researchers transitioning into the early stages of academic careers in the study of swallowing and respiratory-swallowing impairment. These opportunities, in part, will arise from the candidate's own proposed research plan and collaborations. The primary objective of the research plan is to develop swallowing impairment phenotypes that express in three patient conditions with high morbidity and burden related to swallowing impairment (pulmonary, neurologic, head and neck cancer) using turn-key, standardized, valid and reliable measurement and data storage methods, developed by the candidate, and novel statistical mapping techniques. The secondary objective is to demonstrate a link between respiratory-swallow coordination pattern, airway protection, and the nature and severity of swallowing impairment. The long-term goal of this research is to develop prediction models (statistical and dynamic) that will enable clinicians to empirically predict type, severity, and treatment responsiveness of swallowing impairment at early stages of the dysphagia-related disease or condition."
"9333583","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in North American men. However, the genetic events associated with the malignant transformation of prostatic cells are largely unknown. Identification of new prostate specific genes could provide new markers and could be instrumental for development of new treatment modalities. Cten (C-terminal tensin-like) is a new focal adhesion molecule, whose expression is relatively restricted at the normal prostate gland. We have reported that cten is absent or down-regulated in prostate cancers, is a target of caspase 3 and an effector during apoptosis, regulates cell migration, recruits a tumor suppressor, DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), to focal adhesions and this interaction is critical for DLC1's tumor suppression activity. Interestingly, cten localizes not only to focal adhesions but also in the nucleus, suggesting that cten may be a transducer molecule, possibly involved in nuclear events in addition to events at the cell surface. Human cten gene is located on chromosome 17q21, a region often deleted in prostate cancer. These studies suggest that cten is a prostate-specific tumor suppressor whose disruption has repercussions in prostate cancer. However, our recent studies have shown that although not normally expressed in other tissues, cten is overexpressed in a large number of colon cancer patients, indicating that cten may possess an oncogenic activity in the colon. Therefore, cten may have dual functions that are tissue type specific. In this renewal proposal we will continually investigate the role of cten in the prostate and offer a molecular mechanism for the seemingly contradictory function of cten in colon cancer. We hypothesize that cten is a prostate-specific tumor suppressor that plays important roles at the focal adhesions and in the nucleus; and that alteration of cten expression/ function disrupts its normal actions and increases the risk for prostate cancer. Three specific aims are proposed to test our hypothesis.    Aim 1. To determine the role of cten in regulating the tumor suppression activity of DLC1    Aim 2. To establish the mechanism of cten nuclear translocation and its role in tumorigenesis    Aim 3. To demonstrate the function of cten in prostate tumorigenesis using in vivo systems   The gene to be studied is a very unique molecule, a focal adhesion-nucleus protein that may regulate the DLC1 tumor suppressor at focal adhesions and mediate a crosstalk between Wnt and androgen signaling in the nucleus. Verification of our hypothesis would indicate a possible role for cten as a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer and maybe other cancer types as well. Our animal studies will reveal cten's in vivo function and provide better mouse prostate cancer models for studying prostate tumorigenesis and drug screening."
"9172659","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease remains the primary cause of death and disability in the United States. Death is most commonly a direct result of ventricular arrhythmia which, in turn, is the consequence of alternations in ion channel function, affecting action potentials and cell-cell communication. Altered ion channel function in failing hearts also limits the heart's contractility, further worsening heart failure and the vicious cycle towards arrhythmia and death. Individual ion channels have half-lives that are on the order of hours, and a major cause of altered ion channel function in failing hearts is altered trafficking. Altered trafficking implies that the channels are not delivered to the correct subdomain on the cardiomyocyte plasma membrane (forward trafficking), or are removed incorrectly (reverse trafficking or internalization). Altered forward and reverse trafficking are components of most cardiac disorders. However the mechanisms of forward and reverse trafficking of membrane proteins, especially of cardiac ion channels, remain poorly understood.  My laboratory explores the basic mechanisms of cardiac ion channel trafficking. In this competitive renewal, we will identify three novel pathways with strong preliminary data for each. The channels of interest are the Connexin43 gap junction channel responsible for cell-cell communication, and the L-type Calcium Channel (alpha subunit Cav1.2), which is responsible for triggering the beat-to- beat intracellular calcium transient which initiates and helps determine the strength of each cardiac contraction. Each of the three pathways explored is a separate specific aim of this proposal.  Aim #1 is to determine if alternative translation is a mechanism of Cx43 auto regulation of forward traffic in health and disease. We have evidence in human heart that as many as six in frame AUG sequences initiate translation within the Cx43 (GJA1) exon. Our data indicate the truncated Cx43 isoforms are necessary at least for Cx43 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.  Aim #2 is to determine how the actin cytoskeleton contributes to directed channel delivery. Our studies indicate that the majority of intracellular Cx43 is moving slowly or not moving at all, due to association with actin. We have developed a novel microfluidics based cell patterning system to quantify actin dynamics and its contribution to ion channel trafficking and are finding that actin is important to working with microtubules in providing specificity of Cx43 and Cav1.2 delivery.  Aim #3 is to elucidate the post-translation cascade by which Cx43 is internalized from the plasma membrane. We have evidence that serine 373 phosphorylation on the Cx43 C-terminus needs to precede serine 368 phopsphorylation. Our new data will explore mechanism of phosphorylation dependent internalization and whether the products of alternative translation are involved."
"9178083","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are at least 500,000 victims of cardiac arrest each year in the United States. In the majority of these patients, the initial rhythm is not ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT), but is pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole. The survival rates for VT/VF arrests average around 20%. The survival rates for PEA and asystolic arrests are much lower, however, and average only around 5%. There is a critical need, therefore, for improved resuscitation strategies, since each 1% increase in survival rate would result in approximately 5000 additional survivors. This critical need is most apparent with PEA arrests, since little is known about the pathophysiology or the optimal treatment of these arrests, especially when compared to VT/VF arrests. Defibrillation is the definitive treatment for VT/VF arrest, but is not indicated in PEA arrest. We present the novel hypothesis that most PEA arrests are due to failure of ventricular muscle from acute ischemia and/or hypoxia in a substrate where there has been chronic ischemia and/or hypoxia. This contrasts with most VT/VF arrests where acute ischemia causes VT/VF in a healthier substrate. We further hypothesize that this chronic ischemia and/or hypoxia induces preconditioning, which prevents or delays the occurrence of VF, resulting in PEA arrest. We hypothesize, therefore, that therapy for PEA arrests must be directed at reversing this profound ischemia and/or hypoxia, as well as mitigating reperfusion injury. Even though there may be preconditioning, such preconditioning may not be uniform. In addition, the already severe compromise of the metabolic status of the heart would make any degree of reperfusion injury more detrimental in PEA arrests than in VT/VF arrests. Therapy should, therefore, be directed at generating substantial blood flow during resuscitation, including the use of vasodilators, to reverse the profound ischemia that may be present. Methods for augmenting blood flow should include the use of improved external compression devices, which may be particularly useful for treating out-of-hospital arrests; and the use of extracorporeal systems, which may be particularly useful for in-hospital arrests. Controlled reperfusion, including post conditioning, may be necessary at the beginning of reperfusion to reduce reperfusion injury. Additional preservation strategies may also be useful, including intra-arrest hypothermia. Finally, we hypothesize that each of these strategies will have incremental and additive improvement in outcomes from PEA cardiac arrest. The goals of this project are to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of PEA cardiac arrest, develop improved methods for augmenting blood flow during resuscitation, and also develop synergistic, improved strategies for mitigating the effects of the profound ischemia and/or hypoxia present in PEA arrest. These studies should provide new information and insights about the pathophysiology of PEA cardiac arrests, and may lead to substantial improvements in the now dismal outcomes from PEA cardiac arrests."
"9176032","Project Summary: The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that TGF-?1 released from platelets and activated by shear stress in the circulation contributes to the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis (AS) and the complications associated with implantation of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in heart failure (HF) patients. This will build upon our previous and new preliminary studies demonstrating that: 1) shear force can activate latent TGF-?1, 2) thiol-disulfide exchange contributes to the activation process, 3) mice deficient in platelet TGF-?1 are protected from developing cardiac fibrosis in response to pressure overload, 4) Reversa mice develop AS and increased plasma TGF-?1 levels that correlate with shear stress, and 4) both AS and LVAD-implanted HF patients have increased levels of TGF-?1 compared to controls. We will extend our findings by integrating data from biochemical analyses, animal models, and human patient studies. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that shear activates TGF-?1 by facilitating thiol-disulfide exchange involving TGF-?1, thiol isomerases, and/or other thiol-containing proteins, such as TSP1 and vWf. Purification of TGF-?1 and other thiol-containing proteins from platelets, proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry, and mutational studies of recombinant proteins will be employed to identify the shear-induced thiol-disulfide exchange responsible for TGF-?1 activation. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that TGF-?1 is released from platelets and subsequently activated by high shear in vivo using two mouse models: a surgically-induced Ascending Aorta Constriction model to acutely simulate high shear, and a Reversa mouse model that spontaneously develops AS and high shear across the aortic valve. We will assess TGF-?1 release and activation as well as the impact on TGF-?1 activation in mice with a mutation in the latency-associated protein (LAPC33S), whose TGF-?1 cannot be activated by shear and in mice selectively deficient in platelet PDI (PDIflox). Reversa mice have increased levels of TGF-?1 that correlates with shear stress. We will test the role of platelet TGF-?1 and PDI on AS progression by breeding Reversa mice with platelet-specific PF4Cre/Tgfb1flox and PF4Cre/PDIflox mice. A TGF-?1 neutralizing antibody will be used to monitor AS progression as a model for intervention. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that release and activation of TGF-?1 occurs in vivo by assessment of TGF-?1 levels in AS and LVAD-implanted HF patients. AS patients have elevated TGF-?1 levels compared to controls. TGF-?1 levels will be correlated with AS valve pathophysiology. Whether TGF-?1 levels are decreased after valve replacement surgery will be assessed. TGF-?1 levels are elevated in LVAD-implanted HF patients and associated with the loss of vWf multimers. We will monitor TGF-?1 levels through heart transplantation and correlate with vWf multimers to establish TGF-?1 and vWf-multimers as surrogate markers for the risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage, respectively. Collectively, these studies will illuminate and guide development of potential interventions to prevent AS progression as well as diagnostic tools to detect early complications in post-LVAD implantation HF patients."
"9173046","CORE E: Abstract  Despite an enormous increase in the basic science understanding of many IDDs, progress in  the application of this basic knowledge in the clinic has been limited. The reasons for this gap in  ?translation? are many, but most agree that advances in defining, dissecting, and understanding  the multiple dimensions of IDD phenotypes have lagged, with a few exceptions. A few examples  are illustrative. Social functioning, an obvious and foundational element of adaptive ability and  quality of life, is a natural target for intervention efforts across all IDDs, yet the field lacks  suitable measurement tools that are well suited for application in clinical trials, and few  measures have been rigorously compared to real world functioning for their precision and  validity. Social measures often applied for diagnosis (Vineland Socialization or Communication  subscales, ADOS, Social Responsiveness Scale-2, Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Social  Withdrawal subscale [ABC-SW]) are either insensitive to change (too few items and limited  range of scoring), too broad, too burdensome for repeated short-term use, too narrow, and/or  vulnerable to expectancy bias. Even though the ABC-SW subscale has received a partial  endorsement as a possible endpoint for capturing treatment effects on social behavior in Autism  Spectrum Disorder (ASD)(and a separate modification likewise proposed for Fragile X  Syndrome [FXS] trials), a review of its performance finds it vulnerable to placebo effects.  Moreover, on closer inspection, the majority of the subscale's items are restricted to social  interest alone, not capturing the many other possible social dimensions of interest. An objective  of our Core is to continue our existing efforts to creatively increase study impact by developing  and applying novel measurement approaches. An example was the substudy of McCracken and  Kasari embedded in the NIMH Research Units on Pediatric Pharmacology (RUPP) Autism  Network's Methylphenidate for the Treatment of Hyperactivity in Pervasive Developmental  Disorder randomized clinical trial (RUPP Autism Network, 2005). Using an abbreviated (<10-  minute scripted interaction repeated weekly) modification of the Early Social Communication  Scales (ESCS), we documented the first example in the literature to our knowledge of a positive  drug effect on core deficits of joint attention and emotion regulation in ASD."
"9268977","! Project Summary: Most human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people, if not adherent to highly active combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), ultimately succumb to chronic infection. However, some are known as ?elite controllers? (ECs) who demonstrate superior virus control, maintaining virtually undetectable viral loads even in the absence of cART. Although HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in ECs are critical for viral control and progression status, harnessing CTLs to combat HIV reservoirs remains challenging because little to no viral protein is produced in quiescent CD4+ T cells, rendering this reservoir difficult to detect by the host CTL immune response. Currently available strategies to purge latently HIV-infected cells include ?Shock and Kill,? broadly responsive TCR elicited by therapeutic vaccines, broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) blockade, and other immune checkpoint blockades. However, none of these strategies efficiently eradicates HIV reservoirs. Our preliminary data showed that strong phosphorylation of a small adaptor molecule, chicken tumor virus number 10 regulator of kinase (Crk), was induced by PD-1 signaling at the center of exhausted HIV-specific CTL immunological synapses. This critical observation prompted us to develop a novel strategy that targets a common master-signaling molecule to restore the function of exhausted CTLs to eradicate HIV reservoirs, which is an approach that is superior to targeting individual inhibitory immunoreceptor. We hypothesize that chronic HIV leads to functional impairment of CTLs via up-regulation of inhibitory receptors and that the resulting downstream phosphorylation of Crk, in turn, prevents CTL activation. We propose that exogenous phosphorylated Crk (pCrk) inhibitor could be used to restore exhausted CTL functions to eradicate HIV reservoirs. We propose the following two aims: (Aim 1) Restore the function of exhausted HIV-specific CTLs against productively infected cells by inhibiting Crk phosphorylation. pCrk inhibitors newly identified using multipronged approaches (including the state-of-the-art Alphascreen, thermal shift assay, in vitro kinase and cellular phosphoflow assay) will be tested to determine whether these pCrk inhibitors can restore functions of exhausted HIV-specific CTLs against productively infected cells. (Aim 2) Restore the function of exhausted HIV-specific CTLs against latently infected cells by inhibiting Crk phosphorylation. To further test the efficacy of pCrk inhibitors, we will determine whether pCrk inhibitors can restore the function of exhausted HIV-specific CTLs against latently infected cells. We will generate latently HIV-infected primary CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and lymph nodes to compare their sensitivity to killing by exhausted HIV-specific CTLs with and without pCrk inhibitors. If successful, therapeutic use of small-molecule pCrk inhibitors could improve care of chronic HIV patients, restoring exhausted patient CTL defenses. Successful outcomes of this research will lead to the development of a novel immunotherapy to eradicate HIV reservoirs and associated clinical trials. !"
"9172656","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies indicates that adult autologous stem cell based therapies show modest improvement of cardiac function. Emerging evidence from preclinical studies also suggests that hostile micro-environment in the infarcted myocardium, including inflammation and oxidative damage, have adverse effects on transplanted stem cell survival and function thereby posing a significant barrier to the adult stem cell-based therapies for repair of injured myocardium. Therefore, novel approaches to enhance full functional benefits of stem cell based therapies are critically needed. Pluripotent Stem cells including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have provided an alternative for the resurrection of damaged myocardium yet their use remains technically challenging and risky and cellular derivatives of pluripotent cells may still face the similar challenges of low engraftment and survival as is noted with adult stem cells. Therefore use of cell-free components derived from stem cells including iPS and ES cells, need to be explored for their reparative potential. Exosomes derived from such cells may provide one such cell-free source. Exosomes, known regulators of intercellular communication, carry the cell specific mRNA/miRNA signature and participate in cell-cell communication by transferring their materials to the target cells. Our preliminary data indicates that, ESC derived exosomes represent a novel cell free system capable of supporting myocardial regeneration, in part, by inducing cardiomyocyte proliferation and by enhancing cardiac progenitor cell augmentation, proliferation and differentiation. Therefore we hypothesize that ES/iPS-derived exosomes may represent a novel strategy to augment endogenous repair processes in the infarcted myocardium. Our goal is to establish that pluripotent stem cell-derived exosomes as a novel cell free therapeutic regimen for myocardial repair in response to chronic pathological insult. The significance of this study is to develop a novel understanding of the role played by mES cell derived exosomes in supporting cardiomyocyte and cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) based reparative processes in the heart. We will also extend these studies to determine the contribution of pluripotent cell specific miRNAs in regulating CPC reparative response to pathologic injury. Establishing the therapeutic value of these exosomes would help develop a novel cell free system to enhance myocardial repair and would provide a new direction for the restoration and/or augmentation of endogenous myocardial repair process."
"9181435","PROJECT SUMMARY Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and in humans using a combination of nonmyeloablative conditioning and donor bone marrow transplantation (DMBT) that results in transient donor chimerism. However, mixed chimerism protocols that achieve long term tolerance of kidney allografts in NHPs fail to induce tolerance in recipients of heart allografts. It is well known that some organs, such as kidney and liver, are tolerance-prone while others, such as heart and lung, are tolerance-resistant. In earlier studies using miniature swine, we took advantage of the tolerogenicity of kidney allografts and, through donor kidney cotransplantation, achieved long-term stable tolerance of heart allografts which, if transplanted alone, would have rejected acutely. Mechanistic studies in swine showed that kidney allografts were able to confer tolerance upon co-transplanted hearts by promoting the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). We have now extrapolated those findings to NHPs. By combining a mixed chimerism protocol that induces transient donor chimerism with donor kidney cotransplantation, we have succeeded in achieving long-term, stable tolerance of MHC mismatched heart allografts. These results are the first to demonstrate tolerance induction in NHP heart allograft recipients and the first to show that unresponsiveness to a tolerant-resistant organ can be achieved without durable donor chimerism. Based on preliminary results, we hypothesize that amplifying the contributions of host Tregs in NHP heart allograft recipients undergoing mixed chimerism conditioning will achieve long-term, stable tolerance without the need for kidney cotransplantation or durable chimerism. To test this hypothesis, we will first study the characteristics of Tregs generated by kidney cotransplantation and attempt to identify the cells or cell products within the kidney allograft capable of promoting those Tregs. These results will be applied to our subsequent studies aimed at finding a clinically relevant strategy of Treg amplification that effectively substitutes for simultaneous donor kidney transplantation. Our goal is to develop a Treg-amplified, mixed chimerism protocol that can be rapidly translated to human heart transplant recipients. Of note, results from Project 2, which will use novel but related strategies to achieve tolerance of stringent lung allografts, and Project 3, which will use humanized mice to evaluate novel Treg-stabilizing agents will guide the ongoing design of these experiments."
"9190864","PROJECT SUMMARY Congential heart disease is the most common congenital malformation, which is the leading cause of infant mortality in the US and Europe. Heterotaxy, a left-right patterning disorder, is a common congenital heart disease and affected children have poor prognosis ever after extensive surgical intervention. While previous work in model systems has implicated cilia dysfunction in heterotaxy, the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease are not understood, as demonstrated by human genetic studies that have identified candidate heterotaxy genes with no known function in heart development, left-right patterning, or cilia biology. One such study, performed by our collaborators at Yale, identified Nup188, a gene encoding a component (nup) of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), as a potential Heterotaxy candidate gene. Our preliminary data show that knockdown of Nup188 or its binding partner Nup93 1) recapitulates a heterotaxy-like phenotype in a Xenopus tropicalis model and 2) leads to a loss of cilia in multiple Xenopus tissues and in RPE cells. Moreover, our data are consistent with these phenotypes being a reflection of a direct role for nups at the cilium base as both Nup188 and Nup93, but not other nups, localize to the basal body and daughter centriole in Xenopus epidermis and RPE cells. Based on these (and other) results, I hypothesize that Nup188 is critical for ciliogenesis. To directly test my hypothesis, I must first define the nup-cilia interactome and generate reagents that can specifically address the function of nups at bases of cilia without affecting their established roles in nuclear transport. Thus, in Specific Aim 1, I will use a proximity-based ?BioID? approach to identify Nup188 neighboring proteins and binding partners at cilia bases. I will then perform direct binding experiments with full length and truncated versions of Nup188 to identify a cilia binding domain. Using this mapping data, in Specific Aim 2, I will generate a cell line that facilitates the functional separation of Nup188 at the NPC from Nup188 at the cilia by generating an allele of Nup188 that lacks the cilium binding domain. Finally, I will utilize this cell line to probe the role of Nup188 in ciliogenesis. These experiments will elucidate the mechanism by which Nup188 contributes to cilia function and to heart position during development."
"9371861","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease of the pancreas. The U.S. alone sees over 300,000 hospital admissions for acute pancreatitis annually with costs exceeding $2B. However, there is currently no specific therapy for this disease, a lamentable situation arising from our incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology. In part, this situation can be ascribed to the fact that, due to the non-availability of human acinar tissue for experimentation, most of our current knowledge of the pathophysiology of pancreatitis arises from experimental animal models. However, our preliminary data as well as other published studies indicate that there are significant differences in the physiology and pathobiology of acinar cells between humans and rodents. Such information accentuates the urgent need to re-access data generated from rodent models in models which truly reflect human disease. This is further reinforced by the negative outcomes of the clinical trials using the information learnt from experimental animal models. Recently, the advent of endocrine pancreas transplantation programs has made healthy human exocrine pancreatic tissue from donor organs available for in vitro experiments. There are only a handful of such transplantation centers in the US, and to successfully harvest and study human acini in-vitro requires an experienced exocrine pancreas lab. At our center we are uniquely poised to fulfill both pre-requisites. In the current proposal, we intend to utilize acinar cells harvested from pancreata of healthy donors to study and validate basic tenets in the physiology and pathophysiology of human exocrine pancreas. The studies proposed in the current grant will first confirm the tenets of stimulus secretion coupling in human acinar cells, since these principles form the backbone of studies on pathophysiology of pancreatitis. Next, the pathophysiology of early acute pancreatitis will be studied in two different in vitro models of acute pancreatitis in human acinar cells: hyperstimulation model and the more clinically apt model of biliary pancreatitis. We believe that the data generated through the experiments proposed in the current grant proposal will form the basis, in the future, of directed research applicable to the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis in humans and lead to accelerated development of specific therapy for its prevention and treatment."
"9191736","Abstract N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common messenger RNA and long noncoding RNA modification in eukaryotes. Through its effects on RNA processing, export, translation, and decay, m6A influences diverse processes including stem cell differentiation, energy homeostasis, and spermatogenesis. The cellular functions of m6A are mediated through its recognition by m6A reader proteins. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (HNRNPG) is a novel m6A reader protein that functions in neural development and regulates several alternative splicing events linked to neuromuscular diseases. Our preliminary data indicate that m6A influences the cellular localization of HNRNPG, and that m6A and HNRNPG co-regulate the alternative splicing of ~1,000 m6A-containing transcripts. To investigate how m6A regulates HNRNPG localization, I will examine the function of a specific m6A-modified lncRNA in the nuclear retention of HNRNPG, and I will determine the role of nucleo- cytoplasmic shuttling in the cellular function of HNRNPG. To investigate how m6A impacts HNRNPG-regulated alternative splicing events, I will use a pull-down approach to identify splicing factors that are recruited to m6A- modified transcripts by HNRNPG, and I will examine how knockdown of these splicing factors influences alternative splicing. Using the m6A reader HNRNPG as a model, these studies will elucidate novel mechanisms by which m6A influences protein localization and alternative splicing, two crucial cellular processes that are disrupted in a variety of human diseases."
"9220652","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Abnormalities in reward circuitry are characteristic of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders; however, elucidating the precise biological mechanisms underlying this dysfunction has proved challenging. 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (Velocardiofacial/DiGeorge Syndrome; 22qDS) presents a compelling model for investigating these mechanisms, as this neurogenetic disorder is associated with extremely high risk for multiple psychiatric disorders, particularly those associated with dopaminergic dysfunction, such as schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder. Several genes within the deletion region are implicated in brain development and prefrontal cortical (PFC) dopamine metabolism. As such, this disorder provides an ideal model in which to study the structure and function of brain regions known to be essential for frontally-mediated cognitive functions that rely on optimal dopamine levels.  Our hypothesis is that a life-long biological vulnerability, resulting from haploinsufficiency for specific genes critical for dopamine regulation, leads to alterations in behavior and neuroanatomy related to the reward system in patients with 22qDS. Examining these endophenotypes can offer empirical support for how the function of these genes impacts the brain at a system-wide level, [and how these effects may change over the course of development (particularly during the vulnerable adolescent period)]. The purpose of the proposed project is to quantify behavioral and structural neuroanatomic alterations in patients with 22qDS, [both cross-sectionally and longitudinally], and to investigate the contribution of allelic variation in the intact chromosome to these neuroanatomic and behavioral alterations. Aim 1 will first investigate an experimental measure of risk- taking and optimal decision-making in patients with 22qDS, [as well as a measure of real-world executive control], both of which we hypothesize to be impaired in this population. Aim 2 will examine alterations in volume, thickness and surface area in brain regions critical for decision-making and reward expectation (e.g., orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), with the hypothesis that 22qDS patients will show baseline abnormalities in these structures relative to typically developing controls, as well as abnormal trajectories of prefrontal cortical maturation. Aim 3 will employ genetic techniques to examine variation in specific genes relevant to dopaminergic and glutamatergic function (COMT and PRODH, respectively) that are hemizygously deleted in patients with 22qDS, in order to determine how allelic variation in the intact chromosome in 22qDS translates into differences in gene expression and, in turn, PFC structural variation and downstream effects on behavior. Together, the results of the experiments planned in pursuit of these aims will expand the current sphere of knowledge about the relationship between genetics and brain structure and function in the context of dopamine and reward circuitry. Investigation of this unique clinical population allows us to directly investigate links between genetic variation and brain dysfunction, thereby helping to elucidate the complex neurobiological mechanisms by which reward-related dysfunction and psychiatric illness may arise."
"9378290","PROJECT SUMMARY Normal function of the lower urinary tract (LUT) requires coordination of neuronal activities to allow bladder filling for urine storage later followed by bladder contraction to accomplish emptying at an appropriate time and place. Despite the fact that much is known about the neuroanatomy and mature circuitry of the LUT, relatively little is known about the molecular composition, development and postnatal maturation of distinct neuron subtypes that regulate bladder contractility. At present we lack a catalog of receptors expressed by different types of pelvic ganglia neurons that could be used to investigate how these critical neurons reach their targets in different LUT organs or direct regenerative efforts in cases of surgical damage. Even less is known about the molecular makeup of chemosensory brush cells and paraneurons in the urethra that are positioned to modulate LUT contractility. These cells contain high levels of neurotransmitters and thus can act as neuromodulators that stimulate bladder contraction in response to infection or mechanical stretch. Knowledge of the connections between motor neurons in pelvic ganglia and these neuromodulatory cells would enable detailed mechanistic studies of bladder sensitization and contractility in response to infection, inflammation or urine composition. The overall goal of this GUDMAP Atlas project is to fill these gaps in knowledge so that future mechanistic studies can be pursued. Four Specific Aims are proposed: (1) compile an atlas of genes expressed by pelvic ganglia neurons at single cell resolution during development and postnatal maturation; (2) map the first appearance and distribution of urethral neuromodulatory cells during development in the mouse; (3) identify genetic markers for subsets of urethral neuromodulatory cells by RNA-seq ; (4) generate a detailed spatial and temporal map of nerve terminals between neuromodulatory cells and sensory or autonomic pelvic ganglia neurons. These studies will generate novel information that is current lacking from the GUDMAP database. Our results will be summarized in diagrams and tutorial maps on the GUDMAP site and the gene sets identified will expedite comparative studies in human tissues. As a result the research community will be able to investigate the functions of specific cell types and test hypotheses using cell type and gene specific approaches."
"9124563","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developmental language disorders are highly prevalent in the general population. One of the earliest warning signs of many developmental disorders is delayed language acquisition, which is also associated with higher risk for subsequent reading and language disorders. However, little is known about how neural networks underlying language learning develop in early infancy and what neural and genetic mechanisms cause certain individuals to diverge onto an atypical developmental trajectory that leads to developmental language impairments. While there is a small but growing body of research using passive fMRI to examine the neural basis of language in infants (during natural sleep), no studies to date have used a longitudinal design or related early brain-based measures to subsequent behavioral outcomes. Understanding how early brain activity and connectivity relate to later language development may ultimately inform early diagnosis and interventions that will be more effective for treating developmental disorders that affect language. It is therefore essential to characterize the development of the neural networks subserving language acquisition in typically developing infants to serve as a basis for understanding how this system may go awry in developmental disorders such as specific language impairment, dyslexia, and autism spectrum disorders.  Here we propose to use a longitudinal multimodal approach integrating several neuroimaging measures with genetic data to investigate developmental changes in language-relevant networks in the infant brain. By using passive fMRI during natural sleep, we will study infants at two time points: 1.5 and 9 months of age. Prior studies have shown that newborns already demonstrate a preference for their native language and that by 6 months of age, infants can implicitly identify word boundaries in continuous speech by relying on statistical and prosodic cues in the input. Using stimuli analogous to those employed in these milestone behavioral studies, passive fMRI will be conducted to probe the neural signatures of these early linguistic achievements in the infant brain. Resting-state fMRI will also be performed to characterize developmental changes in functional connectivity within language-relevant brain networks. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), deterministic and probabilistic tractography will be conducted to examine the development of specific structural (i.e., white matter) tracts that connect language areas in the developing brain. In addition, we will examine how common genetic risk variants in CNTNAP2 that have been associated with language impairments in neurodevelopmental disorders may affect both activity and connectivity within language-relevant networks. Finally, we will relate th early measures of brain activity and connectivity to behavioral indices of language development assessed longitudinally (from 6 to 24 months of age).  Taken together, the studies outlined in this proposal aim to investigate the functional and structural networks underlying language acquisition in the infant brain, and to further examine how these networks are affected by CNTNAP2, a gene that plays a significant role in the development of fronto-striatal networks subserving language learning. The findings from the proposed research will provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying language learning in typical development and ultimately inform the early detection of altered developmental trajectories, which could lead to more effective interventions due to increased neuroplasticity early in development."
"9217144","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an adverse psychiatric condition that occurs after exposure to extremely stressful life events. PTSD patients also develop a variety of disorders with an inflammatory component. While majority of the studies indicate that there is an excessive inflammatory state in PTSD, the precise mechanisms of immunomodulation seen during PTSD are not clear. Recently, we have made an exciting observation that the severity of PTSD is correlated with greater inflammation and a broadly dysregulated microRNA (miR) profile with numerous targets that regulate inflammatory T cell response. Specifically, we noted that numerous downregulated miRs in PTSD patients targeted components of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway, crucial for the activation, proliferation and differentiation of T cells. In addition to the NFAT proteins themselves, the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin subunits A (isoforms PPP3CA, PPP2CB, and PPP3CC) and B (isoforms PPP3R1 and PPP3R2), which activate NFAT through dephosphorylation, were found to serve as targets for numerous dysregulated miRs in PTSD patients. The status of the T cell regulation, and in particular, the NFAT pathway in PTSD has not been evaluated thus far. Based on our preliminary studies, we will test the central hypothesis that PTSD associates, at least in part, with dysregulation in the epigenetic mechanisms that alter NFAT signaling pathway leading to a pro-inflammatory state. We will pursue these studies trauma-exposed PTSD patients when compared to trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls. We will pursue 3 specific aims: Aim 1: We will identify the mechanisms through which miR dysregulation leads to alterations in NFAT signaling pathway leading to an inflammatory state in PTSD patients. Aim 2: We will determine whether PTSD triggers differential DNA methylation of specific miR and/or targets of NFAT signaling pathway components in T cells leading to pro-inflammatory response. Aim 3: We will test the role of histone modifications in the expression of miRs on NFAT components in PTSD patients.  Together, our studies will delineate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying signaling pathways that lead to alterations in NFAT signaling and consequent T cell dysregulation and excess inflammation in PTSD patients. Our studies also aim to identify epigenetic biomarkers of PTSD that will help in the early diagnosis and treatment."
"9218526","Abstract  Rabies virus (RABV) and related pathogens of the lyssavirus genus cause a fatal neurological disease that leads to at least 55,000 deaths annually. Whereas the current rabies vaccine is save and efficacious, it protects only against infection by phylogroup I lyssaviruses but is ineffective against emerging phylogroup II pathogens that also cause rabies. This efficacy gap equally extends to the human rabies immunoglobulin, which is used in conjunction with vaccination for post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies. Independent of the phylogroup type of the causing agent, no reliable treatment option is currently available for rabies after the onset of clinical symptoms. The development of a novel drug discovery platform for the identification of next- generation anti-lyssavirus drug candidates with activity against all clinically relevant lyssavirus phylogroups is therefore urgently needed.  We hypothesize that shelf-stable and cost-effective small molecule inhibitors with broad anti-lyssavirus indication spectrum will improve global access to life-saving anti-rabies post-exposure prophylaxis, prepare against emerging lyssavirus pathogens of different phylogroups, and establish a foundation to explore innovative treatment options for symptomatic rabies. Building on our highly complementary multiple-year expertise in drug discovery assay development, automated drug screening, lyssavirus biology, and RABV pathogenesis, we have formed an interdisciplinary team to ultimately address this unmet clinical need. In pilot studies, we have generated a first-in-class RABV reporter strain harboring nano-luciferase in place of the G protein encoding open reading frame (RABV-?G-nanoLuc) that induces a single-cycle infection and can be maintained under standard biosafety conditions, developed a novel anti-RABV drug screening protocol suitable for automation, and miniaturized the assay to 384-well scale. In parallel, we have established direct and orthogonal counterscreens for hit candidate confirmation and lyssavirus indication spectrum assessment, and have developed a comprehensive panel of assays for early-stage mechanistic characterization. Building on this tangible foundation, we will in this 3-year pre-therapeutic discovery project fully validate the high-throughput screening (HTS) protocol and apply the assay to a drug discovery campaign using the HTS facilities established in our laboratory (specific aim 1). Emerging hit candidates will be verified in counterscreens, toxicity and indication spectrum determined on established cell lines and primary cells of human and murine origin, and the potential for synthetic optimization assessed (specific aim 2). To short-list a subset of structurally and mechanistically distinct lead candidates that warrant full synthetic development, confirmed hits will be mechanistically characterized, viral escape profiles determined, and the potential for brain penetration evaluated (specific aim 3)."
"9189918","Project Summary  Commonly prescribed immunosuppressant drugs target Calcineurin (CN), the ubiquitously expressed, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, to restrict the growth and differentiation of T cells. Unfortunately, transplant patients must undergo long-term treatment with CN inhibitors, which causes unwanted side effects, including post-transplant diabetes, neurotoxicity, and cancer. These side effects are attributed to CN inhibition in non-immune cells and underscore the importance of delineating the spectrum of CN targets and functions in human cells. However, to date there are only 27 known targets of CN in humans. CN binds to substrates via Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) termed ?PxIxIT? and ?LxVP,? which are located within intrinsically disordered regions of the proteome. PxIxIT sites in CN substrates are required for interaction with and dephosphorylation by CN and are therefore strong predictors of candidate CN substrates. We recently performed proteome-wide peptide phage display selections with CN using a library containing all known disordered regions in the human proteome, with the goal of discovering novel CN substrates and regulators. This screen, which identified PxIxIT sequences from many known CN substrates and regulators, also identified 20 novel PxIxIT-containing sequences, whose parent proteins include kinases, ion channels, cell cycle regulators, and transcription factors. These PxIxIT-containing sequences are evolutionarily conserved across all metazoans and many were independently predicted via novel computational tools developed in our laboratory. We hypothesize that many of these PxIxIT-containing proteins represent novel CN substrates and could indicate new points of regulation for CN in non-immune cells. The most highly enriched PxIxIT sequence belongs to Nup153, a nuclear basket-associated nucleoporin with a well-established role in nuclear transport. This novel PxIxIT sequence is located in a heavily phosphorylated region of Nup153 that determines interaction with nuclear transport factors, suggesting that CN may regulate the nuclear transport function of Nup153. In the first part of this proposal, we will employ in vitro and in vivo binding and dephosphorylation assays to systematically characterize these 20 PxIxIT-containing proteins and determine whether they are bona fide CN substrates. These studies will not only significantly expand the human CN signaling network, but will also provide us with new CN substrates to investigate in further mechanistic detail. In the second part of this proposal, we will investigate whether CN regulates the nuclear transport function of Nup153 by performing in vitro dephosphorylation assays and nuclear import assays in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Together, these studies will significantly expand the human CN signaling network and provide insight into novel functions of CN in non-immune cells."
"9235132","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and there are currently no curative treatment options for patients with advanced-stage disease. Progress has been made in characterizing specific genetic alterations present in lung cancer, which in some cases has translated to therapeutic options available for patients. For instance, mutations in EGFR are found in approximately 10-15% of lung adenocarcinomas, a histological subtype of lung cancer. Patients with tumors harboring somatic mutations in EGFR are commonly treated with and respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the efficacy of these EGFR TKIs is undermined by the inevitable emergence of drug resistance, which develops after an average of 12 months. There are currently no approved therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance implying that these agents are not curative thus novel approaches to further improve survival for patients are needed. Recent advances in tumor immunology have informed the potential use and efficacy of immunotherapy for the treatment of several malignancies. In cancers of the lung, skin and kidney, ongoing clinical trials have shown the efficacy of therapies that modulate the immune system. An example is the blockade of the immune regulatory molecule PD-1 expressed on exhausted T cells. Using genetically engineered mouse models of EGFR mutant lung cancer, we hypothesize that the use of agents that modulate the immune microenvironment in combination with EGFR-directed therapies is an effective approach to augment the efficacy of the latter. Our hypothesis is based on: 1) published work demonstrating activation of the PD-1 pathway in mutant EGFR tumors and 2) preliminary work from our lab revealing that treatment of EGFR tumors with TKIs is not sufficient to reverse immunosuppressive features within the tumor microenvironment, including PD-1 expression on T cells. We propose to study the functional role of components of the immune system on mutant EGFR-induced tumor progression and EGFR-TKI induced tumor regression. Finally, we will determine whether the combination of EGFR-TKIs with immune- modulatory agents can be used to delay or overcome acquired drug resistance."
"9265293","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Zika epidemic that began in Brazil and has spread to Central America and US territories, caused by the Asian Zika virus (ZIKV) strain, has been reported by the CDC as definitively linked to severe birth defects ? microcephaly, miscarriage and stillbirth. Detection of ZIKV RNA in the placenta and fetus and in maternal circulation for months, calcifications associated with long-standing infection, and intrauterine growth restriction indicate that virus-induced pathology impairs placental functions. To address the issue of transplacental ZIKV transmission, we propose a collaborative project between Dr. Lenore Pereira (UCSF) and Dr. Eva Harris (UC Berkeley), experienced investigators with complementary expertise in congenital infection of the human placenta and Flavivirus research, respectively. Our preliminary studies reveal that prototype and recently iso- lated Nicaraguan ZIKV strains infect cells in placental explants and primary cells isolated from human placenta that express AXL, Tyro3 and TIM1 tyrosine kinase receptors, which mediate ZIKV and the closely related dengue virus (DENV) infection in skin. Infected placental cells, including fetal amniotic epithelial cells, placental fibroblasts and trophoblast progenitor cells, developed cytopathology and expressed ZIKV envelope and non- structural NS3 proteins, and virus titers released depended on the receptors expressed and gestational age. Indicative of infection route, AXL was detected in decidua (uterine decidual cells and invasive cytotrophoblasts), chorionic villi (placental fibroblasts, Hofbauer cells and blood vessels) and fetal membranes (amniotic epithelial cells and trophoblast progenitor cells). Differential expression of receptors suggests how ZIKV could infect the decidua and spread to the placenta, fetus and amnion-chorion membranes. Further, in endemic regions, cross- reactive pre-existing antibodies to DENV could play a critical role in protection or pathogenesis of ZIKV in placenta tissues during pregnancy. Our overarching hypothesis is that placental primary cells and explants of decidua, chorionic villi and amnion-chorion membranes can be used as a model of the human placenta to define molecular mechanisms of ZIKV infection by free virions; the role of antibodies in neutralization, trans- cytosis, and enhancement of ZIKV infection in the placenta; and the translational impact of inhibitors and thera- peutic neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1. Identify cells at the uterine- placental interface that are susceptible to infection by Nicaraguan ZIKV strains in primary cells and placental explants, characterize cognate receptors, and identify small-molecule inhibitors of infection. Aim 2. Study the neutralizing and potentially enhancing role of ZIKV-specific and DENV-cross-reactive antibodies on infection and transcytosis in primary placental cells and explants and determine the therapeutic potential of neutralizing MAbs with modified Fc that preclude antibody-dependent enhancement. The proposed studies will reveal molecular mechanisms of ZIKV infection, routes of virus transmission to the fetus, and therapeutic potential for engineered antibodies and small molecule inhibitors that block infection and prevent congenital disease."
"9174088","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Executive function (EF), the ability to flexibly exercise control over thought, action, and emotion, develops rapidly in childhood and predicts a range of outcomes associated with success in adulthood, such as academic achievement, income, and health. Children's EF can be fostered through a wide range of training interventions, so it is a target area in the promotion of healthy development. Language is likely one critical factor tapped in successful training interventions. For example, children's use of overt or covert self-directed speech (termed private and inner speech, respectively) appears to play a key role in the engagement of EF in an anticipatory way, in advance of needing to execute a response. Such patterns have been observed across children's planning, task-switching, and working memory. Furthermore, such patterns appear to converge with a recently discovered developmental transition in the temporal dynamics of EF. Specifically, children shift from a more reactive form of control, engaged in the moment as needed, to a more proactive form of control, engaged in anticipation of needing it. These developments in the temporal dynamics of EF and in the use of language to engage EF in an anticipatory way may support one another, but their relationship has not been tested, nor has the relationship between private speech and subsequent inner speech. In an effort to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the development of EF, the proposed project aims to make an innovative contribution by integrating previously independent lines of research with a new theoretical approach and complementary methods and paradigms in the pursuit of two mutually informative aims. Aim 1 examines relations among private speech, proactive control and inner speech using established paradigms and individual differences and longitudinal methods. Proactive control will be assessed at multiple levels of analysis (behavioral, pupillometric, neurophysiological), to provide convergent, comprehensive data on the temporal dynamics of the shift from reactive to proactive control and how it relates to private speech. Private speech and proactive control are expected to be correlated at age 6, and these factors are expected to predict the transition to the use of inner speech at 7 years of age. Aim 2 tests questions of causality by manipulating children's use of proactive control or private speech, and examining the effect on the other process. Experimentally increasing children's proactive control is expected to increase their subsequent use of private speech, and encouraging children's private speech is expected to increase their subsequent use of proactive control. The proposed research would provide not only the first link between distinct language processes supporting EF, but also the first link between these language processes and the shift from reactive to proactive control. The knowledge gained from this project will advance the study of the development of EF, and may lead to the design of larger-scale training interventions to improve EF in disadvantaged populations."
"9262051","7. Project Summary/ Abstract Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents 15-20% of newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer, and is a particularly aggressive form of this disease. Due to a lack of known molecular targets, there are currently no effective targeted therapies available for patients with chemoresistant TNBC. Infiltration of the tumor by cytotoxic T-cells, which can target and kill tumor cells when functional, is correlated with improved prognosis in TNBC patients. The preliminary data presented here suggest that TNBC cells secrete kynurenine, a tryptophan catabolite with known T-cell-suppressive actions, during the part of metastasis that requires cancer cells to survive in the absence of attachment to a basement membrane (survival in forced-suspension culture). Using T-cells derived from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteer donors, these data show that purified kynurenine decreases the activation and viability of both CD4+ (helper) and CD8+ (cytotoxic) T-cells, and may increase the differentiation of T-regulatory cells, an immune cell that can suppress the function of cytotoxic T-cells. Furthermore, these preliminary data suggest that conditioned media from TNBC cells that are surviving in forced-suspension culture is suppressive of CD8+ T-cell activation, viability, and function. The preliminary data demonstrate that upregulation of the tryptophan catabolizing enzyme TDO2 is the mechanism by which TNBC cells increase their secretion of kynurenine. Using publicly available gene expression data sets, the preliminary data show that TDO2 expression is increased in breast tumors compared to normal breast tissue, and high TDO2 expression in the primary tumor is correlated with poorer patient outcomes in invasive breast cancer. Based on these data, it is hypothesized here that TDO2 activity in TNBC cells is a critical mechanism by which TNBC cells suppress the function of T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity, and that TDO2 inhibition will increase cytotoxic T-cell function and thereby decrease tumor burden in preclinical models of this aggressive disease. In Specific Aim 1, TNBC cell lines and T-cells derived from the blood of healthy volunteer donors will be used to test whether TDO2 is required for the ability of TNBC cells to suppress antitumor T-cell functions in vitro. In Specific Aim 2, an immunocompetent mouse model of triple-negative mammary carcinoma will be used to test whether inhibiting TDO2 decreases tumor burden, metastasis, and antitumor T-cell function in vivo. Completion of these proposed studies will determine whether TDO2 is a mechanism by which TNBC evades antitumor T-cells, and will enhance the field?s understanding of tumor immunology in breast cancer. Together, the findings from these studies will help guide development of a novel targeted therapy for treatment of this aggressive breast cancer subtype for which therapeutic options are currently limited to chemotherapy."
"9149297","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the population ages, cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are becoming increasingly important public health issues. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered a precursor to AD, and early identification of MCI and effective management of risk factors associated with conversion from MCI to dementia is an important step in managing the public health crisis of AD. Unfortunately, MCI is an unstable diagnostic construct, and key predictors of conversion and reversion are poorly understood. Multiple vascular factors and prevalent cardiovascular disease are known risks for the development of AD, so a plausible predictor of diagnostic fluctuations in MCI is the presence of concomitant micro vascular disease in the brain. This proposal will leverage the existing and robust dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to examine neuroimaging markers of micro vascular and microstructural tissue changes in the white matter with cognitive trajectory among cognitively normal older adults and individuals with MCI. We will (1) assess how stable versus progressive cerebral micro vascular disease and micro structural changes in white matter affect maladaptive cognitive aging over time and (2) assess the mediating effect of baseline systemic vascular disease (using a vascular health index) in the longitudinal relation between micro vascular and micro structural white matter changes and diagnostic conversion and cognitive trajectory. Insights regarding complex relations between systemic vascular disease and micro vascular or microstructural changes in the brain have important public health implications because they will contribute to early identification of a vulnerable population at high risk for cognitive progression. Furthermore, because vascular risk factors can be modified over the life course to reduce the burden of cerebrovascular disease in older adults, this vulnerable population would benefit most from novel strategies to delay or prevent progression, which is particularly valuable in light of the aging of the population and increasing prevalence of AD."
"9237495","Chronic rejection of transplanted organs remains the primary cause of graft failure over time despite advances in immunosuppression. Memory T cells and production of antibodies by B cells are recognized as important mediators of chronic rejection but are not effectively controlled by current immunosuppression regimens. We find that antibody-independent functions of B cells also play a significant role in the pathogenesis of alloimmunity and chronic rejection by presenting antigen and providing costimulation to T cells. Here, we will test the hypothesis that B cell interactions with T cells play a key role in the development, maintenance and recall of T cell memory. We propose to (a) delineate when, where and which B cells interact with T cells in shaping memory responses, and (b) test whether blocking these interactions will prevent chronic rejection. Non-selective targeting of B cells by global depletion strategies may be detrimental as it also removes B cells with regulatory functions. Understanding which specific B cell populations interact with T cells, when and where they function to sustain long-lived memory is therefore a clinically relevant and significant goal. Results from these proposed studies would allow us to develop novel therapies that inhibit T cell memory and prevent chronic rejection by targeting specific functions, subpopulations and/or migration of B cells."

"9176026","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vast majority of life, from bacteria to humans, evolved 24 h rhythms (circadian; from the latin circa - about - and diem - day) in genetic regulation, physiology and behavior. Stable circadian rhythms are critical for maintaining normal mental and physical health. In mammals (including humans), circadian rhythms are present in most tissues, but orchestrated by a master circadian clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN does not oscillate at exactly 24 h, and is aligned to the Earth's rotation using light cues from the eye. Abnormal light cues (e.g., artificial light at night, time-zone changes, or irregular sleep patterns) perturb SCN rhythms, and desynchronize subordinate oscillating tissues system-wide. Acutely, these circadian disruptions cause discomfort and cognitive impairment until synchrony is reestablished. Chronic circadian disruptions (CCDs), (e.g., rotating shifts or frequent travel), however, can cause lasting impairments, including but not limited to: cancer, ulceration, heart disease, and depression in adults. The impact of circadian instability on more vulnerable, developing organisms is not known. Thus, given the relative sensitivity of development to perturbation, the present proposal explores whether CCD, early in life, has an enduring impact. My pilot data indicate that CCD during pregnancy and weaning adversely affects offspring morphology and adult behavior, providing impetus for empirical examination. It is possible that CCD negatively affects development by desynchronizing system-wide physiology in the developing organism, or through disharmony between offspring rhythms and those of their mother. It is also possible that CCD causes maternal stress, which is communicated to the fetus chemically and to the neonates behaviorally. Establishing the impact of CCD across early development, and disambiguating effects of physiological and behavioral disruption from those of maternal stress, will inform strategies for prevention and abrogation in pregnant mothers and young children. In the present proposal I will first examine the precise timing during which CCD exposure negatively impacts maternal care, offspring physical development, and offspring adult behavior to clarify the times of development most sensitive to early-life circadian disruptions. Next, to determine the specific contribution of maternal stress to observed deficits, I will explore the impact of CCD on maternal and offspring glucocorticoid - a key stress hormone - rhythms relative to rates of neurogenesis required for normal maternal care and offspring learning, and with epigenetic modifications known to regulate stress. Finally, I will employ strategies to 1) protect mothers from the negative impact of circadian disruption by genetically protecting new neurons from glucocorticoids, and 2) rescue the rhythms of disrupted offspring with exercise, a treatment that also reduces stress and enhances neurogenesis. Together, these studies will clarify the specific developmental impact of circadian disruption, the mechanisms by which CCD negatively impacts development, and identify targets of opportunity for clinical interventions to reduce the impact of CCD in those affected."
"9182900","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this proposal, which is a renewal of a previously funded award, we will investigate maternal environmental factors during pregnancy and risk of childhood autism in the offspring from a national birth cohort in Finland (the Finnish Prenatal Study of Autism, FiPS-A). No previous study of autism has ever examined the proposed prenatal factors by maternal biomarkers and their relationship to perinatal complications and growth velocity of the child's head circumference during infancy. The putative risk factors include environmental toxins (including PCBs and insecticides) and infections (influenza and Chlamydia trachomatis). We aim to address these questions in pregnancies of a large sample of autism cases and matched controls using maternal serum samples that were drawn and stored in nearly all pregnancies in Finland over the course of the study. The children with autism and their matched controls have been identified from detailed databases that contain diagnoses on nearly all cases of autism in Finland. These subjects have been linked to the maternal serum samples and to other registries including data on perinatal complications. In this study, the maternal serum samples of autism cases and of matched controls will be analyzed for these environmental factors, and their occurrence during pregnancy will be compared between the cases and controls. We shall also test whether these maternal environmental factors during pregnancy are related to a select number of other pregnancy and birth complications and to abnormalities in the velocity of head circumference during infancy. This research has the potential to result in a better understanding of potential risk factors for autism and of convergen, as well as divergent, developmental pathways that lead to the illness. Since the risk factors investigated in this study are relatively common in the population, their discovery may lead to prevention of cases of autism by straightforward public measures in pregnant women, including reduction of exposure to environmental contaminants, and prevention of infections, such as influenza and sexually transmitted diseases during pregnancy. These studies could also result in an improved understanding of the mechanisms by which prenatal insults alter postnatal brain development in autism and, along with other measures, potentially target infants at high risk for the disorder for intervention. In summary, the proposed work builds on an existing national birth cohort, and is anticipated to have considerable impact on an emerging and potentially transformative area of research epidemiology and clinical/basic neuroscience, as well as lead to improvements in current public health policy recommendations for care during pregnancy."
"9246148","Abstract A major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research is the design of immunogens capable of inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that bind to the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). While many HIV bnAbs have been isolated from chronically infected patients, raising bnAbs by immunization has been difficult. The principal problems appear to be (1) that bnAb epitopes are sub-dominant and so the response must be primed and boosted in such a way as to avoid off-target responses and favor the desired specificities, (2) that most forms of Env bind poorly to unmutated precursors of bnAbs so that bnAb responses are not typically primed appropriately and (3) we do not understand how best to boost responses once primed to yield bnAbs that typically have an unusual amount of somatic mutation. In this proposal, we address these problems by study of engineered immunogens in bnAb knockin mice. We focus on two classes of bnAbs, VRC01 and PGT130, which we predict will be readily raised by vaccination in humans using appropriately engineered immunogens. VRC01 is the prototype bnAb of a class that recognizes the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) and PGT130 is a representative of a class of glycan-dependent bnAbs that bind the V3 loop and mannose patch on Env. Both antibody classes have been described in many HIV infected individuals and are particularly potent and broad suggesting that a vaccine able to elicit such Abs would provide protection at relatively low Ab concentrations. We have previously generated mice engineered to carry B cells with germline reverted (gl)-VRC01 immunoglobulin heavy (H) and light (L)-chains, and here we propose to generated new knock-in mice carrying gl-PGT130 H- and L-chain genes. The mice express the B cell receptors that should be triggered and matured to generate VRC01 or PGT130 class bnAbs and will be used to investigate immunogens and immunization strategies. For priming, we will use existing germline-targeting immunogens reactive to gl-VRC01 and we will generate novel engineered immunogens targeting gl- PGT130 and. For boosting we will test a range of engineered and natural immunogens to focus and enhance intermediate and final steps in bnAb maturation. This study will test the generality of our germline-targeting approach, discover new vaccine candidates, and teach us lessons on how to maximize subdominant anti-viral responses that should inform human vaccination strategies in general."
"9181437","PROJECT SUMMARY Our laboratories have a long-standing interest in immune tolerance in transplantation, with a particular focus on regulatory T cells (Tregs). While Tregs expressing Foxp3 are required for normal immune homeostasis increasing data suggests that this lineage of cells may be unstable (e.g., as a result for example of inadequate IL-2, TCR and CD28 stimulation, or due to exposure to inflammatory cytokines), meaning that Tregs can revert/convert to effector T cells and thus contribute to loss of tolerance to self or to allografts. One of the key pathways controlling lymphocyte lineage specification and responsiveness is the PI3K pathway, which can be activated via CD28 and the IL-2R. While PI3K is essential for conventional T cell responses, over activation of the PI3K pathway dramatically inhibits Treg development. The primary regulator of PI3K activity in T cells is the lipid phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10). To investigate how PI3K controls Tregs, we created mice with PTEN deleted specifically in Tregs by breeding mice with a PTENfl/fl allele with Foxp3-YFP-Cre knock-in animals to generate PTEN-DTreg mice. Surprisingly, although these mice have elevated numbers of Tregs, a high proportion of those cells are CD25- and CD62Llo, and the animals are susceptible to induced autoimmunity and ultimately develop a severe polyclonal lymphoproliferative disorder. Interestingly, preliminary studies suggest that PTEN-deficient Tregs may have profound metabolic alterations, including over-reliance on glycolysis (vs. oxidative metabolism) for energy. Moreover, inhibition of glycolysis restores CD25 levels to normal. This has led us to formulate the hypothesis that PI3K activity induced via inflammation may disrupt Treg homeostasis due to reduced cytokine receptor expression, altered metabolism and apparent loss of regulatory capacity. Our goals are to determine how PI3K in Tregs controls Treg homeostasis and whether drug targeting of the PI3K pathway can stabilize Tregs. To do so, we have three aims. In Aim #1, we will use fate mapping mice to examine how PTEN loss alters Treg stability and function under homeostatic conditions, and in a well characterized model of autoimmunity. In Aim #2, we will determine the mechanism by which PI3K controls CD25 expression, examine how loss of PTEN alters Treg metabolism, define what role these changes play in Treg homeostasis and stability, and identify drugs which modulate metabolism that can be used to stabilize Tregs in vitro. In Aim #3, we will apply these findings, and pharmacologic manipulation to transplantation models, including a humanized mouse model, to develop means to optimize Treg stability and function. Together, these studies will yield new insights into Treg signaling pathways and provide potential therapeutics strategies to enhance immune tolerance."
"9277848","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid advances in nanotechnology will be accompanied by the exposure of millions of individuals to products containing nanomaterials. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are a major type of engineered nanomaterial designed and modified at the atomic level for multiple uses (electronics, engineering, medicine). While there are many beneficial uses for CNTs, there is also strong evidence that they cause lung injury and respiratory disease in mice and rats. A major concern is that CNTs have some properties similar to asbestos, a fiber that is linked with the development of pulmonary fibrosis (tissue scarring) and mesothelioma (a rare cancer on the pleural surface of the lung). We discovered that inhaled CNTs migrate to the pleura (the sensitive mesothelial lining surrounding the lungs) in mice to cause pleural injury and inflammation. We have also reported that CNTs increase pulmonary fibrosis in mice pre-exposed to allergens or bacterial lipopolysaccharide. It is paramount to understand how CNTs cause respiratory diseases in mice, especially fibrosis and cancer, before human exposures become widespread and identify susceptibility factors to clearly evaluate risk. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate CNT toxicity using genetically engineered mouse models of susceptibility to specific respiratory diseases; specifically pulmonary fibrosis, and mesothelioma. We further seek to determine whether selective surface coatings achieved by atomic layer deposition (ALD), a novel technique of engineering nanoscale structures, affect the potential of CNTs to mitigate or exacerbate these respiratory diseases. The specific hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that susceptibility to CNT-induced pulmonary fibrosis and mesothelioma is due to reduced expression or impaired functional interaction between COX-2, STAT-1, and p53. The following specific aims will be carried out to test this hypothesis: In Aim 1, we will determine whether COX-2 mediates increased p53 levels after exposure to ALD-CNTs and whether COX-2 deletion reduces p53 levels in the lungs of exposed mice to cause fibrosis or mesothelioma. In Aim 2, we will determine whether STAT-1 activation induces and activates p53 after exposure to ALD-CNTs and whether STAT-1 deletion reduces p53 in the lungs of exposed mice to cause fibrosis or mesothelioma. In Aim 3, we will determine whether p53-deficient mice are susceptible to pulmonary fibrosis or develop mesothelioma after exposure to CNTs and whether ALD modification of CNTs alters disease outcome. In Aim 4, we will determine whether ALD-modified CNTs activate MAPKs via ROS as a proximal signal to induce COX-2, STAT-1, or p53, and whether loss of COX-2, STAT-1, or p53 amplifies CNT-induced MAPK signaling. This novel approach will provide valuable information on mechanisms through which CNTs cause respiratory diseases. Moreover, we will identify specific genes whose deficiency will put individuals at greater risk resulting from CNT exposure. Our approach also takes advantage of an innovative cross-disciplinary approach to specifically modify the surface chemistry of carbon nanotubes to determine whether toxicity and disease susceptibility are increased or decreased. The new insights into the molecular mechanisms through which CNTs promote chronic lung disease in mice will improve our understanding of susceptibility to specific types of lung disease. The broad impact of this work will directly affect the health and well-being of millions of individuals in the U.S. and worldwide by providing essential information for the design of safer nanomaterials."
"9379061","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Leyenaar is a pediatric hospitalist and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Tufts University School of Medicine. Her goal is to become an independent clinician-investigator and a national leader in the care of hospitalized children, focused on improving health care efficiency while providing patient-centered care. Dr. Leyenaar's proposed career development plan incorporates mentored research and training in advanced statistics, qualitative methods, stakeholder engagement and implementation research as part of a PhD in Clinical and Translational Science. Dr. Leyenaar's mentorship team brings expertise in patient-centered outcomes research in a comparative effectiveness framework, guiding her career development. Dr. Lindenauer, primary mentor, is an accomplished investigator with an established record of mentoring investigators toward independent research careers. Dr. Leyenaar works in an environment extremely supportive of her success, with access to all of the resources required to achieve her long-term goals. In 2012, 1.8 million children were hospitalized in the United States, generating aggregate costs of 20.6 billion dollars. The majority of these children were admitted to hospitals through emergency departments (ED). For children who are medically stable, direct admission is an alternative approach involving referral to hospital without receiving care in the hospital's ED. Among children with timely access to outpatient healthcare providers, direct admission may offer benefits including improved coordination between health care providers, reduced ED volumes, and reduced healthcare costs. However, potential risks of direct admissions include delays in initial evaluation and management that might adversely impact patient safety. The goal of Dr. Leyenaar's research is to identify the pediatric populations, healthcare settings, and procedures that facilitate safe and effective direct admissions. She will accomplish this goal by: (1) comparing the outcomes of direct and ED admissions for common clinical conditions; (2a) characterizing the perspectives of stakeholders in the direct admission process; (2b) developing a consensus-driven guideline and identifying safety and quality indicators for direct admissions; and (3) pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing this direct admission guidelin. Aim 1 will be accomplished using a large administrative database to conduct a retrospective cohort study of children hospitalized at structurally diverse hospitals in the United States, developing advanced statistical models to compare outcomes among children admitted directly to those admitted via EDs. Aim 2 will be accomplished by engaging parents, healthcare providers, payers and policymakers in deliberative discussions about their admission experiences and perspectives, followed by a Delphi process to develop a direct admission guideline and prioritize quality indicators. Aim 3 will involve implementation of this guideline at one hospital for six months, generating data vital to subsequent studies and Dr. Leyenaar's emergence as an independent investigator."
"9173044","Project: Abstract  The proposal is truly translational, as it draws from clinical observation and moves  towards rigorous quantification of biomarkers of cognitive impairment in both mouse  models and patients. Such a study will serve as a model for studies of other  neurodevelopmental disorders in our comprehensive Center. These biomarkers can then, in  future studies, be directly related to gene expression. First, we will identify a mechanism-based  electrophysiological biomarker of cognitive dysfunction and potential responsiveness to  treatment in a genetically well-defined syndrome highly associated with ID. Standardized  measures of cognition are limited in their ability to quantify subtle individual differences or to  capture clinical heterogeneity that may inform prognosis and intervention. Our group has  considerable expertise in the integration of EEG biomarkers with behavior to better characterize  children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Second, we will perform parallel studies in mouse  models, in order to validate and better understand the genetic basis of biomarker identified in  humans and to begin to test treatments that may alter both the cell activation patterns and  behavior in these mouse models. Specifically we will test how abnormal oscillations disrupt  information flow in awake behaving animals, allowing us to directly link electrophysiological  changes to cognition.  Innovative methods to study electrophysiological markers in both mouse models and  patients. The human EEG experiments in the Jeste Lab will make use of new analysis  techniques to measure signal complexity and to quantify resting state spectral power from  challenging populations. The mouse experiments will make use of custom-made high density  electrophysiological recordings from hundreds of neurons with silicon probes targeted to  multiple cortical regions. New attention-based multimodal set shifting task designed in the  Golshani lab to record the activity of large neuronal populations during flexible decision making  and attentional set shifting, a cognitive domain that is affected in the disorder. Finally, we will  use a new generation of miniaturized microscopes to record the activity patterns of large  populations of hippocampal neurons over days during learning, allowing us for the first time to  follow population dynamics in the same group of neurons during learning and extinction.  Importantly, these studies are rooted in gaining a new understanding of ID at a systems level  with a desire to find convergence in mechanisms and evidence-based treatments for individuals  with this heterogeneous group of disorder."
"9192323","Lyme arthritis (LA), a common late manifestation of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, usually resolves after appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, in some patients arthritis persist for months or years following apparent spirochetal killing by 2-3 months of oral and IV antibiotic therapy, termed antibiotic-refractory LA. Joints in these patients are characterized by excessive synovial inflammation and proliferation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of various biological processes such as inflammation and proliferation, and mice with defects in miRNA function have significantly altered immune responses to B. burgdorferi infection and more severe Lyme arthritis. However, the role of miRNAs has not yet been examined in human LA. To determine how miRNAs modulate human LA, an unbiased screen was performed to measure miRNA expression in synovial fluid (SF) and synovial tissue from antibiotic-refractory LA patients. Patients with infectious LA (before IV antibiotic therapy), RA (a prototypic chronic joint inflammatory disease), or osteoarthritis (OA, a minimally inflammatory joint disease) were used as comparison groups. Synovial tissue and SF from patients with LA and RA, but not OA, contained an inflammatory miRNA signature, including miR- 146a and miR-155. In patients with antibiotic-refractory LA, this inflammatory miRNA signature correlated with elevated inflammatory markers and longer disease duration. In addition to an inflammatory signature, antibiotic-refractory LA and RA patients had a distinct proliferative miRNA signature, including miR-142 and miR-223. In contrast, infectious LA (prior to oral or IV antibiotic therapy) or OA patients lacked this proliferative signature. In vitro studies using fibroblasts, the predominant resident cell in the synovial lesion, demonstrated that miRNAs isolated from SF of LA patients are transferred to fibroblast-like synoviocytes, suggesting miRNAs may act as paracrine regulators of gene expression in resident cells during LA pathogenesis. Based on these preliminary results, it is proposed that after antibiotic therapy, patients with antibiotic- responsive LA appropriately down-regulate inflammation and repair damaged tissue, leading to resolution of arthritis. In contrast, patients with antibiotic-refractory LA fail to restore homeostasis following apparent spirochetal killing, and what starts as an immune response to infection develops into uncontrolled synovial inflammation and proliferation. In these patients, accumulation of inflammatory miRNAs indicates a failure to down-modulate immune responses, and accumulation of proliferative miRNAs indicates a failure to appropriately regulate proliferation and tissue repair. This proposal aims to determine the roles of miRNAs in regulating synovial inflammation and proliferation in human LA pathogenesis, and to explore the potential of miRNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for patients with infection-induced chronic inflammation."
"9178031","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by increased emotional volatility and reported stress, and relatedly, is also the typical age of onset for many psychiatric mood disorders. Concurrently, the social lives of adolescents change and expand reflecting increased independence and preparation for adulthood. While the emotional and social changes that take place during adolescence are well documented, less research has examined the relationship between the two, or in other words, how do social forces shape emotions? To address this gap in the literature, this proposal will take a developmental cognitive neuroscience approach to examine mechanisms underlying the relationship between social and emotional processing during adolescence. Aim 1 will examine how social influence shapes responses to negative situations during adolescence compared to adulthood. This aim is meant to address the observed increase in negative mood states that take place during adolescence. Aim 2 will measure how social influence shapes responses to primary rewards during adolescence compared to adulthood. This aim will address the heightened reward response observed in adolescents compared to adults. By investigating the impact of social feedback in both aversive and appetitive affective domains, our goal is to (a) explore the power of social influence in changing affective responses and (b) uncover the behavioral and neural mechanisms supporting these changes. By closely examining the relationship between social and emotional changes that take place during adolescence with a scientific lens, this proposal will contribute to basic research on adolescent development, and can inform efforts to improve teen-focused mental health practices and public health interventions."
"9334523","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a new proposal to understand the structure, function, regulation and small-molecule stimulation of the nitric oxide receptor, soluble guanylyl/guanylate cyclase (sGC). Nitric oxide (NO) is remarkable in that it is a small, toxic compound, but is produced by most cells to regulate diverse physiology, including blood pressure, wound healing, tissue development and memory formation. Loss of NO signaling leads to cardiovascular disease and is linked to the vascular disorders associated with diabetes, aging and related health failures. Promising new compounds targeting sGC are in clinical trial or in the clinic but how they function or even where they bind in many cases is unknown, making advancement challenging. sGC is a 150 kDa heterodimeric hemoprotein that responds to multiple factors through allosteric regulation, including stimulation by NO and by drug candidates. We have developed human and hawkmoth (Manduca sexta) sGC for addressing mechanism in NO signaling. We seek to understand, at a molecular level, how sGC functions in normal physiology, how it fails in cardiovascular disease and how drug binding can overcome these failures. We propose three specific aims:  Aim 1: Atomic structures of sGC and its functional complexes. A key limitation in the nitric oxide field is the absence of structure for th nitric oxide receptor. We have produced new crystals of truncated heterodimeric sGC in the presence or absence of NO and stimulator compounds. These crystals should allow for atomic structures to be determined for both the active and inactive states, providing key insight into sGC activation and revealing the molecular details for drug binding and drug action.  Aim 2: Mechanism for signal transduction in sGC. Binding of NO or candidate drugs to sGC leads to an ~200 fold increase in catalytic activity, but how signal transduction from the heme domain to the cyclase domain takes place is unknown. We propose to uncover the underlying signal transduction mechanism for sGC activation using UV-visible and luminescence decay spectroscopic measurements, engineered lanthanide binding tags and mutagenesis.  Aim 3: sGC regulation through posttranslational modification. sGC response to NO is regulated in multiple ways, but most importantly through phosphorylation. We propose to discover where sGC is phosphorylated in response to extracellular signals, how phosphorylation inhibits the protein, which signaling pathway is responsible and when it occurs in the cell. The primary technique to be employed is mass spectrometry. We have previously shown that YC-1 family drug candidates can overcome sGC inhibition by phosphorylation. We expect a more complete understanding of cellular sGC regulation will provide much needed drug-discovery opportunities."
"9181321","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Viruses are non-cellular pathogens, which exploit biological processes of their hosts to establish infection leading to the generation of large numbers of progeny. For successful infections, viral genomes must encode gene products to circumvent the host defense mechanisms at an organism and cellular level. Members of the alpha-herpesvirus family, a group of large enveloped dsDNA viruses (e.g.: Pseudorabies Virus, PRV; Herpes Simplex Virus, HSV), specifically infect epithelial and neuronal cells in which they can remain latent for prolonged periods of time. Initial cell entry into the neuron at the distal axon terminal occurs predominantly by fusion and requires high specificity in a sequence of host-pathogen interactions. Following internalization, retrograde transport allows the capsid to move along microtubules (MTs) inside the axon shaft towards the nucleus. Interestingly, engagement of cell surface receptors and the initiation of intracellular signaling cascades allow the virion to prime cytoplasmic conditions for entry and subsequent MT-based transport. At later time points during infection or upon reactivation of a dormant viral genome, a reverse program for egress is started. It includes capsid assembly, axonal sorting, anterograde transport again along axonal MTs, and eventually budding from a distal egress site. Both transport processes inside the axon - retrograde and anterograde - are crucial for infection and spread. Interestingly, both are mediated by molecular motor proteins. Whereas the identity of the motors involved in herpesvirus capsid transport in axons has been established (cytoplasmic dynein and Kif1A, a member of the kinesin-3 family), the actual mechanisms of priming for dynein-mediated transport and of Kif1A recruitment are unknown to date. However, insight into these mechanisms is highly relevant to our understanding of axonal transport processes in general and specifically of herpesviruses as pathogens and potential gene delivery vectors in brain cancer research. The core aims of this proposal are (1) to determine how attachment and entry of herpesviruses into neuronal cells primes the intracellular environment for efficient axonal transport and what cellular factors are involved in the initiation of retrograde motility and (2) t determine how Kif1A and potentially additional motor proteins are specifically recruited to the capsid containing egress vesicle and how blockage of this interaction affects axonal sorting and transport of pathogenic and physiological cargoes. Furthermore, they should shed important new light into the mechanisms underlying herpesvirus pathogenesis, neurological disorders, and motor neuron degeneration."
"9219048","Project Summary  Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is characterized by recurrent disease of the nails, skin, and oral and genital mucosae, caused by the fungus Candida albicans. The pathogenesis of CMC disease (CMCD), a genetic form of CMC, has long remained elusive. Our identification of autosomal recessive (AR) IL-17RA and autosomal dominant (AD) IL-17F deficiencies paved the way for that of AR IL-17RC and ACT1 deficiencies in other patients with isolated CMCD, and of AR ROR-? deficiency and AD STAT1 gain-of-function (GOF) in patients with a broader phenotype of syndromic CMCD. We showed that cells from patients with IL-17RA, IL- 17RC, and ACT1 deficiencies did not respond to IL-17A/F. In addition, IL-17RA- and ACT1-, unlike IL-17RC- deficient cells, did not respond to IL-17E. Moreover, patients with ROR-? deficiency and STAT1 GOF displayed low proportions of IL-17A/F-producing T cells, both ex vivo and after in vitro differentiation. We have reported 85 patients with a genetic etiology of CMCD, out of a total of 188 published cases. We have also enrolled 317 other patients with isolated or syndromic CMCD, from 245 kindreds, originating from 30 countries, whom we hypothesize carry CMCD-causing mutations. We intend to search for mutations in the six known CMCD-causing genes (IL17F, IL17RA, IL17RC, ACT1, RORC, and STAT1), in order to delineate the associated molecular, cellular, immunological, and clinical phenotypes. We also intend to pursue our search for novel CMCD-causing genes using genome-wide (GW) approaches, based on GW linkage (GWL), and whole-exome or whole- genome sequencing (WES/WGS); we will prioritize mutations in genes that control the response to, or the production of, IL-17A/F. This program is built on our pioneering effort in the human genetic dissection of CMCD by cutting-edge genomic and immunological methods, some of which have been developed in the laboratory. We have recently obtained surprising and exciting preliminary results. We found 12, 3, and 121 new patients with IL-17RA, ACT1, and STAT1 mutations, respectively. We also identified three novel genetic etiologies. We discovered AD JNK1 deficiency in three patients from a kindred with syndromic CMCD, whose cells do not respond to IL-17A/F; this is the first inborn error of MAPK-dependent immunity. We also discovered AR c-REL and ZNF341 deficiencies in syndromic CMCD patients from one and two kindreds, respectively, whose cells do not produce IL-17A/F; c-REL is a member of the NF-?B family and ZNF341 is a completely novel protein. These preliminary data neatly illustrate the validity of our approaches, and the potential of our integrated research. Our project is highly innovative, yet supported by strong preliminary evidence. From a basic biological standpoint, this research will provide considerable and novel insights into the mechanisms of mucocutaneous immunity to fungi, including the role of IL-17 cytokines. This work will also shed light on the pathogenesis of CMCD, making it possible to provide molecular diagnoses for patients and genetic counseling for families. This new information will facilitate the use of IL-17 or other cytokines for the treatment of CMC, in addition to antifungal agents."
"9184577","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major public health concern that has led to a worldwide epidemic and is the underlying cause of diabetes, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Excessive visceral and subcutaneous fat is predictive of vascular disease and associated complications, including vascular dysfunction, insulin resistance and decreased levels of the fat burning nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ? (PPAR?). In addition to PPAR? regulating fatty acid metabolism, it has anti-inflammatory properties in vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, most likely through induction of adiponectin. Adiponectin is an adipose- specific hormone with anti-inflammatory and vascular protective properties, and its circulating levels are decreased in obesity. Obesity increases oxidative stress by enhancing reactive oxygen species and simultaneously decreases expression and activity of key cytoprotective systems including heme oxygenase (HO) and bilirubin as well as PPAR?, while increasing inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance. These consequences of obesity-mediated adipocyte dysfunction (decreased PPAR?/adiponectin and increased inflammatory adipokines such as TNF?, IL-1 and IL-6) may lead to vascular dysfunction, which is a prelude to vascular disease and hypertension. Here we provide novel data that bilirubin activates PPAR? activity, which may function as an endogenous ligand agonist. We hypothesize that the three protective factors, bilirubin, PPAR? and adiponectin, are inextricably linked forming a functional module and a deficiency in any of these factors within adipocytes leads to adipocyte and vascular dysfunction that is associated with obesity. We will test this model in vitro and in vivo to show that bilirubin has protective ani-obese and anti- diabetic properties that are mediated by PPAR? that reduces vascular dysfunction."
"9172658","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular imaging with targeted imaging probes can be used to evaluate vascular phenotype in cardiovascular disease. In the past funding period, we developed new tools for assessing endothelial activation and cellular adhesion using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU) molecular imaging in order to detect and quantify high risk atherosclerotic disease. Because CEU molecular imaging can detect events that occur at the endothelial-blood pool interface with high sensitivity and temporal resolution, it is a potentially valuable asset in preclinical research than can be used to discover new disease-related pathways or to rapidly test new candidate therapies. The overall aim of this proposal is to leverage the technologies we have developed in order to better understand the role of platelets throughout the course of atherosclerotic plaque development. Platelet-endothelial interactions have been postulated to play an important early role in promoting atherosclerosis by potentiating the inflammatory response. These interactions have not been well characterized because of lack of appropriate tools for assessing platelet- endothelial interactions in vivo. In Aim 1 CEU molecular imaging of platelet GPIb? and endothelial activation in a murine model of atherosclerosis will be used to temporally characterize platelet-endothelial interaction and endothelial inflammatory activation at different stages of plaque development. Mechanism for platelet adhesion will also be investigated by: (a) imaging the effects of inhibitors to the molecular pathways that may mediate platelet-endothelial or platelet-monocyte complexes, and (b) direct molecular imaging of potential mediators such as dysregulated von Willebrand factor. Since increased oxidative stress is a likely common mediator of endothelial activation and platelet adhesion, in Aim 2, we will determine whether platelet-endothelial interactions at various stages of atherosclerosis are modifiable by potent anti-oxidant therapies (NADPH-oxidase inhibitors, catalase mimetics, or stable transfection with single chain antibodies against oxidized lipoproteins). CEU molecular imaging will be an important biologic readout for these studies. In Aim 3, we will evaluate endothelial-platelet interactions and endothelial inflammatory activation in primates by studying obese, insulin- resistant, and atherosclerotic rhesus macaques. In these studies CEU molecular imaging will be combined with targeted radionuclide imaging of vascular lipid oxidation. Treatment effects of NADPH oxidase inhibitors will again be used to determine the regulatory role of oxidative stress. Successful completion of these studies will provide important new information on atherosclerosis pathophysiology which can be targeted for therapy."
"9235682","PROJECT SUMMARY Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) is a severely debilitating axonopathic peripheral neuropathy, characterized by neuromuscular junction (NMJ) breakdown, axonal transport defects, and neuronal structure malformations. Although animal models for this condition are available, the wide array of gene mutations known to cause a CMT2 phenotype (>30 identified to date) makes the study of common pathway deficits problematic. This in turn makes identification of suitable therapeutic targets, capable of treating a wide range of patients, extremely difficult. The successful generation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neurons from patients with CMT2 makes the establishment of patient-specific humanized assays for studying disease etiology a tangible goal. However, the ability to effectively model CMT2 in vitro using such cells has yet to be achieved, due to the complexity associated with generating robust and functionally mature NMJs in culture. We posit that a culture platform integrating correct tissue-level structural organization, physiologically relevant cell densities, and correct electromechanical conditioning stimuli will promote the development of human myotube-motor neuron co-cultures capable of supporting mature synapse formation. Using our well-established nanopatterned cell sheet manipulation techniques, we will generate scaffold-free 3D tissue structures using hiPSC-derived motor neurons and primary human myoblasts with highly ordered tissue structures. These constructs will be assessed for their ability to promote NMJ formation, and electromechanical conditioning will then be investigated as a means to drive synapse development. This system will be developed in conjunction with motor neurons derived from four CMT2 patients. Co-culture constructs incorporating these cells will be investigated for their capacity to accurately model the disease?s pathophysiology in vitro, and to highlight phenotypic similarities across different mutant lines. Given the prominent role of mitochondria in NMJ development, and the observed breakdown in axonal transport in multiple CMT2-related mutations, we hypothesize that reduced mitochondrial density in presynaptic terminals leads to malformations in NMJ development and ultimately breakdown of the synapse. We will use our CMT2 hiPSC-motor neurons to evaluate axon transport deficits and structural malformations in these cells and correlate these findings with quantified changes in NMJ development within our bioengineered co-culture platform. Finally, we will investigate whether improvement in axon transport properties in multiple CMT2 neuron lines (via stabilization of axonal development with histone deacetylase 6 inhibitors) results in significant improvements in NMJ development and stability in human cells. Consistency of results across different patient mutations will highlight axonal transport deficits as a major causal factor in the development of the human CMT2 phenotype, and validate our platform as a suitable tool for use in the preclinical assessment of new drugs designed to ameliorate peripheral neuropathic conditions."

The long-term research goal of the candidate is to explore the molecular and cellular mechanism involved in morphine induced immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections such as S. pneumonia and HIV/AIDS. The major goal of the current application is to train in HIV/AIDS research as it relates to drug abuse and incorporate this line of research into her ongoing research projects and to introduce state of the art research strategies. To achieve this goal, release time will be utilized for collaborations with HIV/AIDS researchers and researchers with microRNA and TLR expertise. The K05 Award will facilitate this by relieving considerable amount of teaching and administrative duties.

"9171951","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) affects about 5 million Americans and more Medicare dollars are spent for the diagnosis and treatment of HF than for any other diagnosis. Because ATP is absolutely required to fuel normal contractile function, metabolic strategies to treat HF are an appealing investigative treatment strategy. This application focuses on augmenting depressed metabolism in HF by over-expressing the genes for specific isoforms of creatine kinase, the primary myocardial energy reserve reaction. In the failing heart there is reduced CK activity and a decrease in the myofibrillar (CK-M) and mitochondrial (CK-mito) isoforms. CK-M over-expression in murine HF, induced by thoracic aortic constriction (TAC), was recently shown to significantly improve left ventricular systolic function at rest and with stress and to increase survival, suggesting a critical role for CK energy metabolism in failing hearts. Conversely, even more recent studies suggest that depleting creatine, a substrate for the CK reaction, had no adverse effect on contractile function and survival in the myocardial infarction (MI) model of HF, suggesting no pathophysiologic role for creatine or CK in HF. This application aims to resolve this apparent controversy and to shed new, important insights into the role of CK and creatine in HF. The underlying hypothesis is that dysfunctional, viable myocytes benefit from CK over-expression but models with dense necrosis and cell loss do not. The studies will compare different HF models with and without dense necrosis during separate genetic manipulation of CK expression and creatine content. The proposal will exploit recently created cardiac-specific CK-mito over-expressing mice and noninvasive, serial magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging technology to assess the in vivo energetic, contractile, remodeling, and survival consequences in murine HF. The proposed studies aim to answer these timely questions and identify the mechanisms responsible for potential benefit with promise of reducing HF morbidity and mortality."
"9173463","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increased levels of misfolded proteins in the heart are associated with a large subset of congestive heart failure (CHF), the final common pathway for virtually all heart diseases and afflicting the life of millions of Americans. Targeted removal of most cellular proteins is primarily done by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) which degrades a protein via two steps: (1) attachment of a chain of ubiquitin (Ub) to a target protein molecule via a process known as ubiquitination; (2) degradation of the ubiquitinated protein by the proteasome. Cardiac UPS dysfunction is associated with CHF of common causes and a frequently indicated defect is an uncoupling between the two steps, as suggested by the paradoxical co-existence of increased levels of ubiquitinated proteins with elevated or normal proteasomal peptidase activities in diseased myocardium. However, little is known about the molecular basis and pathophysiological significance of the uncoupling. The UBL-UBA family of Ub receptors (Ubiquilin1, Rad23, Ddi1) are purport to recruit ubiquitinated proteins for the proteasome, thereby promoting the coupling. To date, the role of none of these Ub receptors in mammalian hearts is elucidated. Our pilot studies reveal that cardiac Ubqln1 proteins were remarkably increased in human end-stage CHF from ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy and in mouse models of desmin-related cardiomyopathy (DRC), a bona fide cardiomyopathy caused by increased expression of misfolded proteins. Our preliminary data also suggest that Ubqln1 promotes proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins without altering proteasome activities. Hence, we hypothesize that Ubqln1 up-regulation protects against proteotoxicity in cardiomyocytes by enhancing the recruitment of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins to the proteasome for degradation. A unique set of genetically altered mice as well as human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes will be used to interrogate Ubqln1 and proteasome functions in cardiomyocytes to investigate the role of Ubqln1 in the DRC progression, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and post I/R cardiac remodeling in mice and to test the hypothesis that Ubqln1 functions as a shuttling Ub receptor to recruit ubiquitinated misfolded proteins to the proteasome for degradation, thereby protecting against proteotoxicity in cardiomyocytes. The completion of this work is expected to improve our understanding of cardiac protein quality control and provide new molecular targets for developing new strategies to fight cardiac disease with increased proteotoxicity, an increasingly suggested major pathogenic factor of CHF."

Specific training goals to be achieved under the mentorship of David S. Mandell, ScD, an expert in implementation science are to: 1) develop expertise in implementation science and payer incentives in community mental health and broader fields, 2) gain relevant experience in the design, methods, and analyses appropriate for the proposed project and future research in implementation science and community mental health, and 3) establish a network of collaborative and cross-disciplinary relationships to assist in current and future research endeavors. The research component of this F32 will investigate the important question of the payer's role in the implementation of EBP. Despite the critical role payers can play in incentivizing the use of EBP through various strategies, there is remarkably little research examining which incentives are used in public mental health systems. The goal of the proposed study is to examine the extent to which payers for publicly-funded community mental health care use different incentives, how they implement them, and the facilitators and barriers to their use. Specifically, the applicant proposes to build on preliminary results by developing and fielding a national survey of county and state-level payers to: 1) systematically identify, document, and describe incentives employed by payers in the public mental health system to increase the use of evidence- based practices among community mental health providers and 2) examine potential barriers and facilitators to the implementation of incentives proposed in the literature. The applicant will also use qualitative methods and conduct semi-structured interviews with payers, stratified by the extent to which they implement different incentives to increase use of EBP, to determine barriers and facilitators to the use of different strategies. Over the course of this project the applicant will develop expertise in the role of governmental entities and payers in the implementation and sustainment of EBP, and will gain critical knowledge and skills in implementation science, payer and incentive financing, and survey design and development with the expertise of an experienced and established team of mentors."
"9379899","ABSTRACT  Primary autonomic failure is a group of rare neurodegenerative disorders that primarily affect the autonomic nervous system. These patients develop neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) because of impaired autonomic reflexes that control cardiovascular and neuro-humoral adaptation to upright posture. The treatment of neurogenic OH is challenging; the therapeutic options are scarce, and some patients are refractory to treatment. Our preliminary results showed that 36% of patients with primary autonomic failure did not improve OH-related symptoms and upright blood pressure with midodrine, the current standard of care. The use of midodrine is limited in some patients by the development of side effects such as pilomotor reactions, pruritus of the scalp, urinary retention, and supine hypertension. Other available therapies include the recent FDA approved drug, droxidopa, a synthetic norepinephrine precursor; however, the long-term efficacy and safety of this medication is still unknown. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify new pharmacotherapies for the treatment of neurogenic OH in primary autonomic failure.  Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine transporter inhibitor that increases the availability of norepinephrine in the synapse by blocking its reuptake. This medication is currently approved for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the United States, and seven million people with ADHD chronically use atomoxetine or similar drugs. Our preliminary data in sixty-five patients with primary autonomic failure and neurogenic OH showed that atomoxetine was more effective than midodrine in improving standing SBP (+7.5 mm Hg). Notably, only atomoxetine and not midodrine induced a significant reduction in OH-related symptoms (lightheadedness and dizziness) compared with placebo.  The response to an acute administration of a pressor agent does not predict long-term efficacy of the drug. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that prolonged administration of the norepinephrine transporter blocker, atomoxetine, improves OH-related symptoms and OH-impact on daily activities compared with placebo in primary autonomic failure. We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, crossover study."
"9227158","PROJECT SUMMARY Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections are a growing problem in the United States with over 18,000 deaths reported annually. There is no vaccine and as S. aureus becomes more drug resistant the number of treatment options is diminishing. New strategies and approaches are urgently needed to combat the rise in S. aureus infections. The ability of S. aureus to cause disease is due, in part, to an extensive repertoire of secreted and cell wall associated proteins. These virulence factors include adhesins, toxins, exoenzymes, and superantigens. Typically these virulence factors are made inside the bacterial cell and are transported across the cell membrane in a denatured state. Once outside the cell they refold into their active form. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases) are enzymes that assist in the folding of proteins. They catalyze the isomerization between the cis and trans form of proline peptide bonds, thus accelerating the rate of refolding in proteins containing prolines. The absence of PPIase activity can lead to delayed/incorrect folding and a loss of protein activity. In bacteria PPIases have been shown to assist in the folding of secreted virulence factors and in doing so contribute to virulence, however their role in S. aureus remains unknown. Previous work on Staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), a secreted virulence factor, has demonstrated that the isomerization state of a single proline bond (K116-P117) controls the rate of Nuc refolding. The addition of a PPIase can accelerate refolding, however the identity of the Staphylococcal PPIase involved is unknown. In this proposal we identify a Staphylococcal PPIase (PrsB) that is required for Nuc activity. We demonstrate that equal amounts of Nuc are secreted in a prsB mutant and wild-type strain, however the secreted Nuc is less active when secreted from the prsB mutant. Consequently, we hypothesize that PrsB is assisting Nuc folding and in doing so contributes to S. aureus pathogenesis via its PPIase activity. In aim 1 of this proposal we will test this hypothesis by first determining the amino acid residues important for PrsB PPIase activity. Using this information we will construct a PrsB PPIase-inactive strain (prsB?PPIase) by introducing amino acid substitutions that disrupt PPIase activity onto the S. aureus chromosome. The resulting strain will be used in an abscess model of infection to determine the specific contribution of PrsB PPIase activity to virulence. In aim 2 we will investigate direct protein targets of PrsB. We will perform in vitro Nuc refolding assays to determine the direct contribution of PrsB to Nuc refolding, and identify S. aureus proteins that directly interact with and are co-purified with PrsB by immunoprecipitation. We hypothesize that the co-purified proteins represent additional PrsB targets and may be responsible for a decrease in cytotoxicity observed in the culture supernatants of the prsB mutant. The data generated from this proposal will serve as the foundation for future studies to explore the molecular mechanism through which PrsB affects the virulence of S. aureus and identify potential PrsB inhibitors, which may represent a novel anti-virulence therapy to combat S. aureus infection."
"9274775","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A multitude of macromolecular protein interactions must properly occur on chromatin to drive functional aspects of chromosome biology like gene transcription, DNA replication, recombination, repair and sister chromatid segregation. Analyzing how proteins interact in vivo with chromatin to direct these activities remains a significant challenge due to the temporal and dynamic nature of their associations. We have recently developed a technique termed Chromatin Affinity Purification with Mass Spectrometry (ChAP-MS) that provides for the enrichment of a native 1 kb section of a chromosome for site-specific identification of protein interactions and associated histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs). In this grant application, we plan to use this cutting-edge approach to define the histone PTMs and proteins regulating transcription at the arsenic response locus in budding yeast. We hypothesize that ChAP-MS will provide for a comprehensive and unbiased identification of all histone modifications and proteins regulating transcription at the arsenic locus in S. cerevisiae. We will pursue the following Aim to test this hypothesis: Use ChAP-MS to define the histone PTMs and proteins regulating transcription at the arsenic response locus in S. cerevisiae."
"9172995","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has emerged as one of the most critical health care problems in the US as 69% of the US population is currently overweight or obese. Adipose tissue dysfunction is an essential hallmark linking obesity to the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic disease, and prior work form our group has demonstrated that qualitative properties of adipose tissue shape systemic phenotypes. In particular, impaired adipose tissue angiogenesis in obesity has been associated with inflammation and metabolic dysfunction; however pathogenic mechanisms are incompletely understood. We describe a novel endogenous isoform of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), VEGF-A165b that is selectively over-expressed in obesity and inhibits angiogenesis. Our preliminary data suggest that perturbations in the Wnt5a signaling system up-regulates VEGF-A165b under conditions of obesity that is modified by bariatric surgical weight loss. In aim 1, we will examine adipose depot-specific microvascular angiogenic responses in biopsied fat samples from 150 obese and 50 lean subjects. We will characterize VEGF-A isoforms in relation to angiogenic capacity and vascularization. We hypothesize that inhibitory isoform VEGF-A165b will be up- regulated in obesity, associated with anti-angiogenic actions in fat, and relate to whole body metabolic dysfunction. In aim 2, specific inhibitors of Wnt signaling will be employed using human adipose tissue samples secured from aim 1 to provide a molecular framework for understanding the regulation of VEGF-A 165b expression. In aim 3, we will re-examine adipose angiogenic capacity and VEGF isoform expression at 6 months following bariatric surgery in the same 150 obese subjects from aim 1. We will test whether relevant molecular pathways specifically identified in aim 2 are influenced by weight reduction. We seek to identify novel determinants of adipose tissue biology and angiogenesis in relation to metabolic changes which will develop in association with marked weight loss in obese individuals. Our proposal may identify the Wnt5a-VEGF-A 165b axis as a novel modulator of angiogenesis, adipose tissue biology, and consequently, systemic disease in clinical obesity and potentially lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets."
"9189968","Project Summary The epicardium covers the heart as a single epithelial layer, which provides extracellular matrix support and an active stem and progenitor cell pool. Epicardial embryonic development involves the dynamic motility and differentiation of epicardial derived progenitor cells (EPDCs), which facilitate the development of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells and fibroblasts in the heart. Migration and lineage specification of EPDCs is regulated by myocardin related transcription factors, also known as MRTF-A and MRTF-B, to promote myofibroblast formation and pericytic functions. More recently, our laboratory has published that MRTF-A and B deletion from the epicardial cell population with a WT1-driven Cre (called MRTFeDKO) impairs migration of EPDCs resulting in severe vascular deficiencies. Studies from our laboratory and others provide evidence that epicardial cell activation is critical for proper embryonic heart growth and maintenance. However, the contribution of EPDCs during adult cardiac remodeling remains unexplored. Cardiac repair after adult MI is greatly limited due to the inability of cardiomyocytes to divide and modest contribution of endogenous cardiac progenitor cells stemming from the epicardium. In order to investigate EPDC function during an adult setting of MI, acute myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in MRTFeDKO mice. Surprisingly, MRTFeDKO mice displayed a profound cardioprotective phenotype characterized by increased cardiac function and reduced fibrotic scarring compared to wildtype controls. We surmised that this phenotype was most likely due to alterations in the balance of EPDC maintenance and differentiation in MRTFeDKO mice. In this proposal, we will test if MRTF deletion in the epicardium counteracts negative remodeling of the heart by influencing subepicardial progenitor mobilization and cardiomyocyte function following MI. In order to identify novel underlying mechanisms that contribute to EPDC activity during cardiac regeneration following deletion of MRTFs, we performed a genome wide RNA-sequencing screen. Results of the RNA-sequencing revealed that neuronal guidance genes are highly enriched in EPDCs. Interestingly, neuronal guidance genes were inversely expressed in EPDCs lacking MRTFs. Axonal guidance genes are critical for neovascularization and proper heart contractility, however, there are currently no reports describing influence of cardiac innervation on EPDC function. Overall, accomplishing the stated aims of this proposal will yield a comprehensive characterization of EPDCs as it relates to MRTF signaling and axonal guidance cues. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the role of MRTFs in post MI remodeling, 2) Determine the cellular mechanisms contributing to cardioprotection in MRTFeDKO and 3) Define the function of a novel epicardium-based axon guidance center in cardiac repair. These studies will describe the ability to harness a novel epicardium-based axon guidance-signaling center to improve cardiac repair and regeneration after injury."
"9239211","Seminal studies in mouse models and emerging data in NHP and patient populations have consistently implicated memory T cells as being a formidable barrier to long-term, rejection-free allograft survival, particularly in the setting of costimulation blockade. As such, work in our laboratory over the past several years has focused on identifying new pathways that control memory T cell responses during transplantation. Fc?RIIB, the only inhibitory Fc receptor, inhibits intracellular signaling via the ITIM motif located in its cytoplasmic region. Fc?RIIB is known to be expressed by many immune cell types, including B cells, DCs, macrophages and granulocytes; however, the general consensus for the past few decades has been that T cells do not express this molecule. Work done in the last cycle of the grant published by our lab indicated that Fc?RIIB-/- mice exhibit increased costimulation blockade-resistant rejection relative to WT controls. This increased rejection was not the result of increased antibody secretion, as no differences in anti-donor antibodies were detected in these animals. Instead, we discovered that Fc?RIIB is expressed on a subset of memory CD8+ T cells generated via both transplantation and virally-elicited heterologous immunity, and that blockade of this novel coinhibitory pathway results in enhanced donor-reactive memory CD8+ T cell responses. Our data thus suggest a previously unidentified functional role for Fc?RIIB coinhibitory signaling in regulating CD8+ memory T cells during transplantation. However, the mechanisms underlying this observation, including the identity of the Fc?RIIB ligand in this system (i.e. endogenous antibody vs. Fc-containing biologic), remain unknown. Compellingly, our new preliminary data reveal that the degree of expression of Fc?RIIB on donor- reactive CD8+ memory T cell populations directly correlated with susceptibility of those cells to costimulation blockade, providing further evidence for a T cell-intrinsic role for Fc?RIIB coinhibitory signaling in transplantation. Overall, these data suggest a novel mechanism by which the production of alloantibody may function as a negative feedback loop to prevent alloreactive CD8+ T cell activation, and raise the possibility of an innovative new approach to controlling donor-reactive CD8+ memory T cells during transplantation. Thus, in this proposal we aim to further interrogate the mechanisms by which Fc?RIIB inhibitory signaling regulates donor-reactive memory CD8+ T cell responses in transplantation by determining the T cell intrinsic role of Fc?RIIB signaling, identifying the Fc?RIIB ligand in this system (endogenous antibody/immune complexes vs. Fc-containing biologics), and interrogating the epigenetic and transcription-factor mediated control of Fc?RIIB expression on donor-reactive CD8+ memory T cells during transplantation."
"9385541","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of disorders that includes obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, non- alcoholic fatty liver disease and insulin resistance, all of which predispose to the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Epidemiological and clinical data indicate that increased sugar, and particularly fructose, ingestion is a major contributor to the development of the metabolic syndrome and progression to diabetes. The mechanisms by which fructose consumption causes metabolic dysfunction remain elusive. Carbohydrate Responsive-Element Binding Protein (ChREBP) is a master transcriptional regulator of glycolytic and lipogenic gene programs which is activated by products of carbohydrate metabolism. SNPs in the ChREBP locus identified in genome-wide association studies predict features of the metabolic syndrome in human populations. We recently discovered a novel, potent constitutively active isoform of ChREBP, ChREBP-beta. In vivo, ChREBP-beta expression is acutely and robustly increased by fructose ingestion, but only modestly by glucose ingestion. Mice with whole-body genetic deletion of ChREBP die within several days of high-fructose feeding. In this proposal, we will pursue an integrative physiological approach to determine the role of ChREBP in fructose-induced metabolic disturbances. We hypothesize that ChREBP, and particularly ChREBP-beta, is a key regulatory element that is required for the normal adaptive metabolic response to fructose ingestion and also contributes to the development of metabolic disease and diabetes when sugar is consumed in excess. Using a combination of genetic and dietary interventions in mouse models, we will evaluate the role of ChREBP in integrated fuel homeostasis by pursuing the following three aims. In Aim 1, using tissue-specific, loss-of-function mouse models, we will explore the physiologic and cellular mechanisms by which the absence of ChREBP impairs integrated fuel homeostasis and causes fructose intolerance. In Aim 2, using a ChREBP gain-of-function mouse model combined with diets of different carbohydrate content and composition, we will explore a novel concept that the effects of ChREBP activity on integrated fuel homeostasis and insulin sensitivity depend on the nutritional context. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel, ChREBP-beta isoform specific conditional loss-of-function mouse model to begin to determine the physiological significance of the distinct ChREBP isoforms in relation to integrated fuel metabolism and fructose induced metabolic disease. We anticipate that these studies will provide fundamental insight into mechanisms of fructose-induced metabolic disease and lay the groundwork for novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity and diabetes."

The purpose of this project is to increase surveillance for antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria from retail meat samples. The BOL Food Microbiology Laboratory has maintained the capacity to test for foodborne pathogens and food quality indicator organisms for over 35 years. During this cooperative agreement the Food Microbiology Laboratory will increase laboratory capacity by implementing the NARMS retail meat surveillance protocols. Bacteria isolated from retail meat samples will be characterized where appropriate by serology and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Results will be shared with the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and DHEC Foodborne Epidemiologists and will be used to drive identification of foodborne disease outbreaks. Isolates identified will submitted to FDA-CVM for antibiotic sensitivities. Antibiotic resistance data collected as a result of the surveillance sampling activities will be analyzed and monitored for trends which will be disseminated to state epidemiologists, when appropriate state sentinel hospitals, and shared with the public through DHEC?s external website. These activities will strengthen national efforts to monitor antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacteria isolated from retail meats and provide data to drive public health policy and program development."
"9148260","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure and congenital heart defects threaten the lives of several thousand children each year. The only FDA-approved long term pediatric heart support device is the Berlin Heart Excor, which is based on 30+ year old technology and is fraught with complications including blood clots forming in the device requiring frequent device replacement. The recipients of this technology are at high risk for strokes, bleeding, and infection and the pumps are driven by a large 220 lb. console, which limits patient mobility and prevents hospital discharge. In spite of these severe limitations, 90% of Excor recipients survive to transplant, although the median duration of support is only 35 days. A safer device would dramatically reduce the complications of support, permit discharge to home, and allow doctors to deploy the technology earlier, before a child reaches the brink of death. VADovations is developing a miniature implantable pump platform, the Revolution, in which minor modifications of 2 components can be implemented to adjust the pump performance to support the right or left side of the heart. The devices are 8 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length, about the size of a 'AAA' battery, compared to the market leading Heartmate II, which is 47 mm in maximum diameter and 95 mm in length, the size of a 'D' cell battery. Our adult Revolution RVAD can safely generate the lower blood rates needed for a pediatric left heart assist device and has demonstrated exceptionally low blood trauma in bench-top studies and during implants in sheep for durations up to one month with no long-term blood thinners. Building upon these promising results, we propose a Fast Track, combined Phase I/II SBIR to re-purpose the Revolution RVAD as a pediatric left heart assist device, the Revolution MINI, for children ages 1 and up. Then we will revise the design to create the Revolution NEO for neonates and infants, aged 0-1, who represent the largest clinical need for pediatric heart support. During Phase I, we will demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the MINI for pediatric blood flow rates and pressures during in vitro and short term animal experiments. In Phase II, we will conduct chronic animal implants to evaluate the long-term function, biocompatibility, and durability of the pumps and perform verification and validation studies of the Revolution MINI system to prepare for a US clinical trial. Throughout the program, we will focus considerable efforts on anatomic fit modeling and studies to devise approaches so that these devices can be implanted in the smaller bodies of children, to avoid pumps protruding from the body, as occurs with the paracorporeal Excor. Superior hemocompatibility, smaller size, and the ability to leverage adult system components, combine to produce pediatric heart assist devices that will offer fewer complications, permit patient discharge to home, and be economically viable to revolutionize the treatment of pediatric heart failure."
"9181436","PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past two decades, the development of new immunosuppressive agents has greatly improved early post-transplant survival. Nevertheless, long-term survival has not improved significantly, due to chronic rejection, infections, and malignancies - all attributable to chronic immunosuppression. In lung transplantation, chronic allograft rejection, as manifested by obliterative bronchiolitis, fibrosis, and/or vasculopathy, represents the principal cause of graft loss and patient demise after the first year following transplantation. It is now well established that both antigen-dependent and antigen-independent factors contribute to both acute and chronic rejection in a synergistic manner. We have long held the position that the establishment of transplant tolerance is the paradigm shift that will transform the field of transplantation by obviating the need for long term systemic immunosuppression with its attendant complications (malignancy, toxicity, and infection), while simultaneously preventing both acute and potentially chronic rejection. Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in non-human primates (NHPs) and in humans using a strategy that induces hematopoietic mixed chimerism. We have modified and extended this approach to lung transplantation in NHPs by adding the interleukin (IL)-6 signal blocker tocilizumab (anti-IL6R mAb) to our delayed, non-myeloablative conditioning regimen. This has allowed us to achieve long-term lung allograft tolerance without chronic rejection in NHPs for the first time, albeit only in one-MHC haplotype mismatched donor/recipient pairs. Attempts to cross more stringent histocompatibility barriers have led to acute and/or chronic rejection. From a mechanistic point of view, it appears that the tolerance obtained in NHPs is not simply deletional tolerance, as seen in most murine chimeric models, but is highly dependent on 1) enhancing regulatory responses and 2) dampening pro- inflammatory states. We therefore hypothesize that to successfully induce tolerance of fully MHC-mismatched lung allografts without the development of chronic rejection we must develop protocols which further enhance immune regulation and which prevent antigen-independent inflammation. This hypothesis will be tested in Aim 1. Our overall goal is to generate a tolerance protocol that can be applied to human lung allograft recipients. Thus, once the optimal tolerance induction protocol is identified in Aim 1, attempts will be made to substitute the investigational components of the protocol with FDA-approved agents making it suitable for clinical use in Aim 2. Finally, it is clear that chronic rejection is refractory to current therapies, including in some circumstances, tolerance induction. Therefore, in Aim 3 we will perform integrated mechanistic studies of the pathogenesis of chronic rejection and use the results to design modifications of the optimal protocol achieved in Aim 2 in order to prevent this complication."
"9173051","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on the mechanisms and electrophysiological consequences of the molecular interactions between the inward rectifier potassium channel protein Kir2.1 and the ?ubunit of the major cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5. Our preliminary results strongly suggest that NaV1.5 and Kir2.1 modulate each other's surface expression and function through their respective PDZ binding domains within a macromolecular complex to control cardiac excitability. Such a dynamic reciprocity is post-translational, involving, at least in part, mutual regulation of trafficking and targeting of both channel proteins at common membrane compartments, as well as internalization. We focus on inheritable mutations that are known to disrupt trafficking of NaV1.5 (Brugada Syndrome, BS) or Kir2.1 (Andersen-Tawil Syndrome, ATS). We surmise that a mutation that disrupts the expression of one channel protein type (e.g., NaV1.5) will also affect the other type (e.g., Kir2.1 by disturbing the common macromolecular complex through which they interact, thus contributing to both the electrophysiological phenotype and arrhythmogenic potential. We will test the following three major hypotheses: 1) NaV1.5 and Kir2.1 protein channels undergo PDZ-domain mediated interactions with common partners in a macromolecular complex that controls their membrane stability; 2) macromolecular complex formation affects anterograde and/or retrograde trafficking of Kir2.1 and NaV1.5; and 3) human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CMs) expressing either ATS or BS mutations that affect protein trafficking will show reduced excitability reflecting altered expression of both channel proteins, which should contribute strongly to the inherited arrhythmia phenotype. We propose to combine proteomics (e.g., protein purification, yeast two-hybrid assay and interaction domain mapping) and genetic (e.g., mutagenesis and silencing) tools, confocal microscopy, live cell imaging, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, patch clamping, optical mapping, gene transfer and silencing in heterologous systems, and in single, highly mature ventricular-like hiPSC-CMs and hiPSC-CM monolayers. We will also conduct computer simulations to enable the virtual dissection and interpretation of the electrophysiological and arrhythmogenic changes resulting from NaV1.5-Kir2.1 interactions and their mutants in a macromolecular complex."
"9258294","Abstract Thermoregulation is the ability of homeothermic animals to maintain a steady core body temperature by rapidly responding to changes in the environment. Despite its fundamental nature, our understanding of the neural circuitry underlying thermoregulation is limited. The lack of effective treatments for many disorders of thermoregulation, from hot flushes to various drug- induced hyper- and hypothermias, reflects a lack of knowledge about how and where temperature signals from the environment are converted into compensatory responses. Perhaps the most common disorder of thermoregulation is the development of hot flushes, or periodic and often overwhelming sensations of heat, sweating, and flushing affecting millions of individuals, primarily but not exclusively menopausal women. Here I propose experiments designed to dissect thermoregulatory circuits in the mouse brain while simultaneously testing a proposed model of hot flush generation.  The exact mechanism of hot flush generation is currently unknown, though it is associated with a drop in estrogen levels. A leading hypothesis implicates a population of neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) co-expressing Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B, and Dynorphin (KNDy) that become hypertrophic in response to estrogen withdrawal and that are thought to project to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA). The POA is well established as the thermoregulatory center of the brain, but the molecular identity of POA neurons underlying temperature regulation is largely unknown. This research proposal has three aims designed to elucidate the molecular identity of neurons comprising a thermoregulatory circuit in mice. Identification of cell-specific neural substrates for thermoregulation will hopefully uncover targets (e.g., receptors) that help to foster the development of novel therapeutics for conditions of dysfunctional thermoregulation and to further our understanding of exactly how temperature signals are converted into compensatory responses. Such knowledge has broad implications not only in thermoregulatory disorders, but also in disorders of general energy balance including those associated with diet."
"9178670","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atrial stretch, caused by pressure and volume overload, contributes to development of atrial fibrosis, in patients with ventricular dysfunction such as mitral regurgitation or congestive heart failure. Atrial structural remodeling-including fibrosis- is a major component in development and progression of atrial fibrillation (AF). Prophylactic treatments which reduce stretch-mediated atrial remodeling exist, and would benefit patients, but the appropriate selection of patients is unclear, because atrial structural remodeling is difficult to assess clinically. This work introduces a new approach, which relies on several innovative ideas in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). We propose to increase the robustness and reliability of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) using a sequential acquisition order, with acceptable fat-suppression, and a REPAIR pulse, designed to reduce artifacts in 1RR LGE acquisitions, in the presence of arrhythmias or RR variability. Further, we propose to quantify atrial collagen fraction, by suitably adapting T1 mapping methods to this high resolution application, with dark blood preparation. Extracellular volume fraction (ECV), based on T1 mapping, will be a more precise measure of the presence of collagen. Inflammation will be investigated using a fluid and fat-suppressed T2-mapping method. We will also evaluate 3D atrial strain. This atrial strain measurement would be extraordinarily challenging with conventional tagging methods, because of the thin walls of the atrium. However, we will develop 3D cine atrial imaging which can be processed, based on the expertise of our collaborators, with shape tracking to estimate atrial strain. We will then study these methods in an animal model of mitral regurgitation, and in patients with mitral disease. We will validate our in-vivo LGE and ECV measurements vs. histology in animals, and in the explanted hearts of heart-transplant recipients. Mitral regurgitation is a major risk factor for boh AF and atrial fibrosis development. We will test the major hypothesis that abnormal atrial stretch (low or high) -measured via strain measurements-generates inflammation and, at later time-points, atrial fibrosis. The project carries a health benefit to a broad spectrum of patients, by potentially permitting early treatment with anti-fibrotic medications or interventions in appropriae patients at risk for atrial-fibrosis related AF."
"9381077","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metals are in widespread use to inhibit the growth of microbial populations. In particular, silver is commonly used in hospital settings as an effective broad spectrum biocide that has low toxicity to humans. However, protein systems are in place which enhance survival of microbes under conditions of high metal concentrations and reduce the efficacy of metals as broad spectrum biocides. One of these systems, the Cus system of E. coli, is responsible for sensing and responding to elevated levels of silver(I) and copper(I) in th environment. Despite its public health importance, the mechanisms of copper and silver handling by the Cus system are not well understood. We propose that mechanistic understandings of copper and silver handling will provide a target for future development of drugs and aid in understanding the limitations of metal-based biocides. In our previous work, we have focused on using the Cus system as a model system for a large class of microbial metal resistance systems. We have biochemically and structurally characterized two of the components, CusF and CusB, of the membrane spanning metal efflux system (CusCFBA) that actively removes metals from the cell. Additionally we have developed a novel and powerful technique to monitor metal transfer between proteins. The natural development of this previous work is to integrate these findings with the other proteins in the system. In aim 1 we will investigate the mechanism of metal transport by the Cus system and test the hypothesis that the Cus system is primarily important for detoxification of the periplasm, through metal transfer from the Cus periplasmic proteins (CusB and CusF) to the membrane-bound Cus proteins (CusA and CusC). In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CusS is activated by metal binding to the periplasmic domain, leading to conformational changes that ultimately result in activation of Cu(I)/Ag(I) resistance systems.. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have a detailed understanding of the microbial counterattack to metal contaminated environments. We will have determined how a specific metal is discriminated from other metals by a sensory and response system, the mechanisms of the transport process, and the further detoxification strategy after transport has occurred. These studies will give us the tools to understand the microbial response to metal biocides and provide strategies for their effective use in controlling bacterial infections in human populations."
"9173038","CORE C: Abstract  The need for physiological assessments was generated by UC-TRaN faculty who required  electrophysiological studies beyond collaborations. These electrophysiological assessments  consisted of experiments performed in brain slices, acutely isolated neurons or in cultures,  providing a functional analysis of changes in neurons, local circuits and microcircuits induced  primarily by genetic alterations in cellular, mouse or rat models. The first objective of Core C will  be to continue these analyses because the need remains and the Core will assist investigators  with functional analysis at the cellular, circuit, and systems level using state-of-the-art  electrophysiology and optogenetic recording methods in in vitro and in vivo preparations.  Recent advances in both genomic and stem cell technologies, particularly hESC and hiPSC,  have opened the door to new approaches in IDD research based on human cells. For example,  cortical neurons harboring genetic mutations with a given disorder can in principle be readily  produced from hiPSC generated from patients. A significant challenge remains to translate this  promise into new discoveries about the basis of IDD and therapies. The second objective of this  Core will be to facilitate this process by assisting UC-TRaN investigators to produce, propagate,  and differentiate hESC and hiPSC into neural and glial cell types of interest to create in vitro  models of IDD. Another function of the Core is to work with investigators and molecular  screening resources available at UCLA to harness the potential of these in vitro models for drug  discovery."

Understanding the mechanisms underlying rejection and tolerance of heart and lung transplants in the primate experiments described in Projects 1 and 2 will not only help us achieve tolerance but will help us recognize when it is present or absent. The following methodologies will be utilized:  1. Determine the role of MHC disparities on alloresponses by MHC genotyping of donor and recipient monkeys;  2. Investigate the contributions of direct and indirect T cell alloresponses and autoimmune responses to  acute/chronic graft rejection;  3. Monitor the frequency, phenotype, antigen specificity, and functions of donor-specific memory T cells  present in blood and lymphoid organs of monkeys tested pre- and post-transplantation;  4. Monitor the frequency, phenotype, antigen specificity, and mechanisms of action of regulatory T cells  and expand these cells in vitro for adoptive transfers experiments;  5. Analyze B cell subsets and antibodies as well as their functional properties;  6. Monitor pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in sera. The knowledge acquired from these experiments will be used to optimize mixed chimerism protocols designed to achieve tolerance of heart and lungs allografts and to assist in the successful translation of those tolerance protocols to the clinic."

"9181433","PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this core is to provide essential common facilities and expertise for the immunopathological studies in all 3 projects. The primary role is to document and characterize:  1) The status of the heart, lung, kidney and skin allografts (nature of infiltrate, presence of acute or chronic  rejection, including a humoral component and the quantitation of lesions.  2) Systemic effects of the protocols (toxicity, complications, BK viral infection, PTLD)  3) Intragraft markers that predict acceptance vs. rejection  4) Mechanisms by which intragraft cells may promote rejection or acceptance The pathology studies in Core A are essential to evaluate the status of the allografts, particularly the in situ events in the heart, lung and kidney grafts. The studies are critical to determine the nature and location of the cells infiltrating the graft, the role of antibodies in rejection and systemic toxicity of treatment. The techniques that will be utilized include routine histology, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Immunoperoxidase techniques with a panel of mAbs will distinguish the infiltrating cell types (Teff, Treg, Breg, et al), adhesion and cytokine molecules and receptors, complement deposition (C4d), and endothelial activation markers (e.g., pERK). Analysis will be enhanced by whole slide digital scans and morphometry. The pathology results will be correlated with functional and molecular studies done in the projects. In addition, complete necropsies will be done on all animals, with samples from all major organs analyzed by routine and special techniques as indicated."
"9173030","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks funding for the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC) at the U of PA (Penn) and the Children's Hosp of Philadelphia (CHOP). Our IDDRC, now in its 25th year, is an inter- disciplinary program that is the chief agency at CHOP/Penn for the promulgation of research into the developmental disabilities. In the next cycle we build upon this foundation by proposing an innovative Center with 6 components: (1) A research project which uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) to develop a novel biomarker - an electronic signature - for non-verbal and minimally verbal children with autistic spectrum disorders; (2) A series of 6 research core facilities which will provide investigators with state-of-the-art facilities and expertise, including 2 new cores (Preclinical Models and Clinical Translational); (3) An educational program which will nurture a feeling of IDD Community by featuring monthly seminars, including the IDDRC Research Lecture, the Monthly Chalk Talks and the Autism Distinguished Lecture Series; (4) A career development initiative which will benefit dozens of exceptional young investigators who will receive support from the IDDRC New Program Development award (to be funded by the Philadelphia Foundation), the IDDRC-administered T32 Training Grant in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities and several private awards (aggregate value ~ $3 million over 5 years) given by local philanthropies to the IDDRC; (5) A research advocacy mission which involves an IDDRC- CHOP/Penn collaboration to create Centers of Excellence that encourage inter-disciplinary translational research into IDD; and (6) Participation in the larger IDDRC Network in order to realize the scientific and organizational goals of the IDD Branch of NICHD. The Center will support 78 federally-funded projects ($23.3 million/yr), of which 15 are from NICHD ($5.8 million/yr). The theme of our IDDRC is Genes, Brain, Behavior, a designation which reflects our ongoing effort to understand IDD in 3 inter-related domains: (a) The genetic anlage which causes a disability or modulates disease severity; (b) The anomalies of brain biochemistry and neurophysiology which accompany genetic changes; and (c) The phenomenological manifestations of these genetic/neurophysiologic alterations which we recognize as clinical manifestations of the IDD. Our rationale for this reductionist approach is that the dissection of  a disability into isolated and simpler components affords a strategy with which to develop therapies that will prevent, attenuate or even reverse the devastating consequences of the disorder. Over the coming 5 years the Center will pursue this aim by deploying these tools: cutting-edge research cores, a focus on translational research, the enormous clinical resources of CHOP/Penn, nurturing a cadre of future leaders, and a strong emphasis on creative partnership with the IDDRC Network."
"9176033","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The demand for donor hearts for transplantation far outstrips the supply; however, only one in three available cardiac grafts are used for transplantation. There are many reasons for graft non-use, but previous studies have failed to demonstrate consistent associations between donor characteristics, donor cardiac function, and adverse recipient outcomes. Thus, there is a critical need to standardize how cardiac allografts are evaluated and accepted for transplantation. Our long-term goal is to safely expand the use of available cardiac allografts without adversely affecting transplant recipient outcomes. We propose to carefully characterize the current population of cardiac organ donors, particularly with regards to allograft function; to examine how decisions are made regarding graft acceptance for transplantation; and to systematically evaluate associations between donor characteristics and recipient outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that acceptable allografts for heart transplantation are being unnecessarily discarded, and the establishment of an evidence-based process for cardiac donor evaluation and acceptance will increase graft utilization rates while maintaining excellent clinical outcomes. In response to this need, we propose a collaborative study with seven organ procurement organizations representing geographically diverse regions of the United States, to address the following specific aims: (1) To identify clinical correlates of graft function in potential donors being evaluated for heart transplantation An existing online donor research database will be expanded for standardized collection of data on detailed donor characteristics, especially as pertains to cardiac allograft function. We will perform expert core review of donor echocardiograms, including serial echocardiograms in donors with cardiac allograft dysfunction. Serial electrocardiograms and cardiac biomarkers (Troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide) will also be studied; (2) To prospectively study reasons for cardiac allograft non-utilization for heart transplantation. Real-time data will be collected on specific reasons for allograft non-acceptance for transplantation in order to study graft acceptance practices and variation in graft utilization nationwide; and (3) To prospectively study associations between donor characteristics and recipient outcomes after heart transplantation. Data will be collected on recipient post-transplant length of hospitalization and survival to identify associations between donor predictors and recipient outcomes. This proposal is innovative because it focuses on an entirely different approach to donor-based research, thereby surmounting the limitations of prior investigations. Completion of the proposed study will have a positive impact by defining how to optimize the evaluation and use of available grafts for heart transplantation, thereby safely expanding the donor pool and increasing the number of heart transplants performed nationwide."
"9246000","Grant title: Type III exported effectors of Chlamydia trachomatis Abstract: The human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis is a significant concern in the United States due to its prevalence and the combined health and socioeconomic impact of acute and chronic disease. Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that possess the ability to modulate host-cell functions while sequestered within a membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuole. Although it is established that a type III secretion system (T3SS) represents one mechanism employed to modulate critical host cell pathways, the overall understanding of this process in Chlamydia remains limited. During the past funding cycle, we made significant progress in understanding the role of T3S effectors designated CT694 and CT695. Importantly, we also leveraged novel genetic manipulation techniques to investigate the impact of T3S in chlamydial pathogenesis. Perhaps our most important contribution was the development of a fluorescence-reported allelic exchange mutagenesis (FRAEM) approach to allow, for the first time, deletion of targeted chlamydial genes. We have used this technique to create null mutants for ct694 and ct695, and these strains are attenuated in both tissue-culture and animal-infection models. We propose to elucidate molecular details by which mutant phenotypes are manifested. A balanced combination of genetic, biochemical, cell-biology, and animal-based studies are proposed that will define developmental defects, identify host targets important for effector function(s), and gauge the overall role of effectors and target proteins in promoting Chlamydia pathogenesis. Completion of this work will extend the efficacy of genetically manipulating a challenging pathogen and lead to an enhanced understanding of Chlamydia-mediated disease."
"9172657","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein kinase C-delta (PKCd) is a signal-regulated enzyme that plays pleotropic roles in the control of cardiac contraction, ventricular remodeling, ischemia-reperfusion injury and cardioprotection. PKCd is traditionally viewed as an allosterically-activated enzyme that exerts membrane-delimited actions at lipid membranes. This conventional model of PKCd activation does not adequately explain PKCd's actions in the heart, where PKCd phosphorylates proteins in non-membrane compartments and exerts diverse (and in some cases opposing) actions in both ischemic injury and cardioprotection. Our previous studies began to address this longstanding dilemma by showing that PKCd is activated in a stimulus-specific manner in cardiomyocytes. We showed that PKCd is phosphorylated at Y311 in cardiomyocytes subjected to oxidative stress (but not G protein-coupled receptor agonists) and that Y311 phosphorylation alters PKCd activity toward the sarcomeric regulatory proteins cardiac troponin I and cardiac troponin T. New data in this application expose the mechanism underlying the Y311-phosphorylation dependent change in PKCd's enzymology. We show that Y311 phosphorylation generates a docking site for PKCd's phospho-Tyr (pY) binding C2 domain. The C2 domain-pY311 interaction in turn controls PKCd activity indirectly by regulating phosphorylation at a novel site (S357) in the catalytic pocket of the kinase domain. The redox-dependent decrease in PKCd-S357 phosphorylation leads to a high level of lipid-independent activity (allowing for the phosphorylation of substrates throughout the cell, not just on lipid membranes) and a change in PKCd's substrate phosphoacceptor site (P-site) specificity. A mechanism to dynamically alter P-site specificity (through a change in kinase domain phosphorylation) is both novel for PKCd and unprecedented for any other kinase. Studies in this application will consider changes in S357 phosphorylation as a mechanism to explain PKCd's distinctive cellular actions during oxidative stress. Aim #1 will use in vitro biochemical approaches to identify the role of the C2 domain and S357 phosphorylation in the control of PKCd signaling to pathways that regulate cardiac growth and apoptosis responses. We will use biochemical approaches to identify growth factor- and ROS-dependent mechanisms that regulate PKCd-S357 phosphorylation and take advantage of genetic approaches and overexpression strategies (including with analogue-sensitive forms of PKCd) to identify substrates/effectors that are uniquely activated by distinct molecular forms of PKCd and (in conjunction with studies Aim 2) examine their role in cardiac injury responses. Aim #2 will use mouse models engineered to express mutant PKCdS357A or PKCdS357E alleles, in place of the WT-PKCd allele, to determine the role of PKCd- S357 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation in cardiac function and cardiac pathogenesis following ischemia- reperfusion injury in vivo. The overarching goal of these studies is to identify novel molecular determinant of PKCd that can be targeted to prevent or mitigate ischemia-reperfusion injury and pathologic cardiac remodeling."
"9176023","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are common, familial vascular malformations that arise due to mutations in three genes, KRIT1, CCM2 and PDCD10. Adaptor proteins encoded by the CCM genes bind each other and the cell surface receptor, Heart of Glass (HEG). Genetic studies in mice have revealed that HEG-CCM signaling is required in endothelial cells for early vascular development, while dilated hearts in deficient fish have also suggested that CCM signaling guides heart development and growth. How CCM signaling alters endothelial cell function in the setting of cardiovascular development and CCM disease remains unclear. We have used a new Nfatc1Cre allele to delete CCM signaling exclusively in the endocardium of the heart, thereby bypassing the requirement for this pathway in early vessel growth. We find that endocardial loss of CCM signaling results in heart failure associated with loss of cardiac jelly and over-expression of the ADAMTS5 protease and the KLF2 transcription factor. Reduced expression of either gene rescues the heart defects in ccm-deficient fish, demonstrating causal, functional roles for these new downstream CCM signaling effectors. The present proposal will define this new pathway downstream of CCM signaling by (i) testing CCM regulation of cardiac and vascular matrix, (ii) defining the role of CCM regulation of KLF2 in cardiac development and vascular disease models, and (iii) testing the hypothesis that CCM signaling affects matrix and KLF2 and ADAMTS5 gene expression through regulation of MEKK3 activity and MAPK signaling. These studies are expected to yield new insight into how the endocardium regulates cardiac development, and how CCM signaling affects endothelial cell function in the context of cardiovascular development and vascular disease."
"9377021","Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD), a rapidly growing health problem in the United States, has created serious public and personal crises at both medical and financial levels. Developing therapeutic strategies for AD is of critical importance, as no cure is currently available. Accumulation of ?-amyloid (A?) in the CNS has been proposed to play a causative role in the pathogenesis of AD. Dysfunction of the innate immune system for A? clearance is crucially involved in cerebral A? deposition and in pathological progression. The resident microglia and bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages (BMDMs) are the key innate immune cells to clear A? in the CNS. During disease progression, microglia turn to a pathological phenotype and fail to clear A?. BMDMs show robust effects in A? elimination, revealing a target for developing A? clearance therapies for AD. In fact, the hematopoietic system for generating BMDMs is defective in AD patients. BMDMs as well as stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are significantly reduced in AD patients. SCF and G- CSF are the essential hematopoietic growth factors that regulate blood cell generation. Critically, elucidating the role of SCF and G-CSF in generating BMDMs and in restricting A? accumulation may help in developing a cure for AD. We have recently discovered that SCF+G-CSF not only enhances BMDM generation but it also increases BMDM recruitment and enhances BMDM phagocytosis of A?, and ultimately induces long-term effects in A? reduction and cognitive improvement in APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis. The objective of this project is to define how SCF+G-CSF regulates BMDMs to restrict A? accumulation and improve cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. We hypothesize that the SCF+G-CSF-increased A? clearance in the brain with amyloidosis is coordinated through the enhancement of BMDM generation, of BMDM recruitment, and of BMDM function in A? removal. Using approaches ranging from molecular biology to live brain imaging, this hypothesis will be tested through the following 3 Aims: Aim 1 will determine how SCF+G- CSF enhances BMDM production in APP/PS1 mice, Aim 2 will examine how SCF+G-CSF regulates entry of BMDMs into the brains of APP/PS1 mice, and Aim 3 will define how SCF+G-CSF increases BMDM uptake of aggregated A?. Through these 3 Aims, the interaction between BMDM-related A? removal and neuroinflammatory changes will also be examined. We expect these studies to define the mechanisms underlying the SCF+G-CSF-increased A? clearance and cognitive improvement. This project is innovative in the unique approach, originally developed by our group, of targeting the hematopoietic system to enhance BMDM-mediated A? removal by SCF+G-CSF. This study is significant as it will shed light on how SCF+G-CSF ameliorates the defective innate immune system in the AD-like condition to reduce A? load. Importantly, this research could be readily translated into clinical trials because SCF+G-CSF therapy has been approved by the FDA for bone marrow stem cell recovery after chemotherapy in cancer patients."
"9373468","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroblastoma illustrates the striking clinical heterogeneity that one tumor histotype can encompass, with stage 4S patients undergoing spontaneous tumor regression and high-risk patients exhibiting significant mortality. Our laboratory recently identified LIN28B, an RNA binding protein that inhibits the let-7 tumor suppressor microRNA family and binds mRNAs directly, as an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma. While its roles in metabolism and embryonic development are becoming increasingly well-understood, how it promotes oncogene- sis is less clear. We have shown that LIN28B drives expression of the Ras-related protein RAN and Aurora kinase A (AURKA), to promote neuroblastoma proliferation. We also have evidence indicating that LIN28B promotes stemless related gene signatures in neuroblastoma, raising the possibility that its function in promoting self-renewal in normal development may also serve an oncogenic role. This Mentored Career Development proposal will test the hypothesis that LIN28B, in conjunction with RAN and AURKA, promotes cell proliferation and self-renewal to drive neuroblastoma aggression. First, we will determine the mechanisms by which LIN28B promotes self-renewal. Second, we will dissect the contribution of the downstream LIN28B targets RAN and AURKA to cell proliferation and self-renewal. In the final aim, we will test the hypothesis that LIN28B binding to mRNAs, including mRNAs of the RAN signaling network, provides one mechanism by which it exerts its oncogenic function. This K08 Award will broaden my scientific repertoire and provide an outstanding basis for a career in basic and translational oncology. First, in Aims 1 and 2, I will develop new expertise on the role of LIN28B/let-7 in mediating self-renewal, a hallmark of cancer that may represent an eventual therapeutic vulnerability but that re- quires further study. Second, I will master RNA-Seq and related technologies, using it to generate and test hypotheses; in Aim 1, I will use RNA-Seq to unveil the pathways LIN28B utilizes to regulate self-renewal. Finally, in Aim 3, I will develop expertise in utilizing CLIP-Seq, a high-throughput technology that identifies RNAs to which RNA binding proteins bind. This will further our understanding of coding and non-coding RNAs influenced by LIN28B and may improve our understanding of how other RNA binding proteins function. This work will be completed under the outstanding mentorship of Dr. John Maris and an Advisory Committee, comprised of Drs. Anil Rustgi, Celeste Simon, Andrei Thomas-Tikhonenko, Tom Look, and Sharon Diskin. Collectively, this committee possesses expertise in cancer genetics, RNA binding proteins, microRNAs, stem cell biology, bioinformatics, and animal models of disease. By studying this key pathway in neuroblastoma, I aim to lay the basis for its eventual therapeutic manipulation and generate novel insights to further our understanding of both pediatric and adult malignancies. In summary, both the scientific and educational components of this grant will strengthen my scientific foundation, allowing me to launch an independent research career."
"9173035","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and patients who survive a coronary artery occlusion have a high risk for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Spatial heterogeneity of sympathetic transmission is a major contributor to post-infarct arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction (MI), and sympathetic denervation predicted arrhythmia risk in recent human studies.  We have identified two distinct types of sympathetic denervation after MI: 1) persistent denervation of the infarct/scar and adjacent border zone myocytes, and 2) transient denervation of uninjured peri-infarct myocardium. This proposal will develop methods to prevent or reverse both types of denervation, and determine if restoring sympathetic innervation throughout the ventricle decreases arrhythmia susceptibility. The infarct remains denervated after MI due to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). We identified protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor sigma (PTP?as the major CSPG receptor in sympathetic neurons, and found that removing PTP?esulted in reinnervation of the border zone and hyperinnervation of the cardiac scar. Preliminary data suggest that eliminating PTP?ormalizes cardiac electrophysiology and renders hearts surprisingly resistant to post-MI arrhythmias. This suggests that restoring sympathetic innervation has a beneficial effect on arrhythmia susceptibility. However, it's not clear if re-innervation is the key to preventing arrhythmias, or if other actions of PTP?ontribut to decreased arrhythmia susceptibility in PTP?- hearts. We hypothesize that the major action of PTP?s to prevent reinnervation via interactions with CSPGs (Aim 1), and that restoring sympathetic innervation will decrease arrhythmia susceptibility (Aim 2). Peri-infarct myocardium is transiently denervated 1 and 3 days after MI and loss of sympathetic fibers outside the infarct requires activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor. We identified ProNGF and a form of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (either proBDNF or BDNF) as p75 ligands that are elevated in the heart after MI. We will test the hypothesis that pro-neurotrophins and/or BDNF stimulate peri-infarct denervation, and that preventing peri- infarct denervation will decrease arrhythmia susceptibility (Aim 3).  We have assembled an outstanding team of experts along with unique animal models and novel genetic tools to assist us in completing these studies. This work will test directly if manipulating cardiac nerves after MI can normalize cardiac electrophysiology and decrease arrhythmia frequency, opening a new avenue for therapeutic development."
"9178084","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With an estimated annual incidence of 300,000-350,000 and accounting for 50% of all cardiovascular deaths in the US, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a condition with significant implications for public health. Despite ongoing treatment advances in resuscitation science, survival among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims is <10%, making SCD prediction and prevention essential. While SCD risk is strongly associated with increasing age, manifestation in middle age (35-59 yr; approx. 30% of all SCD) is the most significant contributor to societal burden. However, published studies of SCD have focused almost exclusively on older patients (?60 yr), partly explained by insufficient numbers of middle-aged SCD cases among existing cardiovascular cohort studies. We have recently reported evidence for a distinctive profile of SCD in middle age compared to older age, indicating the significance of identifying middle age-specific SCD mechanisms. Middle aged SCD patients were more likely to present without prior warning, with obesity and non-white race playing a more important role. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that a detailed and focused examination of novel factors associated with SCD in middle age will enhance the understanding of mechanisms and contribute to improved SCD risk prediction and prevention. Our specific aims are 1) To identify features of malignant coronary events that provoke lethal arrhythmias in middle age 2) To identify novel obesity-related risk factors contributing to SCD risk; and 3) To identify patient subgroups at highest risk of SCD in middle age.  Over twelve years ago, we initiated the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon SUDS) to identify novel risk predictors for SCD. This large study among one million residents of the Portland, Oregon metro area continues to accrue a significant number of SCD cases and controls. The critical need to identify risk predictors for SCD in middle age currently represents the largest knowledge gap in SCD. The established Oregon SUDS provides a unique discovery population with sufficient numbers of subjects, coupled with the opportunity to leverage existing detailed clinical and biomarker information. There is a high likelihood of identifying clinically and mechanistically relevant predictors of SCD risk that will enhance prediction and prevention of SCD."
"9379937","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite strong evidence about the optimal treatment of diabetes, care often remains suboptimal. One recent examination of a national sample of diabetes patients found that less than 10% of patients surveyed were in optimal blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol control. One recently discovered barrier to optimal diabetes care is poor health literacy. Poor health literacy affects over 90 million Americans. Our research group was one of the first to demonstrate that low health literacy was independently associated with worse diabetes knowledge, self-management, and glycemic control (A1C). Numeracy (math skills) is an understudied component of literacy that is essential for many tasks in diabetes including glucose monitoring, assessing carbohydrate intake, and medication adjustment. Recently, our group demonstrated that poor numeracy is common in adults with diabetes and significantly associated with worse diabetes self-management, self- efficacy, and A1C. Addressing literacy and numeracy represent an exciting opportunity to improve diabetes care, because these are potentially modifiable risk factors. We recently performed four trials at academic medical centers that suggest that addressing literacy and numeracy can improve diabetes control. The aim of the proposed study is to perform a cluster-randomized trial to assess the efficacy of a low- literacy/numeracy-oriented intervention to improve diabetes care in under-resourced communities in Tennessee. The state of Tennessee now has a higher prevalence of diabetes then any other state in the nation. The study will occur in Tennessee Department of Health safety net primary care clinics in middle Tennessee. These primary care clinics provide diabetes care for a predominantly uninsured population at high risk for poor diabetes related health. The study represents a novel partnership between the Tennessee Department of Health and the Vanderbilt Diabetes Research and Training Center to improve care for a vulnerable population of diabetes patients. Ten State Health Department Clinics located in medically underserved areas will be randomized, and a total of 400 diabetes patients will be enrolled. Health Care Providers at the 5 control sites will receive standard diabetes education and the use of educational materials from the National Diabetes Education Program. Health Care Providers at intervention sites will receive training in clear health communication skills, and a Diabetes literacy and numeracy sensitive Educational Toolkit to use in partnership with their diabetes patients. Primary outcomes will include A1C, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Weight, Self-Management, and Self-Efficacy at 1 year. Patients will be followed for 2 years to assess sustainability. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed. The products of this study (health communication skills training modules and educational materials) will be disseminated via public access on the Internet. If successful, the proposed model will be disseminated across the State and will be a model for other Health Departments and clinics across the nation."
"9178082","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term career goal is to develop an independent, funded research program that contributes to understanding the mechanisms by which obesity and type 2 diabetes lead to impaired vascular insulin signaling and cardiovascular disease. In obesity, insulin-stimulated blood flow to skeletal muscle is limited and this attenuate glucose uptake, thus contributing to impaired glucose homeostasis. However, the mechanism by which insulin-induced vasodilation becomes impaired is largely unknown. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediates the impairment in insulin-stimulated vasodilation in skeletal muscle arterioles. It is reasoned that vascular ER stress and vascular insulin resistance caused by obesity is attributable to the local secretion of inflammatory cytokines by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). Using a well-established pig model of Western diet-induced obesity, Aim 1 will test if obesity-associated vascular ER stress underlies the imbalance between nitric oxide and endothlein-1 leading to impaired insulin- stimulated vasodilation. Aim 2 will then determine if obese skeletal muscle PVAT can cause vascular ER stress, thus contributing to impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation. Finally, Aim 3 will examine whether in vivo genetic and chemical enhancement of ER function can restore impaired insulin-stimulated vasodilation associated with obesity. The contribution of this proposed work in pigs is significant as targeting ER stress may be a novel therapeutic strategy to correct vascular insulin resistance and ultimately prevent/treat metabolic and cardiovascular disease fueled by obesity. The University of Missouri (MU) campus has a distinguished history of research in cardiovascular science, metabolism, and exercise physiology and is the home for the Life Sciences Center, the Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center, the Health Activity Center, the Diabetes and Cardiovascular Center, the National Swine Resource & Research Center as resources for this project. These centers are filled with faculty from multiple departments and divisions that actively collaborate, providing an unparalleled research environment to pursue my independent research. Indeed, I will be interacting with a large number of senior investigators who will not only help ensure successful completion of the proposed studies, but also facilitate my career development as I progress toward becoming a successful independent investigator. James R. Sowers, MD, will be my primary mentor and Frank W. Booth, PhD will act as my co-mentor. Dr. Sowers is a clinical physician as well as a researcher with expertise in vascular insulin actions and cardiometabolic disease. Dr. Booth has expertise in adipose tissue biology and physical activity. Together, we have assembled a comprehensive research training plan and team of collaborators that will facilitate the acquisition of new molecular techniques (i.e., in vivo adenoviral transfection, proteomics) as well as techniques involving in vitro preparations of isolated intact arterioles to enhance my abilities to conduct mechanistic research. These additional skills combined with my earlier background in human vascular research will contribute to my long-term goal of establishing a research program with capabilities to conduct in vitro and in vivo mechanistic and translational research using animal models of obesity/type 2 diabetes as well as human patients. In short, the additional technical, academic, and career development afforded by my training plan will place me in an ideal position to successfully launch a productive, independent and translational research program. This NIH K01 application represents the next logical step in my career development as a young early investigator and will set the stage for my first R01 application. (End of Abstract)"
"9191025","Project Summary/Abstract  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the only cause of death amongst the top ten in the United States which has no treatment. AD progression cannot be halted, and there are no disease-modifying drugs currently on the market (1). It is hypothesized that the reason many treatments have failed in the fight against AD is that once a person starts showing clinical cognitive decline, too many neurons are irreparably destroyed. Consequently, the prevailing notion in the field of AD research is that we must identify patients at risk for developing the disease, so we can treat them before symptoms manifest. In order to be successful in this endeavor, we must work to understand the etiopathogenesis of the disease. It is becomingly increasingly recognized that many cases of AD are multifactorial in nature; the most common mixed dementia pathology is standard AD amyloid and tau pathology in concert with vascular pathology. This proposal seeks to examine the relationship between vascular status, particularly arterial health metrics of the arteries of the Circle of Willis, and longitudinal metrics associated with AD progression, namely cognitive performance on neuropsychological tests and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes. Additionally, as AD is known to be genetically linked, this F30 project will also seek to investigate how differing genetic backgrounds interact with vascular and amyloid pathology. Specifically, this fellowship proposal will employ a newly developed 4D-Flow MRI method to characterize cerebrovascular disease in the major arteries of the brain. These metrics will be used as predictor variables in longitudinal linear mixed effects models to examine trajectories of cognitive decline. Furthermore, these arterial health metrics will be analyzed in concert with structural and molecular variables associated with AD, namely cortical atrophy, hippocampal atrophy, and CSF amyloid and tau, to determine whether poor vascular health is associated with a faster accumulation of AD-associated pathology. Lastly, a polygenic risk score representing the amyloid clearance pathway and metrics of arterial health will be studied in an interaction model to determine if optimal vascular health may be protective in those individuals with increased genetic risk for AD."
"9176990","Cognitive deficits are major disabling impairments associated with autism and schizophrenia. Because the underlying genetic and cellular mechanisms of such deficits are still poorly understood, mechanism-based therapeutic options do not exist, limiting the effective integration of patients into society. Previous clinical work has shown that executive functions such as working memory and cognitive flexibility start to lag behind from adolescence to adulthood in individuals with autism and schizophrenia. However, the precise genetic, anatomical and cellular substrates through which this occurs are still poorly understood. We have identified two genes encoded in copy number variants (CNVs) at human chromosome 22q11.2, a high-risk factor for autism and schizophrenia, for which dose alterations impair the developmental maturation of working memory. Our published work shows that mice developmentally expand working memory capacity from adolescence to adulthood and that constitutively elevated activity of catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) impairs the working memory of mice during adulthood, but not adolescence. During the previous funding period, we have further found that over-expression of COMT and the transcription factor TBX1, another 22q11.2 gene, in adult neural progenitor cells of the hippocampus recapitulates this age-dependent deficit in working memory capacity. The objective of the proposed project is to test our overarching hypothesis that dose alterations of CNV-encoded genes impair the developmental maturation of executive function through defective adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. To test this hypothesis, we developed experimental tools to regulate CNV- encoded genes in adult neural progenitor cells in the hippocampus at specific developmental time points. Moreover, we have established a screening system to identify other autism- and schizophrenia-associated CNV genes whose dose alterations affect adult neurogenesis and executive function. Our experimental readouts include executive function and adult neurogenesis. Upon completion of the proposed studies, these technically innovative experiments will, for the first time, establish a common cellular mechanism through which altered doses of autism- and schizophrenia-associated genes impair the developmental maturation of executive function. Identification of the developmental time window, neuroanatomical region(s), and cellular subtypes necessary for maturation of executive function will have a major impact on our understanding of the developmental mechanisms of executive function and its derailed trajectories. This proposal could lead to a better understanding of the neurobiological substrates for an important dimensional aspect of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9173032","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Severe pulmonary hypertension is a progressive and irreversible disease that often leads to mortality due to right heart failure. The pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension involves proliferation of cells, including endothelial cells (intimal remodeling), in the vessel walls of pulmonary arteries resulting in remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. Several factors implicated in the remodeling process are driven by hypoxia. One mechanism by which cells respond to hypoxia is by stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha. Independent studies suggest that both HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are important mediators in PH. However, recent investigations have reported a marked increase in HIF-2alpha gene locus polymorphism in individuals adapting to high altitudes, suggesting a role of HIF-2alpha in PH. Mechanism by which HIF-2alpha influences pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH, independent of HIF-1alpha is not known. This proposal is focused on understanding the role of HIF-2alpha and its pathways in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.  We have recently identified a new pathway, the HIF-2alpha-A2A receptor pathway, by which HIF-2alpha can promote endothelial proliferation, independent of HIF-1alpha. We hypothesize that hypoxia increases endothelial  proliferation and vascular remodeling through a HIF-2alpha and A2A receptor-dependent mechanism and that this  is an important step in the pathogenesis of PH. Additionally, we have also identified HIF-1alpha in smooth muscle  cell proliferation, independent of HIF-2alpha. The proposed studies are divided into three aims. Aim 1 will elucidate mechanisms by which hypoxia and HIFs influence endothelial growth using cultured primary pulmonary endothelial cells as well as endothelial cells derived from hypertensive rats. The second aim will be used to test the hypothesis that inhibition or knockdown of HIFs, particularly HIF-2alpha will limit vascular remodeling and PA pressures in a rat model of PAH. The third aim will test whether inhibition or knockdown of A2A receptor, a downstream transcriptional target of HIF-2alpha, can mitigate remodeling and PA pressures in a rat model of PAH.  The in vivo aims will investigate effects using both a prevention model and a rescue model. Results of the proposed research will help provide insights into hypoxic pathways that influence pulmonary vascular remodeling and offer alternative targets for treatment of PH."
"9099504","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) face extreme challenges as they adapt to both arthropod and vertebrate hosts. Arboviruses acutely infect humans and a wide range of other vertebrates, but must persistently infect one or two mosquito species for transmission to their next vertebrate host. Due to interhost cycling, arboviruses encounter vast differences in immune responses and RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by small RNAs. In contrast to in vertebrates, RNAi is the main antiviral response in insects, targeting RNA virus genomes for degradation to limit viral replication. Because of the disparate nature of RNAi in vertebrates versus mosquitoes, strategies for arboviruses to evade and subvert these responses should be equally divergent depending on the host. Therefore, we hypothesize that arbovirus:small RNA interplay will vary radically between mosquito and mammalian hosts. As a model arbovirus, we plan to study chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which causes a painful, debilitating illness, for which there is no vaccine or treatment. The main goal o this proposal is to understand CHIKV interaction strategies with disparate host RNAi components and responses. This work aims to advance our understanding of host-specific small RNA interactions with arboviruses, beginning with CHIKV.  Recently, we collaborated with the Darnell lab at The Rockefeller University to apply cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of Argonaute (Ago; termed Ago-CLIP) to virus-infected cells. Ago proteins are essential to all RNAi pathways, and are guided by small RNAs to bind to mRNA or viral RNA targets. Using Ago-CLIP, we can physically map small RNA-mediated Ago binding to viral genomes. This technique offers a unique opportunity to examine functional differences in host species' small RNA interactions with arboviruses. In our specific aims, we propose to use Ago-CLIP to map small RNA-mediated Ago binding to the CHIKV genome in both mammalian and mosquito models 1) in vitro and 2) in vivo, with special attention to interactions relevant to mosquito antiviral responses. Our understanding of arbovirus:host interactions is limited, particularly in mosquito vectors, and has been a major impediment to the development of antiviral control strategies. Our aims will allow us to identify critical CHIKV:small RNA interactions, which may uncover novel drug targets. Furthermore, observation of such small RNA interactions will increase our understanding of determinants of tropism and may inform strategies for disrupting arbovirus transmission. On a global level, systemic mapping of small RNA landscapes for arboviruses will yield insights into the interplay between viruses and antiviral defenses in disparate hosts."
"9188563","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Perinatal Research Society (PRS) consists of pediatricians, obstetricians, and basic scientists who are the nation's leaders in all aspects of perinatal research and have a wealth of experience in NIH funding and trainee mentoring. The overall purpose of the PRS annual meeting is twofold, 1) to provide productive interchange between scientists of different disciplines sharing a common research interest in perinatal biology, and 2) to encourage development and collaboration opportunities for Young Investigators (YI's) to build careers in perinatal research. The PRS annual meeting provides many important career development opportunities through it design. The YI program begins at a premeeting Workshop in which intensive one-on-one mentoring/teaching by senior PRS members leads to tangible progress in the YIs developing and expressing their own research ideas. However, it is in the Main Meeting that they become integrated with the society membership as a whole. The program itself presents the latest advances in the field but also provides the opportunity for some YI's to present their research ideas. Beyond the speaker program all YI's are constantly encouraged to network with the many established and indeed prominent researchers who have excelled at building successful careers. The intentional programmatic acknowledgement of and presentations by YI's within the Main Meeting, combined with many informal and formal interaction opportunities in a relaxed retreat-like setting contributes to YI professional development and creates opportunities to develop individual collaborations and mentoring relationships with senior colleagues. This is critical to future research career success.  We seek funding to support a lectureship as part of the Main Meeting program, but also predominantly to support Young Investigators (YI) attendance and participation in the Main Meeting. The need for this kind of opportunity for early career development is significant because of the times in which we live. Many YI's are giving up their goal of a career in perinatal research. We believe this combined approach or premeeting Workshop and then Main Meeting attendance and further mentoring is unique, and we will track outcomes norms over the next five years to see if they exceed NIH norms."
"9220188","ABSTRACT Inflammatory signaling by macrophages in response to pathogens or tissue injury is the key determinant of the pathology and pathogenesis of infectious and non-infectious disease. The transcription factor NF?B controls the inflammatory gene expression programs, but it remains unclear how its regulation determines healthy or disease-associated gene expression responses. During the previous funding period, we have used a combined experimental / computational modeling approach to gain a predictive understanding of how NF?B is activated in response to TLR signaling and that multiple mechanisms converge to regulate NF?B. After developing a live cell microscopy tracking workflow we discovered that contrary to previous notions NF?B dynamics are highly oscillatory. By generating a knockin RelA-Venus mouse, we are able ? for the first time ? measure NF?B dynamics in primary cells revealing oscillations as an intrinsic hallmark of NF?B in healthy macrophages. Based on preliminary studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that NF?B oscillations are critical for healthy macrophage functions as they preserve their epigenetic chromatin state. Non-oscillatory NF?B is more likely to alter the macrophage-characteristic chromatin state and lead to altered, disease-associated gene expression. Further, while oscillations are pervasive, their duration is modulated by different stimuli, allowing for differential, stimulus-specific gene expression programs. Together, the proposed studies will substantially contribute to our understanding of how NF?B dynamic control determines physiological and pathological gene expression programs."
"9236245","Summary: Antibiotic resistance represents one of the greatest threats to human health. In particular, the six so-called ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacteriaceae) represent highly drug-resistant bacteria that exert a tremendous global burden of disease. The potential scope of this crisis was highlighted in a recent report commissioned by the Wellcome Trust and British Government; the authors projected that, by 2050, drug-resistant bacterial infections could cost the global economy a cumulative $100 trillion and kill 10 million people annually. To address this issue, there is a critical need for innovative antibacterial treatments. One compelling therapeutic strategy leverages recombinant enzymes that degrade cell wall peptidoglycan, thereby causing bacterial lysis and death. Currently, all such lytic enzyme therapies are trans-acting in nature, i.e., they are derived from bacteriophage or the immune systems of eukaryotic organisms. This proposal seeks to establish an entirely new paradigm for developing bacteriolytic enzyme drugs. We hypothesize that a pathogen's own endogenous cell wall hydrolases (i.e., ?autolysins?) can be co-opted to yield potent antimicrobial agents that are refractory to new resistance phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue initial studies with the high impact pathogen methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), although the strategy should be broadly applicable to any bacterial pathogen. Here, complementary computational and experimental approaches will be utilized to identify, isolate, and engineer potent autolysins derived from staphylococcal proteomes. In aim 1, the sequenced genome of S. aureus and related bacteria will be searched for autolysins using bioinformatics. Candidate enzymes will be cloned, evaluated, and their activities will be improved via computationally guided fusion to high performance cell wall targeting domains. In aim 2, a complementary high throughput screening strategy will be taken to identify autolysins from genomic libraries of pathogenic staphylococci. The activities of candidate enzymes will be improved via combinatorial chimeragenesis with high performance cell wall targeting domains, followed by high throughput functional screening of the resultant chimeric libraries. In aim 3, lead autolysin candidates will be further engineered for potent anti-staphylococcal activity using a directed evolution strategy. The most promising lead candidates from these studies will be rigorously evaluated using a panel of clinically relevant in vitro and in vivo assays. Ultimately, this project could yield both novel anti-staphylococcal agents and an entirely new paradigm for development of antibacterial biotherapies."
"9173042","(NEUROIMAGING AND NEUROCIRCUITRY (NNC): CORE E)  PROJECT SUMMARY Description: The Neuroimaging and Neurocircuitry Core (NNC) enables the study of changes in brain circuitry which occur in people with IDD. The Core supports research in both patients and animal models by providing users the following state-of-the-art technologies: (a) Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of brain activity; (b) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of brain structure and function; (c) Multiphoton, confocal, and epifluorescence microscopic imaging studies of the dynamics of neuronal circuit function; (d) Patch clamp recording studies in neurons; and (e) Electroencephalographic (EEG) and other in vivo recordings. Analyses are performed in affected human patients with IDD, in Preclinical animal models of IDD, and in vitro (stem cells and tissue culture). Core Directors provide users with access to a wide set of otherwise inaccessible neuronal circuit assessment techniques, as well as expert consultation regarding experimental design and analysis. In all core functions, emphasis is placed upon quality control. In addition to assuring that all studies are competently conducted and appropriately analyzed, the Core Directors assist users to design studies that are properly controlled, adequately powered, and, when feasible, conducted in a blinded fashion. Relevance to IDDRC Mission: The overarching theme of this IDDRC is ?Genes, Brain & Behavior? (see Overview). This Core focuses on each of these overlapping domains. Genetic alterations underlie many IDDs, and result in aberrant protein expression, which alters basic brain function. This in turn generates the behavioral anomalies which constitute IDD. The study of patients and animal models brings the genetic components into sharp focus, and the NNC facilitates examination into how these genetic changes alter brain function and, subsequently, whether such changes are correlated to behavior. Thus, the goal of the Core is to quantify the changes in function of neuronal circuits which result from genetic mutation and variation. Elucidating the changes in dynamic function of neuronal circuitry responsible for the generation of the pathologic behaviors collectively termed the IDD is critical in translational efforts to develop better therapies to treat and cure brain pathologies underlying the IDDs and other related CNS disorders such as autism, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy. Eligibility: These services are available both to approved users of the IDDRC at CHOP/UPenn and to users at other Centers in the Network.       "
"9172660","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in the understanding of underlying mechanisms, heart failure (HF) remains the major cause of mortality, indicating the urgent need in the development of novel unconventional therapeutic strategies. Abnormal intracellular calcium (Ca2+) handling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of malignant arrhythmias characteristic of Heart Failure (HF). Cardiac excitation-contraction (EC) coupling is mediated through Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), which is controlled by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-sensitive Ca2+ channels, also known as cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2). MicroRNAs (miRs) are ~22-nucleotide-long nonprotein-coding RNAs that recognize their target mRNAs by base pairing interactions and subsequently inhibit gene expression by targeting these mRNAs for translational repression or degradation. Rapidly accumulating evidence implicates dysregulated miRs in cardiac pathogenesis including arrhythmias and HF rendering them new attractive targets for therapy. However, much work must be done for better understanding of miR functions. Our preliminary results implicate a family of miRs specific to muscle tissue called myomiRs in regulation of Ca2+ handling in cardiomyocytes. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that myomiRs which include miR-208a, miR-208b and miR-499 play a critical role in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis by modulating the structure and function of macromolecular complexes involved in Ca2+ handling. In order to test this hypothesis we have developed techniques to modify the expression of miRNAs in vitro and in intact hearts in vivo in order to examine their effects on Ca2+ cycling in single ventricular myocytes using electrophysiology and single photon laser scanning confocal microscopy. Specifically we aim to investigate the molecular determinants of myomiR-mediated regulation of SR Ca2+ release through RyR2s in ventricular myocytes, and test whether aberrant expression patterns of these miRs contribute to Ca2+-dependent arrhythmias characteristic of cardiac disease using rat model of heart failure."
"9048937","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this fellowship is to examine the stability of early childhood environmental ecologies and how instability in these ecological settings affect childhood health and well-being and broader patterns of population-level inequality. Prior literature investigating childhood inequality and ecological instability has typically examined point-in-time exposure to ecological contexts or focused on instability in only one domain. This study extends the existing literature by taking a dynamic, multi-dimensional, and child-centered approach to the short- and long-term developmental implications of ecological instability. This study bridges conceptual ideas from sociology, demography, and developmental psychology to accomplish this goal. In this effort, this study asks three main questions: (1) what does instabiliy in the work-family-care nexus look like during the first five years of children's lives; (2) do children influence their own experience of ecological instability during early childhood, and if so what factors (e.g., physical health, social behavior) are most likely to affect these settings; (3)is early childhood instability associated with children's middle and late childhood health and well-being? Moreover, an important component of this research is to examine how these trends differ by children's socioeconomic status, which can speak to how ecological instability shapes the intergenerational transmission of inequality. In answering these questions, this study draws on two complementary sources of data: The NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCW). These datasets allow for the close examination of changes in family structure, mothers' work characteristics, and children's extra-familial care because of the detailed collection of information during frequent interviews with families over early childhood. In addition, both datasets have objective and subjective measures of children's development, including their physical health, behavioral, and academic outcomes in middle and late childhood. The analytic plan uses latent class analysis (LCA) to identify the ecological instability experience over early childhood, and cross-lagged structural equation models and regression analysis to examine the role children play in influencing their ecological contexts and how early childhood instability may  be associated with children's poorer health and well-being in middle and late childhood. Additional statistical techniques will be used to address selection bias and causal inference. This theoretically grounded study has important implications for policy. Understanding what types of instability put specific groups of families at risk for subsequent instability in other domains and which instability profiles are associated with poorer childhood health and well-being can inform policy and interventions targeting vulnerable children and families and speak to larger trends in population health and well-being inequalities."
"9120717","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circadian (~24 hr) rhythms influence nearly all aspects of behavior and physiology. Disrupted circadian rhythms contribute to a wide range of human health conditions including sleep disorders such as shift work disorder and affective disorders such as anxiety and depression. However, understanding how circadian rhythms control or influence behavior remains a fundamental problem in neuroscience. While most neurons in the brain contain a molecular clock, overt circadian rhythms are orchestrated by the master pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Neurons of the SCN rhythmically fire action potentials and, together as a network, communicate circadian information to other circuits responsible for complex behaviors, perhaps the most obvious of which is sleep. Theoretical work has suggested that circadian drive for sleep (Process C) and homeostatic sleep pressure (Process S) follow distinct, albeit interconnected oscillations. A proposed mechanistic link between these processes lies in the hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) system, a collection of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus that is essential for the stability of arousal. The loss of Hcrt or its receptors is associated with the disorder narcolepsy, which is characterized by the intrusion of sleep into wakefulness, and the optogenetic stimulation of Hcrt neurons directly promotes sleep-to-wake transitions. Importantly, Hcrt neuron activity (as read out by c-Fos), Hcrt transcript levels, and levels of Hcrt in the cerebrospinal fluid exhibit circadian rhythmicity. As circadian clock genes are ubiquitous throughout the brain and have been shown to influence neural activity and behavior outside the SCN, an intriguing possibility is that the molecular clock within  Hcrt neurons regulates their activity independent of, or in concurrence with, input from the SCN. Thus, I hypothesize that SCN neural activity and the molecular clock within Hcrt neurons synergistically exert circadian control over Hcrt neural activity and sleep/wake behavior. To test this hypothesis, I will investigate the link between circadian rhythms, Hcrt neural activity, and sleep using a unique strategy that combines optogenetic manipulation of SCN activity, Hcrt neuron-specific molecular clock disruption, in vivo calcium imaging of Hcrt activity, and polysomnographic recording of sleep state. This proposal will provide novel insight into not only the essential relationship between circadian rhythms and arousal, but also the general neuroscience question of defining the neural mechanisms of complex behaviors that, when disrupted, can cause mental disease. To understand how the dysregulation of circadian rhythms may lead to illnesses such as sleep and affective disorders, it is first necessary to understand how they work in a healthy brain. Thus, this research plan will ultimately improve our understanding of the interplay of vital circadian and sleep circuits whose dysfunction can negatively impact human health."
"9215112","Defining the role of Host Hsp70 Subnetworks in Dengue Virus Replication Abstract: Viral protein folding and homeostasis depends entirely on the machinery of the host cell. Here we define the dependence of Dengue virus (DENV) on the complex network of Hsp70 chaperones and cochaperones which mediate distinct steps of the virus life cycle. We find that several cytosolic Hsp70 isoforms are required at multiple steps of the viral life cycle to prevent viral protein degradation, promote virion assembly and support viral enzyme function. At each step, Hsp70 function is specified by distinct subnetworks of cofactors, called DnaJs and NEFs, that modulate Hsp70 action and localization at each step. We hypothesize that combinations of DnaJs and NEFs dictate the specific cellular locations, substrate specificities and downstream effectors of Hsp70 in viral replication. We propose to define the mechanism and function of Hsp70 subnetworks in DENV replication through the integration of genetic and proteomic analyses with biochemical and cell biological experiments. Specifically we propose to: (1) Define the mechanism and function of DnaJs in DENV replication; (2) Dissect the role and mechanism of Hsp70 NEFs in DENV replication and (3) Define the mechanism of restriction by the Bag6-centered network. Defining the chaperone subnetworks required for distinct steps of DENV replication will provide new insights into key aspects of the cell biology and molecular mechanism of viral infection. Importantly, Hsp70 provides a susceptible node for antiviral drugs, since compounds inhibiting the Hsp70 cycle blocks DENV infection with negligible toxicity to the host. Our work will thus identify novel targets for pharmacological antiviral intervention and uncover unanticipated cellular mechanisms for viral restriction."
"9191587","Project Summary Traumatic injury is the leading cause of death from ages 1-44 in the United States, responsible for over 180,000 deaths, 2.3 million hospital admissions, and $406 billion in healthcare costs per year. While roughly half of deaths due to trauma occur either immediately or very early after injury, the remaining mortality occurs after presentation and administration of hospital-based care, primarily from trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), the associated overwhelming systemic inflammatory responses that lead to end-organ failure, and sepsis due to secondary immunosuppression. While new therapies such as tranexamic acid have been introduced with limited efficacy in controlling early major bleeding, no specific therapies or early interventions exist that alter the natural history of delayed mortality following major trauma. A major risk factor for mortality is the presence of TIC, which is present in 1 of every 4 patients suffering major trauma (ISS > 15), carries a 30 day mortality of nearly 50%, and is clinically observed to have a significant inflammatory component. Based on the well-established role of neutrophils (PMN) in many systemic inflammatory and end-organ diseases such as sepsis and ARDS, we recently set out to investigate a role for PMNs in TIC and its inflammatory sequelae. Our early experiments suggest that products of clotted whole blood and clotted plasma prime PMNs for excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, likely through generation of the complement fragment C5a, and can lead to breakdown of endothelial barriers, end-organ damage, and further coagulopathy. To fully investigate this promising observation, we now propose in Aim 1 to fully characterize the role of complement fragments generated during coagulation in PMN NADPH oxidase priming for ROS production, the complement pathway(s) involved, and the functional consequences of the released soluble PMN products on endothelial barrier integrity. We will then establish ex-vivo the ability of human poly-trauma patient plasma to prime the PMN NADPH oxidase complex for ROS generation, define the contribution of the complement system and pathway(s) involved, and correlate these findings with the corresponding clinical outcomes including development of TIC, end-organ injury, and mortality in Aim 2. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use murine models to demonstrate in-vivo the importance of PMN ROS production, complement, and endothelial cytokine production in the development of TIC and inflammatory organ injury following trauma and hemorrhage. Taken together, this will allow a comprehensive evaluation of the contribution of PMNs and PMN-derived ROS to the development of TIC and its associated inflammatory end-organ damage."
"9385123","Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to secure funds to support the 1st International SYNGAP1 Conference. MRD5 (MIM#: 612621; www.omim.org/entry/612621) is a recently discovered sporadic form of intellectual disability (ID). This disorder is caused by deleterious de novo mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene, which encodes the synaptic RasGAP, SynGAP. Symptoms of MRD5 include cognitive impairment and severely impaired expressive and receptive language. Epilepsy, ASD and ADHD are common comorbid conditions often described in these patients. Pathogenic mutations in SYNGAP1 are surprisingly common, with the incidence reported as 1-4/10,000 individuals, or approximately 1-2% of all ID cases, making it one of the most common genetic causes of ID. It is crucial in the case of SYNGAP1 to have an international meeting bringing together all relevant stakeholders (i.e. patient families, clinicians and researchers) because so little is understood about this emerging brain disorder. While it is known that SynGAP protein is critical for regulating learning and neural excitability in both humans and mice, it remains unclear how loss of functional SynGAP protein leads to symptoms of the disorder. Furthermore, there is a general lack of awareness of the disease, resulting in delay of diagnosis and there is no centralized location to access medical, research, or patient information. Lastly, patient families have poor access to cutting-edge medical and scientific expertise that will inform their understanding of the disorder. Therefore, we believe that there is an urgent need to hold this meeting. The proposed conference will bring together stakeholders with the primary goal of maximizing scientific resources by building collaborative approaches that are efficient and synergistic, thereby accelerating the identification of effective treatments. We have commitments from the leading clinicians and researchers studying SynGAP biology and the related human disorders. Importantly, the meeting will be run in conjunction with the major MRD5 patient support network, Bridge-the GAP (www.bridgesyngap.org), which will organize the attendance of several families with affected children. The symposium will include sessions related to MRD5 clinical genetics/patient phenotypes, Syngap1 neurobiology, common substrates in neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy genetics, translational approaches in RASopathies, and accelerating translation in rare genetic disorders. We anticipate the creation of impactful opportunities for junior investigators, including women and minorities, to participate in scientific exchange and to meet MRD5 patients and their families. Key outcomes expected from this meeting include: (i) networking and establishment of collaborative research and clinical outreach programs; (ii) generation of new ideas on the pathogenesis and possible treatment of MRD5; (iii) expansion of the MRD5 research and clinical community; and (iv) establishment of an international MRD5 research and clinical network to foster fully collaborative, multi-laboratory basic research and to encourage initiation of a patient registry and natural history study in order to advance patient care and treatment."
"9258641","PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S., with a continued call for more effective interventions to improve outcome. Many compounds have shown promise in pre-clinical studies, but fail to translate effectively into the clinic. Our long-term goal is to improve TBI therapeutic translation through temporal and pathobiological specificity in administering compounds to individual patients. Here we postulate that certain therapeutics are effective only when appropriately timed to a specific post-TBI biochemical event. This application will specifically focus on TBI-induced dysfunction of potassium/chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2), a neuron specific transporter that maintains the low intracellular chloride concentration essential to gabaergic inhibitory transmission. Aim 1a interrogates the post-translational modification of KCC2 ahead of its destabilization and triggered loss of the active dimeric form and associated binding partners. KCC2 functional cycling is post-translationally regulated and our preliminary data point to early modification preceding its delocalization. Aim 1b assesses the therapeutic potential of CLP290, a recently reported selective modulator of KCC2 that enhances preservation of its functional state at the plasma membrane, as observed in our preliminary studies following TBI. Effective administration of CLP290 will be tested in relation to post-translational triggers of KCC2 destabilization to underscore the mechanistic relevance of our preliminary data demonstrating therapeutic efficacy when given one day, but not immediately or two days following injury. Aim 2a will test the correlation of improved behavioral recovery with CLP290 administration and the functional preservation of chloride homeostasis, as critical to maintaining inhibitory neurotransmission. Aim 2b will evaluate whether CLP290 further reduces secondary tissue loss through maintenance of chloride homeostasis and associated inhibitory transmission counteracting excitotoxicity. With the successful completion of these studies, we expect to establish the mechanistic framework for the novel therapeutic targeting of KCC2 dysfunction following TBI. Furthermore, these studies will demonstrate the need to temporally correlate therapy with post-translational proteomic events that may then be targeted for selective biomarker development. We expect results from these studies will progress the theragnostics approach to TBI interventions. Specifically, these studies aim to treat the disruption of the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in surviving tissues for improved functional recovery and potential alleviation of post-traumatic seizure. As well, the successful completion of the proposed training plan and project will provide Mr. Lizhnyak with exceptional preparation in pursuing an independent, productive research career."
"9172203","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has become a major epidemic in today's society. It is a major risk factor for cardiac disease and necessitates studies that enhance our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in transcriptional adaptation to obesity that could potentially translate into therapeutic targets. A contributing factor in obesity is hypothyroidism. Many of the confounding cardiac effects of obesity overlap with effects of hypothyroidism including mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupted cardiac energetics, and ultimately decreased cardiac contractility. The heart requires highly efficient metabolism to maintain the levels of ATP needed for contractility and pump function. We identified a signaling pathway for transcriptional regulation in the heart by MED13 and found that this pathway plays a key role in modulating energy homeostasis. Our preliminary studies for this proposal show that altering cardiac transcription by MED13 significantly alters metabolic gene expression, metabolite production and cardiac function, prompting us to develop the necessary tools to identify the mechanism for MED13 function in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this application is to decipher the physiological role of MED13-dependent transcriptional regulation of cardiac reprograming in response to obesity and altered thyroid hormone levels. We hypothesize that MED13 functions to inhibit cardiac transcriptional reprogramming in obesity and hypothyroidism. The specific Aims designed to test this hypothesis using MED13 gain- and loss-of-function mice are: Aim 1: To analyze the molecular mechanistic action for MED13 regulation of cardiac energetics in response to obesity. The experiments planned will test the hypothesis that MED13 integrates metabolic signaling events in the heart, functioning as a brake to regulate transcriptional reprogramming. We will utilize in vivo and in vitro models of obesity to assess changes in cardiac gene expression, mitochondrial function, metabolomics profile and key signaling pathways that are regulated by MED13. Aim 2: To define MED13- dependent regulation of cardiac remodeling in response to chronic hypothyroidism. The proposed experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that MED13 suppresses transcriptional reprograming in response to chronic hypothyroidism. We will utilize a similar experimental approach as in Aim 1 to dissect MED13-dependent cardiac effects of TH signaling in vitro and in vivo. These studies will provide mechanistic insights into the regulatory network linking cardiac reprograming in obesity and hypothyroidism. The new insights will provide opportunities for therapeutic modulation of cardiac diseases with disrupted transcriptional programing, altered cardiac energetics and decreased function. ."
"9237890","Abstract  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease that affects as many as one in 2500 individuals. We discovered that 43% of lupus patients have dramatically increased numbers of peripheral blood B cells that express the transcription factor ARID3a. Numbers of ARID3a+ B lymphocytes were associated with increased disease activity, suggesting that ARID3a might contribute to, or be a consequence of, disease activity. The underlying reasons for increased ARID3a expression in blood cells from lupus patients, and its association with disease activity are unclear. Our data now indicate that ARID3a+ B cells produce interferon alpha, a Type I interferon previously associated with inflammatory processes and increased disease activity in SLE. It is unlikely that B lymphocytes secrete sufficient quantities of interferon to explain the high levels associated with SLE. Preliminary data indicate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells and neutrophils also show high levels of ARID3a expression in a subset of SLE blood samples, as compared to healthy controls. Intriguingly, ARID3a expression in those cells is associated with production of interferon alpha. Additional data suggest that ARID3a, and interferon alpha, are induced in healthy blood cells through toll-like receptor signals, particularly CpG. These data link ARID3a expression to normal innate immune responses. Inhibition of ARID3a in B lymphoblastoid cells also inhibits interferon alpha expression, suggesting ARID3a plays a role in regulating interferon production in those cells. We hypothesize that ARID3a expression is associated with interferon production in neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and that ARID3a+ neutrophils and/or dendritic cells are associated with disease pathogenesis in SLE. Furthermore, we hypothesize that ARID3a expression is induced as a consequence of innate immune signals in hematopoietic stem cell progenitor populations, and that ARID3a-expressing progenitors contribute to interferon signatures observed in SLE. The proposed studies will define associations between ARID3a expression and innate immune responses in neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in lupus and healthy control samples. Requirements for ARID3a in interferon production will be evaluated using ARID3a knockdown experiments. Genes potentially regulated by ARID3a in innate immune signaling pathways will be identified. Finally, we will use humanized mouse models to evaluate the consequences of induced ARID3a expression in healthy hematopoietic progenitors. The results of these experiments will fill important gaps in our understanding of regulatory responses in innate immunity and abnormal responses observed in SLE that are associated with ARID3a. Ultimately, we expect these data to have broader impacts that increase our understanding of inflammatory responses associated with normal innate immunity and with autoimmune disease."
"9275104","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for gene expression in all eukaryotes and errors in splicing cause genetic disorders and many other diseases. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing has the potential to provide useful approaches for human disease therapy. The splicing of introns is carried out through two transesterification reactions catalyzed by the spliceosome, a large RNA/protein complex composed of five snRNAs and over 100 protein factors. The five snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, U6) and associated proteins form snRNPs, which play important roles in intron recognition, splice site definition, and the splicing reaction. U5 snRNP is a core spliceosomal component that contains U5 snRNA and three protein factors (Prp8, Brr2, and Snu114) that form a stable core even after chaotropic salt treatment. U5 snRNA interacts with both exons and is critical for aligning the exons for ligation in the second catalytic reaction. Prp8 lies in the heart of the spliceosome and is hypothesized to help form/stabilize the active site or even contribute functional groups to the catalytic reaction. Brr2 is a DExD/H-box protein responsible for U4/U6 unwinding, an essential step for spliceosomal activation. Snu114 is the only GTPase in the spliceosome and is thought to regulate the activity of Brr2. Crystal structures of several domains of Prp8 and Brr2 are known, but there is no structure of any full-length protein or U5 snRNA. It is not clear how proteins in U5 snRNP interact with each other, with U5 snRNA, or with the spliceosome catalytic core. The goal of this proposal is to determine the structure and function of components of the U5 snRNP, as well as their complexes with other proteins and RNAs (including those at the spliceosome catalytic core), using a combination of cutting edge cryo-electron microscopy, crystallography, biochemistry, and yeast genetics approaches. A thorough understanding of the structure and function of U5 snRNP will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing in general."
"9383076","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The candidate's long term goal is to become an independent investigator at an academic research institution to study the effects of hormones and endocrine disrupting compounds on the development and activity of brain circuits. He has received excellent training in neuroendocrinology, neuroplasticity, and behavioral neuroscience. He now plans to complement this knowledge and technical expertise with training in in vivo analysis of the role of endocrine disruptors on neuronal structural plasticity and brain circuit connectivity using targeted manipulation of gene expression via electroporation, time-lapse 2-photon imaging, neuronal reconstruction and structural analysis, electrophysiology and quantification of thyroid hormone levels.  During this training period the candidate will enroll in courses and seminars to improve his management abilities, communication skills and technical literacy.  By the end of this award, he will have gained the skills and training that will be needed for establishing his own lab. He wil also have the publication record and preliminary data on hand to write a R01 proposal with a high likelihood of funding.         Most of the training during the mentored phase will occur at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) under the supervision of Dr. Hollis Cline. Dr. Cline has taken a multidisciplinary approach to studying molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern the development of the visual system in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, including in vivo time-lapse 2 photon imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings of visual responses, calcium-imaging and behavior. Her laboratory has been at the forefront of developing exciting new techniques to study the factors that regulate circuit development. Her laboratory is located in the Dorris Neuroscience Center, which is an outstanding intellectual environment consisting of 14 faculty members and more than 100 postdocs and other scientists. Some of the candidate's proposed experiments will benefit from training from a co-mentor, Dr. Ardem Patapoutian, a TSRI faculty member with expertise in biophysics of the TRPA1 channels, which the candidate will use to manipulate neuronal activity.  In addition, the candidate will learn techniques to measure thyroid hormone levels in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Denver at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Dr. Denver is a leading expert in endocrine disruption and physiology and will be an invaluable co-mentor to this project.         The goal of this research project is determine the effects of endocrine-disrupting compounds on brain development. Compounds that are used in the production of industrial and consumer products can accumulate in the environment and even be found in human blood and tissue in measurable quantities. There is increasing evidence that some of these compounds can affect hormone metabolism and action, including thyroid hormone, which plays an important role in brain development. Yet little is known about how environmental toxins that disrupt thyroid hormone function affect development of brain circuits.  The candidate will determine the effects of thyroid hormone disrupting compounds on CNS development, using the visual system in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, an ideal experimental system for these studies because the external development of the animal provides easy access to the developing brains for observation and manipulation.  The candidate will treat tadpoles with the active thyroid hormone triiodothyronine, methimazole (a thyroid hormone antagonist), and several thyroid hormone disrupting compounds. I will assess several parameters of brain development, including neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and survival, and the development of neuronal structure and circuit connectivity. In addition, he will develop and characterize the use of microspheres as a local thyroid hormone delivery system and use this system to target particular hormone treatments to the retina or the optic tectum. These experiments will allow him to disambiguate the site of hormone action within the developing brain and to localize the sites of action and effects of thyroid hormone disrupting compounds on brain development. These will be important advances in the fields of environmental toxicology, neuroendocrinology and brain development. Furthermore, these experiments will establish the Xenopus retino-tectal system as an ideal model to screen thyroid hormone disrupting compounds for effects on brain development."
"9174910","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular mechanisms that mediate steatohepatitis, an increasingly prevalent condition in the Western world for which no therapies are available, are poorly understood. Using human genome wide association studies, we recently identified TTC39B (T39), which encodes a tetratricopeptide repeat-domain protein of unknown function, as a novel gene influencing HDL cholesterol levels. We have sought to understand the functions of T39 and its potential significance for human diseases using mouse models. These studies have revealed that T39 deficient mice are protected from development of fatty liver, steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis. T39 appears to be a scaffolding protein that regulates the post-transcriptional degradation of LXR, a transcription factor controlling cholesterol efflux genes and well as genes promoting triglyceride synthesis. In addition to beneficial lipoprotein changes and reduced atherosclerosis, T39 deficiency protects from hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis when mice are challenged with high fat/high cholesterol diets, and the underlying mechanisms of these novel observations will be the main focus of this proposal. We will also explore the basic functions of T39 such as its ability to facilitate ubiquitination and degradation of LXR. Aim 1 will assess the mechanisms of reduced hepatic steatosis in T39-/- mice, Aim2 will determine tissue-specific effects of T39 in liver, spleen and hematopoietic cells; Aim 3 will explore the mechanisms of the post- transcriptional increase in LXR protein in T39-/- hepatocytes. These studies have the potential to uncover new treatments for steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis."
"9173465","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Angioplasty and stenting for peripheral artery disease (PAD) of the femoropopliteal artery segment, consisting of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal artery (PA), carries the highest rate of reconstruction failure primarily because it undergoes large deformations during flexion of the limb. Our preliminary data demonstrate that previously published limb-induced deformations of the SFA and PA are markedly underestimated, and that certain stent designs are not able to accommodate these severe deformations. We propose to precisely quantify the mechanical environments of the SFA and PA in order to determine the optimal patient and lesion- specific stent for the SFA and PA. This will be accomplished through 3 Specific Aims.  In Aim 1 we will determine the 3D bending, torsion and compression of the SFA and PA as a result of limb flexion in human cadavers using our new intra-arterial marker technique, CTA, and image analysis. In Aim 2 we will determine the biaxial mechanical properties of SFA and PA from human tissue donors with PAD, along with the mechanical properties of 5 commonly used self-expanding nitinol PAD stents. In Aim 3 we will use the data on femoropopliteal artery flexions (Aim 1) and SFA, PA and PAD stent mechanical properties (Aim 2), to build a computational model of the stented SFA and PA. This model will then be subjected to limb flexion induced deformations to determine the mechanical stress resulting from the interaction of the stent with the artery. A comparison of each of the 5 stents under identical conditions, including a systematic study of the effects of age, diabetes and lesion calcification on these mechanical stresses, will allow identification of the optimal stet for the SFA and PA in patients with different clinical and lesion characteristics. The capability o our model to predict areas where restenosis will occur in the stented SFA/PA will for the first time be clinically validated in PAD patients by comparing the areas of high stress in the patient-specific models to the areas of restenosis visualized by CTA 6 months after stenting. The ability to rationally select patient and lesion-specific stents for the SFA and PA will produce more durable reconstructions and have an immediate direct translational impact benefiting PAD patients with claudication and critical limb ischemia. Our precise description of the human SFA and PA mechanical environments will greatly advance our knowledge of PAD pathophysiology and will allow the development of a better stent for the SFA and PA. By creating vital, currently unavailable computational model input data and taking the initial steps towards clinical validation, our study will serve as a foundation for larger-scale, more cost-effective in silico comparative effectiveness studies of current and future PAD stents and help advance the new paradigm of patient-specific modeling and medicine."
"9265215","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne virus that is causing explosive outbreaks. While asymptomatic in most healthy adults, ZIKV infection of pregnant women causes severe developmental complications of fetuses, including fetal death, microcephaly and a variety of other neurological complications. No animal model of fetal ZIKV infection is currently available. Because adult rhesus macaques can be infected with Zika virus, including isolates from recent outbreaks, it is important to investigate if ZIKV infection of fetal macaques has similar detrimental effects. The development of a nonhuman primate model of fetal pathogenesis, that affords precise experimental control, is critical to (i) determine the mechanisms of how ZIKV infection affects the developing fetus, including the fetal brain and other parts of the central nervous system, and (ii) to develop and screen intervention strategies, including vaccines and therapeutics. The proposed pilot studies, aimed at demonstrating proof-of-concept, have been designed to test whether ZIKV infection initiated at different times of gestation can recapitulate the spectrum of outcomes described in ZIKV-infected pregnant women, and determine how the timing of ZIKV infection in pregnancy associates with markers of viral replication, viral distribution, immune markers and pathology. The overarching objective of the proposed work is to develop a NHP model of fetal pathogenesis, ultimately allowing scientists to expedite clinical trials with the ultimate goal of curtailing the ZIKV pandemic as quickly as possible."

"9246366","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The receptor tyrosine kinases of the TAM family ? Tyro3, Axl, and Mer ? are essential regulators of infection by enveloped viruses, and Axl and Mer are especially important to arbovirus infection of cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Infection of the CNS by encephalitic arboviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), often has devastating consequences, both acutely and after recovery, and deciphering the molecular mechanisms through which TAM receptors control virus entry, propagation, and clearance is therefore a key objective. Genetic, molecular biologic, cell biologic, and behavioral assays will be used to elucidate these mechanisms. In Aim 1, a set of new conditional mouse mutants and cell-specific Cre drivers will be used to investigate the CNS cell types through which TAM receptors control infection by WNV and two other neurotropic enveloped arboviruses - La Crosse encephalitis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. These studies will elucidate the specific roles played by Axl and Mer in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), microglia, astrocytes, and pericytes in neuroinvasion and CNS pathogenesis by these viruses. In Aim 2, a new mouse model of learning impairment after recovery from CNS infection by WNV will be used to probe the role that Axl and Mer in microglia and astrocytes play in spatial learning and memory after infection. These experiments also will assess the role that cell-specific TAM signaling plays in synapse elimination and neurogenesis subsequent to WNV infection of the brain. In Aim 3, molecular genetics and cell-based signaling assays will be used to elucidate the molecular architecture of TAM receptor-Interferon receptor (IFNAR) interaction, which is crucial to the phenomena of Aims 1 and 2, in BMECs, microglia, macrophages, and dendritic cells. These studies will identify the signaling pathways activated by cooperative TAM receptor/INFAR signaling in these cells, and assess the ability of these interacting receptor systems to reorganize actin cytoskeletons. Together, the experiments of this proposal will guide the formulation of novel strategies for inhibiting virus entry into the CNS, attenuating virus infection of neural cells, and promoting the repair and recovery of infected neural tissues."
"9236893","Summary The goal of the proposed research is to characterize structures and interactions of receptors residing in plasma membranes, in particular those of immune cells. Membrane bound receptors play important roles in cells but their structures and molecular functions have been difficult to reveal. Importantly, the T-cell plasma membrane contains the T-cell receptor of antigens and the associated CD3 components crucial for signaling. Furthermore, the membrane contains the CD4/8, CCR5 and CXCR4, co-receptors of HIV. There are many other T-cell transmembrane proteins with numerous activities, such as CD2, CD45 or Ca2+ channels. For a number of these systems structures of extracellular or intracellular portions have been characterized in various groups including ours. However, interactions of transmembrane segments have been difficult to access on a structural level due to the complexity of handling membranes. Exceptions include the G-protein coupled receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, or the ? homodimer of the TCR and a model of the TCR transmembrane arrangement based on biochemical experiments and model building. Structures and functional aspects of complexes of T-cell membrane proteins with other proteins residing in other membranes are even more difficult to study but will be tackled here. We recently made a break through designing covalently circularized nanodiscs (cNDs) of variable size, which allows assembly of stable membrane protein complexes in a well defined near-native environment and dramatically facilitates structural studies of integral membrane proteins. Moreover, this approach provides access to structural studies of proteins residing in different membranes. We show preliminary data from non-circularized and circularized nanodisc since the latter was established only recently. It is now fully available and will be applied to the systems described. We will apply this technology in two specific aims:  Aim 1. Characterize the interaction of viral particles with their receptors in circularized nanodiscs. As a proof of concept we will use EM methods to reveal detail of poliovirus interaction with its receptor CD155 in cNDs. This approach will be extended for imaging the interaction of HIV pseudovirus and/or gp160 with its co-receptors and will reveal details of viral engagement and pore formation.  Aim 2: Determine the structure of the TCR/CD3 complex in cNDs and characterize the interaction with pMHC and CD8. Receptors residing in different nanodiscs will be linked with DNA handles to allow formation of cND sandwiches that mimic interactions of receptors from different cells."
"9352656","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a great need to develop new vaccination approaches for influenza. The current strategy based on waiting to identify each seasons new strains and then building a matching vaccine based mostly on egg production is not ideal. Because of this requirement to match strains and the limits on egg based production, the US is forced to under vaccinate our population due to limitations in supply and the impossible task of vaccinating the entire US population each year. This application proposes a new vaccine approach that if successful can result in a transformative shift in the development of seasonal influenza vaccines. We propose to develop a synthetic collection of HAs encoding a focused set of consensus H1, H3 & HB immunogens as a cocktail that together produce broad HI and uNeutralization against seasonal and pandemic H1, H3 and HB viruses. We use an improved DNA technology which eliminates virus culture entirely. We have assembled an outstanding team of investigators who together have helped to produce the technology and the advances that underpin this important application. There are four specific aims that make up this application.    Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that we can create a synthetic H1HA immunogen which generates broad HI antibody responses against all four H1 pandemic strains as well against the last 20 years seasonal H1 viruses in mice and ferret models.    Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that we can create a synthetic H3HA as well as HBHA which will each generate broad HI responses against seasonal variants of H3 and HB viruses in mice and ferret models.    Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that we can develop a combination immunization strategy for H1, H3 and HB immunogens resulting in broad HI activity at protective levels (greater than 1/40 HI titers in an indicator animal species - Ferrets). Studies in ferrets will include challenge with pandemic as well as seasonal strains. We will confirm the immune potency of this combination vaccine in the Rhesus Macaque model which will provide further evidence of the immune potency of the optimized enhanced delivery DNA platform.    Aim 4: To test the hypothesis that we can safely induce, using a well tolerated platform, protective HI levels in humans in a pilot safety and immunogenicity study using the combination H1, H3, HB universal DNA vaccine when delivered to healthy volunteers. Together these aims represent transformational shifts for the development of vaccines to influenza as well as for the DNA vaccine field as a whole."

Factors explored as predictors of academic and career success include personal and contextual inputs, learning experiences, self-efficacy expectations, and outcome expectations as predictors of interest in, goals set, and actions taken to achieve behavioral and biomedical research careers. The project also aims to examine differences in important factors predicting success in academic perseverance and career attainment for American Indian behavioral and biomedical science majors versus American Indian non-science majors. Finally, the project aims to examine pathways by which American Indian students enter a research-intensive institution of higher educations. These efforts are intended to provide substantial information upon which interventions can be based, to increase the participation and perseverance of American Indian students in education and job-seeking within biomedical and behavioral science research."
"9153002","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involve inappropriate inhibitory control over fear after exposure to life-threatening traumatic experiences showing enhanced fear generalization and inability to extinguish acquired fear. Currently available medications for PTSD provide limited relief and there is a need for developing more effective treatments for this disorder. Understanding the neural circuitry involved in fear regulation could help develop more effective treatments for this disorder. The amygdala, with its sub-divisions that include the basolateral (BLA) and central nuclei (CeA), is a crucial part of the fear circuitry. Although BLA is known to be important for fer acquisition and CeA for fear expression, the exact mechanisms through which BLA modulates CeA functions is unclear. A GPCR signaling cascade system, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) and its receptor PAC1 have been shown to modulate fear and is expressed in the neural circuitry of fear and have also been related to PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity. Our findings demonstrate that PACAP neurons in the BLA innervate a cluster of cells known as the intercalated cells (ICCs) that lie at the interface of BLA and CeA, a novel microcircuit that could be important for modulation of fear. ICCs receive excitatory projections from the BLA, send inhibitory projections to the CeA, express PAC1 receptors, and have been shown to be important for extinguishing fear behaviors. Given the putative role of the PACAP/PAC1 system and the ICCs in the fear circuitry and their roles in regulating fear, this proposal seeks to elucidate the role of PACAP within the BLA acting via the PAC1-containing neurons in the ICCs that in turn project to CeA in modulation fear expression, generalization and extinction. This proposal will test this hypothesis by systematically manipulating several aspects of the microcircuit involving the BLA (PACAP)-ICCs (PAC1)-CeA using stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL), a model designed in our lab to specifically test the effects of traumatic experiences on fear behaviors using fear conditioning procedures. The studies will test 1) how loss of function of PAC1 receptors from the ICCs, and 2) how exciting inhibitory signaling in the ICCs alters SEFL expression, generalization and extinction. The findings from the studies in this proposal could unravel novel information about BLA-ICCs-CeA microcircuit as these pathways involving the PACAP/PAC1 system has not been studied in fear-related behaviors. Importantly, these results may be clinically relevant as abnormalities in any part of this circuitry could contribute to the pathology observed in disorders like PTSD, allowing development of targeted therapies."
"9092446","?

The specific goal is to elucidate the contribution of a particular transcription factor recently found to have a novel effect on tissue growth. This protein delays the growth of cells with alterations in the protein synthetic machinery and enables their elimination from tissues. Genetic epistasis experiments using mutant fruit flies will be employed to define the contribution of a family of related bZIP transcription factors to the growth delay an competitive loss of cells, in part employing effects on eye size as an assay. The genome-wide contribution of selected bZIP transcription factors to gene transcription will be determined using high- throughput sequencing methods both in normal tissues and in tissues with alterations in protein synthetic machinery, with the goal of understanding the regulatory processes that control the rate of growth and the competition between cells that occurs in chimeras and perhaps in normal or cancerous tissues."
"9172241","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes remains a major risk factor for the development of both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, despite improvements in clinical treatments, our knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of diabetes-associated CVD is poorly understood. As with the majority of cardiovascular physiology, pathologic cardiovascular events exhibit a time-of-day-dependence, with regards to both onset and impact on disease progression and we have shown that the cardiomyocyte circadian clock directly influences the manner with which the heart responds to specific stressors. Importantly, we have shown that diabetes induces a phase shift in the cardiomyocyte circadian clock. Thus dysynchrony of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock may be an important and previously unrecognized contributor to the etiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Protein O-GlcNAcylation, a metabolically regulated post-translational modification that rapidly influences protein function, is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of both cardiac physiology and pathology including the adverse effects of diabetes. We recently reported that the cardiomyocyte circadian clock directly influences cardiac O-GlcNAc levels, that at least two circadian clock components are O-GlcNAc modified, and those acute increases in O-GlcNAc levels phase shifts the clock similarly to that seen in the heart during diabetes. We have also observed increased protein synthesis in the heart during the inactive phase, a time when protein O-GlcNAcylation is low. This has led us to postulate that protein O- GlcNAcylation may be a key mechanism by which the cardiomyocyte circadian clock temporally coordinates repair/replacement of damaged proteins in the heart. Collectively, these observations support the overall hypothesis of this proposal that dysregulation of protein O-GlcNAcylation is a critical factor contributing to diabetes-induced alterations of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock, and that misalignment of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock represents a key mechanism underlying diabetes-related cardiac dysfunction. To test this hypothesis we will pursue 3 specific aims: 1) Determine the molecular underpinnings linking the cardiomyocyte circadian clock with protein O-GlcNAcylation, and identify how this relationship is altered during diabetes; 2) Determine the role of O-GlcNAcylation in circadian clock mediated protein turnover, and elucidate how this relationship is modified during diabetes; 3) Determine whether re-alignment of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock during diabetes attenuates cardiomyopathy development. Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to new fundamental insights regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of aberrant circadian function in the development of diabetes-related cardiac disease and will help identify new approaches for reducing the risk of CVD in diabetic patients."
"9171922","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Specific Aims: The goal of this study is to collect formative data that will provide a foundation for future interventions to improve patient engagement in antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs in Mali through targeted improvements in provider communication skills. Specifically, the study aims to (1) examine the nature and content of patient-provider communication (PPC) and how it influences patient engagement in ART programs and (2) measure patient preferences toward different styles of PPC. Significance: As access to ART in sub-Saharan Africa expands, optimizing patient engagement in ART programs becomes increasingly important. Mali's 12-month retention rate of ART patients is one of the lowest in the region at 64%. Recently, there has been growing attention to the role of PPC in patient retention and adherence in ART programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Positive effects of implementing pre- service PPC trainings have been documented in medical and nursing schools in high-income countries, yet similar trainings in sub-Saharan Africa are limited or non-existent. Integrating PPC training interventions in medical and nursing curricula is  a potentially effective and sustainable opportunity to improve patient engagement in ART programs. Formative research for such efforts is needed. Approach: This study will build of the applicant's previous experience in Mali and partnership with the University of Bamako. It will be based at three major clinical ART sites. This mixed method study with a foundation in patient-centered care theory. Aim 1 will be achieved with qualitative interviews and focus groups with people living with HIV and ART clinical providers. This qualitative data will be analyzed with thematic coding and conversation analysis. Aim 2 will be achieved through a factorial survey that will test ART patient reactions to systematic variations of communication styles in video vignettes. Multiple regression analyses will be used to analyze the data. Fellowship Information: This study will serve as the doctoral dissertation for Ms. Emily Hurley, a current PhD student in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Ms. Hurley has chosen one primary sponsor and three co-sponsors who have complementary expertise in the methods and topics of this project. The training plan is designed with research, coursework and teaching opportunities to help Ms. Hurley achieve her long-term goal of becoming a leading researcher in the social, cultural, and behavioral aspects of primary health care and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa."

"9198044","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the largest single contributor to global mortality and appears to dominate mortality trends in the future. New evidence is emerging that inflammation attributable to monocytes/macrophages contributes to the development of CVD. Traditional CVD risk factors, such as insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, have been associated with modification of epigenetic markers and signatures of epigenetic dysregulation can be detected in peripheral blood samples. Monocytes (CD14+CD16+) residing in peripheral blood from dialysis patients predicted cardiovascular disease incidence, implicating this cell type in disease pathology. Indeed, an increased percentage of CD14+CD16+ monocytes were observed in the blood of patients with coronary heart disease. An increased percentage of these monocytes were also observed in the blood of HIV+ patients. Data from our collaborators indicate that monocytes from persons with HIV infection are hyper-responsive to oxidized LDL or LPS, producing high levels of IL-1?, IL6 and IL8. Thus, HIV-mediated immune activation in monocytes may play a role in the development of CVD. In support of this link, our preliminary data demonstrate that monocytes from HIV+ individuals, who have an elevated risk for CVD, also exhibit hyper-responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Interestingly, we observed that the level of a specific epigenetic mark, DNA methylation, at the promoter region of a pro- inflammatory gene in part explained the varying degree to which monocytes from individuals with clinically determined low or high risk for CVD responded to inflammatory stimuli. The mechanistic link between monocyte inflammation and CVD risk may be fundamental, but more easily detectable in individuals with heightened inflammatory response, such as those infected with HIV. This proposal will therefore test the hypothesis that a heightened inflammatory response elicited by monocytes confers an increased risk to CVD due to epigenetic dysregulation of environmentally labile loci, including at pro-inflammatory genes. This may be independent of HIV infection status. To address this hypothesis, we aim to evaluate monocyte inflammatory response in banked blood specimens from HIV-infected and matched uninfected individuals selected based on clinical parameters of CVD risk, and characterize, compare, and integrate this data with genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles from these monocytes. Collectively, this unique clinical, immunological, and epigenomic database will allow us to identify novel biomarkers associated with CVD risk that may enable improved risk stratification strategies for cardiovascular disease.
