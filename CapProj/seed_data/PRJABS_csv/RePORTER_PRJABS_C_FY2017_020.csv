"9238972","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The transition to genomically driven oncology has begun, catalyzed in part by efforts to rationally design effective therapies targeting the specific molecular aberrations on which individual tumors depend. This has led, inexorably, to the prospective clinical sequencing of patients with active disease to guide their cancer care. Nevertheless, a fundamental gap remains. The shift toward larger panel and whole exome sequencing has led to the identification of increasing numbers of somatic mutations in even presumed actionable cancer genes, the vast majority of which are in the so-called long right tail and lack biological or clinical validation. This significantly impairs our ability to use findings generated by prospective profiling to guide patient care. We have recently shown that such long-tail driver mutations can be the genetic basis of extraordinary responses to systemic cancer therapy. We went on to show that a systematic survey utilizing population-scale cancer genome data coupled to computational methodologies reveals similar long-tail drivers of both biological and therapeutic significance. These findings underscore the importance of long-tail driver mutations in cancer, but without a systematic approach for rapidly prioritizing and functionally and clinically validating these somatic mutations, the gap in our understanding of the clinically actionable genome will widen. We propose to overcome this urgent clinical challenge by establishing a robust and sophisticated framework for elucidating novel driver mutations in the long tail. We will first establish a comprehensive computational framework that identifies and prioritizes long-tail driver mutations that leverages not only population-scale data but integrates orthogonal measures of selection. We will then apply these methods to a cohort of greater than 50,000 prospectively sequenced active cancer patients at our Center, all possessing detailed clinical, outcome, and treatment response data, results from which can lead to the enrollment of patients on genotype-directed clinical trials. Finally, we will perform functional studies of novel long-tail driver mutations revealed by these analyses in genes for which there is an open basket study at our institution, thereby establishing a co-clinical framework by which laboratory functional validation can be paired with patient treatment response. Together, these studies seek to establish a computational-experimental framework for identifying functional mutations in the long tail that expand the treatment options for molecularly defined populations of cancer patients."

Equipment: In 2015, we acquired an Essen BioScience IncuCyte, which offers real time imaging of living cells to quantitate cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, chemotaxis and gene expression in an automated, high throughput manner. This instrument offers new technical advantages that were not previously available to our investigators. Services: The PMTSR has assembled a collection of over 200 authenticated human cancer cell lines, which are available to UCCC members at a reduced price relative to commercial services, to encourage the responsible use of established cell lines in biomedical research. Investigators can use the PMTSR to prepare large volumes (0.5 to 10 liters) of cells for in vitro and in vivo biological studies. For over 25 years, the PMTSR has produced hybridomas and purified monoclonal antibodies for use in basic and preclinical studies. Recombinant proteins are produced using baculovirus expression systems or in mammalian (293) cells. Consultation and Education: The PMTSR has advocated for the use of authenticated cell lines in cancer research by providing seminars outlining the impact of contaminated/misidentified cell lines upon biomedical research and by providing information on cell authentication services to UCCC members. A number of seminars have been offered regarding the use and technical abilities of the IncuCyte Bioimaging system. The PMTSR director and staff routinely consult with UCCC members on projects involving offered services and technologies. Management: The PMTSR is a UCCC SR managed by the UCCC and is overseen by the Associate Director for Basic Research. CCSG funding represents 31% of the annual operating budget. The remaining 69% support is from user fees. Use of Services: Since July 2011, 157 investigators have used the PMTSR services. Fifty- seven percent of users were UCCC members, representing all UCCC Programs and resulting in 65 peer- reviewed publications. Future Directions: 1) Expand our collection of authenticated cancer cell lines and continue to make them available to UCCC members at reduced prices as a means to ensure compliance with new NIH and journal policies. 2) Collaborate with Structural Biology Shared Resource (SBSR) to develop service offering on-demand purification of recombinant proteins. 3) Support the expanded use of the IncuCyte in cancer research. 4) Contribute to international efforts to develop platforms for murine cell line authentication and when available, provide these authenticated lines to UCCC members."
"9207573","PLANNING AND EVALUATION (Core-453) ABSTRACT Overview: The University of Colorado Cancer Center's (UCCC) Planning and Evaluation (P&E) activities, under the leadership of Dan Theodorescu MD PhD, are focused on the comprehensive strategic review of the UCCC and its Research Programs, Shared Resources (SRs), Clinical Research, and associated operations to ensure the optimization of UCCC's activities and the recognition and pursuit of particular opportunities. The P&E component is conducted in a multi-faceted approach that includes the review and assessment by the External Advisory Board (EAB), several key internal advisory committees, and the Senior Leadership of the UCCC. These activities are augmented by specific ad hoc individual and group external reviewers along with key input from UCCC members through UCCC organizational structures. Following the NCI Site Visit of the UCCC in June 2011 and receipt of the detailed CCSG review, UCCC Senior Leadership and Research Program Leaders initiated a series of meetings to identify key areas for development and recruitment in addition to those strategic directions outlined in the Director's Overview. Key areas were identified as recruitment of an Associate Director for Population Sciences Research, the reconstruction of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) which had been disapproved and implementation of better educational opportunities and infrastructure (new clinical trial management system (CTMS)) in support of clinical investigation. The UCCC External Advisory Board (EAB) played a critical role in this strategic planning and evaluation activities through annual visits and written feedback. Accomplishments: Since 2011 such P&E activities have led to the successful accomplishments of many of the strategic directions outlined in the Director's Overview in addition to the key areas outlined above. In the next funding period, the P&E component proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Creation of appropriate external and internal advisory bodies to ensure strategic development, expert guidance, and rigorous review of UCCC research programs and activities; and 2) Development of processes for continuous review and improvement of UCCC programs to ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and concordance with UCCC strategic initiatives."
"9292026","Abstract: Hantaviruses, members of the Bunyaviridae family are enveloped negative strand RNA viruses and category A pathogens that are transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have evolved a unique translation mechanism for the preferential translation of their mRNAs. This preferential translation is carried out by hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) which specifically binds to the mRNA 5' cap and ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), a structural component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. In addition, a trimeric N-protein molecule specifically binds to a highly conserved triplet repeat sequence (UAGUAGUAG) of the viral mRNA 5' UTR. Our results suggest that N-protein associated ribosomes are selectively loaded on viral mRNA 5' UTR to boost the translation of viral transcripts in the host cell cytoplasm where cellular transcripts are competing for the same translation machinery. Interestingly, our preliminary data shows that N-protein mediated translation strategy also favors the translation of certain host cell factors by an unknown mechanism. Using multifaceted experimental avenues we will determine the mechanism for the selective translation of certain host cell mRNAs by N-protein mediated translation strategy. We will determine whether preferential translation of host cell factors plays a role in virus replication. As antiviral response, host cells transiently shutdown the host translation machinery to create roadblocks for the synthesis of viral proteins. This antiviral response is triggered by the activation of protein kinase R (PKR), which phosphorylates its downstream target eIF2?, causing translational shutdown. Our preliminary results show that N-protein inhibits PKR activation in virus-infected cells to ensure continuous synthesis of viral proteins during the course of infection. We will test the hypothesis that N-protein requires the assistance from endogenous host cell factors to inhibit PKR antiviral response. These studies will reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention of hantavirus disease."
"9389784","Project Summary The genetic basis of complex traits, especially behavioral traits, is often difficult to dissect because the effects of genes often depend on the genetic background in which they occur. Additionally, genes are typically involved in multiple phenotypes (they are pleiotropic) making the context of where/when they are expressed important to understanding their impacts on phenotype. Speciation offers an opportunity to study complex traits because when new lineages diverge there is strong selection for female behavior so that females reject males of the ?wrong? lineage. This strong selection results in genetic changes that can be identified and then the impacts of these changes can be dissected. One such case occurs in ?races? of Drosophila melanogaster. There is strong reproductive isolation between populations that are from the ancestral range (Southern Africa) and cosmopolitan populations. Females from the ancestral range reject cosmopolitan males. One candidate gene for this behavior, desat2, has been identified. Alleles of African D. melanogaster are pleiotropic; they confer female preference and contribute to differences in female pheromones (cuticular hydrocarbons). It remains unknown how much variation in female preference is controlled by desat2, and which mechanisms affect female behavior. I will study how desat2 influences female mating behavior by first examining how genetic background interacts with different desat2 alleles to affect female behavior. I will engineer strains that all share a common desat2 allele but differ in their genetic background. This will allow me to determine how genetic background alters the impact of desat2 on female behavior (Aim1). I will then look at the effects of desat2 on female specific pheromones (cuticular hydrocarbons) and expression patterns of desat2. To look at the role of female cuticular hydrocarbons I will engineer flies that express desat2 but do not produce female cuticular hydrocarbons. I can then add precise amounts of cuticular hydrocarbons back to the flies and ask how they affect behavior (Aim2). Lastly, I will assay tissue specific expression of desat2 in neuronal tissue using quantitative PCR and high-resolution microscopy. Expression in specific neuronal tissue will suggest that desat2 contributes to female perception of CHCs (Aim3). The outcomes of this research will provide insight into how pleiotropic traits and genetic background contribute to complex behavioral phenotypes."
"9332915","Individual TCR ? and ? genes are rearranged and expressed in a series of overlapping waves during murine development with cells bearing specific TCR preferentially or exclusively migrating from the thymus to specific epithelial and lymphoid sites. ?? T cells that rearrange their TCR during early fetal development express highly restricted or invariant TCR. The first TCR-bearing cells migrate from the developing thymus to the skin where they take up residence in the epidermis as Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC). Similarly, subsequent waves of ?? TCR expressing thymocytes migrate to other epithelial tissues. The presence of these ?? T cell populations with restricted TCR use in distinct epithelial locations supports recognition of unique, tissue- specific antigens and specialized functions for these cells. However, roles for TCR signals in development and ligands for these invariant ?? TCRs are currently poorly understood. We hypothesize that novel endogenous V?3V?1 TCR ligands are expressed in the embryonic thymus and deliver key signals for DETC precursor development and that expression of these ligands is upregulated on skin epithelial cells following stress and functions to deliver activation signals to DETC following injury or stress. We have developed tools for detection of V?3V?1 TCR ligands and found expression on embryonic, but not adult, thymic epithelial cells. Based upon these results, we are now in a position to identify and characterize this fetal TCR ligand and determine its role in DETC precursor development and activation of DETC function."
"9386446","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the scale of the HIV epidemic remains large, it has entered a promising new phase, marked by unprecedented progress and opportunities. In view of the need to rigorously test interventions to improve the uptake, implementation, and translation of recent scientific findings into standard of care (the know-do gap), as well as to evaluate the impact of bringing such interventions to scale, we propose to launch a new research training program focused on Global HIV Implementation Science. Implementation science is the scientific study of methods to promote integration of research findings and evidence-based interventions into health care policy and practice, thus improving the quality and effectiveness of health services. A key element of translational research, implementation science encompasses a broad range of skills, including epidemiology, biostatistics, health economics, decision science, and sociology. The goal of the proposed Training Program is to prepare well qualified individuals for careers as independently-funded researchers and for leadership in global HIV implementation research. We have assembled an outstanding group of diverse faculty from multiple schools, departments, and centers at Columbia University and abroad who have distinguished themselves in mentorship and are leading cutting edge implementation research addressing HIV prevention among key populations, linkage to and retention in care, prevention of mother to child transmission, and TB/HIV integration. The Training Program will encompass streamlined coursework based on an individualized training plan; weekly faculty-trainee seminars; tailored mentorship; research experience in a variety of domestic and international field settings; presentations; manuscript and grant preparation; research seminars and colloquia; and instruction in the responsible conduct of research. The Training Program will also include rigorous evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of the Training Program, to ensure that trainees achieve the competencies and skills necessary for success as future leaders in HIV implementation science research.  The five-year program aims to support seven (three predoctoral and four postdoctoral) trainees at any one time. Among the postdoctoral trainees, a mix of trainees with PhD, DrPH, and MD degrees will be sought. Predoctoral trainees will be required to pursue a doctoral degree in Epidemiology. The period of support will be three years for predoctoral candidates and two years for postdoctoral candidates. With stellar faculty, a unique training environment, and unparalleled research opportunities in domestic and international field settings, we are well-poised to lead this novel effort and nurture new investigators trained in multidimensional, interdisciplinary approaches to advance scientific knowledge and demonstrate the impact of interventions."
"9207585","CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT (Core-176) ABSTRACT Overview: The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) provides central management and oversight functions for coordinating, facilitating and reporting on clinical and population sciences trials across the UCCC consortium which serve our catchment area of the State of Colorado. The CPDM is led by Thomas Flaig MD, Associate Director for Clinical Research and supported by Colleen Kellackey RN, Consortium Clinical Research Director. The UCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) was approved by the NCI in October, 2014. The Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) provides a robust structure for auditing clinical trials across the consortium. DSMC's oversight is prioritized for high-risk Phase I and Phase II protocols. Accomplishments: Since 2011, the CPDM substantially improved clinical research support as follows: 1) CPDM led an institutional- wide effort to select and implement the OnCore® commercial clinical trial management system (CTMS) integrated with the UCD clinical data repository (Health Data Compass). OnCore was activated July 2015; 2) CPDM leadership implemented an acuity tool to right-size the clinical research staff for the adult Cancer Clinical Trials Office (CCTO); 3) CPDM increased its support for institutional trials by adding staff; and the 4) the DSMC auditing capacity was increased by 2 auditors. Quality Control and Training: An education coordinator position was added to the CPDM. In addition to outlining and coordinating training and orientation for data managers, nurses and new faculty, the coordinator works closely with the DSMC to review trends from internal and external audits. Based on these findings, the coordinator works with the CPDM leadership to develop focused educational outreach to clinical investigators and recommends policy updates to improve the quality and compliance of clinical research. Trials and Catchment Area Demographics: The CPDM oversees an annual average of 382 clinical research studies. In FY2015 1,499 patients were accrued to intervention studies and 706 were accrued to intervention-treatment studies representing 18% of the analytic cases reported by UCH, CHCO and the VA. Patients accrued to clinical trials come from 61 of 64 Colorado counties. Based on data from 2015: 1) Although approximately half the cancer population is female, 58% of the accrued patients were female, representing a substantial increase from 2012 (49%) and 2) 3% and 5% of patient accruals were African American and Hispanic, respectively. UCCC continues to enroll women and African Americans in rates that are consistent with the cancer incidence in these specific populations and has a plan to increase Hispanic enrollment to at least 10%, consistent with the cancer incidence in the population. Taken together, these data demonstrate substantial progress in the CPDM and further demonstrate the UCCC's commitment and success in providing safe and equitable clinical investigative opportunities to Colorado's cancer patients."

"9259397","Project Summary  Vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation (VCTA), a clinical reality since 1998, still faces  many challenges yet to be addressed with basic and translational research. As the number of patients  who have undergone VCTA grows, so does our understanding of the unique immunologic demands of  composite grafts and their propensity toward rejection. Acute rejection is extremely common in clinical  VCTA, with a reported incidence of 85% in hand and 54.5% in face transplants, requiring steroids and  increases  in  immunosuppression  to  salvage  the  grafts  (1).  The  experience  with  chronic  rejection  is  growing, but it remains a poorly described entity, and still less is known regarding potential interventions  (4).  An  emerging  interest  in  cellular  therapies  to  prevent  and  fight  allograft  rejection  has  led  to  the  exploration of T-­regulatory cells (T-­regs) as a method to modulate the immune response toward a more  tolerogenic state (7). T-­regs have been demonstrated to be instrumental in long-­term graft survival, and  they attenuate the long-­term sequelae seen in cases of chronic rejection, including tissue fibrosis and  intimal  hyperplasia  (8,11-­15).  Additionally,  an  exciting  new  cellular  technology,  chimeric  antigen  receptor (CAR) T-­regs, could allow for efficient, targeted therapy for VCTA rejection. By administering  these cells to VCTA recipients, rejection could be prevented or possibly reversed.    This  study  employs  a  murine  hindlimb  transplant  model  with  two  specific  aims.  First,  transplanted,  immunosuppressed  mice  will  be  serially  biopsied  to  study  the  kinetics  as  well  as  the  cellular aspects of VCTA rejection. Biopsies will examine both the architecture of the tissues as well as  the makeup of graft cellular infiltrates. Mice will also be observed clinically for signs of acute and chronic  rejection.  Second,  transplanted  mice  with  rejection  will  be  treated  with  engineered  CAR  T-­regs  as  salvage therapy. We hypothesize that CAR T-­reg infusion will halt or even reverse tissue and cellular  changes seen in allograft rejection.    This  project  seeks  to  elucidate  what  is  known  about  the  dynamics  and  cellular  processes  of  rejection  in  VCTA,  especially  with  respect  to  the  role  of  T-­regs,  as  well  as  apply  a  targeted  cellular  intervention  for  salvage  of  rejected  grafts.  CAR  T-­regs  have  shown  clinical  promise  in  the  field  of  oncology, and if they are found to be successful in an animal model, they could feasibly be translated  to  the  treatment  of  rejection  in  human  hand  or  face  transplants  (17).  Such  an  advance  can  provide  clinicians with a powerful tool for treating composite allografts threatened by rejection, as well as make  strides toward achieving the ultimate goal of tolerance without the life-­long use of immunosuppressive  drugs.   "
"9345535","Project Summary  The current standard of care for peanut allergy is strict avoidance of peanuts. Due to the contamination of various food items with peanut protein allergens, complete avoidance is difficult to achieve and reduces the quality of life in allergic individuals for fear of accidental ingestion. Upon accidental exposure, allergic individuals must quickly self-administer or receive epinephrine injections and antihistamines to prevent the symptoms associated with the onset of an allergic reaction. To treat peanut allergies, a more recent strategy being tested is allergen-specific immunotherapy which focuses on preventing the development of allergic symptoms by altering the pathologic immune response to non-pathogenic antigens and inducing clinical desensitization which is defined as an increase in the threshold of ingested allergen needed to cause allergic symptoms. Clinical trials investigating long-term oral and sublingual delivery of escalating low doses of peanut proteins as a form of allergen-specific immunotherapy have been conducted and achieved some success at inducing clinical peanut desensitization in peanut-allergic individuals. The effectiveness of oral immunotherapy has been demonstrated by the ability of peanut-allergic patients treated with active oral immunotherapy to tolerate 5,000 mg of peanuts whereas placebo treated patients were only able to tolerate 280 mg of peanuts. However, the daily administration schedule and duration of treatment (>1 year) as well as the occurrence of mild adverse effects such as itching and sneezing and, on rare occasions, severe respiratory reactions, are some of the shortcomings of current peanut-specific mucosal immunotherapy. In addition, although desensitization can be achieved by mucosal immunotherapy, long-term tolerance has yet to be demonstrated as half of the patients who are successfully desensitized regain sensitization after 4 weeks of allergen withdrawal. In summary, the length of time required to achieve clinical desensitization, the potential of experiencing adverse effects associated with peanut-specific mucosal immunotherapy and the short duration of the desensitization of the immune response profile, while providing evidence that allergen-specific immunotherapy can work, suggests that there is still room for improvement by the implementation of novel therapies that reduce the time to desensitization and the possibility of adverse reactions.  One strategy for improving current peanut immunotherapy protocols would be to design an immunotherapy formulation that rapidly induces long-lasting peanut-specific Th1 and T regulatory responses while minimizing adverse effects in a hypersensitive host. Sensitization to peanut allergens occurs by the induction of peanut-specific T helper (Th) type 2 cells that secrete Interleukin (IL) -4, -5 and -13 to support B cell production of peanut-specific IgE that binds mast cells (MC) and basophils. The major peanut allergen proteins are Ara h 1, 2, 3 and 6. It is estimated that 95% of peanut allergic individuals have IgE specific for Ara h 1, 2 and 6 and 45% of peanut hypersensitive people have Ara h 3-specific IgE. Exposure to peanut in allergic hosts crosslinks surface IgE on mast cells and basophils inducing their degranulation and secretion of inflammatory mediators that produce allergy symptoms. A recent publication described the ability of injection immunotherapy with peanut extract (PN) adjuvanted with the Toll-like Receptor (TLR)-9 agonist, CpG, to reduce allergic disease severity in mice. Since injection therapy is impractical due to the incidence of severe adverse reactions, mucosal delivery of immunotherapy formulations would be much more acceptable for clinical development. The Staats laboratory at Duke University has recently developed a mouse model of nasal immunotherapy against peanut allergies and shown that a combination of PN adjuvanted with CpG in this mucosal immunization model facilitated a reduction in the severity of peanut-induced anaphylaxis in hypersensitive mice in a manner that is superior to therapy with PN alone.  In this SBIR Phase I application, we propose to demonstrate that VesiVax® liposome formulations containing immunostimulatory adjuvant molecules that have been shown to stimulate cellular immune responses can be used to re-direct the response of the immune system to an allergen into a non-allergic response profile. We will focus on peanut allergens to demonstrate the proof of concept that VesiVax® liposomes can facilitate the switching of the immune response to a non-allergenic response pattern. We will collaborate with Professor Staats? laboratory to conduct these studies."
"9408767","ABSTRACT Hepatitis C virus entry and egress are unusually complex, involving many host cofactors and distinctive trafficking processes. Entry factors include the basolateral membrane proteins CD81 and SRB1, the tight junction proteins CLDN and OCLN, and a requirement for EGFR signaling. The distinct subcellular localization of HCV receptors has led to proposals that HCV either (i) traffics to the tight junction during entry, or (ii) disrupts tight junctions to gain access to CLDN and OCLN. We have developed single particle imaging of HCV entry into polarized three-dimensional Huh-7.5 organoids to answer this question. The organoids perform basic liver functions and form the appropriate in vivo polarized, hepatocyte architecture. Using this system, we have defined the steps of HCV entry. HCV virions first localize with ?early receptors? (CD81, SR-B1, and EGFR) at the basolateral membrane and then traffic to the tight junction in association with actin filaments. Surprisingly (and in contrast to current models of HCV entry), EGFR signaling is not required for trafficking to the tight junction. In the presence of EGFR inhibitors, HCV virions remain localized at the tight junction in association with ?late receptors? CLDN and OCLN and fail to recruit clathrin to the HCV/receptor complex. Interestingly, EGFR is selectively activated at the tight junction. We propose a model wherein HCV association with early receptors activates a CD81- or SRB1-dependent migration to the tight junction. EGFR, which is associated with the HCV receptor complex becomes activated at the tight junction via an interaction with CLDN and/or OCLN, which then recruits the clathrin endocytic machinery for virion internalization. We will test this model in Aims 1 and 2.  Our previous study of HCV egress combined an RNA interference (RNAi) screen with live cell imaging of HCV capsid trafficking to discover that extra-cellular HCV is released from the hepatocyte via the secretory pathway. Increasing evidence indicates that a secondary pathway of HCV release, cell-cell spread, is also important. Little is known about this pathway of HCV release, except for its receptor requirements. We have developed the hepatic organoid system described above, in addition to a polarized system using HepG2 cells engineered to express the HCV cofactors CD81 and miR-122 plus a fluorescent reporter to detect infection. In Aim 3, we will use these polarized cell systems to define the pathways of HCV cell-cell spread."
"9034409","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol misuse and smoking constitute two of the three leading preventable causes of death in the United States. Reluctance to treat tobacco dependence among those with AUD is misguided as recent research suggests smoking cessation treatment can be effective, does not increase risk of relapse to alcohol, and may even improve rates of sobriety. There is strong evidence for the short-term efficacy for alcohol misuse and smoking of contingency management (CM). It is an intensive behavioral therapy that provides incentives (vouchers, money) to individuals misusing substances contingent upon objective evidence from drug use. Implementation of CM has been limited because of the need to verify abstinence multiple times daily using clinic based monitoring. Our group recently developed a smart-phone application which allows a patient to video themselves several times daily while using a small CO monitor and to transmit the data to a secure server which has made the use of CM for outpatient smoking cessation portable and feasible. Our mobile CM (mCM) approach paired with cognitive-behavioral counseling and pharmacological smoking cessation aids has been effective in reducing smoking. Thus, the purpose of this project is to develop and pilot-test a combined alcohol and smoking mCM intervention. Our long term goal is to develop mCM procedures that will be used as part of a multi-component intervention to concurrently and effectively treat both alcohol misuse and smoking. As part of this project, we will develop a multi-component telehealth alcohol and smoking mCM intervention. It will include mCM, cognitive-behavioral phone counseling, and standard smoking cessation pharmacotherapy. Three cohorts will provide data. The first cohort (n = 5) will yield primarily qualitative data from participants and therapists, which will be utilized to modify the treatment components including the therapist manual, participant workbook, mCM apps, and data collection procedures. The second cohort (n = 5) will yield qualitative and quantitative data to guide the focus of the intervention to components most valued by participants and linked with achieving outcome benchmarks. The third cohort will be a pilot clinical trial comparing the multi-component mCM intervention (n = 30) to a comparison condition (n = 15) that differs only in that reinforcement will not be contingent on abstinence. The work proposed in these aims will provide the first step toward implementation of an innovative approach that builds upon the power of mHealth technology to reduce the prevalence of both alcohol misuse and smoking."
"9398610","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-heme, iron-containing oxygenases are involved in various biomedically important processes, including the biosynthesis of antibiotics (including chlorobiocin and penicillin), the generation of deoxyribonucleotides (key building blocks of DNA), and the storage of iron to prevent damaging Fenton-type chemistry (via the ferroxidase site of ferritin). Understanding how oxygenases use activated iron-oxygen species to carry out these transformations is of paramount importance. Despite the wealth of studies on the role of iron-oxo and iron-peroxo species, there is a paucity of spectroscopically accessible iron-superoxo compounds known. This is surprising given that iron-superoxo species are proposed as early intermediates in the catalytic cycles of almost every non-heme iron-containing oxygenase enzyme. The goal of this proposal is to generate spectroscopically tractable Fe(III)-superoxo species of relevance to non-heme iron-containing oxygenases. This will be accomplished by developing a synthetic methodology for mononuclear non-heme Fe(III)-superoxo species. We hypothesize that by appropriate combination of reaction conditions and ligand design features (including ligand basicity, steric bulk and hydrogen bond donor ability) we will be able to generate the first synthetic mononuclear non-heme Fe(III)-superoxo species. We will also apply similar design principles to the generation of Fe(III)-superoxo compounds from dinuclear precursors containing a Fe(II) center. The synthetic Fe(III)-superoxo compounds will be comprehensively characterized by a variety of spectroscopic methods including UV-vis, XAS, resonance Raman, EPR, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. This will allow the establishment of an understanding of the relationship between primary- and secondary- coordination sphere features of the compounds to the structural and electronic features of iron-superoxo species. To date no non-heme iron-superoxo compound has been fully characterized by a combination of Raman, EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy, and this is a significant gap in understanding for the field. In fact, only a single such superoxo compound has been characterized by resonance Raman, and the ?O-O stretching frequency of 1310 cm-1 is anomalously high compared to other known superoxide compounds (1043-1207 cm-1). The reactivity of the synthesized Fe(III)-superoxo compounds will also be explored in order to establish a reactivity relationship to electronic and structural parameters. Overall, this research has the potential to be transformative to understanding the role of superoxide intermediates in the field of non-heme iron-containing oxygenases."
"9198584","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating demyelinating disorder that impacts the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. These defects are largel thought to be due to a chronic loss of myelin, a lipid dense structure important for normal functioning of the central nervous system. Drugs that treat MS decrease the likelihood of myelin damage, but do not stimulate myelin repair. Exercise can also lessen disability in MS patients, yet the underlying biological cause for this effect is not well understood. Additionally, it is unknown whether exercise influences either myelin repair or the maturation of oligodendroglia, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. However, some studies in healthy adults indicate that training intricate motor skills (such as juggling) or increasing levels of exercise, correlate with increases in the size of white matter, brain areas that are heavily myelinated. Unfortunately, it is not yet clear whether exercise is influencing the myelin itself or rather othe white matter elements. Intriguingly, recent studies in rodents have found that exercise can stimulate the production of new neurons in the hippocampus, a memory area in the brain. This made us wonder whether exercise could also stimulate oligodendroglia to make new myelin. We have therefore begun to test the hypothesis that exercise influences changes in oligodendroglia that enhance myelin repair. By providing running wheels to healthy young adult female rodents for several weeks, we observed increased numbers of mature oligodendrocytes in the brains of running rodents compared to sedentary rodents. In another experiment, we exposed mice to cuprizone, a chemical that causes myelin damage. We found that cuprizone-treated mice that exercised had more myelin compared to cuprizone-treated sedentary mice. We also found that these mice had less Insulin growth factor B receptor levels, which suggests that it could play a role in protecting myelin. Our current proposal is designed to more fully evaluate the effect of exercise both on critical oligodendroglial responses such as cell division and maturation, and on the repair of myelin itself, both during cuprizone-mediated myelin damage and shortly after the removal of cuprizone, when significant myelin repair takes place. We will use whole brain imaging techniques to assess myelin, coupled with traditional histological and gene expression analyses to evaluate oligodendrocytes and myelin. We will also use transgenic mice with immature oligodendroglia that can be induced at different time points to become fluorescent, enabling us to precisely monitor the temporal dynamics of oligodendroglial differentiation and myelin repair in the exercising and sedentary mice. Together, these studies will enable us to determine how and when exercise influences myelin repair. We hope that these studies will build the foundation for future studies on the cellular signals that enable exercise to contribute o improved myelin repair. If successful, our findings could lead to a better understanding of exercise in MS treatment and the development of novel therapeutic targets for myelin repair."
"9239173","Project Summary  The rates of obesity, which is defined as an excessive increase in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, has increased rapidly over the last several decades and today 65% of the adult population in the U.S. is overweight with more than 30% of the population meeting the criteria for obesity. As the weight of the nation has increased, so have the incidences of many obesity-linked disorders, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. Despite the importance of WAT in normal physiology and disease, we understand little of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate WAT mass in vivo. WAT is composed of several subcutaneous and visceral depots that are pertinent to the study of obesity. The differential accumulation of excessive WAT in specific depots is associated with differential risks of developing diabetes and other obesity-associated pathologies. However, the mechanisms that control WAT mass in distinct depots is not well understood. Therefore, establishing the differences in cellular and molecular events that regulate WAT mass in separate WAT depots will lead to a better understanding of obesity and how excessive WAT leads to the development of secondary pathologies. Adipocyte number increases in obesity, but this increased adipocyte number is maintained even after extreme weight loss. We have recently determined there is an obesity-specific mechanism of adipogenesis. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms that govern adipocyte formation in different physiologically relevant contexts. We hypothesize that distinct regulatory mechanisms control depot-specific adipogenesis in development and obesity. There are numerous conditions that are known to affect WAT mass and function, such as sex and anatomic location. The specific mechanisms that drive adipocyte formation in these different contexts likely influence the function of the resulting adipocytes, impacting their contribution to normal physiology and disease. Here we will define the mechanisms that drive adipocyte hyperplasia in both males and females, building a base of knowledge for future studies of the physiologic impact of these aberrant forms of adipogenesis. These studies may lead to the development of novel, sex-specific strategies for prevention and treatment of obesity and obesity-associated diseases."
"9397707","Project Summary Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a RNA virus that currently infects three percent of the world's population. By chronically infecting hepatocytes, HCV leads to severe physiological changes of host cells. This often leads to liver cirrhosis, which is the leading cause for development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and need for liver transplantation. HCC is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and current treatment of HCC is indirect and ineffective. Vaccines have not been successfully developed to prevent HCV infection, and direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has only recently become successful, largely thanks to basic science research studying molecular aspects of HCV infection. HCV is a RNA-only virus, and recent advances in the study and analysis of RNA has lead to a revolution in understanding the complex role that diverse RNAs play in cells. This proposal seeks a molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions between the virus and host cell during HCV infection using state-of- the-art approaches. In Aim 1, I will analyze the in vivo RNA targets of the HCV bi-functional protease/RNA helicase, NS3. Although NS3 is a target of current DAA therapy, no studies have analyzed what the RNA substrates for NS3 helicase activity are. It is presumed that NS3 targets viral RNA, but it is unknown whether the helicase impacts cellular gene expression. To resolve these unknowns, I will perform PAR-Clip on NS3. PAR-Clip permits unambiguous identification of regions of RNA that directly interact with proteins, and I will use a variety of mutants and/or drugs to probe the consequences of altering helicase or protease activity. In Aim 2, I will test whether the HCV RNA genome interacts with cellular proteins. The Pyle lab has uncovered conserved RNA structures that are required for normal HCV replication and infectivity. I will use RAP-MS to uncover whether host cell proteins interact with these structures. Follow-up experiments will confirm direct interactions and analyze the function of these interactions. These approaches will inform how RNA-protein interactions impact viral replication and cellular physiology. The ultimate goal of this work is to aid in the development of DAAs, uncover markers for HCC progression, and discover aspects of infection that can inform the study of other RNA viruses."
"9207084","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9244294","Globally, 30-40% of new HIV infections occur in adolescents and the HIV epidemic in adolescents is growing. The majority of these infections are acquired via heterosexual intercourse and ~40% of all adolescents living with HIV are boys. It will be impossible to achieve an AIDS-free generation without understanding the adolescent HIV epidemic in boys and developing novel strategies to prevent new infections.  Heterosexual transmission of HIV infection occurs across the anogenital mucosa. The presence of HIV target cells in the genital mucosa is a critical determinant of HIV risk. We have shown that penile anaerobes are associated with increased risk of HIV seroconversion, anaerobe abundance correlates with sub-preputial cytokine production, and penile IL-8 is associated with HIV target cell density in the foreskin. Thus, it is biologically plausible that changes in the penile microbiome with resultant inflammatory changes may increase the risk of HIV. There is little information on the pathophysiology of male adolescent HIV infection, especially changes in the mucosa affecting HIV susceptibility associated with maturation and sexual debut.  We hypothesize that maturation and sexual debut in boys lead to changes in the penile microbiome that affect the genital immunological milieu and the risk of acquiring HIV and other viral STIs.  We propose to evaluate whether the penile microbiome and soluble immunological milieu (secreted cytokines, chemokines and anti-microbial factors) change with reproductive maturation and sexual debut. Using the Rakai Community Cohort Study in Uganda, we will enroll 200 uncircumcised, sexually naïve, HIV- negative adolescent boys aged 15-16 years. Urine testosterone and the Tanner scale will be used to assess adolescent maturation. Coronal sulcus penile swabs will be evaluated for the penile microbiome, pro- inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and specific innate anti-microbial factors (e.g., ?-defensins, ?- defensins, cathelicidins, SLPI and trappin-2/elafin). We will also evaluate the impact of maturation and sexual debut on the tissue immune milieu and HIV susceptibility among the 200 boys in the study who request male circumcision (n~60). Their foreskin tissue and PBMCs will be assessed for inflammatory status, HIV target cell density, microstructural changes and HIV susceptibility using two ex vivo infectivity models. Data will be correlated with the microbiome, inflammation status, HIV/STIs acquisition, sexual debut and maturation stage, and adjusted for HIV risk factors using multivariable regression. This proposal addresses the Request for Applications aims by assessing the genital microbial and immunologic environment that impacts HIV susceptibility in adolescent boys during maturation and sexual debut. This study will contribute to our understanding of host-microbe/immunologic interactions and may lead to novel preventive interventions to reduce HIV risk that could likely be applicable to all men regardless of age, such as targeting high-risk bacterial species with narrow-spectrum antimicrobials or anti-inflammatory agents."
"9306515","More than 35 million Americans are subject to hospitalization and bedrest each year. Cardiovascular deconditioning (CVD) due to bedrest or microgravity impairs cardiovascular regulation. CVD in humans and an animal model, hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats, produces autonomic impairments, including enhanced chemoreflex function, that correlate with poor prognosis in disease. The nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS) coordinates basal and reflex cardiorespiratory function via neurotransmitters/neuromodulators acting through a network of synapses which include both neurons and astrocytes (the ?tripartite synapse?). We propose that increased excitability within the nTS tripartite synapse contributes to augmented chemoreflex responses in CVD. The goal of this proposal is to determine the cellular, molecular and integrative mechanisms, including the role of the tripartite synapse, by which the nTS influences cardiorespiratory regulation in CVD. We hypothesize that nTS astrocytes tonically restrain excitation of nTS neurons, and CVD attenuates this restraint or reverses it to enhancement. The resulting increased nTS synaptic and/or neuronal activity augments chemoreflex function. Aim 1 determines the extent to which CVD alters 1) reflex and nTS neuronal responses to arterial chemoreflex stimuli; 2) nTS synaptic and neuronal activity; 3) the balance of excitatory and inhibitory modulation of nTS chemoreflex, neuronal and synaptic signaling. Aim 2 determines the magnitude by which cardiovascular deconditioning modulates the integrative role of astrocytes in the nTS tripartite synapse to 1) enhance baseline ventilation, sympathetic and neuronal activity, and responses to chemoreflex activation, and 2) neuronal and synaptic function. Aim 3 determines the extent to which CVD alters the contribution of nTS astrocyte transport mechanisms to 1) baseline and enhanced cardiorespiratory and neuronal responses to chemoreflex stimulation, 2) synaptic and neuronal function, and 3) the influence of neurotransmitters. These studies utilize a comprehensive and integrated approach, including conscious and anesthetized whole animal studies to examine physiological mechanisms, the brainstem slice preparation to determine cellular mechanisms within the nTS tripartite synapse, and molecular approaches. Proposed studies will provide valuable novel information regarding the role of plasticity of the nTS tripartite synapse in normal cardiorespiratory function, and insight into mechanisms of dysfunction in CVD. Importantly, mechanisms of cardiorespiratory dysfunction in CVD also may apply to other disease states that exhibit altered autonomic and respiratory control."
"9210111","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this proposal we aim to define the molecular mechanisms by which membrane-bound organelles are organized in magnetotactic bacteria. These microorganisms are capable of using the earth's magnetic field as a guide to simplify their search for low oxygen environments with the help of a specialized organelle termed the magnetosome. Magnetosomes are small lipid-bilayer invagination of the inner cell membrane within which nanometer-sized iron-based magnetic particles are produced. Individual magnetosomes are arranged into a chain that maximizes the interaction of the bacterium with magnetic fields. The work of many groups, including ours, has pinpointed a large number of genes as having specific roles in building the magnetosome organelle. One of these factors, MamK, is a bacterial actin-like protein that is at the center of magnetosome chain formation. In the absence of MamK, magnetosomes fail to form coherent chains and are instead separated by numerous gaps. Bacterial actins are widespread amongst the Bacteria and form numerous families with distinct functions. For instance, MreB is involved in directing the synthesis of the cell wall whereas ParM and other actins help in segregation of naturally occurring plasmids. Outside of MreB and ParM, little is known regarding the function and behavior of the vast majority of the bacterial actin-like proteins. MamK is the founding member of one of these families and its representatives are mostly found within the MB. With the support of this grant over the last four years, we have developed an in vitro system to study the polymerization kinetics of MamK and, through collaborations, obtained a high-resolution electron microscopic structure of its filaments. Furthermore, we identified two proteins, MamJ and LimJ that are responsible for the dynamic turnover of MamK filaments in vivo. Using a directed mutagenesis strategy, we have also identified intrinsic features of MamK that contribute to its function, localization, bundling and dynamics. Finally, we have used broader genetic strategies to define the functions of over 20 genes in the formation of magnetosomes and biomineralization of magnetic particles. In this proposal, we have will build on our exclusive expertise and infrastructure to define the mechanisms of MamK function and magnetosome formation in more detail. First, we will ask if the biochemical and structural features of MamK are represented in the diverse members of its family, some of which exist in non-magnetotactic bacteria as well as the archaea. Second, we will define and characterize regulators and interactors of MamK. Third, we will develop tools to ask if MamK is involved in chain establishment, maintenance or segregation. Finally, we will develop tools to image and understand the earliest steps of magnetosome membrane biogenesis. These experiments promise to shed mechanistic light on the cell biology of bacterial organelles and the evolution and functional diversity of bacterial actins."
"9418251","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Northwestern University Udall Center of Excellence in Parkinson's disease Research, now in its 10th year. In the last award period, this highly productive research team made fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease, resulting in over 50 peer-reviewed publications. Our studies also motivated a successful Phase II clinical trial with isradipine. The program continues under the direction of Dr. D. James Surmeier. There are 4 scientific projects, 1 translational project, an administrative core and a molecular biology core built around 2 central themes: 1) the determinants of selective neuronal vulnerability in Parkinson's disease and 2) the determinants of the network pathophysiology responsible for the core motor symptoms of the disease. Project 1, directed by Dr. Surmeier, builds upon ground-breaking work in the last grant period to pursue the role of the pedunculopontine nucleus and nicotine in regulating oxidant stress in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. Project 2, directed by Dr. Savio Chan, pursues the mechanisms governing the emergence of synchronous rhythmic bursting in globus pallidus neurons in Parkinson's disease, focusing on a novel class of these neurons that project to the striatum. Project 3, directed by Dr. Mark Bevan, explores the role of cortical and pallidal input t the subthalamic nucleus in driving oscillatory behavior in Parkinson's disease. Project 4, directed by Dr. Charles Wilson, explores the mechanisms underlying the symptomatic benefit of deep brain stimulation. Project 5, directed by Dr. Richard Miller, is a translational project; this  project will test the neuroprotective potential of a novel selective antagonist of Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels, as well as two anti-inflammatory agents; this project will also test the ability of  novel gene therapy targeting GluN2D-containing glutamate receptors to produce symptomatic relief in a Parkinson's disease model. These projects make use of advanced molecular, optogenetic, pharmacogenomics, imaging and electrophysiological approaches to achieve their aims. The administrative core will oversee the program budget/subcontract arrangements, biannual meetings, external and internal advisory committees, archiving and distribution of program publications, compilation and submission of annual NIH program renewal applications, and maintenance of a program web page. The molecular core will provide gene expression analysis for each of the projects, provide consultation and assistance for genotyping, and provide assistance in the design and construction of viral vectors for gene knockdown and to provide assistance in the design and construction of viral vectors for gene delivery. The successful attainment of our programmatic goals should bring us closer to meeting the two grand challenges facing the Parkinson's disease research community: to develop a disease-modifying therapy and to develop better, longer lasting symptomatic therapies."
"9345288","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT To date, the only vaccine trial (RV144) that has shown any protective efficacy against HIV acquisition is based on a poxvirus prime ? protein boost immunization strategy. Although the efficacy achieved was modest (~31%), these findings provide a strong rationale to seek improvements for the prime-boost immunization approach and to gain better insight on the nature of the protective immunity achieved. Correlate studies of the RV144 trial indicated that antibodies against the hypervariable loops 1 and 2 (V1/V2) region of HIV envelope protein (Env) and high levels of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activities inversely correlated with the risk of HIV-1 acquisition. Neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) were generated, but were primarily against sensitive (?Tier 1?) isolates, with little or no activity against the more resistant (?Tier 2?) strains typical of circulating viruses. Thus, much of the current effort in HIV vaccine research aims to elicit Tier 2 Nabs and to improve the potency and the breadth of non-neutralizing antibody responses, including V1/V2 directed antibodies and antibodies that can mediate ADCC. Using a replication-competent poxvirus for priming and gp120 for boosting, we were able to induce Nab against heterologous Tier 2 viruses as well as cross-reactive V1/V2-specific antibodies and high levels of ADCC activities in rabbits. In this application, we propose to examine novel immunogens and immunization approaches to further enhance the breadth and potency of the Nab and non-Nab responses achieved and to determine if findings in rabbits can be translated to non-human primates. We hypothesize that by presenting the Env antigen in a native trimer form with the conserved CD4 binding site unmasked, we will enhance cross-reactive Nab, and by using polyvalent Env immunogens, we will amplify responses to conserved epitopes, while broadening strain-specific responses, including those directed to variable regions. The enhanced breadth and potency of both Nab and non-Nab responses, including V1/V2- directed antibodies and those that mediate antiviral effector functions, such as ADCC, will contribute to protection against challenge in a non-human primate model. The Specific Aims are: (1) To determine if trimeric Env, instead of monomeric gp120, when used as the boosting immunogen in a prime-boost regimen may improve the breadth or potency of Nab responses; (2) To determine if the ability of a highly conserved glycan (N197) to modulate Env immunogenicity is dependent on the use of trimeric Env, instead of monomeric gp120; (3) To determine if polyvalent, rather than monovalent Env, when used in a prime-boost immunization regimen, can improve the breadth and potency of Env-specific antibody responses; and (4) To examine if immunization regimens down-selected from the preceding studies in rabbits can be translated to macaques and if the immune responses generated can protect against SHIV challenge. If successful, insights obtained from these studies will inform the clinical development of vaccines and vaccine strategies that may be more effective than those used in RV144 to prevent HIV-1 acquisition in humans."
"9390200","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membrane bound organelle that stretches throughout the cytosol while maintaining a single lumen and is composed of multiple domains including the nuclear envelope, peripheral ER tubules and sheets. The shape of the ER plays critical roles in sustaining ER function, like protein synthesis,  while also providing a cellular scaffold through which other organelles interact and are supported. Additionally, the ER is responsible for trafficking up to one third of all proteins thatit synthesizes out to various cellular locations as a critical mechanism to maintain cellular health and homeostasis. This proposal aims to determine whether the distinct structural domains of the ER also play a role in regulating the trafficking of proteins through a bulk flow mechanism. This method of protein sorting acts in a non-selective method and is instead dependent on the structural features of the organelle, specifically, the ratio of membrane area to luminal volume. Protein transport through bulk flow has previously been demonstrated in other organelles such as the endosome and golgi and it is likely that the geometric constraints of the various ER domains also function to facilitate bulk flow transport of proteins. This proposal therefore aims t understand the mechanism by which ER proteins are trafficked throughout the ER and the impact that the shape of the peripheral ER has on protein trafficking and export. By altering the shape of the ER, Aim 1 of this proposal will determine 1) how the distribution of membrane and luminal proteins are altered following changes to the geometric profile of the ER and 2) how the trafficking and movement of membrane and luminal proteins are directly affected by the morphology of the ER. Results from this aim will provide mechanistic insight in the mechanisms regulating protein distribution throughout the ER and whether protein trafficking is regulated through a bulk flow dependent manner that is dependent on the geometric profile of the peripheral ER. Aim 2 of this proposal will determine how the shape of the ER regulates protein export by 1) determining the role of ER shape on the location of COPII labeled exit sites and 2) track accumulation of secretory cargo proteins at exit sites in proximity to peripheral ER sheets and tubules. Results from this aim will provide insight into how the shape of the ER can directly regulate the targeted export of proteins from the ER. At the completion of this proposal, the mechanism by which the structural profile of the peripheral ER regulates protein trafficking and export will be established."
"9209580","PROJECT 4: MODELING STUDIES OF ANESTHETIC ACTION General anesthesia is a fascinating man-made, neurophysiological phenomenon that has been developed empirically over many years to enable safe and humane performance of surgical and non-surgical procedures. Specifically it is a drug-induced condition consisting of unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia and immobility, along with physiological stability. General anesthesia is administered daily to 60,000 patients in the United States, the mechanisms for how anesthetics act in the brain to create the states of anesthesia are not well understood. Significant progress has been made recently in characterizing the molecular sites that anesthetics target. However, how actions at specific molecular targets lead to the behavioral states is less well understood. Addressing this issue requires a systems neuroscience approach to define how actions of the drugs at specific molecular targets and neural circuits lead to a behavioral state of general anesthesia. In this program project entitled, Integrated Systems Neuroscience Studies of Anesthesia, we will develop an integrated systems neuroscience program consisting of human, non-human primate, rodent and modeling studies of four anesthetics: the GABAA agents, propofol and sevoflurane; the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine; and the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine. The program project will also include a DATA ANALYSIS CORE, which will provide assistant with data analysis and conduct research on statistical methods. The Specific Aims are to understand how the actions of the anesthetics at specific molecular targets and neural circuits produce the oscillatory dynamics (EEG rhythms, changes in LFPs and neural spiking activity) that are likely a primary common mechanism through which anesthetics create altered states of arousal (sedation, hallucination, unconsciousness). The goal of the modeling research will be to develop detailed, circuit-level descriptions of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying each brain state of each anesthetic. The modeling will provide a systematic way to organize and integrate information across all of the three experimental projects and thereby, allow us to develop precise statements about anesthetic mechanisms of action. As the research proceeds, the modeling will enable us to make predictions that can be tested with experiments. In addition to providing new insights into the systems neuroscience of anesthetic states, these studies will also provide fundamental new quantitative knowledge about the neurophysiology of the brain's arousal circuits that will be relevant to studies of other neuropsychological problems such as coma, pain, sleep and depression.  "
"9199401","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The gut microbiota has been implicated in many autoimmune diseases, both inside and outside the gut (gut- distal/systemic). However, how gut microbiota affects gut-distal diseases remains largely unknown. Notably, commensals have been reported to affect certain T cell subtype(s) including T helper 1 (Th1), Th17, and regulatory T cells (Tregs), but little is known about how or which commensals impact T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. Tfh cells are a crucial T cell type that helps B cells produce high-affinity antibodie (Abs) in the germinal center (GC). However, an overactive Tfh cell response can lead to autoimmunity. We have established a new and more physiologically relevant platform to study the commensal effect by introducing segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) into specific-pathogen-free (rather than germ-free, our old approach) K/BxN autoimmune arthritis mice, whose disease mechanism relies on Tfh cells and auto-Abs. Our new data show that SFB strongly enhances disease in K/BxN mice and indicate a role for SFB in Tfh cells, as an increase in the Tfh and GC cell populations was observed in SFB (+) compared to SFB (-) K/BxN mice. To our knowledge, this is the first data to associate a specific commensal type with Tfh cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that gut microbiota can drive gut-distal autoimmune disease by enhancing the Tfh cell response. We will examine: 1) the mechanism for SFB-dependent expansion of systemic (splenic) Tfh cells and their significance in augmenting disease; 2) whether SFB boosts auto-Ab response by inducing Tfh cell cytokines, reprogramming other Th subtypes into Tfh cells, or directly acting on B cells; and 3) whether the gut can serve as a Tfh priming site, which is required for the systemic Tfh cell response. Specifically, we will address if SFB increases the number of Tfh cells by enhancing proliferation, survival, and/or differentiation. We will determine if Tfh cells are critical for SFB-mediated disease by using a K/BxN transfer model with CXCR5-/-KRN T cells, which are defective in mounting a Tfh response. We will use retroviral systems to see if overexpression of SFB- dependent cytokines can correct the defects in SFB (-) Tfh cells. We will test whether SFB can reprogram Th17 and Th2 cells into Tfh cells by adoptively transferring ex-vivo isolated Th17 or Th2 cells. We will use a transfer model with innate signaling-deficient MyD88-/- B cells to test if SFB can help B cells by acting directly on them through innate receptors. Our new data show a tremendous SFB-dependent increase in Tfh cells in the gut Peyer's patch (PP). Thus, we will examine the role of gut T cells in the splenic Tfh response by generating mice that lack T cells in gut-lymphoid-tissue (using transfer model with integrin ß7-/-KRN T cells). Importantly, our latest data indicate strong significance and broad applications of this proposal, as the Tfh/GC enhancing effect of SFB found in the K/BxN model can also be demonstrated in NZB/NZW F1 mice, a natural and spontaneous lupus model. Studying the commensal effect on Tfh cells will have crucial impacts on public health, as dysbiosis caused by modern medical practice might trigger autoimmunity by affecting Tfh cells."

The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9217675","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is a relentlessly progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary movements and cognitive decline. HD results from a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the coding region of the huntingtin (htt) gene, and pathogenesis stems from production of htt protein with an expanded polyglutamine tract. We found that the mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic deficits in HD result from transcriptional dysregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPAR] gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-????To determine the basis for PGC ???transcription interference in HD, we performed an unbiased screen for htt-interacting protins, and identified PPARs as candidate interactors. When we evaluated the different PPARs, we documented a physical interaction between PPAR? and htt in the cortex of BAC-HD97 transgenic mice, and confirmed that PPAR? is highly expressed in neurons. Mutant htt repressed PPAR? transactivation in neurons from BAC-HD97 mice, but could be rescued by PPAR? agonist treatment or over-expression. These findings formed the basis for our initial R01 project where we proposed to determine the role of the PPAR?-PGC-1? pathway in HD pathogenesis, define the function of PPAR? in the CNS, and test if PPAR? agonist therapy might be a viable treatment paradigm for HD and related disorders. In the last funding cycle, we confirmed the importance of the PPAR?-PGC-1? pathway in HD by documenting that htt physically interacts with PPAR? and represses PPAR? transactivation function to yield mitochondrial dysfunction and neurotoxicity, and determined that transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative PPAR?  in the striatum recapitulate HD-like phenotypes. Furthermore, we observed neurological disease phenotypes in mice expressing dominant-negative PPAR?, thereby identifying neurons as a cell type where PPAR? function is essential for homeostasis. Finally, we validated a selective and potent PPAR? agonist, KD3010, as capable of rescuing htt neurotoxicity, and performed a preclinical trial of KD3010 in HD mice, where we documented significant improvements in motor function, neurodegeneration, and survival. In this renewal proposal, we will determine how PPAR? promotes neuroprotection by examining the effects of PPAR? on bioenergetics function, autophagy, and mitochondrial quality control. We will determine how PPAR? counters htt neurotoxicity by defining the cistrome and active regulome of PPAR? in normal neurons and HD neurons, and we will seek the basis for PPAR? neuroprotection by transcriptome analysis of HD mice treated with PPAR? agonist to identify genes and pathways required for PPAR? neuroprotection. To evaluate the contribution of such genes and pathways to PPAR? neuroprotection, we will test if expression modulation of target genes is sufficient to produce rescue in BAC-HD and HD patient neurons, or is capable of preventing rescue by PPAR? agonists."
"9332820","Project Summary  Autoreactive B cells are key contributors to autoimmune diseases. Despite a stringent central tolerance checkpoint, some B cells expressing autoreactive antibodies leave the bone marrow and enter the circulation. These B cells, moreover, break central tolerance in higher numbers in autoimmune individuals, and have been described to participate in disease flares in lupus patients. Despite the importance of newly generated autoreactive B cells in autoimmunity, how and why autoreactive B cell precursors undergo or escape central tolerance remains poorly understood. The current model of central tolerance takes into account only the strength of antigen-induced BCR signaling where increasing binding to antigen increases BCR signaling and the level of tolerance (a so called ?negative? model). This model, however, does not take into account the contribution of tonic BCR signaling, a ligand-independent signaling event that promotes differentiation of immature B cells and survival of mature B cells. In fact, removal of tonic BCR signals in nonautoreactive immature B cells causes a phenotype similar to that of autoreactive cells undergoing tolerance, including the induction of receptor editing. This and other findings do not fit well the ?negative? model of B cell tolerance. Our goal is to re-evaluate the model of central B cell tolerance to develop one that more accurately reflects all experimental observations. Specifically, we propose to test two alternative models of central tolerance (?yin- yang? and ?positive?) where tonic BCR signaling in combination or not with antigen-induced BCR signaling regulates receptor editing and cell differentiation in developing autoreactive B cells. Experiments will also test how the duration and amount of BCR stimulation, and the ensuing Ag-induced BCR internalization contribute to central B cell tolerance. The proposed studies are significant because they will lead to a better understanding of the fundamental processes regulating the development of autoreactive B cells and autoantibodies that contribute to autoimmune disorders, and why the B cell repertoire of some individuals is more autoreactive than others."
"9422764","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Historically, the primary focus of Transfusion Medicine specialists has been the immune compatibility of blood types as well as the safe and appropriate use of blood products. As a consequence of the tremendous growth in the knowledge of blood cell biology, the functions and responsibilities of Transfusion Medicine specialists have expanded to now also include the translation of cell-based therapies. Transfusion Medicine specialists are valued medical and scientific consultants to their colleagues in other disciplines, including among others surgery, cardiology, anesthesiology, neonatology, and hematology/oncology. There is a recognized need for scientific training of individuals to further advance knowledge and translation of hematopoietic cellular therapies. The overall goal of the Program in Transfusion Biology and Cellular Therapies is to prepare M.D., M.D. /Ph.D. or Ph.D. postdoctoral fellows for biomedical research careers in Transfusion Biology and Cellular Therapy. The program supports 8 postdoctoral fellow slots per year. Funding is provided for 2-3 years after which the fellows are expected to assume positions in academia or in pharmaceutical industry. The program has a broad scope of research activities. The scientific disciplines involved include Immunobiology, Hematopoiesis, and Cellular Therapy.

"9403494","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a new application for a pre- and postdoctoral training program, the title and theme of which is Understanding Cardiovascular Disease Mechanisms. While this is a new T32 application, the cardiovascular training program at the University of Cincinnati and Children's Hospital has a renowned legacy due to 35 years of previous NIH T32 support under Dr. Arnold Schwartz (recently not renewed). The new leadership proposed here, together with a more focused and highly funded faculty wish to carry on this proud tradition of excellence in cardiovascular research and mentorship for another 35 years in Cincinnati. Our collective 19 faculty has placed 297 of their past trainees into academics over their careers, 154 of whom have run, or currently run independent research programs. The overall scientific emphasis of our training program will continue to build from a basic platform of cardiovascular physiology, cell biology, biochemistry and pharmacology, but will also incorporate the latest approaches in the post genomic era, as well as incorporating clinical and translational approaches. The cardiovascular environment at Cincinnati Children's and the University of Cincinnati is considered one of the very best in the country, with 19 NIH funded faculty (some 49 NIH grants amongst them as PI status), 166 collaborative papers published in 10 years, and the very latest technologies and approaches with outstanding core support. The leadership consists of the co-PIs Drs. Evangelia Kranias and Jeffery D. Molkentin, both of whom have a long standing track record of working closely together (15 years), as well as having excellent mentorship credentials. The Executive Committee (2 members), Internal Advisory Committee (4 members) and External Advisory Committee (3 members) are highly engaged cardiovascular researchers who will help ensure the quality of the training program.  The current proposal requests funding for 3 pre- and 3 postdoctoral trainees. Predocs are selected by the Internal Advisory Committee from a wide pool arising from departmental graduate programs, while postdoctoral candidates are selected based on being accepted into a mentor's laboratory and then passing the screening process by the Internal Advisory Committee and co-PIs. The mentoring program and evaluation process for the program are highly structured and oversight occurs on many levels. Trainees and mentors are evaluated every 6 months. The proposed educational training curriculum is highly structured and state-of-the-art. Recruitment of minorities has also been successful in the past with our faculty, and it will remain a top priority."
"9329778","PROJECT SUMMARY The project goal is to understand the selective pressures associated with Zika virus (ZIKV) adaptation. New approaches to preventing ZIKV are needed because the endemic range of this virus is expanding and because current methods are limited to controlling mosquito populations, and they cannot prevent invasion of this virus into new locales. A promising candidate for arbovirus control and prevention relies on the introduction of the intracellular bacterium Wolbachia into Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia biocontrol has advanced from laboratory experiments demonstrating that Wolbachia reduces the transmission potential of Ae. aegypti for certain viruses to small-scale field trials demonstrating that Wolbachia are capable of spreading through wild Ae. aegypti populations. This primarily has been proposed as a tool to control dengue virus (DENV) transmission; however, Wolbachia infections confer protection for their insect hosts against a range of pathogens including for Ae. aegypti against ZIKV. A critical next step is to assess the impact of Wolbachia on virus evolution to determine whether or not Wolbachia biocontrol is a sustainable method for ZIKV control and prevention that will not be undermined by mosquito or virus evolution. Likewise, alternative transmission pathways for ZIKV (e.g., sexual intercourse and perinatal transmission) are creating a scenario by which a highly mutable RNA virus could readily exploit new routes of transmission during circulation in South America. Accordingly, through this NIH/NIAD R21 we will perform experimental evolution studies to evaluate and anticipate evolutionary changes of ZIKV- Wolbachia-mosquito interactions and vertebrate co-adaptation. Furthermore, Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti colonies have been established by a complementary Eliminate Dengue Program (EDP) project in Colombia to evaluate the impact of Wolbachia biocontrol on DENV transmission. There are two specific aims 1.) Evaluate the impact of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti on ZIKV transmission potential and 2.) Evaluate the consequences of releasing ZIKV from alternate cycling between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Experimental evolution of ZIKV via alternate passage between Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and mice is new. Medium-scale Wolbachia deployments have commenced or are imminent. Therefore, assessing the evolutionary potential of ZIKV to adapt to Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti will help inform the viability of Wolbachia biocontrol for ZIKV control. Potentially, through this R21, valuable evidence could be provided that justifies expanding this type of control program to other Ae. aegypti-transmitted arboviruses, e.g., ZIKV. And understanding the potential for new transmission pathways will be critically important for prediction, prevention, and control of this emerging viral disease."
"9377179","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract: Hypoxia-suppressed Dicer and AGO1 promote angiogenesis Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis is a critical and complex process in normal development and disease conditions such as ischemia. In response to hypoxia, vascular endothelial cells (ECs) selectively upregulate a panel of angiogenic molecules through an intricately coordinated network consisting of transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls to support angiogenesis and new vessel formation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) have emerged as essential regulators that modulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level. The regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs and their functional relevance have been intensively investigated in cardiovascular biology and other fields. Most studies to date have focused on transcriptional regulation of miRNAs and functional validation of single miRNA-single target pathways. I recently demonstrated that hypoxia induces a group of hypoxia-responsive miRNAs (HRMs) including Let-7 and miR-103/107, which jointly suppress Dicer and Argonaute 1 (AGO1), two key components of miRNA machinery. The marked decrease of Dicer and AGO1 indicate that hypoxia may cause a global reprogramming of miRNA biogenesis and targeting at post- transcriptional level. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments provide evidence that hypoxia- suppressed Dicer and AGO1 enhance expression of angiogenic factors in ECs, e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and placental growth factor (PlGF) and hence promote angiogenesis. Mechanistically, hypoxia-suppressed Dicer may alter miRNA biogenesis to promote selective processing of HRMs, which acts in concert with hypoxia- suppressed AGO1 to decrease the miRISC targeting of angiogenic molecules. These observations prompted me to hypothesize that hypoxia-suppressed Dicer and AGO1 alter miRNA biogenesis and miRNA targeting, which enhances the expression of genes promoting angiogenesis. To test this hypothesis, I proposed three specific aims: In Aim 1, I will investigate the molecular basis by which the hypoxia-suppressed Dicer reprograms miRNA biogenesis in ECs to enhance the expression of angiogenic molecules. In Aim 2, I will delineate the mechanism by which hypoxia- suppressed AGO1 regulates miRNA targetome in ECs to promote angiogenesis. In Aim 3, I will examine the functional relevance of hypoxia-suppressed Dicer and AGO1 in pathological angiogenesis, i.e., in the context of myocardial ischemia. Collectively, these studies will reveal a new paradigm of miRNA-regulated gene expression in ECs responding to hypoxic and ischemic stress. Furthermore, the delineated pathways may provide novel insights into future translational studies involving pathological angiogenesis."
"9211385","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype.... An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life."
"9197335","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our project seeks to apply an objective behavioral measure of brain function that may identify sites of neural dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our paradigm will be a robust measure of associative learning - Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning (EBC) - to assess how fundamental building-blocks of higher brain function may be disrupted in school-aged children with ASD. The subjects will be 99 10-year-old children that are currently participating in one of two longitudinal studies examining: 1) the effet of an early behavioral intervention on the cognitive development of children with ASD; and 2) the neurochemical and neurostructural risk factors for developing ASD. Of note is that all of our subjects have had neurochemical and structural imaging at 24 months of age along with ongoing longitudinal clinical and behavioral assessments up to the current time. The project builds upon strong preliminary data demonstrating that ASD severity and EBC performance deficits are related. Our goal is to apply EBC in a well-controlled group of children whose ASD history has been extensively documented to determine whether EBC can aid in understanding long-term developmental outcome. Because the children had high-resolution anatomical brain scans and neurochemical imaging at approximately 24 months of age, we can now relate variability in EBC performance to alterations in early brain morphology and metabolism. An advantage of EBC is that it does not require language, social interaction, or active participation. Thus, EBC can be applied equally to high-functioning children and very low- functioning children with ASD for whom quantitative measures of behavioral development are difficult to obtain. The project will have the following impact: 1) it will address a crucial need for long-term outcome studies of developmental processes and outcomes in ASD; 2) it will help to identify the underlying neural mechanisms of ASD; 3) it could point to implementing EBC at earlier ages to assess ASD risk."
"9402469","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The direct functionalization of arene C-H bonds can be a powerful way of constructing biaryl motifs found in a variety of medicinally relevant molecules. Despite the potential utility of direct C-H arylation, control of regioselectivity remais a difficulty that limits its synthetic utility. One approach to address this issue is the use of an ortho directing group. Although many such directing groups are currently known, most are synthetically inflexible or require added protection/deprotection steps for their use. Due to the versatility of the amino group, an ortho-arylation using this functional group would be synthetically valuable, allowing access to diverse ortho-substituted biaryl derivatives. However, use of the amino group for ortho direction is challenging, the first example of which having been reported only very recently. The current proposal provides an approach to ortho-arylation of anilines and heteroarylamines utilizing continuous flow technology. Specifically, through the use of carbon dioxide as an abundant and inexpensive reagent, the amino group of an arylamine will be converted to the carbamate salt, which can serve as an in situ protecting and directing group for ortho-arylation. The use of continuous flow methods for this approach is uniquely advantageous, since 1) the thermally labile carbamate salts can be produced and immediately consumed, and 2) high carbon dioxide pressure can be conveniently and safely accessed, a condition necessary to prevent decarboxylation of the carbamate intermediates at the high temperatures required for C-H arylation. Taken together, these two features of continuous flow synthesis allow for an expedient ortho-arylation of anilines that eliminates the need for separate protection/deprotection steps. This advance could lead to more cost-effective syntheses of biaryl scaffolds that are ubiquitous in pharmaceutical agents."
"9148671","PROJECT SUMMARY DNA crosslinks, including interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are forms of DNA damage that arise continuously in DNA from endogenous and natural sources. They must be removed in order to allow accurate genome duplication and gene expression. Many chemotherapeutic agents induce ICLs including nitrogen mustards and derivatives (melphalan, chlorambucil), psoralens, mitomycin C, platinum- based compounds such as cisplatin, and nitrosoureas such as BCNU. Identification and future development of biomarkers associated with ICL repair proficiency will facilitate precision medical treatment for individual patients. Despite the importance of crosslinks in cancer etiology and treatment, mechanisms of DNA crosslink repair are known only in outline, and many steps are simply assumed. An integrated, programmatic approach involving four Research Projects and two service Cores will conduct experimental investigations under the auspices of the Program and contribute, both individually and synergistically, to this theme. Each Overall Goal/Specific Aim is independently engaged by each project using distinct and complementary approaches. The Program Project is organized around three aims, representing goals of the project: Aim 1: Determine how different pathways of crosslink repair are used or coordinated. The program will investigate major gaps in knowledge about different crosslink repair pathways, including how nucleases or complexes/components are recruited and used in different situations, variations of crosslink repair during the cell cycle, action of crosslink repair at different configurations of model stalled replication forks, whether ICL repair differs for different lesions, and the mechanism of error-free and mutagenic crosslink repair. Aim 2: Understand functions of newly discovered and little-studied crosslink repair components. One block to progress in understanding repair of ICLs is that there are a group of components that are known to be involved in crosslink repair, but where mechanistic roles are unassigned or known only superficially. In this program the investigators will cooperate to determine their functions. Major unknown components include SLX4IP (which associates with SLX4); the HMGB1, HMGB2 and HMGB3 DNA binding proteins; the MSH2-MSH3 complex (which binds DNA distortions); and UHRF1 (postulated as an alternative scaffold for delivery of nucleases). Aim 3: Investigate the mechanisms of repair of DNA-protein crosslinks. There are likely to be several routes of DPC repair and tolerance. Experiments will be undertaken to determine different modes of processing. Major gaps in knowledge include the involvement of Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway proteins in repair and how features of FA might be explained by defects in DPC repair. We will investigate involvement of replicative bypass (translesion DNA synthesis) in tolerance of DNA-peptide crosslinks (modeling proteolytically processed DPCs). We will also explore pathways that prevent or induce mutagenesis by DPCs."
"9204865","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The natural ability of neural stem cells (NSCs) to migrate within the brain, under certain circumstances, has long made them a candidate for treatment of CNS diseases. The development of methods to reprogram human somatic cells into tissue specific stem cells has provided great hope for using NSC therapies for many brain disorders. NSC transplantation experiments in mouse models of human diseases have demonstrated correction of at least some pathology in several types of diseases, providing proof-of-principle for the NSC- based approach. However, a significant barrier to effective translation is the low level of engraftment that occurs. Neurogenetic diseases have globally distributed lesions in the CNS due to the nature of the defect, thus treatment requires disseminated distribution of the donor cells. Achieving that will, however, require much better understanding of the post-transplantation properties of NSCs. We have reprogrammed human patient fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), derived NSCs from them, and genetically corrected the hu-iPS- NSCs. We propose xenograft studies to evaluate the effects of engineering hu-iPS-NSCs on post-transplant distribution and survival. We will test the therapeutic effectiveness of delivering a diffusible protein within the brain, in a well-characterized mouse model of a human lysosomal storage disease (LSD). There are >50 individual LSDs and they are responsible for a large portion of all inherited childhood genetic diseases that affect the CNS. A common treatment strategy can be used, in principle, for most of the LSD's, based on the observation that lysosomal enzymes are exported from genetically corrected cells and taken up by mutant cells to restore the missing enzymatic activity. Preliminary studies indicate the hu-iPS-NSCs engraft in the NOD- SCID mouse brain at low levels. The proposed experiments will investigate basic features of post-transplant dispersion and survival of the donor cells to address the problem of inadequate NSC engraftment. We have obtained compelling preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed experiments and we will use quantitative analyses to measure amounts of engraftment, differentiation into mature neural cell types, and changes in pathology. The long-term strategy of this line of research is to develop NSC transplants in the mouse brain to a level where they can be tested in large animal models of brain diseases in future translational studies and eventually into the human brain which is ~3,000 times larger than the mouse brain. It is clear that progress on this problem needs significant advances in understanding the biology of NSC engraftment and development of strategies to enhance engraftment."
"9403722","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States has the largest and fastest growing market for electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), and adult women of childbearing age are the most common users. However, no data exist regarding the health effects of e-cigs on pregnant women or their babies. It is well known that tobacco use during pregnancy is the most modifiable risk associated with adverse birth outcome, yet nearly one in four women in Kentucky continue to use tobacco products during pregnancy. E-cigs also contain varied (unregulated) concentrations of nicotine, despite nicotine being classified as a pregnancy class-D drug (exhibiting teratogenic effects on the fetus). The addictive nature of nicotine may explain continued use during this vulnerable time. E-cigs have been the center of recent controversy regarding novel smoking cessation or harm reduction products. There is also concern that marketing strategies promoting harm reduction may increase the appeal and obfuscate the known adverse effects of nicotine on fetal development. In addition to the adverse effects of prenatal nicotine, maternal tobacco use alters immune response during pregnancy, placing women at increased risk for preterm birth. We plan to build on previous work to determine the impact (better, same, or worse) that e-cigs and dual use (conventional + e-cig) have on prenatal immune response and birth outcomes compared to conventional use and dual use. Our overall goal is to determine the effects of e-cigs (and dual use) on perinatal biomarkers and birth outcomes. Three hundred and sixty pregnant women will be recruited. Participants will complete a survey to measure tobacco related behaviors, and provide perinatal biomarkers at four time points (each trimester and postpartum). Data analysis will include a series of repeated ANCOVAs to determine the association of perinatal cigarette smoking (conventional, e-cigarettes-only, and dual use) with perinatal biomarkers. A one- way ANCOVA will be used to determine the association with birth outcomes. Primary biomarker measures include: expired air carbon monoxide, urine and serum cotinine, serum immune markers and urinary NNAL. Gestational age at birth and birth weight are the primary birth outcomes. Until more data about the effects of e-cigs and dual use on perinatal immune response and birth outcomes are available, promotion of e-cigs during pregnancy would be premature. There is an urgent need to investigate the impact of e-cigs and dual use on perinatal biomarkers and birth outcomes. The lack of research may unnecessarily place women-and their babies -at risk for lifelong adverse health outcomes."
"9210088","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer- term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long- term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre- diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre- diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9309303","Activin signaling in normal and disordered erythropoiesis ABSTRACT Disorders associated with anemia such as ?-thalassemia (BT) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are a major clinical challenge in the United States, as many of these patients require chronic, expensive treatment for survival. Two novel, very similar drugs, Sotatercept (ACE-011) and Luspatercept (ACE-536), are presently being tested in clinical trials, and they have shown success in improving anemia and bone mass in BT, and delay of disease onset in MDS. Importantly, Sotatercept and Luspatercept contain the extracellular domain of activin receptor 2A (ACVR2A) and 2B (ACVR2B), respectively, and they use a non-erythropoietin (EPO)- dependent pathway to enhance red blood cell (RBC) production. Their proposed mechanism of action is to trap transforming growth factor (TGF) ?-like ligands, thereby modulating activin signaling via altered modification of the intracellular SMAD complex. Studies in BT mice suggest that the target of these drugs is the TGF?-like ligand growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11). Moreover, it has been proposed that GDF11 is upregulated in erythroid cells of BT and MDS mice, inhibiting late-stage erythroid differentiation via SMAD complex phosphorylation. However, these results are not consistent with our preliminary data showing that Gdf11 deletion failed to recapitulate the phenotype observed in animals treated with RAP-536 (the mouse counterpart of Luspatercept). In addition, Gdf11-deleted mice continued to respond to RAP-536. Thus, we hypothesize that GDF11 is not the sole target responsible for the improvements observed in RAP-536-treated BT mice or that lack of GDF11 is required, but not sufficient, for increased RBC production. Of note, these drugs also increase erythropoiesis in normal individuals and mice. Here, we propose to investigate the pathways involved in normal and ineffective erythropoiesis using wild-type (WT) and BT mice, respectively, with the following specific aims (SA): 1. Characterize the mechanisms by which RAP-536 increases erythropoiesis in WT mice and improves anemia in BT mice. We will characterize erythropoiesis in RAP-536 treated, WT and BT mice, and if this drug promotes macrophage-erythroblast interaction. 2. Investigate the consequences of simultaneous inhibition of the candidate ligands responsible for the increased erythropoiesis mediated by RAP-536. We will inhibit GDF11, GDF8, which is highly homologous to GDF11, and Activin-B, individually and in combination in WT and BT mice, to determine whether their inactivation is necessary for enhanced erythropoiesis. 3. Identify which cell types respond to RAP-536 administration by targeting the candidate Acvr2A/B receptors in erythroid and myeloid cells. We will use transgenic, SMAD-responsive, reporter mice to identify which cells show altered pathway activity following RAP-536 treatment. To further identify the cells that are responsible for the erythroid phenotype in RAP-536-treated, BT mice, we will use mouse lines with cell-type-specific deletions of Acvr2A and Acvr2B. Such insight should result in important clinical advances in treating BT, MDS, and other anemias, such as anemia of inflammation."

"9256826","7. Project Summary / Abstract Organ failure, such as end stage renal disease, places a substantial burden on the United States healthcare system and transplantation has been shown to be the most cost effective treatment option. Each year, there are nearly 30,000 solid organ transplants (SOTs) performed and Healthy People 2020 has made it a priority to reduce the number of deaths among recipients with a functioning graft. Transplant recipients are given immunosuppressive therapy (IST) to prevent host rejection of the graft. IST may include induction, a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody therapy administered at the time of transplantation to mitigate immediate cellular rejection, in addition to maintenance combination therapy. Although IST has proven effective at preventing rejection, the safety of these therapies needs to be more thoroughly evaluated, as evidence suggests an increased risk of infection associated with IST drugs. Infection may lead to sepsis, or systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction resulting from an infectious process, which can have devastating consequences for patient and graft survival. The specific aims of this study are to 1.1) determine the association of initial IST with sepsis risk and outcomes (mortality and graft failure) among all SOT recipients using time-to-event analyses that account for confounding by indication; 1.2) determine the association of long- term IST with sepsis risk and outcomes among kidney transplant recipients; 2.1) identify risk factors for sepsis among SOT recipients; 2.2) develop and internally validate sepsis risk prediction tools. In order to complete these aims, we will use 2005-2013 data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) linked to administrative hospitalization data, and 2008-2013 data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) linked to Medicare claims. The SRTR and USRDS collect information on recipients of all organ types and kidney recipients, respectively. These databases contain comprehensive donor and recipient information, including demographics, diagnosis data, biochemical values, and treatment history. SRTR data pertaining to kidney, heart, liver, lung, intestine, and pancreas transplants are collected by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network from hospitals and organ procurement organizations. USRDS kidney transplant data originates from a variety of sources, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the United Network for Organ Sharing. We will use USRDS data linked with claims to ascertain more granular pharmacy data that will allow for characterization of long-term IST usage patterns. The resources available through UAB and my mentorship team provide an ideal environment for conducting this study. My mentors have a long track record of successful research in epidemiology, sepsis, nephrology, and transplant medicine. This F31 grant also includes a tailored training program focused on career development, enhancing my analytic skill set, and gaining knowledge related to the care of transplant recipients. The training received through this proposal will allow me to obtain the required skills to achieve my goal of becoming an independent researcher."
"9255938","ImmuNext has identified and developed a putative lead anti-VISTA monoclonal antibody (mAb) that we aim to bring to the clinic for the treatment of human autoimmune disease. VISTA is a member of the highly successful negative checkpoint regulator (NCR) family of drug targets, whose members have demonstrated proven efficacy in inducing long-term remissions in human cancers. We contend that antibodies that suppress immune function by enhancing VISTA's function will prove effective in a broad array of human autoimmune diseases. The unique nature of VISTA to regulate both lymphoid and myeloid cells suggests that its modulation will be best suited toward the treatment of SLE, where defects in both subsets have been identified. With a strong patent position, state-of-the-art approaches and a skilled, experienced drug development team, we will develop a first-in-class NCR-targeted therapeutic for the treatment of autoimmune disease. In Phase 1 we will identify a cynomolgus cross-reactive lead and a backup mAb through functional screening of an anti-VISTA human antibody library. We currently have a human CD3-activated T call assay for our primary screen. Our choice of the best functional antibody and a backup will come from: 1) using in vitro assays, 2) by confirming activity using a human-VISTA knock-in (hV-KI) mouse strain and 3) with two models of autoimmune inflammation, concanavalin A induced hepatitis and, following selection, a graft vs. host disease model. After selection of the best antibody and a backup, we will advance into Phase 2 with lead optimization and pre- clinical development. The constant region of the lead antibody will be engineered through Ig isotype and FcRn engineering, and we will choose the best one to develop as the final lead molecule. This lead will be assessed for immunogenicity and manufacturing liabilities, and will be used to study the mechanism of action (MOA) in hV-KI mice. Additionally, we will examine the potential for this new therapeutic to induce immunological tolerance using transplant models. PK/PD relationships will be measured and rodent toxicity investigated. We will also develop PD biomarkers to inform future clinical plans using a variety of approaches, including examining tissues and cells by Phosflow and RNA-seq in drug-treated settings. By examining VISTA and the lead MOA in SLE human patient samples compared to healthy controls, we will potentially identify VISTA biomarkers for future clinical trials. With a qualified lead in hand, we will commence cell line development and non-GLP PK/PD and toxicological assessment in cynomolgus non-human primates. We have convened a panel of experts that will help collect, analyze and process the data generated from these studies to outline a clinical strategy and an IND-enabling GLP tox study.  The first-in-class anti-VISTA mAb will ultimately provide patients with a unique checkpoint regulator drug to not only treat their symptoms, but also to provide them the opportunity to reset their immune system back to a healthy homeostatic state.  "
"9208535","ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. Among various CHDs, single ventricle phenotypes resulting from altered ventricular morphogenesis have the poorest clinical prognoses. CHDs that present with defective ventricular morphogenesis allow for the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood via ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and/or impaired contractile function both of which put limits on vitality. Currently, there is a poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms and cellular etiology causative of the many forms of ventricular CHDs. Hand1 is expressed within the developing left ventricle (LV) myocardium and the myocardial cuff (MC) between embryonic day (E) E8.5 and E13.5. Gene targeting models establish that Hand1 is required for normal LV development. We show that cardiomyocyte deletion of Hand1 results in surviving mice that present with CHDs effecting LV morphology. Recently, HAND1 mutations have been identified in patients diagnosed with CHDs. These HAND1 gene mutations manifest as frameshift or nonsense mutations within the protein coding domains and are reported to be somatic in nature, as germline mutations in HAND1 are assumed to be embryonic lethal. Like all genes, Hand1 is transcriptionally regulated through cis-element enhancers located within Conserved Non-coding Sequences (CNS) that are present both 5' and 3' to the Hand1 transcriptional start site. The notion that CNS gene mutations affecting the function of Hand1 through defects in cardiac transcriptional regulatory elements is a largely unexplored hypothesis that could provide a mechanism for heritable Hand1 cardiac loss-of-function in human CHDs. RELEVANCE CHDs resulting in ventricle phenotypes have the poorest clinical outcomes. Thus, gaining an understanding of the etiology and molecular mechanisms that cause CHDs resulting in altered ventricular morphogenesis has the potential to benefit thousands of pediatric patients annually. Hand1 plays a key role in cardiomyocyte patterning and gaining insight into the cellular and molecular mechanism of this understudied developmental process will have a great benefit to developing non-surgical treatments for CHD patients."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."

"9205239","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular profiles of tumors are nowadays used to determine prognosis and to guide therapy. For example the presence of a mutation in the EGFR gene will most likely lead to anti-EGFR therapy. Recently an image phenotype was discovered that acts as a biomarker of EGFR mutation. This is a precursor of the possibilities of a new emerging field called radiogenomics defined as directly linking imaging features to underlying molecular properties. Research in radiogenomics is rapidly gaining recognition as a powerful new field that has several promising applications, such as non-invasive molecular lesion assessment. When image surrogates can be identified that mirror relevant molecular aberrations (e.g. a mutation in the EGFR gene) they can be readily translated in clinical care. The value added by radiogenomics can be readily translated, as medical imaging is part of routine management in oncology. However, these early applications have not taken full advantage of the opportunities. First, they limit the correlation to either a handful of manually annotated image features and a pre-selected set of molecular parameters. Secondly, the initial applications are limited to a single omics by focusing on gene expression, without taking into account DNA mutations, DNA copy number changes or DNA methylation changes. We will develop a radiogenomics framework to identify non-invasive biomarkers mirroring relevant molecular tumor properties that impact treatment and clinical outcome of human brain tumors. Our objective is not to mimic a radiologist's expertise through computational means, but to empower radiologists and clinicians with new biomarkers. We will offer innovative new algorithms to represent medical images. Once such a representation is computed (e.g., in the form of a large data matrix), we will identify univariate and multivariate image signatures predictive of clinical outcome. Next, we will use sophisticated methods for integration with molecular data to interrogate different views of the data with respect to a clinically relevant outcome. The end result is a radiogenomics map where image signatures of molecular properties and tumor heterogeneity can be hypothesized and validated. We will have image signatures that are prognostic and image signatures reflecting actionable molecular properties of a tumor such as drug target activity or drug signatures."
"9199400","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to promote transplant tolerance in pediatric liver transplant recipients so that immunosuppression and the associated morbidity and mortality risks can be eliminated. Transplant tolerance can spontaneously develop and be identified through immunosuppression withdrawal. However, data consistently show that rate of spontaneous tolerance is low early after transplantation and increases slowly over time as multiple toxicities accumulate. Children face a particularly onerous burden of immunosuppression, extending over a long lifespan. Therefore new therapies that facilitate tolerance induction are much needed. Research in the past 20 years has demonstrated that regulatory T cells are essential for immune tolerance to self-antigens and can be therapeutically harnessed to induce transplant tolerance. Recently concluded phase I clinical trials in graft versus host disease and an ongoing clinical trial in type 1 diabetes demonstrate that regulatory T cell therapy is safe and potentially efficacious in suppressing alloimmune responses. Here we propose to conduct an open label, phase I/II, multi-center clinical trial to determine the safety and potential efficacy of a single infusion of autologous, polyclonally expanded, regulatory T cells to induce tolerance in non- tolerant pediatric liver transplant recipients. We will also perform mechanistic studies using peripheral blood and biopsy samples collected from trial participants to improve our understanding of transplantation tolerance and the impact of regulatory T cells on alloimmune responses in humans. We have established a collaborative network of six clinical centers and four mechanistic cores that have unique and relevant expertise as well as many pre-existing collaborations to conduct this trial. We plan to enroll 25 children 2 to 6 years after liver transplantation and identify non-tolerant patients through highly supervised gradual immunosuppression withdrawal. Twelve non-tolerant patients will be stabilized with immunosuppression for 6 to 12 months before receiving an infusion of autologous expanded regulatory T cells. These participants will undergo second attempt of immunosuppression withdrawal to determine whether regulatory T cell therapy can induce tolerance. Global gene expression profiling of blood and biopsy samples, multi-parameter immunohistology of liver tissue, and multiplex plasma cytokine and chemokine analysis will be used to identify biomarkers of tolerance, differences in immune responses between tolerant and non-tolerant patients, and impact of regulatory T cells on the immune responses. This proposal is strongly resonates with the mission of NIAID and CTOT-C to promote understanding and reduce immune-mediated morbidity and mortality in vulnerable pediatric transplant recipients."
"9236395","One of the major challenges for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is to extend the health-span of the veterans and their families as their physical and/or cognitive performance capabilities decline with age. Human neurodegenerative protein misfolding disorders or proteinopathies, are associated with abnormal protein depositions in brain neurons. They include polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders such as Huntington's disease and ?-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease. Disclosing the basic molecular and metabolic alterations that occur during aging of post-mitotic cells such as neurons, under proteotoxic stress is crucial for understanding the etiology of neuro-proteinopathies.  Metabolic and mitochondrial alterations are hallmarks of aging and neurodegeneration. Over the last decade, we and others have shown that enhancement of mitogenesis or overexpression of NMNAT/NMA1, an enzyme in the NAD+ biosynthetic salvage pathway, act as powerful suppressors of proteotoxicities in yeast, fly and mouse models. Although the mechanisms involved remain to be fully understood, our preliminary data suggest that the two mechanisms are independent and that NMNAT could act as a chaperone to promote clearance of misfolded proteins. Recent screens in yeast models in our lab allowed us to identify three additional enzymes of the NAD+ biosynthetic salvage pathway that perform similar functions in protection against proteotoxic stress: NADS/QNS1, NaPTRase/NPT1 and NDase/PNC1. These observations suggest the existence of an evolutionarily conserved strategy of `repurposing' (or `moonlighting') housekeeping enzymes under stress conditions, and further reveal the intricate balance of metabolic activity and stress response in neurons.  The main objective of this proposal is to investigate the cytoprotective roles of NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes and mitochondria in normal and proteotoxic environments. We will test the hypothesis that NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes are a new class of chaperones that perform this function independently of their catalytic activities and without requiring mitochondrial functions. Furthermore, we will test whether neuroprotection offered by enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis is additive or synergistic to protection exerted by the chaperone function of NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes.  These hypotheses will be investigated in yeast models of polyQ toxicity during yeast chronological lifespan (CLS), a model of neuronal aging. Furthermore, the results obtained will be validated in human striatal cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from human fibroblasts. Three aims will be pursued: First, we will establish the effectiveness of NAD+ biosynthetic proteins in cellular aging and protection against proteotoxicity. Second, we will perform structure-function correlation studies to define the domains in NAD+ biosynthetic proteins required for chaperone or enzymatic activity and their requirement for protection against proteotoxicity. Third, we will characterize the mechanism by which NAD+ biosynthetic proteins promote the clearance of misfolded/oligomerized proteins and its crosstalk with mitochondrial mechanisms of protection.  Identifying and characterizing independent yet synergistic pathways of neuroprotection will reveal the complex network for neuroprotection and the intricate relationship between metabolism and neurodegeneration. The proposed research may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to modulate these pathways to counteract cellular toxicities and extend health-span. Finally, the ability to control stress- resistance mechanisms such as those against proteotoxic stress may provide molecular targets and tools to treat the Veterans and the general population to enhance their physical and cognitive performance and postpone their progressive deterioration with age."

"9316026","Abstract Bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (BM HSPCs) express innate immune sensors for bacterial products including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Unexpectedly, we recently demonstrated in a non- infectious setting that HSCs from TLR4 signaling deficient mice outcompete wild-type in competitive adoptive transfer. These findings open a new avenue of investigation into the role of basal TLR4 signals in steady-state hematopoiesis. Further, these observations raise questions about BM corruption in disease conditions marked by increased levels of circulating TLR4 ligands. In Aim 1, we will use genome-wide approaches to determine the transcriptome and chromatin structure of TLR4-deficient versus -sufficient HSCs, an essential step toward identifying the molecular basis of functional changes. Aim 2, we will perform separation-of-function experiments to distinguish the mechanistic importance of two distinct co-receptors, CD14 (LPS) versus Fetuin A (saturated fats), to TLR4-dependent HSPC lymphoid suppression in obesity, a disease of global burden. The outcomes of these studies will significantly advance our understanding of how environmental cues delivered through a hallmark innate immune sensor shape BM hematopoietic processes."
"9197260","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The success of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has led to an increased number of HIV-infected individuals experiencing complicated chronic non-infectious diseases including HIV-Associated Nephropathy (HIVAN) and subsequent End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Although renal transplantation is the most favorable and often only treatment option, the probability of dying on the waiting list for a healthy organ is higher than te probability of receiving one. The use of HIV-infected Deceased Donors (HIVDD) as a novel source of kidneys could alleviate the organ shortage. South Africa is the only country globally doing HIVDD kidney transplantation to HIV infected recipients, and the US is considering this option. Hence there is a need to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HIV- infected-to-HIV-infected organ transplantation. In this application we will study the only population of HIV-positive to positive transplant patients in the world in order to identify virological factors that underlie the re-emergence of HIVAN after transplantation. To this end we will first determine the incidence, extent, and nature of donor-to- recipient HIV-superinfection using drug resistance testing, digital droplet PCR, and two distinct next- generation sequencing techniques. Secondly we will quantify recipient's virus infiltration into the graft kidney and investigate virus compartmentalization in the kidney epithelium using laser directed microdissection. And finally we will investigate whether these and other factors are associated with re- emergence of HIVAN in HIV-infected-to-HIV-infected recipients. The results of this study will have a direct and immediate influence on transplant clinical practice in South Africa and on clinical decisions and policy in the US as was called for in the US landmark HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act in November 2013. Additionally, our study provides an opportunity to answer multiple fundamental biological questions surrounding HIV-SI, viral infiltration into tissues, the role of minor ART resistance for future care, and factors that influence establishment of tissue specific viral reservoirs, which would be informative for HIV cure research."
"9266979","SUMMARY The unifying postulate of this P01 proposal is that comparative studies of KSHV, EBV, and MHV68 will accelerate the discovery of pathways regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that contribute to gammaherpesvirus latency and tumorigenesis. Specifically, we hypothesize A) that herpesviruses utilize lncRNAs to regulate both virus and host gene expression, and B) that viral lncRNAs and/or virus-perturbed host lncRNAs directly contribute to the genesis of virus-associated AIDS malignancies. To address these hypotheses we propose three highly integrated projects with the goal of functionally analyzing lncRNAs and their mechanisms of action. Project 1, led by Dr. Renne (University of Florida, UF), will investigate KSHV- encoded lncRNAs and alteration of host lncRNA expression in the context of HIV-associated KSHV malignancies. Project 2, led by Dr. Flemington (Tulane University) will interrogate Epstein-Barr virus lncRNAs and alteration of host lncRNA expression in the context of HIV-associated EBV malignancies. Project 3 led by Dr. Tibbetts (UF) will investigate function of MHV68 lncRNAs and alteration of host lncRNAs in the context of latency and lymphomagenesis in a facile murine model. Importantly, all projects are supported by strong novel preliminary data, including the discovery of new gammaherpesvirus lncRNAs using a novel multi-platform genomics approach and implicating some of these lncRNAs in viral biology and pathogenesis. The well- organized Administrative core (Core A, Core Leader: Rolf Renne) will maintain oversight and organization of the program, including biostatisical consultation and adherence to reproducibility and transparency standards. Two additional service cores, which are already established and very productive, will support sequencing, bioinformatics and recombinant virus generation needs across the three projects: The Virus RNA-seq and Bioinformatics Core will be maintained at Tulane University (Core B, Core Leader: Erik Flemington). The Recombinant Virus Core, which was established with an NCI-funded RC2 award in 2009, will be maintained at UF (Core C, Core Leader: Rolf Renne). In addition, Dr. Parsons (LSUHSC, New Orleans), who leads the NIH- supported LSUHSC/LCRC HIV Clinical and Biospecimen Repository, will facilitate the acquisition of valuable Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and lymphoma tumor specimens from HIV-infected patients. Our proposal is significant and highly innovative in terms of the field of study ? ?understanding virus and host lncRNA function in gammaherpesvirus tumorigenesis? ? and in applying numerous state-of-the-art techniques across all three projects. Finally, studying pathogenesis-relevant tissue culture and animal models, complemented by the analysis of human tumor tissues from EBV- and KSHV-associated malignancies, will greatly increase our understanding of both viral and host lncRNAs in the context of AIDS malignancies."
"9332765","Abstract Myocardial infarction (MI) is caused by lack of adequate blood flow to the heart and results in terminal loss of cardiomyocytes (CM). MI and its related complications are a leading cause of death worldwide. The search for regenerative therapy that can repair or replace lost CM remains a daunting challenge. The foremost issue is the difficulty in procuring viable replacement cells. Heterologous sources are unattractive due to the potential for immunorejection. Harvesting progenitor cells from a patient's damaged heart is invasive and poses severe risks. Reprogramming somatic cells from other autologous sources can result in very low yields due to genetic or epigenetic barriers. A series of recent studies, however, has revealed that masseter muscle derived progenitor (MMP) cells share a common origin and have overlapping gene expression patterns with heart muscle. MMP can be isolated from highly accessible masseter muscles without mandible motor dysfunction and our preliminary data has shown that MMP yield the highest rate of CM differentiation as compared with limb muscle progenitors. Importantly, MMP can give rise to functional CM phenotypes including ventricular, atrial, and pacemaker CM under defined conditions. Therefore, MMP represent an ideal therapeutic candidate to maximize cardiogenic differentiation efficiency after cell transplantation in order to repopulate an infarcted heart region with a supply of autologous CM. At the same time, MMP avoid the common pitfalls associated with immunorejection, tumor formation, and reversion to an alternative epigenetic precursor. Aim 1 consists of in vitro studies to isolate and characterize MMP (including developmental origin, surface markers, and proliferation potential) in order to gain the desired CM population using novel sorting approaches. Aim 2 is designed to determine the mechanism by which microRNAs and transcription factor networks mediate the lineage commitments of MMP and the underlying cardiac potential of MMP as regulated by miR-128. Finally, Aim 3 focuses on the effects of implantation of MMP-derived cell sheets on the cardiac functions in mouse and porcine MI models. Experiments will examine the in vivo cell fate of MMP and determine any beneficial effects that result from cell engraftment and functional integration under ischemic conditions. These studies will provide new insights in both basic heart developmental biology and cell-based regenerative medicine. This approach holds great promise for the emerging field of personalized medicine and strongly supports the possibility that autologous MMP harvested from human masseter muscles and expanded in vitro will serve as a major source of CM that will be highly effective for treatment of patients after MI."
"9386400","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insufficient sleep is a major public health concern [1], particularly among older adults [2-5] and is linked to adverse health outcomes including metabolic dysregulation, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus [6-13]. Correlational studies suggest that insufficient sleep increases risk for diabetes and obesity [11, 15, 16], while interventional laboratory studies show that just a few days of sleep restriction can cause decreased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity [6, 12, 17, 18], as well as changes in metabolic and inflammatory hormone signalling [21-25]. However, this data comes almost exclusively from experiments in which healthy younger adults underwent relatively short exposures to sleep loss (1-7 days), and the field still lacks well-controlled in-lab studies which assess the time course of physiological changes in response to prolonged sleep restriction in older adults. Such studies are needed to address whether metabolic impairments continue progressively over weeks of sleep loss, or are eventually counteracted by allostatic adaptation. Relatedly, evidence suggests that circadian disruption, which typically accompanies sleep curtailment, has metabolic consequences that are distinct from [10, 22, 23] and may augment and interact with the effects of [24] sleep restriction. Finally, there is data to suggest that metabolic consequences of sleep restriction and circadian disruption can be reversed or ameliorated by sleep extension and circadian re-entrainment [10, 12, 29], though it is not yet understood how the extent of said recovery may vary with its timing and duration relative to sleep loss or circadian disruption. Therefore the proposed experiment will study the time course of changes in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and related metabolic/inflammatory markers in healthy older adults exposed to three weeks of sleep restriction, in an inpatient setting, carefully controlling for effects of diet, exercise, and circadian disruption. Research training wil consist of data collection from the proposed study as well as data analysis (from proposed and previous studies), manuscript writing, presentation of results at meetings, and design of future projects based on findings. Academic training will comprise formal and informal coursework and attendance at seminars on topics of endocrinology and metabolism, aging research, sleep and circadian rhythms research, statistics and principles of clinical research, and research ethics. Mentorship training will be received via regular meetings with the sponsor and co-sponsor and through established training programs at the Brigham and Women's Department of Sleep and Circadian Disorders."
"9406376","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over thirty years into the United States epidemic, social disparities in HIV prevalence persist, with Black Americans, and Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in particular, disproportionately affected. Intensifying HIV prevention efforts in communities of high prevalence as well as maximizing the dissemination and impact of effective interventions are among the top national priorities for addressing HIV.1,2 The proposed training plan in this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the essential knowledge and skills that the principal investigator, Sarah K. Calabrese, PhD, needs to launch a productive career in research targeting these public health imperatives. Further, the research conducted throughout the course of this award would contribute meaningfully to the successful delivery of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP, i.e., oral antiretroviral medication for HIV prevention) in real-world clinical practice and could have far-reaching implications for equitable access across social lines. PrEP is a cutting-edge biomedical advancement that received United States Food and Drug Administration approval for prescription in July of 2012, sparking a push for its implementation in health care settings throughout the country. There has been mounting recognition of the need for provider training and education about PrEP3-7 and some discussion of cultural sensitivity being a component thereof,5 but minimal attention paid explicitly to the risk of disparate prescription practices. Documented discrimination in the prescription of antiretroviral medication for treatment purposes as well as preliminary evidence of biases in clinical judgment surrounding PrEP pose a call to action; the proposed research aims to address this call via the development and pilot testing of a single-session, group-based PrEP Awareness + Discrimination Prevention intervention for healthcare providers. The intervention will serve the dual purpose of increasing knowledge about PrEP among providers and averting discriminatory prescription practices using evidence-based strategies derived from social-cognitive psychology. The project will include a comprehensive needs assessment, including eight focus groups with potential PrEP providers from diverse clinical settings (n=48-64), six focus groups with Black MSM at risk for HIV acquisition (i.e., potential PrEP users; n=36-48), key informant interviews with healthcare providers who have experience prescribing PrEP (n=20), and a national quantitative survey of physicians (n=350). The intervention will be pilot tested in a two-armed randomized controlled trial with 80 healthcare providers seeking continuing medical education. The project will yield an intervention manual with detailed curriculum and supporting materials as well as preliminary indicators of intervention feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness, setting the stage for future refinement and evaluation in the context of a larger-scale randomized controlled trial. The training acquired by Dr. Calabrese via this timely and innovative research project, in combination with formal coursework, focused workshops, academic conferences, manuscript preparation, grant-writing, one-on-one mentorship, and other research activities, will target the following three training objectives: (1) to gain mastery in the discipline of social-cognitive psychology on the topics of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination and to obtain training in measurement of implicit bias, (2) to gain expertise in intervention development, implementation, and evaluation, and (3) to enhance statistical analysis skills for application to planned research. Dr. Calabrese will be mentored primarily by John F. Dovidio, PhD, at Yale University, with additional mentoring from Nathan B. Hansen, PhD (Yale University), Kenneth H. Mayer, MD (Harvard Medical School/The Fenway Institute), Joseph R. Betancourt, MD, MPH (Harvard Medical School), and Manya Magnus, PhD, MPH (George Washington University). Dr. Calabrese's training through the proposed K01 award will round out her expertise and fully prepare her for a career as an independent research scientist in the field of HIV prevention."
"9259391","ABSTRACT Financial capacity (FC), which subsumes several complex, representative financial dimensions, refers to the ability to handle one?s finances efficiently. Emerging research in older adults has found that FC is heavily susceptible to age-related changes in cognitive abilities, brain volume and to affective factors such as depression and anxiety. Older adults have been, therefore, found to be in a precarious position of being physically and mentally abused for financial gains, duped via scams, exploited and are, thus, especially at risk for mismanaging their finances. This increases the financial loss and fiscal burden at an individual and societal level making it urgent to examine factors associated with FC to help with identification and prevention of such risky behaviors. Existing studies have not comprehensively examined the multidimensional FC construct as a function of age wherein well-learned, crystallized abilities may be persevered relative to abilities requiring novel problem-solving. Moreover, very few studies in older adults have focused on FC and cognitive abilities, volumetric changes, and affective changes, and such studies have been circumscribed and restricted in the number of abilities that they have been able to examine, and have not taken a developmental perspective to examine FC as a function of age. The overarching purpose of the current proposal is to fill in these gaps in the literature by using data from ongoing, R01 studies at Columbia University Medical Center, and by obtaining FC information from a standardized measure. The first two specific aims of the study are to examine the extent to which age is associated with specific FC dimensions, and to investigate the cognitive, volumetric, and affective correlates of FC dimensions with a specific focus on older adults. A third, novel aim of the proposal is to characterize FC awareness in older adults and determine its cognitive, volumetric, and mood correlates. FC awareness, which refers to an individual?s awareness of his or her level of FC ability, will be obtained from an objective, experimental metacognitive task that was specifically designed for this study. In older adults, intact awareness of one?s cognitive abilities (metacognition), is likely to be a critical factor in preserving everyday functioning and decision making, including that related to FC. Conversely, reduced FC awareness could further increase an older adult?s vulnerability to financial loss. Aim 3 seeks to identify factors associated with reduced FC awareness and thus reduce the negative consequences associated with financial loss. Results obtained from the proposed study will yield critical information to identify the nature and correlates of FC in older adults, and provide vital clues regarding how and why older adults make potentially risky financial decisions."
"9243634","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia meeting entitled Bile Acid Receptors as Signal Integrators in Liver and Metabolism, organized by Drs. Luciano Adorini, Kristina Schoonjans and Scott L. Friedman. The meeting will be held in Monterey, California from March 3-7, 2017. In the last decade, bile acids have enjoyed a renaissance, sparked by the identification at the turn of the millennium of their dedicated receptors, FXR and TGR5. This has been instrumental in revealing the key role bile acids play in regulating liver and metabolic homeostasis, transforming them from detergents facilitating the intestinal absorption of nutrients into versatile hormones. Signaling through FXR and TGR5 indeed modulates several metabolic pathways, regulating not only bile acid synthesis and enterohepatic recirculation, but also lipid, glucose and energy homeostasis. In addition, FXR and TGR5 agonists display anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, making these agents interesting candidates for the treatment of several liver and metabolic diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is already a medical problem of epidemic proportions poised to become by 2020 the leading indication for liver transplantation in the US. This conference will review genetics, structure and functions of bile acid receptors and will explore the intricate interactions among gut microbiota, bile acids and liver disease, as well as the multiple bidirectional signals along the gut-liver axis. Intriguingly, FXR agonists, like the bile acid derivative obeticholic acid, could have a beneficial role in the treatment of NASH by decreasing hepatic lipogenesis, steatosis and insulin resistance, while also inhibiting inflammatory and fibrogenic responses able to promote liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The conference therefore aims at integrating basic, translational and clinical aspects of bile acid receptors, bringing together an interdisciplinary group of scientists to discuss the state of the art and propose new avenues of investigation in this active and dynamic field. Relevance to NIDDK: NIDDK conducts and supports medical research and research training to disseminate science-based information in key areas related to its mission, including endocrine and metabolic diseases, digestive diseases, and obesity. NIDDK has recently sponsored the phase 2 study of obeticholic acid in NASH patients (FLINT trial), and this conference will integrate the study results into a broader perspective of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention in metabolic liver disease, which is the fastest rising liver disease in the United States."

"9212810","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The past two decades have witnessed a dramatic rise of obesity prevalence and a parallel leap of type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence. Although there are clear genetic determinants for both conditions, solid evidence proves that both conditions can also be prevented through lifestyle and dietary intervention on modifiable risk factors. Meanwhile, evidence now suggests that some environmental pollutants, especially the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), may also lead to increased risk of both obesity and T2D. Accumulating data from animal studies have linked a few POPs, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and p,p'- dichlorodiphenyldichloethylene (p,p'-DDE), with weight gain and insulin resistance. Human studies are rare in this field and most of the existing studies used a cross-sectional design, which cannot establish causal relationship or timeline between exposures and outcomes. Moreover, our preliminary data from epidemiologic observation and system biology simulation have suggested that hexachlorobenzene (HCB), a POP primarily deemed to be merely a marker of long-term total POP exposure, may be causally associated with risk of diabetes. In addition, new POPs that have entered the environment, such as the perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), have received little attention with respect to their effects on obesity and T2D. To narrow the gap in science in this regard, we aim to evaluate PCBs, DDE, HCB, and PFCs in relation to 1) subsequent weight gain, 2) development of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, and 3) markers of insulin resistance/glucose metabolism abnormalities, including fasting insulin, hemoglobin-A1c, and total adiponectin, in young and middle-aged women who participated in a well-characterized prospective cohort: The Nurses' Health Study (NHS) II. We will also explore lifestyle and dietary determinants of the POPs and potential interactions between POPs and other risk factors on obesity and diabetes in this cohort. The NHS II provides a unique and ideal opportunity for us to examine the aims. Since the study baseline in 1991, extremely rich data on lifestyle, diet, medical history have been repeatedly collected every 2 to 4 years. Moreover, in 1994-1995, blood samples were provided by approximately 30,000 NHS II participants, who comprised the study population for the current investigation. Among these participants, we will conduct a nested case-control study of type 2 diabetes, which is expected to include 1,050 incident type 2 diabetes cases at age 45 or older and the equal number of matched controls. Rigorous quality control protocol and processes have been and will be continuously applied in the NHS II cohort to ensure the highest quality of research data. In addition, we have assembled an outstanding research team comprised of well-established researchers in multi-disciplinary fields including environmental health, nutrition, and biostatistics that will ensure the successful implementation of the project. In summary, the current investigation will provide novel and critical evidence that will not only greatly expand ou knowledge of the diabetogenic effects of POPs, but also inform public health policy-making to help prevent obesity and T2D."
"9251288","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), an obstruction of blood flow in the arteries in the extremity, most commonly involves the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and affects approximately eight million Americans [1]. For patients with PAD, endovascular stenting can be a promising therapy that alleviates plaque obstruction and restores blood flow. However, stent fracture is a serious problem and it can lead to vascular complications such as restenosis, stent occlusion, and re-interventional procedures. Stent fracture is influenced by type of stent and local mechanical forces that are influenced by arterial wall composition including degree of calcification. Selection of stents for patients should take into account vascular complexities such as realistic in vivo arterial compliances and disease severity.  The long term goal of this study is to establish through experimentation, modeling, and simulation analysis of stent fatigue in the diseased state. Previous studies have modeled arteries as homogenous conduits, and do not consider individual patient environments. There are no existing models for the prediction of stent fatigue that combine biomedical imaging data of the diseased superficial femoral artery, which is essential for realistic in vivo arterial compliances. In this study, an automated artery computer model based on ultrasound virtual histology will incorporate the histological disease condition of the arteries. Combined with stent modeling, this computer model is targeted to be streamlined for the clinical arena and used as a physician tool for virtual evaluation and stent selection in a patient arterial setting.  This reserch proposes to generate a computer model tool to aid in stent selection of for patients with peripheral artery disease and validate it. It will involve expanding our current stent artery computer model to include plaques of varying compositions. The study encompasses development of a large patient artery model database, development of a large stent model database for commercially available stents, and integration of the stent and artery models to evaluate varying plaque compositions and their impact on stent fatigue. Each modeling step will be validated with a unique experimental setup under application of in vivo pressures. This work will lead to knowledge about arterial stiffness, stent-artery interfaces, boundary conditions, cardiac pressure interactions, restenosis, and stent fracture. Future work will be to implement the computer modeling tool clinically."
"9394058","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein ubiquitination is a fundamental biological process that regulates all aspects of human biology. Covalent modification of proteins with polyubiquitin chains tags them for proteasomal degradation, while monoubiquitination regulates endocytosis, signal transduction, nuclear import, and gene transcription. To this end, ubiquitin ligase enzymes (~600 known) represent a vast and completely unexplored area of druggable genome. The complexity and diversity of ubiquitin ligases rivals that of three other large families of enzymes: kinases (~500), proteases (~600), and GPCRs (~800). There are 25 FDA approved kinase inhibitor drugs, ~30 FDA approved protease inhibitor drugs, and about 30% of all medications target GPCRs. In stark contrast, there are only 3 FDA approved drugs that target ubiquitin ligases: teratogenic compounds thalidomide, and its analogues lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Significantly, germline and somatic mutations of E3 ligase genes are linked to many human diseases such as cancers, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and hypertensive disorders. Therefore E3 ligases have recently emerged as prominent targets for basic research and drug discovery. In this proposal, we focus our efforts on developing small molecule inhibitors of HECT E3 ligase Nedd4-1, which is an essential gene in mice and is a positive regulator of IGF-1 and insulin cell growth pathways, pathways that increase the risk and promote the growth of human cancers. Specific aims are as follows (1) To discover covalent inhibitors of Nedd4-1. We used an irreversible tethering technology, to identify two first-in-class covalent inhibitors of Nedd4-1 enzyme, and visualized their binding mode using X-ray crystallography. We propose to investigate biochemical mechanism of action of identified Nedd4-1 inhibitors, (2) conduct structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of identified Nedd4 inhibitors, (3) to conduct cell based studies of Nedd4-1 inhibitors to show that they inhibit IGF-1/Insulin cell growth pathways in cells. In summary, the proposed research program outlines new concepts to discover covalent small molecule inhibitors of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1. The proposed research program will serve as a foundation to initiate novel research directions to discover and optimize small molecule probes targeting other HECT E3 ligases (28 known)."
"9212790","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent exome sequencing of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) determined that aside from the near 100% mutational activation of KRAS, no other oncoproteins are mutationally activated beyond single digit percentages. This has renewed interest in efforts to make undruggable K-Ras druggable. The most promising direction involves inhibitors of K-Ras effector signaling, prompting current clinical evaluation of the Raf-MEK- ERK cascade and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR signaling network. However, to date, when applied as monotherapy, or with limited combination approaches, these inhibitors have shown little to no clinical efficacy for RAS mutant cancers. Two key issues contribute to this failure. First, kinome reprogramming mechanisms drive resistance mechanisms that reactivate the pathway downstream of the inhibitor block point. Second, it is clear that cancer cell dependency on mutant K-Ras cannot be attributed to the Raf and PI3K effectors alone, prompting efforts to validate noncanonical effectors for anti-K-Ras drug discovery. We propose that therapeutic targeting of the lesser studied Rac small GTPase effector pathway and its key effector, the Group I PAK serine/threonine kinases will address both issues. To accomplish this, we propose the application of three innovative tools to interrogate the role and mechanism by which the Rac-PAK effector network contributes to K-Ras-driven cancer growth. Specifically, our studies will focus on two immerging themes in signal transduction targeted therapies: (i) dynamic signal reprogramming mechanisms that drive de novo or acquired resistance to limit the therapeutic activity of signaling inhibitors and (ii) the cancer driver function of a signaling protein is strongly dependent on subcellular location. We have assembled a team of researchers with diverse and complementary expertise to (1) define the mechanisms of PAK1 activation by aberrant K-Ras- Rac1 signaling and the driver functions of plasma membrane-associated, cytoplasmic and nuclear PAK1, (2) identify the spatio-temporal phosphorylation events essential for aberrant PAK1 activation and PAK1- dependent cancer growth, (3) profile kinome reprogramming to identify the compensatory protein kinases that overcome PAK1 inhibition to promote cancer cell resistance, and (4) determine if Group I PAK suppression enhances PDAC sensitivity to inhibitors of the Raf or PI3K effector pathways."
"9219069","Molecular Mechanism of Wnt/Planar Polarity Signaling Summary  Directed cellular polarization as a key feature of organismal development is required for tissue and organ function and homeostasis. Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) is emerging as a fundamental mechanism regulating various morphogenetic processes including cartilage elongation in the limb, anterior-posterior (A-P) body axis elongation, neural tube closure, body hair orientation, orientation of inner ear sensory hair cells, left-right asymmetry and axon guidance in vertebrates. Mutations in PCP signaling components have been identified in human diseases such as brachydactyly type B1, Robinow syndrome, scoliosis, spinal bifida and epilepsy. Despite the fundamentally important roles of PCP, the mechanisms of PCP establishment by global instructive cues such as Wnts remain poorly understood and represent an exciting frontier in developmental and cell biology. The Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway is evolutionarily conserved and provides essential directional information during morphogenesis to orient cytoskeleton, cell division, cell migration, differential adhesion across cells, and to position cell extensions, such as cilia and axons. However, unlike the extensively studied Wnt/?-catenin pathway, Wnt signal transduction in the PCP pathway remains poorly understood. The PCP pathway is controlled by core PCP proteins including Van Gogh (Vang), Frizzled (Fzd) and Dishevelled (Dvl), which were originally identified in Drosophila. Wnt/PCP signaling in vertebrates is more complex and functionally diverse and vertebrate-specific features of PCP require rigorous genetic and biochemical studies of their own. The core PCP proteins are initially randomly distributed in the cell and gradually accumulate on one side of the cells instructed by global cues during PCP establishment. Wnt5a is a global cue required for establishing PCP in vertebrate long bone cartilage by inducing a novel receptor complex that contains Vang like 2 (Vangl2) and Ror2, a vertebrate specific PCP component. As a result, Vangl2 is phosphorylated in a Wnt5a dose-dependent manner and Vangl2 phosphorylation regulates its function. Our identification of Wnt induced PCP signalosome and Vangl2 phosphorylation as both an important readout and transducer of Wnt/PCP signaling opens a new door to find missing links in the Wnt/PCP signaling cascade. We propose to decipher novel Wnt5a signaling events that eventually lead to PCP establishment with rigorous genetic and biochemical approaches. In Specific Aim 1, we will define the functions and regulations of Vangl2 phosphorylation in vivo. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the molecular mechanism whereby Wnt5a signal is transduced through Vangl2 in the PCP pathway. In Specific Aim 3, we will identify additional regulatory components in Wnt/PCP signaling. Given the fundamental roles of Wnt/PCP signaling in many morphogenetic processes and identified WNT5A, VANGL and ROR2 mutations in human diseases, our studies of Wnt5a/PCP signaling in vertebrates will advance our understanding of Wnt signaling in human biology and pathology."

"9411989","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The full potential of genome wide association studies (GWAS) will only be realized once we fully understand the biological consequences of genetic risk associations. The goal of the proposed study is to identify gene targets of validated colorectal cancer (CRC) GWAS risk enhancers using a series of complementary approaches and to begin to establish the biological role of risk enhancers in normal crypt development and CRC etiology using a novel in vivo murine-based method. This study builds upon our previous successes in identifying CRC risk enhancers within GWAS loci on chromosomes 1q41, 3p14.1, 8q24.21, 11q23.1, 15q13.3 (3 risk enhancers), 18q21.1, 19q13.11, 19q21 and 20p12.3. In Aim 1 we will identify novel target genes of these CRC risk enhancers by conducting genome wide eQTL analyses using RNA-Seq data from >1000 normal colon epithelial biopsies and by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock out of the risk enhancers in CRC cell lines followed by RNA-Seq eQTL analysis. In Aim 2 we will identify and validate risk enhancer-target gene(s) interactions using chromosome conformation capture methods. We will identify and validate the physical interaction between risk enhancers and target genes using the circularized chromosome conformation capture (4C) method using HCT116 and SW480 CRC cell lines. Specific enhancer-target gene interactions will be further validated using chromatin conformation capture (3C) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In Aim 3 we will test the biological effect of CRC risk enhancers using a novel mouse model system. Mice will be developed that harbor selected human BACs corresponding to 3 risk enhancer GWAS regions (including the multiple enhancer region on 15q13.3) with known local target genes (8q24.21/cMYC/ CCAT2, 11q23.1/C11orf53/ C11orf92/ C11orf93 and 15q13.3/GREM1/ FMN1/ ax747968). BACs will be inserted into mouse ES cells and CRISPR/Cas9 technology will be used to introduce either risk or non-risk variants within risk enhancers. The modified ES cells will be combined with wild type tetraploid embryos to generate chimeric mice in which the entire embryo-proper was derived from the modified ES cells. The effects of the risk and non-risk SNPs on target gene transcript levels using transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq) will be determined in these mice in intestinal crypts and non-colon cells (e.g. liver, spleen). Histological studies will be conducted to examine the effects of risk enhancer SNPs on normal crypt and intestine polyp/tumor development. These experiments will be carried out in transgenic mice that are wild-type for Apc, as well as mice that carry a heterozygous-null mutation in the Apc gene. The proposed research will provide insight into the biological role of risk enhancers in the intestinal crypt and CRC etiology and the discovery of risk enhancer target genes will provide tools for future early surveillance and prevention studies of CRC."
"9239168","Approximately half of the metastatic melanoma patients develop brain metastases. Despite recent advances in therapy for metastatic melanoma, treating patients with brain metastases remains challenging. These patients are typically excluded from clinical trials because historically, melanoma brain metastases (MBMs) were difficult to control and usually portended a poor prognosis. Systemic therapies for patients with MBMs are understudied and preclinical development of new effective therapies are limited by the lack of knowledge regarding mechanisms involved in brain metastasis, coupled with the lack of studies addressing drug passage across the blood brain barrier (BBB). This emphasizes the immediate need for molecular studies of MBMs with the goal of developing new drug targets and effective and specific systemic therapies. In our preliminary studies we conducted gene expression profiling of tumors of patients who developed early brain metastases and compared them to patients who did not; PLEKHA5, a gene known to regulate normal brain development, and CEACAM1, an immune checkpoint molecule, were among the most differentially expressed genes. In situ assessment of protein levels in a non-overlapping set of patients showed that high levels of both molecules are significantly associated with propensity for brain metastasis, while the risk of developing early MBMs is highest when tumors have elevated Ceacam1 levels and low density of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Moreover, patients who presented with MBM as their first distant site of disease had highly elevated levels of both biomarkers. Knock-down of PLEKHA5 decreased in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cerebrotropic cells and inhibited their BBB transmigration and invasion. Further analysis showed a possible interplay with the PI3K pathway. Here we propose to 1) further study PLEKHA5 and CEACAM1 as possible mediators of MBMs utilizing somatic cell genetic approaches along with in vitro cell based assays and in vivo experimental mouse models recently developed, and to 2) concurrently investigate the role of CEACAM1?directed immune modulation in brain metastasis. The proposed studies are of high clinical relevance: first, the PI3K pathway has been shown to be important and druggable in MBMs with clinically available compounds that cross the blood-brain-barrier and second, a newly developed immune check point inhibitor, directed against CEACAM1, is being investigated in clinical trials in solid tumors including melanoma. Our studies will provide meaningful information regarding the roles of PLEKHA5, CEACAM1 and their combined roles in brain metastasis. If successful, these studies will form the basis for future development of PLEKHA5/PI3K and/or CEACAM1- targeting therapies for treatment of melanomas prone to metastasize to the brain. Moreover, they will provide insight into biomarker-based patient selection for these trials, resulting in an improved therapeutic window."
"9328810","Project Summary Obesity is a disease that affects 33% of the US population, leads to the development of severe comorbidities such as diabetes, and results in overall poor quality of life. The development of obesity is influenced by many genetic, environmental, and cultural factors but ultimately is strongly dependent on caloric intake and diet. Gastrointestinal (GI) peptides and hormones are known to influence appetite, satiation, and energy expenditure through interactions with cognate receptors expressed in the brain or in peripheral nerve fibers making them an appealing therapeutic target for obesity treatment. Our laboratory has previously described a putative role for a particular GI peptide, peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), where application of PYY to the oral cavity in mice promotes decreased food intake and weight loss without causing conditioned taste aversion (Acosta et al 2012, Hurtado et al 2013). Notably, cognate neuropeptide Y receptors (YRs) for PYY have been detected in taste buds as well as receptors for leptin and GLP-1, two other pro satiety hormones (La Sala et al 2013, Shigamura et al 2004, Martin et al 2009). The discovery of satiety hormone receptors in taste buds is intriguing, specifically because of the influence of taste on both feeding behavior and caloric consumption. Based on preliminary RNA sequencing of the murine taste bud transcriptome conducted in our laboratory, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of murine circumvallate taste buds and discovered that key receptors for adiponectin (APN), Adipor1 and Cdh13, are expressed in PLC?+ taste receptor cells. This finding is significant because APN is a protein known to be down-regulated in obese humans and known to effect body weight and glucose homeostasis in mice (Arita et al 1999, Kubota et al 2002). In addition, APN is present in saliva as well as in the circulation although a specific role for salivary APN has yet to be identified. Using a behavioral brief-access taste response test in adiponectin null (APN-/-) mice, we have further discovered that these mice display an increased sensitivity to intralipid stimulus. Based on these results, we will first set to fully characterize the expression profile of Adipor1 and Cdh13 in murine circumvallate taste buds by performing dual IHC staining using antibodies for Adipor1 and Cdh13 as well as antibodies for established taste receptor cell markers. Next, we will assess the functional effects of salivary APN on intralipid taste sensing in a mouse model that expresses APN solely in saliva, using a brief-access taste response test. Finally we will use this same salivary adiponectin mouse model to study the effects of salivary APN on food intake and body weight gain when exposed to a high fat diet. The outcome of this project will provide insight into the role of salivary APN on taste perception and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of salivary APN modulation, as an effector of food intake and weight loss. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that salivary adiponectin modulates intralipid taste perception in mice. Aim 1: Characterize Adipor1, Adipor2, and Cdh13 receptor gene expression profiles in Type I, Type II, and  Type III TRCs Aim 2: Determine the effect of salivary APN on intralipid taste response in APN-/- mice Aim 3: Determine the effect of salivary adiponectin on food intake and body weight in APN-/- mice"

"9276117","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are an important target for the gene therapy of infectious diseases, genetic disorders, and cancer. In vivo genome editing of HSCs has major advantages over currently used approaches that involve the collection of HSCs from patients, their in vitro culture/transduction, and retransplantation into myelo-conditioned patients. We have developed a new in vivo approach for HSC transduction, which is based on the GCSF/AMD3100-mediated mobilization of HSCs from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood stream and the intravenous injection of an HSC-targeting, helper-dependent adenovirus vector (HD-Ad5/35). The central goal of this proposal is to increase the percentage of stably in vivo HD-Ad5/35 - transduced HSCs while avoiding potential genotoxicity. We plan to achieve this through i) optimization of HSC mobilization and in vivo HSC transduction, ii) optimization of transgene integration through stimulation of homologous recombination, and iii) incorporation into HD- Ad5/35 vectors of systems that allow for the in vivo selection or expansion of stably transduced cells. Based on these studies, we will generate and test HD-Ad5/35 vectors for in vivo gene therapy of b-thalassemia."
"9212814","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this proposal is to delineate the mechanisms by which amino-acid radicals participate in both productive and destructive redox reactions in living organisms. Controlled radical chemistry occurs in enzymes that use amino acids in catalytic and multistep electron-transfer reactions. Amino-acid radical enzymes are involved in a range of chemical transformations some of which are fundamental to aerobic life on Earth. It is of vital interest to delineate these chemical reactions in great detail for a numbe of reasons. These include, for example, developing anticancer drugs, understanding the interactions of non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen with their protein targets, and laying the foundation for sustainable solar energy production. Importantly, there is also a sinister side to amino-acid radicals as these species are generated during oxidative stress conditions and can cause significant cellular damage. Despite the biochemical importance of amino-acid radicals, surprisingly little is known about their fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic properties. It is very challenging to study these species due to their highly oxidizing and reactive nature. As a result, no guide is currently available for comparing the formal reduction potentials of amino-acid radicals and correlating these values with the properties of the surrounding protein. Studies aimed at characterizing the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions associated with tyrosine oxidation-reduction are currently of high interest but are largely conducted on small-molecule models free in solution. The correlation between the solution chemistry and the protein chemistry is not straightforward. Furthermore, it is well known that the protein matrix can modulate the lifetime of the amino- acid radical by many orders of magnitude but there is little information on how this occurs. We have developed a protein system that can provide novel and important information about these issues. The a3X constructs are well-structured proteins supporting reversible amino-acid oxidation-reduction and major radical stabilization. Protein reengineering, solution NMR spectroscopy, (very) high potential protein voltammetry, quantum chemical methods, time-resolved laser spectroscopy, and protein hydrogen exchange (HX) methods will be employed to characterize and refine the redox properties of the a3X proteins. This system will be developed along three connected paths. First, the a3X proteins will be used to generate a unique protein-based thermodynamic ladder for interpreting the thermodynamic and kinetic effects of mutations and chemical modifications of amino-acid radicals in natural systems. Second, this project seeks to complement and significantly extend prior solution studies by characterizing tyrosine/phenol-based proton-coupled electron transfer in a structured protein environment. Third, we will investigate how the dynamic properties of the protein ensemble may influence tyrosine radical formation, stabilization and decay."
"9394241","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH)-intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major complication of premature infants that results in cerebral palsy, mental retardation, learning disabilities, neurodevelopmental delay, and reduced cortical growth. Glutamatergic neurogenesis-formation of glutamatergic neurons-is orchestrated in the dorsal ventricular (VZ) and subventricular zones (SVZ) of the cerebral cortex, and continues until 28 weeks of gestational age. As IVH typically initiates in the periventricular germinal zone, this might hamper glutamatergic neurogenesis. Therefore, we ask whether IVH disrupts glutamatergic neurogenesis and the organization of the upper cortical layers (2-4) and if so, how this can be restored.  During the development of the cerebral cortex, glutamatergic neurons develop from radial glia (Sox2+) of the VZ, which undergo asymmetric division to generate intermediate progenitors (IPC). IPC migrate to the SVZ to further proliferate and mature into pyramidal neurons that form the layers of cortex. Glutamatergic neurogenesis in the dorsal SVZ is orchestrated under the influence of graded expression of transcription factors including Pax6, Ngn1/2, Emx1/2, and Insm1, while neuronal specification of upper cortical layers is regulated by Cux1, Brn2, and Satb2. These transcription factors are controlled by Wnt and Notch signaling pathways. These signaling cascades are the central regulators of proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells; and these morphogens determine the transcriptional activity that modifies cell fate. Our preliminary data revealed that IVH suppressed glutamatergic neurogenesis, activated Notch, and downregulated Wnt signaling. Therefore, we hypothesize that i) IVH will disrupt glutamatergic neurogenesis and the growth of the upper cortical layers, and that ii) modulation of the Wnt or Notch pathway will restore the development of glutamatergic neurons and cortical layers in preterm pups with IVH. Our approach is to employ our preterm rabbit model of glycerol-induced IVH and use autopsy materials from preterm infants. Aim #1: Evaluate a) the density, proliferation, and apoptosis of radial glia (Sox2+) and IPC (Tbr2+) in the cortical VZ and SVZ, b) the abundance of pyramidal neurons (Cux1+, Brn2+) in cortical layers 2-4, and c) neurological function in premature rabbit pups with IVH vs. pups without IVH. Validate rabbit data in humans by performing parallel experiments in human premature infants (autopsy materials) with and without IVH. Aim #2: Determine the effect of activating Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways on a) the density, proliferation, and apoptosis of radial glia and IPC, b) neuronal density in cortical layers 2-4, and c) proneural transcription factors--Pax6, Ngn1/2, Emx1/2 and Insm1, and d) neurological function in treated pups with IVH vs. controls. Aim #3: Determine the effect of Notch inhibition on a) the density, proliferation, an apoptosis of radial glia and IPC of the VZ and SVZ, b) the density of neurons in cortical layers 2-4, c) proneural transcription factors-- Hes1/5, Pax6, Ngn1/2, and Insm1, and d) neurological function in treated pups with IVH vs. vehicle controls."
"9397725","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome codes for thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of which are implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative disorders. Despite the importance of lncRNAs, we only understand the function of a handful of them. Even for these select few that have been studied, our understanding lies at the genetic or molecular level and we lack a detailed structural understanding of how they function. This structural information is critical for validating proposed  mechanisms, understanding and predicting the function of unstudied lncRNAs, and potentially targeting lncRNAs for therapeutic purposes.  One of the most common functions of lncRNAs is the recruitment of chromatin modifying complexes. This function is consistent with their tissue specific expression and their implication in diseases related to cellular differentiation, such as cancer metastasis. Perhaps the best-characterized lncRNAs, Xist and its partially overlapping 5' transcript repA, function in this manner by recruiting PRC2 to silence the X- chromosome during dosage compensation in female mammals. Additional lncRNAs, such as HOTAIR, also recruit PRC2 via interaction with a 5' domain, suggesting a global mechanism of action. Recent reports in the literature, however, disagree about the mechanism and specificity of PRC2 recruitment. Thus, we will additionally utilize an analogous model system in flies to gain insight into the structural basis of lncRNA recruitment of histone modification complexes.  The first aim will be to determine the structural basis for the specific interaction between the roX lncRNAs and the MSL histone modification complex in Drosophila. The roX lncRNAs recruit the MSL complex to the X-chromosome in a fashion akin to the Xist/PRC2 system. In flies, however, the components of this complex have been well characterized and two protein components have been proposed to specifically interact with a defined RNA element. These models will be validated using in vitro biochemical approaches such as electrophoretic mobility shift assays and isothermal titration calorimetry. Ultimately, these biochemical data will facilitate the solution of the x-ray crystal structure of the complex responsible for conferring specificity in the roX/MSL complex.  The second aim will be to structurally characterize the lncRNA repA. repA will be transcribed in vitro,  but will be subsequently purified by size-exclusion chromatography without the traditional denaturation step. This production method has been shown to produce homogenous, well-folded RNA amenable to structural characterization by chemical probing. Protein footprinting assays will also be used to determine those RNA structural elements that specifically interact with PRC2. Together, these aims will elucidate the conserved mechanisms of interaction between lncRNAs and histone modification complexes."
"9299897","Project Summary  Candida albicans is a causal agent of opportunistic oral and genital infections in humans. While anti-Candida medications are currently available, the development of drug-resistance presents a significant challenge. Thus, chemical agents that can target novel pathways/enzymes essential for Candida growth would greatly enhance our capability to combat Candida infections.  RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved gene regulation process that operates in diverse eukaryotic organisms ranging from unicellular yeasts to mammals. Among the central components of RNAi are small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are processed by Dicer and incorporated into the siRNA-induced silencing complexes (siRISC) that contain Argonaute (AGO) family proteins. siRNAs guide siRISC to target RNAs, leading to sequence-specific gene silencing. The genome of Candida albicans encodes a sole catalytically active Dicer homolog (caDicer1/caDcr1) and one AGO (caAGO1). While RNAi is dispensable for cell proliferation in Candida, loss of caDcr1 blocks cell growth due to defects in caDcr1-mediated ribosomal and spliceosomal RNA maturation. These findings provide a strong rationale for our hypothesis ? small molecules that selectively inhibit the activity of caDcr1 would produce a new class of anti-Candida agents. We have established and validated a robust high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to identify small molecule inhibitors of RNAi in cultured Drosophila cells. Taking advantage of the conservation of Dicer in Candida and Drosophila and the HTS-amenable RNAi assay in cultured Drosophila cells, we propose to explore caDcr1 as a therapeutic target and to develop assays that will facilitate to identify small molecule inhibitors of caDcr1.  Completion of the proposed study will generate assays that will facilitate to identify inhibitors of Candida Dicer, which may be explored further as anti-Candida compounds with clinical potential."
"9403855","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This T-32 Training application is to competitively renew the current T32 pulmonary training program, anchored within the Indiana University School of Medicine, the only medical school in the state of Indiana. The proposed program builds on the success of the current training award, being multidisciplinary, highly collaborative, and including established investigators and highly qualified and dedicated mentors. We will continue to expose trainees to classical elements of basic and clinical-translational research, to which we incorporated novel technologies and a robust component of regenerative medicine, building on our local strengths. New in this application is a partnership with Pediatric Pulmonology at IU, fueled by the realization that adult lung diseases start in childhood or even prenatally, and by the strong history of cross training our fellows in research. Given the success and growth of our program, we are also proposing an increase in the number of trainees, adding one predoctoral and one postdoctoral spot to the three postdoctoral positions from the current program. The addition of one predoctoral position will also allow us to more efficiently to recruit future leaders of pulmonary and critical care medicine at an early stage. Finally, we propose to offer to interested postdocs a track for training in life science entrepreneurship, as an alternatie but yet important science career track. The ultimate goal is for us to train investigators that wil accelerate the advancements in lung research and close the gaps in knowledge that prevented for so many decades the development of phenotypic characterization, effective preventive intervention, and disease-modifying or even curative druts for most patients with lung disease. We maintain the strong commitment to training underrepresented minority talent and by a strong oversight from leaders in the field."
"9324512","Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this work is to characterize a unique small molecule probe of nuclear protein TOX (thymocyte selection-associated HMG box protein) to aid in understanding how this protein regulates development and function of the immune system. These studies would also provide a significant proof-of- principle that a small molecule can target the interface of a protein and the DNA minor groove. The TOX amino acid sequence is 94% identical between mice and humans, suggesting a highly conserved function. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that many aspects of the immune system fail to develop in TOX-deficient mice, including CD4 T lymphocytes and the entire innate lymphoid cell lineage, due to a failure of specific progenitor cells to continue differentiation in thymus and bone marrow, respectively. We focus here on the DNA binding HMG-box domain of TOX and its role in regulating gene expression. This is a highly evolutionarily conserved region of the protein, and one that is shared with the other three members of the TOX subfamily of proteins. Thus, the small molecule probe we have identified has potential to have broad utility in a number of biological contexts.  We have determined the crystal structure of the HMG-box domain of TOX and used these data and molecular docking to identify a small molecule, neurodazine, that we predicted would bind TOX and alter the interaction of the protein with DNA. Neurodazine is an imidazole-based cell-permeable small molecule that was identified by its ability to alter gene expression associated with neuronal cells, but has not been well studied. Here we will address whether this small molecule is active as a modulator of TOX activity. That neurodazine can influence TOX activity was suggested by novel assays we developed to detect TOX binding to DNA, and to allow an easy read out of TOX-mediated regulation of gene expression. We propose here to characterize the binding of neurodazine to TOX, including crystal structure determination of the complex, and to determine whether neurodazine specifically inhibits TOX-induced gene regulation. Most interestingly, neurodazine can enhance binding of TOX to DNA, but appears to disrupt the function of the protein. This has led to the hypothesis that neurodazine may stabilize TOX on chromatin, altering its nuclear dynamics. This will be tested in living cells using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Finally, two distinct cell systems will be used to determine the potential of neurodazine to inhibit TOX activity in the context of immune cells; bone marrow progenitor cell differentiation to innate lymphoid cells and TOX- dependent cutaneous T cell lymphoma cell growth. Together, these studies will provide key insights into structure-function relationships of this protein and form the basis for future development of additional small molecule modulators of the TOX-family of proteins that could be useful as probes and leads for pretherapeutics."
"9266981","PROJECT SUMMARY Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a human gamma-herpesvirus, is the causative agent of AIDS malignancies like KS and primary effusion lymphomas (PEL). In recent years it became clear that pathogenic herpesviruses including EBV, KSHV, and MHV68 express numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) many of which are in antisense orientation to protein coding transcripts. The function and structure of these RNAs is largely unknown. In addition, these viruses express microRNAs (miRNAs). While characterizing the KSHV miRNA targetome, we identified several hundred host cellular lncRNAs as putative miRNA targets. Furthermore, infection of endothelial cells with wtKSHV induced dramatic dys-regulation of host lncRNAs including the down-regulation of 533 lncRNAs. Of these 126 were rescued when cells were infected with a KSHV recombinant that lacked 10 of 12 KSHV miRNAs. Together these data strongly suggest that both KSHV encoded proteins and miRNAs contribute to dysregulation of host lncRNAs. Importantly, ten lncRNAs that are perturbed following KSHV infection, including HOTTIP, ANRIL, Meg3, and UCA1 are reported to be associated with human cancers. We demonstrate that up-regulation of UCA1 affects proliferation and migration of KSHV infected endothelial cells. Additionally, we provide experimental evidence that the anti-sense LANA transcript is bound by EZH2/PRC2 complexes and may contribute to the regulation of viral latency. These data suggest that viral lncRNAs are important regulators of viral gene expression and hence may be important for viral pathogenesis and/or tumorigenesis. To understand the role of lncRNAs in viral biology we propose to functionally study viral lncRNAs and to determine underlying mechanisms and phenotypical consequences of host lncRNA dysregulation in KS pathogenesis. Importantly, experimental findings observed in appropriate tissue culture models of lymphoid and endothelial origin, will be validated using clinical specimens from AIDS malignancies in collaboration with Dr. Chris Parsons. Moreover, this project will be performed in close collaboration with Projects 2 (EBV) and 3 (MHV68), with the goal of identifying pathways that are commonly regulated by cancer-associated gamma-herpesvirus lncRNAs. Identifying such common regulatory pathways may point to novel virus-specific therapeutic strategies. We note that to date several miRNA and lncRNA based therapeutics are in different stages of clinical development."
"9425226","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use in the population. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. Post-marketing surveillance currently relies mainly on voluntary reporting to the FDA by health care professionals (and recently, patients themselves) through MedWatch, the FDA's safety information and adverse event reporting program. Self-reported patient information captures a valuable perspective that has been found to be of similar quality to that provided by health professionals, and currently it is only captured via the formal MedWatch form. The overarching goal of this application is to deploy the infrastructure needed to explore the value of informal social network postings as a source of signals of potential adverse drug reactions soon after the drugs hit the market, paying particular attention at the value such information might have to detect adverse events earlier than currently possible, and to detect effects not easily captured by traditional means. Despite the significant challenge of processing colloquial text, our prototype study in this direction showed promising performance in identifying adverse reactions mentioned in these postings, with significant correlations between the effects mentioned by the public and those documented for the drugs we studied. Specific aims to be addressed include: 1). To establish the infrastructure that enables processing of online user comments about the drug on health-related social network websites. Particularly, we seek to recognize and extract mentions of adverse effects in those informal postings, and to map them to standard terminology. We will build on our preliminary lexical approach for finding the mentions, and propose a variation of machine learning (commonly referred to as active learning) where the machine learning framework has the ability to control what instances will be selected for use in the training data, among other innovative semantic approaches to normalization (mapping of the mentions to established, formal terms) and sentiment analysis (to discover whether a mention is reporting a positive or a negative effect); 2) To evaluate the  sensitivity and specificity of the extraction and identification systems, as well as the predictive value of the extracted  knowledge through specific case studies of a set of drugs with well known adverse reactions and by monitoring  postings about a select group of drugs released since 2007. Our existing manually annotated gold standard will be  expanded  through  a  dedicated  annotation  effort  led  by  a  pharmacologist (Karen Smith). 3) To compare the  knowledge  extracted  from  patient  comments  to  what  is  derived  from  the  established  drug  safety  monitoring  scheme overseen by the FDA. We recognize that the data obtained through the deployed infrastructure would not be able to be used to define an ADR standing on its own. However, if this method is validated, it could provide useful signals to complement the already established processes and data sources."
"9132187","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in American women with ~229,000 new diagnoses and ~39,000 deaths expected in 2012. Further, breast cancer incidence is projected to increase by ~45% over the next two decades. Although tamoxifen is considered the standard chemopreventive strategy for women at high-risk of breast cancer, it is medically contradicted in up to ~30% of high-risk women, associated with several adverse toxicities, and only effective for prevention of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Thus, there is an urgent need for new, non-toxic strategies to prevent both ER+ and ER negative (ER-) breast cancer. Observational studies indicate that regular exercise is consistently associated with a 20%-30% reduction in both ER+ and ER- breast cancer incidence in both pre-and postmenopausal women. However, the host and/or tumor-related mechanisms that underline this association as well as the optimal 'dose' to modulate these effects have not been elucidated. Against this background, the objective of this grant is to elucidate the 'dose-response' effect of exercise on inhibition of breast cancer initiaton and the role of growth factor withdrawal to regulate this effect in preclinical and clinical studie. Our central hypothesis is that exercise, in a dose-dependent manner, will reduce proinflammatory growth factor availability in the host (peripheral circulation) and mammary tissue that, in turn, will effectively inhibit 'core' cell signaling pathways that induce the transtion to the malignant phenotype.  This central hypothesis will be addressed by three translational aims that span laboratory to clinical studies. Aim 1 (preclinical): Determine the 'dose-response' of exercise on tumor inhibition in genetically-distinct transgenic models of breast cancer; Aim 2 (clinical): Determine the 'dose-response' of exercise training on mammary tissue growth factor profile in a randomized trial among women at high-risk of breast cancer (i.e., cytological confirmed atypia); and Aim 3 (mechanistic): Identification and validation of growth factor and signaling pathway modulation using targeted molecular analyses (IHC, RT-PCR) in combination with unbiased approaches [i.e., Reverse Phase Protein Microarray]. To test the mechanistic role of exercise-induced growth factor withdrawal, we will over express growth factor availability or growth factor receptor activity using genetic (knock-in models) or pharmacological (specific agonistic antibodies) strategies. This sub-aim will be addressed using in vitro experiments using human premalignant cell lines exposed to serum from patient samples obtained in Aim 2 as well recombinant growth factors using 'add back' experiments."
"9417112","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substance abuse and dependence is highly prevalent among people living with HIV and significantly exacerbates morbidity and mortality and accelerates HIV disease progression. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been the single most important treatment for slowing disease progression. ART adherence and HIV primary care are affected by a complex array of factors in the context of lives impacted by socioeconomic, psychological, and health challenges. Drugs and alcohol play a major role in non-adherence, engagement in care, and poor health outcomes among HIV-positive persons. While evidence is unequivocal that substance use treatment improves health outcomes, systems of care for the detection and treatment of substance abuse and dependence remain fragmented. Integrated approaches are key to the delivery of optimal care. Pragmatic or effectiveness trials can provide the best evidence about clinical practice to inform practitioners and policy makes about the most clinically and cost effective treatment to inform dissemination on a wider scale at the organizational and public health levels. We established a public-private partnership between public health investigators, clinicians and researchers within the City University of New York (CUNY), the nation's largest urban public university and the Institute for Advanced Medicine at Mount Sinai Health System, the largest provider of HIV medical care in the NYC area to nearly 10,000 HIV-infected persons from diverse backgrounds and from underserved communities. This collaboration will address implementation challenges at the frontline of service provision to pave the way for a comprehensive, integrated program to detect and reduce substance abuse and in turn, to improve ART adherence and HIV, substance use and associated health outcomes among HIV-positive individuals. We will achieve our goals through four specific aims: 1) develop an intervention to integrate substance abuse treatment with HIV care in a consortium of HIV clinics in New York City; 2) test the effectiveness of the intervention using a stepped wedge trial design to sequentially implement a screening tool and training of patient health navigators at six HIV clinics; 3) develop optimized technologies within the electronic health record (EHR) system used at the HIV clinics and integrate these with existing substance-use treatment mobile applications to retain patients in recovery and relapse prevention; and 4) assess the cost- effectiveness of implementing this organizational-level intervention. Our project has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful influence not only by providing data about the effectiveness of an organizational-level intervention to integrate substance abuse treatment with HIV treatment among HIV-positive individuals, but also on the effective use of EHRs that integrate treatment for both substance abuse and HIV care."
"9309422","Abstract Hearing and balance loss is prevalent in every population and poses significant challenges to those affected. For many types of hearing and balance loss including Meniere's Disease, Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct Syndrome, and Pendred Syndrome, the mechanism underlying the disease is currently unknown but is suggested to result from the loss of endolypmh volume and pressure control in the inner ear. Our long-term goal is to understand how the exquisite morphology of the inner ear is created during development and maintained in adults. Here we focus on the role of inner ear fluid pressure regulation by the endolymphatic sac in this process. The endolymphatic sac is a deeply conserved yet mysterious and poorly studied part of the inner ear. It has previously been suggested that the endolymphatic sac absorbs excess endolymph but through an unknown mechanism. Our preliminary data using state of the art timelapse imaging on larval zebrafish reveals that the endolymphatic sac pulses: the lumenal volume slowly increases over 1-3 hours and then rapidly decreases over several minutes. Endolymph pressure is necessary and sufficient for the expansion of the endolymphatic sac, and breaches in the epithelial barrier are necessary and sufficient for its collapse. These breaches occur at a novel cell-cell junction we term ?basal lamellar junctions? that seem to act as pressure relief valves. These preliminary data support our central hypothesis that regulated breaches in the epithelial barrier of the endolymphatic sac at specialized pressure relief valves are essential for proper fluid homeostasis in the inner ear; failure of these pressure relief valves causes endolypmh pressure to build up leading to inner ear swelling, death of sensory cells, and unregulated tearing of the otic epithelium called endolymphatic hydrops. We plan to test our central hypothesis using three specific aims: 1) identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms of valve formation; 2) determine the role of the valve in homeostasis of endolymph pressure and composition; and 3) determine the structure and function of the valve across species and developmental stages. Our experimental approach will use functional studies on zebrafish and quail and descriptive studies on mouse and human. Our studies will employ state of the art 3D, timelapse, confocal microscopy and serial section electron microscopy along with genetic, pharmacological, and physical perturbations. At the completion of this project, we will have a deeper understanding of the normal physiology of the endolymphatic sac and how disruptions to this physiology may lead to disease. Better knowledge of pressure homeostasis as well as the small molecule reagents we develop will provide a foundation for development of potential therapeutic interventions for these diseases. We are optimistic that this work will establish a new causal mechanism for inner ear pressure diseases such as Meniere's."
"9198221","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An R25 Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) for under-represented minority (URM) students will be developed at Michigan State University (MSU). It will provide a 12-week beginning research experience in environmental toxicology and health, with emphasis on the mechanisms of action of environmental toxicants, for 7 per year undergraduate student's science majors after their 1st or 2nd yr of class work; 4 positions will be set aside for these students. The remaining positions will be available to any student. A minimum of 5 positions per year will be allocated for under-represented minority students. The focus is on 1st time research experience on hypothesis-directed projects related to environmental health. The ultimate goal is to encourage under-represented minority students to enroll in Ph.D. programs in environmental health or allied biomedical sciences. There are three objectives. The first and principal objective  is to provide an intensive experience in hypothesis-directed research on projects relevant to the NIEHS mission, as this is often the critical first step to launching a student into a successful graduate career. A second objective is to enhance students' communication skills, especially with respect to scientific presentations. The third objective is to develop a sense of mentored community. Students will supplement the research experience with a series of social and professional development opportunities. A one-week long bootcamp entitled Introduction to Laboratory Research will precede the student beginning their project. It will serve as a foundation to provide a cohesive introduction to the fundamental aspects of working in a laboratory. The proposed SURE program leverages partnerships developed by the Principal Investigator with two undergraduate institutions in the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) system: UPR-Cayey and UPR-Arecibo, as well as minority serving institutions (MSIs) in the Southwest. Each of these institutions lacks significant research opportunities. These partnerships have resulted in 17 Hispanic students entering Ph.D. programs in biomedical sciences over the past 5 years. Recruiting will involve visits to the campuses by the Principal Investigator, and will be coupled with a seminar exposing the students to concepts in environmental health sciences. Summer research projects will be in federally-funded laboratories of investigators with research interests in environmental toxicology and health. Enrichment activities will include the weekly informal presentations on student's research, discussion of career opportunities and ethical aspects of research; a final oral and poster presentation will be required. These activities will improve students' presentation skills and help them focus on the bigger picture of translational biomedical sciences. Students will be encouraged to attend national scientific meetings to present their research. Ideally, these meetings will also have career development/educational activities for undergrads such as those at the Society of Toxicology meeting. This will further students' exposure to environmental toxicology and health, allow them to network, and develop a sense of community with other under-represented minority undergrads. A long- term outcome is increasing the number of under-represented minority scientists in the biomedical/environmental health sciences."
"9229478","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the research proposed is to facilitate the construction of organic molecules by exploring unconventional reagents for cross-coupling and exploiting the unique attributes of such reagents. This will be accomplished by employing a recently developed, paradigm-shifting approach to cross-coupling involving a dual catalytic cycle. The two cycles, a photoredox catalytic cycle and a cross-coupling cycle, working in concert, will facilitate a single electron transmetalation protocol, allowing cross-coupling under mild conditions and, with the appropriate ligand, high levels of enantioselectivity via stereoconvergent transformations.      In particular, methods to do so from inexpensive, bench-stable, commodity nonmetallic organic precursors will be sought. A process using such materials would be robust, cost-effective, and scalable, leading to a facile transition from the academic setting to a process development facility. Employing the dual catalytic systems that have proven effective in studies on the cross-coupling of organotrifluoroborates, the protocol will be extended to non-organometallic bulk source materials, namely hydrazines and sulfinate salts. Studies on these commodity materials will focus on practical methods of effecting radical formation under photoredox conditions and assessing their viability in being funneled into the base metal catalytic cycle. Organocatalysts and inexpensive inorganic materials will be explored as potential photocatalysts to enhance the sustainable profile of developed processes. Photoflow-based technologies and strategies will be examined as a means of enhancing scalability and effectivity. Diverse electrophilic coupling partners will be examined, and stereoconvergent processes will be developed to access enantioenriched alkyl substructures. This protocol will be transformative in enabling unprecedented C-C bond construction via cross-coupling from nonconventional, inexpensive coupling partners."
"9370192","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 40,000 women die from breast cancer every year. The extent of lymph node metastasis is a major determinant for staging and prognosis of this disease. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that migration of cancer cells into lymph nodes is also mediated by lymphangiogenesis, a process that generates new lymphatic vessels from pre-existing ones. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis are not well understood. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid mediator and a ligand for specific S1P receptors regulates critical processes of breast cancer progression, such as cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), the enzyme that generates S1P, is up-regulated in breast cancer and is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and correlates with a poor prognosis. We have recently shown that ATP-binding cassette transporters export S1P from breast cancer cells, and subsequently activate its receptors by inside-out signaling. Our preliminary studies suggest that S1P also plays an important role in tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis. We have found that S1P induces lymphangiogenesis via the S1PR1 receptor on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and it stimulates these cells to release angiopoietin 2 (Ang2), a critical regulator of lymphangiogenesis, whose levels in breast cancer correlate with metastases to lymph nodes and poor prognosis. The goal of this proposal is to determine the role of SphK1/S1P/S1PR1 axis and its crosstalk with Ang2 pathway to form a feed-forward amplification loop and explore its possibility as a target for treatment. We will examine the hypothesis that S1P produced by SphK1 is a previously uncharacterized cancer-induced lymphangiogenic factor that is critical for breast cancer progression and metastasis. Pharmacological, molecular biological and extensive genetic approaches will be utilized to determine the intricate crosstalk between S1P, released from the primary tumor and/or LECs, and Ang2, released from LECs via the S1PR1 receptor to form a feed-forward amplification loop, and evaluate their important roles in breast cancer-induced lymphangiogenesis. We will further elucidate their impact in lymph node metastasis and reduced survival utilizing our validated syngeneic breast cancer metastasis model, and explore clinical evidence using patient samples to support our hypothesis. Collectively, these studies will lead to better understanding of the role of SphK1/S1P/S1P1 axis in lymphangiogenesis and breast cancer biology that could lay the foundation for the addition of a novel S1P-targeted modality of treatment to the armamentarium of anti-breast cancer agents."

The services of Core C will aid the overall goal of the program project to comprehensively analyze the role of herpesviral non-coding RNAs as well as studies on host cellular lncRNAs that are perturbed in response to viral infection. In addition to constructing recombinant viruses, Core C will perform genome-wide sequencing of viral mutants. Building upon years of experience in making a complete set of KSHV miRNA deletion mutants, our group has developed and implemented techniques for making bacmid-derived mutants in both KSHV and MHV68, and will readily extend this to EBV."
"9400911","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed training program, Postdoctoral Training in Reproductive Mood Disorders is to develop researchers with expertise in both the biological basis and clinically relevant (predictive) phenotypes of reproductive mood disorders (perinatal depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and perimenopausal depression). This is a two year training program for MD, PhD and MD/PhD trainees. Training will involve a broad-based and integrative perspective, involving not only psychiatry but cardiology and genetics, endocrinology, neuroscience, and obstetrics/gynecology. With this program's emphasis on training in pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie reproductive mood disorders, trainees will develop mastery in the following: reproductive hormonal physiology and signaling; methods for manipulating the reproductive system; and clinical phenomenology of reproductive mood disorders. Additionally, trainees will develop expertise in at least one of four methodological training tracks: Neurosciences, Genetics, Stress Physiology, or Clinical Trials Methodology. Fellows will have a primary research mentor (representing their training track) and a secondary mentor (from a different track), thereby providing additional exposure to both the interdisciplinarity and collaborative nature of science. In addition to experiential opportunities with program faculty, didactics will be tailored to the individual fellow to ensure that each achieves competence in their chosen research track. A key element of the training as well includes an independent research project. Thus, while the training plan is multidisciplinary, an emphasis is placed on individualizing the training experience for the Fellows. However, through a number of program specific venues designed to bring the Fellows together for exchange of ideas and support, the program will ensure cohesiveness among the trainees. Fellows who complete this program will be poised to become independent researchers, having the unique requisite foundation to examine biobehavioral mechanisms in reproductive mood disorders and the ability to identify therapeutic biologic targets in their future independent research. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill represents an ideal setting for the proposed program because it possesses a well-known collaborative infrastructure, a vibrant women's mood disorder clinical program (which includes the first inpatient perinatal depression program in the country), and a critical mass of researchers in reproductive mood disorders with a track record of success."
"9207592","LUNG, HEAD & NECK CANCERS PROGRAM (Project-534) ABSTRACT Overview and Goals: The Lung, Head and Neck Cancer (LHN) Program unites scientists focused on malignancies of lung and head and neck with the goal to decrease the incidence, morbidity and mortality of lung and head and neck cancer. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the UCCC catchment area while HNC causes significant morbidity and mortality. The smoking rate in Colorado is lower than the national average but still causes the majority of LHN cancers, however, non-smoking related cancers in young, particularly female, patients are rising. Thus, research in the LHN program focuses on tumors caused by tobacco as well as other etiologies (non-smoking related driver mutations and human papilloma virus (HPV)). Program research falls into 3 areas: Risk, Early Detection and Chemoprevention; Tumor Genetics and Biology; and Experimental Therapeutics. Research Highlights: Research initiatives directly translated to our catchment area include development and validation of biomarkers to inform management of CT detected lung nodules; investigation of the biology of premalignant lesions to define risk of progression to cancer; chemoprevention of lung cancer and HNC; discovery of targetable mutations with translation to clinical trials; defining tumor vulnerabilities and mechanisms of resistance; developing biomarkers to provide personalized treatment; discovering the pathogenesis of HPV-associated HNC; and translating new approaches to decrease treatment side effects and improve survivorship. Program Activities: The program fosters interactions through seminars, retreats and training bringing together basic and clinical scientists in collaborative projects. Pilot grants through the UCCC, Lung SPORE and developing HNC SPORE support promising research initiatives. UCCC Shared Resources that are highly utilized by program members include Flow Cytometry, Genomics, Molecular Pathology, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics and Tissue Biobanking and Processing. Program leaders and members mentor young investigators through Career Enhancement Programs in the Lung and developing HNC SPOREs; the UCCC K12; the VA Career Development Program; the NCI T32 developed and led by the Program Leaders; and an NHLBI Pulmonary Sciences T32. Members: The LHN program is comprised of 22 Full and 27 Associate members, from 2 consortium institutions (UCD and VA) and appointed in the Schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine and Public Health at UCD. LHN members hold $3.3M ($1.3M NCI) in peer-reviewed cancer research funding in 2015 and produced 362 cancer-focused publications since 2011, of which 49% were inter- and 30% intra-programmatic, exemplifying the highly interactive nature of the LHN program. Future Directions: The LHN program will further enhance early detection, prevention and biomarker research in lung cancer and HNC and improve the integration of clinical and molecular diagnosis and targeted therapies for LHN cancer patients. We also intend to enhance research in HPV-related HNC and encourage increased research in immunotherapy."
"9271659","Project Summary Young men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV infection in the United States, representing 80% of all infections among youth ages 14-24, and 92% of infections among boys ages 14-19. Despite these risks, the field has not even one HIV prevention intervention shown to be effective in decreasing sexual risks or increasing HIV testing among adolescent MSM (AMSM). Historically, reaching AMSM for HIV prevention has been challenging, given their relative geographic isolation and lack of access to traditional gay congregating spaces (e.g., bars and many gay-related social networking websites). However, our team has developed a novel online platform for delivering interventions to parents of LGB youth that currently sees thousands of visitors each year. HIV prevention advocates have identified parents of AMSM as an untapped resource for reducing HIV risk in this population. Parent-child communication about sex has well-demonstrated associations with adolescent risk behaviors, and interventions with parents of heterosexual youth have been shown to be effective in increasing parent-adolescent communication, and thereby, reducing adolescent health risks. Thus, the goal of the proposed study is to develop an online intervention to increase and improve parent communication with AMSM about sexuality and HIV, with the ultimate goal of decreasing adolescent sexual risk and increasing HIV testing. To achieve this goal, we proposed four specific aims: (1) Identify the ways to best educate, motivate, and guide parents in communicating about sexuality and HIV with their sons by conducting interviews and focus groups with AMSM and their parents, (2) Develop a web-based, multimedia, intervention that motivates and teaches parents how to communicate effectively with their sons about HIV-related topics, (3) Pilot test the acceptability of the intervention and functionality of the system, and (4) Conduct a pilot randomized, controlled trial of the intervention. Aims 1-3 will be achieved by collecting interview and focus group data from AMSM and their parents, and then collaborating with a team of parents and adolescent to synthesize existing data, design the intervention, and test its acceptability and functionality. Aim 4 will be achieved by randomizing parents who come to seek resources on our existing website to receive either our new intervention or control, and then gathering longitudinal, online data from parents in both study arms and their AMSM sons over a 2-4 month period. Importantly, our study team has already demonstrated the feasibility of (a) recruiting parent-AMSM dyads into qualitative research, and (b) utilizing our website to enroll parent-AMSM dyads into longitudinal quantitative research. Thus, our proposal is innovative in that it uses our existing, proven resources to address many of the barriers that have historically plagued research on AMSM and their parents, as well as efforts to intervene with this population. If found to be effective, this would be the first ever HIV prevention intervention shown to work for AMSM ? the population of adolescents who are at highest risk for HIV infection."
"9211382","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of high blood pressure in children and young adults is increasing, yet there remains a large gap in our understanding of the optimal approach to blood pressure management in young individuals. Appropriate blood pressure control should be a priority for young patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease who are at increased future risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality during adulthood. However, few longitudinal studies have examined the association between exposure to different blood pressure levels during youth and subsequent adverse cardiovascular or renal outcomes in later life. Improving the healthcare transition of adolescents with special healthcare needs has been identified as a priority of the American Academies of Pediatrics and Internal Medicine. The transition from adolescence into early adulthood represents a high-risk period for many individuals with chronic illnesses because of frequent non-adherence and suboptimal disease control. A better understanding of blood pressure trends during this period, associated outcomes, and effective interventions that will lower blood pressure in young populations at increased cardiovascular risk is needed to prevent the long-term sequelae of high blood pressure. Dr. Ku is establishing herself as a young investigator who is committed to patient-oriented research focused on hypertension in young populations. This is an initial submission for a K23 award which will provide Dr. Ku with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) to understand BP trends in patients receiving anti- hypertensive therapy during the transition from adolescence into adulthood and risks factors for elevated blood pressure during this period; 2) to study the association between different levels of blood pressure exposure and risk of adverse outcomes in young patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease; 3) to investigate the feasibility of home BP monitor and physical activity tracker use as a means of lowering BP in young populations. This proposal will allow Dr. Ku to 1) perform hypertension research in a multi-disciplinary setting that integrates expertise from the fields of nephrology, cardiology, endocrinology, pediatrics, and transitional care; 2) gain hands-on experience in patient-oriented research, including primary data collection and analysis, trial design, and execution; 3) acquire advanced epidemiology and biostatistical expertise; and 4) set the platform for a career as an independent clinical investigator focused on interventional studies that will test alternate BP targets or home BP monitoring use in high-risk young populations. To achieve these goals, Dr. Ku has assembled a nationally-recognized mentoring team led by her primary mentor, Dr. Chi-yuan Hsu, Chief of the Division of Nephrology, and co-mentor, Dr. Kirsten Johansen, Professor of Medicine at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Ku's larger mentoring team also includes Dr. David Glidden, Professor of the Division of Biostatistics and Dr. Anthony Portale, Chief of the Division of Pediatric Nephrology at UCSF."
"9207452","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9408038","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian intestine is home to a dense community of bacteria that are integral to host health. Alterations in this bacterial population ca cause intestinal distress and even in some cases inflammatory disease. Aside from bacteria, viruses are also abundant in the intestinal tract. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses make up the intestinal virome, however, viruses that infect bacteria, known as bacteriophages (phages), dominate. The majority of intestinal phages exist as lysogenic prophages that are stably integrated into bacterial chromosomes. Prophages typically undergo lytic induction to produce infectious phage particles when bacterial cells are stressed or when they are stimulated by nutrients. Preliminary studies have revealed that the commensal bacterium Enterococcus faecalis V583 induces the prophages when growing in the mouse intestine. In vitro, prophage induction depends on elevated amino acid concentrations; however, the exact mechanisms underlying nutrient-mediated induction of prophages are unknown. Further, in vivo studies indicate that the release of lytic phage particles allows E. faecalis to compete with genetically related enterococci vying for similar intestinal resources. Together, these initial findings indicae that phages can impact the dynamics of bacterial colonization in the mammalian intestinal ecosystem and have established E. faecalis prophages as model intestinal phages for the study of phage-host interactions. The long-term goal of this research is to understand how intestinal bacteriophages impact human physiology and health. The specific research proposed under this K01 award mechanism will advance this goal by defining the mechanisms that elicit phage production in the intestine, by determining how bacteriophage impact host immunity, and by exploring how phage predation impacts bacterial interactions with the host. These studies will provide novel insights into how intestinal phages influence host health and physiology, and will set the stage for future exploration of phage as therapeutic tools for manipulating the microbiota to improve health."
"9385663","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is classically described as a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRP) that transcribes all mRNAs within the eukaryotic cell. Curiously, Pol II also possesses a secondary function as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), using the mouse B2 non-coding RNA as both a template and a substrate for the addition of a distinct 18-nt extension to the B2 RNA 3' end. This extension results in altered stability and function of B2 RNA, suggesting Pol II RdRP activity may modulate RNA metabolism at the post- transcriptional level. While the mechanism and regulation of Pol II DdRP transcription has been extensively studied, little is known about the underlying mechanistic steps of Pol II RdRP 3' extension, the magnitude of RdRP activity within the cell, or the effects of RdRP activity on the stability of RdRP-derived RNAs. The studies proposed here will identify B2 RNA secondary structures that are required for the Pol II RdRP reaction in vitro and within cells. Furthermore, a novel RdRP-sequencing (RdRP-seq) approach will be developed that will allow detection of all cellular RdRP-derived RNAs. After uncovering members of the mammalian RdRPome, the Pol II-specific RdRP-generated RNAs will be identified, and the effects of RdRP activity on RNA half-life will be investigated. These studies will provide valuable insight into the mechanism and biological significance of this unique Pol II RdRP activity."
"9348865","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The major goal of HIV-1 vaccine development is the design of immunogens capable of inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against circulating viruses. Although a number of bnAbs have been identified in HIV-infected individuals who developed broadly neutralizing responses over time, eliciting these bnAbs by immunization is unsuccessful thus far. Because it is highly conserved, CD4 binding site (CD4BS) on HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) is considered a main target for bnAbs, and the anti-CD4BS VRC01-class bnAbs are of particular interest because of their exceptional neutralization potency and breadth. Recent studies showed that the predicted germline precursors of VRC01-class bnAbs lack detectable affinity for native HIV-1 Env. This may explain the failure of all Env immunogens to induce anti-CD4BS bnAb responses. An engineered gl-targeting gp120 outer domain immunogen (eOD-GT) that contains multiple mutations including the removal of key glycosylations at positions 276 and 463 has been reported. Studies showed that eOD-GT6 bound to gl-VRC01, and activates naïve B cells expressing gl-bnAbs in human Ig knock-in mice, but did not elicit bnAbs, while in contrast native-like Env trimers failed to activate the naïve B cells but were needed to select for bnAbs. These data suggest that vaccination to elicit bnAbs may require immunization with a succession of related immunogens, or with a native-like immunogen that binds to bnAb germline precursor. Studies on the glycan profiles showed that there were vast differences in the glycosylation of Env produced in different systems. We therefore produced gp140 trimers in HIV-1 natural host T-lymphocytes to mimic the natural post-translational modification. Our preliminary data showed that the gp140 ? only when produced in T- lymphcytes, not in 293T cells ? was able to bind gl-VRC01. The gp140 produced in T-lymphocytes also exhibits significantly increased binding affinities to other bnAbs, including glycan-dependent PGT126 bnAb and anti-MPER 10E8 bnAb, In this proposal, we will evaluate immunogenicity of the gp140 immunogens produced in T-lymphocytes. The gp140 produced in T-lymphocytes is the first intact, native-like Env trimer in the HIV/AIDS vaccine field that binds the germline precursor of VRC01 bnAb. It binds gl-VRC01 with an affinity similar to eOD-GT6, therefore, like eOD-GT6, it should be able to activate naïve B cells expressing gl-VRC01 in human Ig knock-in mice, and as an intact Env trimer, it should also be able to drive the Ab maturation to finally elicit VRC01-like bnAbs. Determining whether an intact, native-like Env immunogen that binds the germline precursor of VRC01 bnAb can elicit VRC01-like antibodies will have a considerable impact on HIV vaccine design."
"9266984","Summary The Administrative Core supports productive interactions between the different projects and cores, and facilitates communication and data exchange between all associated personnel and the external advisory board (EAB). The Administrative Core will monitor the progress of each project, and the effective utilization of service core resources. Importantly, the core will provide fiscal management ensuring that all funds are utilized efficiently to support the Program Project's mission. A key core activity is to organize an annual review by the EAB, which will be done in the context of a Program Project retreat, where project leaders and trainees will report on scientific progress. This event will complement the bi-monthly project leader and IEC member meetings, and will foster integrated scientific interactions between scientists working in the project leaders' laboratories and core facilities. In addition, the core will facilitate training sessions enabling trainees at Tulane to receive hands-on training at UF in Recombinant Viral Genetics (Core C), and to provide hands-on bioinformatics training at Tulane (Core B) for UF trainees. We note that travel costs for these training-specific activities will be provided as institutional support by the University of Florida. Core A will support the timely publication of findings from the P01 components. Provision of Biostatistics services will be coordinated by Core A. Finally, the core will securely archive research data, share data between groups, and disseminate results with the scientific community after publication. To facilitate these goals, the core will create a Program Project-specific website in close coordination with Core B and Core C."
"9207806","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to plan and execute movements is fundamental to the survival of animals. Inherent in these movements is the necessity for accuracy, accomplished through careful planning and preparation. Notably, this planning and preparation of movement is disrupted in individuals with autism spectrum disorder or Asperger syndrome. In normal functioning brains, during the planning of a movement, collection of evidence allows for environmental stimuli, internal states and projected consequences to be taken into account prior to making confident, robust movements. These preparatory states involve complex sensorimotor transformations, assessment of motivation, and reward association. How are these transformations and associations represented among various regions of the brain comprising the sensorimotor pathway? Previous studies recording neural activity from the primary (M1) and secondary (M2) motor cortices have revealed fundamental principles about their activity during movement behaviors, showing changes in activity during and immediately prior to (i.e. in preparation for) movements. Similarly, recordings made in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) have shown selective modulation of activity prior to movements in a planned direction. Activity prior to movement in each of PPC, M2 and M1 likely plays an integral role in preparing the motor cortex for proper movement execution. Thus understanding their interaction at a network, or population level, will provide a better understanding of the coding strategies surrounding movements. This proposal utilizes in vivo calcium imaging of mice performing a novel memory-guided two-choice sensorimotor discrimination task and has two specific aims, Aim 1: To identify the information flow of preparatory activity between PPC, M2 and M1. Aim 2: To test how population dynamics during preparatory activity affect subsequent movement related activity and movement execution."

"9299994","PROJECT SUMMARY: Human infection by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi leads to inflammatory cardiomyopathy (Chagas disease) which is the leading infectious cause of heart failure in Latin America. The incidence of Chagas disease is increasing worldwide through the migration of chronically infected people from endemic areas. The mechanisms by which the parasite causes inflammation and fibrosis of host tissues are multifactorial and incompletely understood. The focus of this proposal is the parasite protein cyclophilin 19 (Cyp19), a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, which is expressed and secreted by all lifecycle stages of the parasite including the two keys stages that cause human disease. Our work has found that Cyp19 binds to human CD147 (aka, extracellular matrix metalloprotease inducer; EMMPRIN), a ubiquitous cell-surface signaling protein implicated in multiple hyper-inflammatory states. Engagement of CD147 by Cyp19 leads to the production of matrix metalloproteases analogous to the well-documented action of extracellular human cyclophilin A (a structural and functional human homologue of Cyp19) induced inflammation in a variety of human pathologic conditions including cardiac disease. Our hypothesis is that during parasite infection released Cyp19 acts both locally in tissues and systemically as a potent inducer of host tissue inflammation. This is relevant to the inflammation leading to cardiac fibrosis and the development of Chagas cardiomyopathy. The experiments outlined in this exploratory project are designed to test this hypothesis. In the first aim we will interrogate the interaction between parasite Cyp19 and human CD147 using purified Cyp19 and inactive enzyme mutants to test whether Cyp19 enzymatic activity is essential for this activation. Host cell lines engineered to lack expression of CD147 will be used to test the specificity of the induction of inflammation on CD147 and in parasite infection studies to understand the influence of CD147 on parasite infectivity and intracellular growth. Parasites lines engineered to express diminished Cyp19 will be used in host cell infection studies to test the effect of variable amounts of Cyp19, in the context of the parasite, on host infection and the induction of inflammation in CD147-dependent and ?independent conditions. In the second aim we will determine the role of Cyp19 in the induction of tissue inflammation in a mouse model of infection. The effect of wildtype and enzymatically inactive Cyp19 proteins will be used to treat mice to determine if Cyp19 alone, in the absence of parasite infection, can induce tissue inflammation. Infection of mice with wildtype and Cyp19-deficient parasite lines will be compared for levels of parasitemia, induction of cardiac fibrosis and overall mortality. At the conclusion of this project we will understand whether Cyp19 contributes to T. cruzi infection and tissue pathogenesis and the results will provide the groundwork for further mechanistic studies on this pathologic process and the development of small molecule inhibitors for the potential treatment Chagas heart disease."

"9235542","ABSTRACT Accurate breast cancer risk assessment has the potential to distinguish women at higher risk who need enhanced screening, preventive or risk-reducing therapies and surgeries from women at lower risk who can be spared interventions that yield little benefit and may cause harm. Breast cancer risk assessment is currently hampered by limited precision and accuracy of existing risk prediction models. Women with a family history of breast (FHBC) have the greatest need for better risk assessment as they often receive the same clinical recommendations despite substantial heterogeneity in the underlying risk by the extent of FHBC. Integration of mammographic breast density (MBD), a strong and readily assessable risk factor for breast cancer, in combination with detailed FHBC data, offers an exceptional opportunity for enhancing existing risk assessment methods. MBD generally declines with age, but the rate of change varies considerably between women, and may be particularly important to breast cancer risk; we have demonstrated that women who remain at high MBD over time are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women whose MBD decreases. Attempts to improve risk prediction models by incorporating MBD has had limited success as studies have used one-time measures of MBD and included mostly postmenopausal women for whom the largest changes in MBD may have already occurred. We propose to investigate within-individual changes in MBD over a 10- year period in relation to incident breast cancer by the extent of FHBC (Aim 1), and evaluate how changes in MBD may improve several clinical risk prediction models (Aim 2) and clinical risk stratification forming the basis for risk-based surveillance and preventive care (Aim 3). We will address these aims by building upon the U.S. Sister Study, a prospective cohort of 50,884 women with one or more sisters diagnosed with breast cancer who were personally breast cancer-free at enrollment in 2003-2009; active annual follow-up is conducted for at least 10 years with each woman. Using a nested case-control design, we will retrieve existing mammograms for all incident breast cancer cases diagnosed at ages ? 60 years (n=1,242 cases to date) and controls matched on age and enrollment year (2 controls selected per case at the time of case identification). We will undertake a comprehensive assessment of MBD, using both clinically available qualitative measures used in clinical practice, and assessing quantitative measures that allow for measurement of smaller changes and different components of MBD (e.g., dense, nondense tissue) that are independently associated with breast cancer risk. Our team?s experience in leading studies of MBD and prospective available data in the Sister Study will afford an unparalleled investigation of prospective MBD changes in relation to breast cancer risk, modifiable and genetic factors, and how to use this information to enhance risk assessment in women with FHBC. These results are necessary to inform personalized risk-based surveillance and prevention programs."
"9314348","Project Summary/ Abstract Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a leading cause of antibiotic overuse worldwide. Rapid, accurate identification of a pathogen can reduce antibiotic overuse for ARTIs, but is not always possible with available diagnostics. In low- or middle-income countries (LMICs), ARTI diagnosis is further complicated by limited laboratory infrastructure. Previously, the applicant showed that providing access to rapid antigen-based influenza testing in a LMIC setting was associated with a significant decrease in antibiotic use; however, the majority of influenza-positive patients still received antibiotic prescriptions. Physicians later cited diagnostic uncertainty regarding bacterial infection as a major reason for antibiotic over-prescription. To more effectively minimize antibiotic use for ARTIs, diagnostics that broadly classify infections as bacterial or viral may play an important role. The long-term goal of the applicant is to become an independent investigator developing effective strategies for using novel diagnostics to improve antimicrobial stewardship in LMIC settings. The work proposed in this application will be carried out in a LMIC with the objectives of 1) defining the epidemiology of ARTIs, 2) refining a novel host-based gene expression assay that differentiates between viral and bacterial ARTIs, and 3) determining the performance characteristics of procalcitonin and gene signatures at differentiating between viral and bacterial ARTIs. To accomplish these goals, the applicant will carry out the project under the mentorship of experts in genomics, infectious disease diagnostics, antibiotic resistance/ stewardship, and global health. The proposed Specific Aims will be carried out at a tertiary care hospital in Sri Lanka and include the following: 1) Determine the frequency distribution of viral and bacterial respiratory infections among patients with acute febrile respiratory illness, 2) Refine a gene expression classifier to distinguish viral and bacterial ARTIs, and 3) Prospectively enroll a cohort of ARTI patients to assess the performance characteristics of procalcitonin and gene expression classifiers at differentiating between viral and bacterial ARTIs. By conducting this work, the applicant proposes to fill an important gap in knowledge regarding the applicability of host-based technologies for diagnosing ARTIs in a South Asian, LMIC population. The proposed comprehensive five-year plan includes didactic sessions, hands-on laboratory and bioinformatics work, antimicrobial stewardship and clinical trials training, and structured mentorship to develop the candidate as an independent and successful researcher. The completion of these aims and the acquisition of skills during the training period would place the applicant in a competitive position to apply for future R01 funding. By the conclusion of the award period, the applicant will have contributed significantly to the knowledge of how host-based technologies perform at diagnosing ARTIs in a South Asian, LMIC setting, and will be poised to become a leader in developing effective strategies for improving the rational use of antibiotics in resource-limited settings."
"9259019","PROPOSAL SUMMARY Discovery of endogenous stem cells found within the heart, cardiac progenitor cells (CPC), has prompted intense basic discovery in multiple experimental animal models and clinical trials in heart failure patients. A survey of the literature reveals that the most popular experimental animal models exhibiting regenerative properties are also characterized by genome duplication or polyploidy. Our lab has recently discovered a fundamental difference between human and rodent CPCs: rodent CPCs possess polyploid mononuclear tetraploid (4n) chromatin content, whereas human CPCs are mononuclear diploid (2n) cells. This fundamental biological distinction between humans and rodents prompts provocative questions regarding regenerative potential differences between humans versus other species as well as the translational applicability of regenerative studies performed in rodent models. If ploidy is an integral aspect of tissue regeneration in lower vertebrates and other species, then elucidating the biological basis of CPC ploidy and mechanistic differences in cell signaling and mitosis between polyploid rodent CPCs versus diploid human CPCs will provide important insight for enhancement of regenerative potential. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that mononuclear chromatin duplication in CPCs improves regenerative capacity of the heart by overriding senescence-induced cell cycle arrest and increasing tolerance of DNA damage and oxidative stress. The short-term goal is to establish biological distinctions and elucidate unique molecular properties of polyploidy CPCs relative to diploid human CPCs. The significance is to understand the advantages of polyploidy for regeneration while also uncovering previously unrecognized limitations of extrapolating from experimental animal model studies to clinical interventional approaches. Two specific aims are proposed based upon the following hypotheses: (1) Chromatin content in murine CPCs responds to alterations in environment leading to changes in gene transcription and mitotic chromosomal alignment, and (2) CPCs of murine origin with tetraploid content possess enhanced regenerative characteristics and potential relative to diploid CPCs by phenotypic analysis as well as following adoptive transfer into an experimental infarction injury model. The novelty and impact is to define novel biological attributes of a well-known and heavily studied cardiac stem cell and to apply that understanding to elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of regenerative responses in human versus murine myocardial responses to pathologic injury. The long-term goal is to apply the knowledge gained from understanding the role of polyploidy in regeneration to improve upon clinically relevant therapies in the treatment of heart failure."
"9230372","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nicotine addiction remains a major health problem in the US and throughout the world. The rewarding effects of nicotine are well-documented, but higher doses of nicotine have intensely aversive effects. Initial responses to nicotine can predict future dependence (i.e., subjects whose first nicotine experiences were rewarding are more likely to become nicotine dependent relative to subjects whose first nicotine experiences were aversive). Thus, the balance between nicotine reward and aversion likely contributes to the development and maintenance of nicotine addiction. Despite considerable understanding of the effects of nicotine on reward-related circuitry, treatments for nicotine dependent populations remain limited. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie aversion to nicotine can provide novel insights into the factors that contribute to nicotine dependence. These insights have the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets and strategies.  Recently, the projection from the medial habenula (MHb) to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) was shown to mediate nicotine aversion. Suppressing MHb-IPN activity reduces the aversive effects of nicotine, while enhancing MHb-IPN activity enhances aversion to nicotine. Although these results implicate the MHb-IPN circuitry, the downstream post-synaptic targets of the IPN and the neurotransmitters involved remain largely uncharacterized. Some evidence suggests that this circuitry ultimately suppresses VTA dopamine (DA) neurons. Burst activity in DA neurons has been linked to motivated behaviors, and suppression of DA neuron output results in an aversive experience. While the IPN projects to several brain areas, it strongly innervates the lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), a brainstem cholinergic center that controls burst firing of VTA DA neurons. Activation of LDTg neurons that project to the VTA results in enhanced activity in the VTA as well as conditioned place preference, whereas inhibition of VTA DA neurons has been linked to conditioned place aversion. Therefore, inhibiting the LDTg (via IPN excitation), and consequently VTA DA neurons, may diminish the rewarding effects of nicotine.  Experiments outlined in this proposal will examine the cellular mechanisms underlying the aversive effects of nicotine and how this aversion impacts reward circuitry. We will use optogenetic strategies to explore the cellular mechanisms mediating the communication between the MHb-IPN pathway and VTA DA neurons. Causal links between these pathways and nicotine-induced behaviors will be explored by optogenetic excitation or inhibition of these pathways while testing nicotine-related behaviors. Exploring the mechanisms by which the MHb-IPN circuitry mediates nicotine-aversion could yield novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies for helping smokers quit successfully."
"9274912","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proper control of acute and chronic pain is one of the most important areas in health care. Despite the profound advances in neuroscience over the past 20 years, we still largely use opiate narcotics, much as was done in the Civil War. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed. While knee pain is often a complaint that precedes TKA, the procedure itself is associated with considerable post-operative pain lasting days to weeks, and adequate postoperative pain control is an important factor in determining recovery time, hospital length of stay, and long-term surgical outcomes. Primary methods used to manage post-operative pain primarily involve systemic opiates. Despite available strategies, patients still report considerable post-operative pain, and often struggle to complete post-operative physical therapy regimens. Additionally, systemic opiates have associated side-effects that can lead to post-operative complications including but not limited to mental-clouding, confusion, addiction, respiratory depression, interactions with other medications, and fatigue. These are not trivial concerns as the population receiving TKA are more and more likely to be elderly and/or overweight and thus these complications can have serious negative consequences. New analgesic strategies are needed that can be used adjunctively to existing strategies with the potential to reduce reliance on opioid analgesia. Several novel brain stimulation technologies including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are beginning to demonstrate promise as treatments for a variety of pain conditions. Electricity has no metabolite or other residue, and can be delivered with minimal discomfort and without problems associated with drug-drug interactions. In two preliminary studies, the investigators have found that tDCS can reduce post-operative PCA use by as much as 46% in TKA patients while simultaneously reducing subjective pain ratings. These findings are promising, but this new technology is in its infancy, and a foundation of well-controlled, high-quality clinical trials needs to be established before this field moves forward. The proposed study will be the first randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial of the effects of tDCS on subjective pain-ratings, PCA opioid usage, and post- operative complications among veterans receiving unilateral TKA surgery. Further, this study will examine the relative efficacy of 3 different tDCS dosing strategies compared to sham stimulation. Data from this trial will likely yield information regarding the feasibility and efficacy of tDCS as a post-operative pain-management approach. If the proposed pilot trial suggests significant and meaningful effects of tDCS as an adjunctive post- operative pain management strategy, this could change the way post-operative pain management is approached in the future."
"9259139","Abstract Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth leading incidence of cancer worldwide. Standard therapies can be effective for site-specific subsets, but overall the 5-year survival rate is 40-50%. We hypothesize that significant improvements in patient survival will require the development of precision medicine protocols, in which treatments are designed to target the specific disease process of the individual patient. The potential for targeted therapy in HNSCC has been shown with the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitor Cetuximab, in which Cetuximab and radiation extended patient survival by 19.3 months in comparison to radiation alone. However, as the sensitivity and resistance mechanisms are unknown, there are no biomarkers that predict response to targeted EGFR inhibition. Likewise, patients that relapse from this therapy often have highly aggressive and rapidly lethal recurrences. A better understanding of the compensatory pathways that rescue tumor growth is needed to devise more effective combination strategies and improve patient survival. Our central hypothesis is that there are specific compensatory pathways containing targetable genes that drive resistance to EGFR inhibition, and that disruption of these genes will overcome resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies. Our initial study used the Genome CRISPR Knock-Out (GeCKO) library, a CRISPR/Cas9 library that created a stable pool of 18,000+ genetic knock-outs, and we observed that knock-outs in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) pathway sensitized cells to a low dosage of an EGFR inhibitor in a subset of models. Further preliminary data indicates that 40% of our HNSCC models that are resistant to EGFR inhibition are sensitive to the combination of EGFR and FGFR inhibition. For this proposal, we will extend this observation to assess the mechanistic role of FGFR kinase compensation in rescuing cell survival during EGFR inhibition, as well as identify novel mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in the remaining 60% of models. In identifying and understanding the compensatory pathways that drive resistance to EGFR inhibition, this proposal will help to develop precision medicine protocols using combination therapies for patients with HNSCC."
"9254748","Project Summary/Abstract  During the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cells undergo a switch from a polarized, epithelial state to a highly motile and more aggressive mesenchymal phenotype that is associated with cancer stem cells (CSC) and metastases (1,2). Our lab has identified a regulatory mechanism by which Transforming Growth Factor-? (TGF?) induces EMT at the translational step of gene expression (3-5). An inhibitory complex consisting of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 (hnRNP-E1) and eukaryotic elongation factor 1a1 (eEF1a1) suppresses translational elongation through binding to the 3'UTR of several EMT-inducing genes. TGF? stimulation promotes the release of this complex by Akt2-mediated phosphorylation of hnRNP-E1 at Ser43. Among the mRNAs controlled by this mechanism is the cytokine Interleukin-like EMT Inducer (ILEI), a secreted factor belonging to the FAM3 family. The biochemical mechanism of the ILEI pathway and identification of the ILEI receptor has remained elusive. The basis of this proposal aims to investigate the mechanism of the ILEI signaling pathway and its contribution to EMT and CSC formation.  In order to identify potential ILEI binding partners, we utilized yeast two-hybrid screening and observed that ILEI interacts with the 190kD leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). LIFR is cross-reactive with several cytokine ligands and forms a complex with glycoprotein 130 (GP130) and an array of other ligand-specific co- receptors during signal transduction (9,10). In order to investigate whether ILEI signals through the LIFR/GP130 complex, we have expressed and purified a construct of ILEI that can rescue TGF?-mediated EMT in cells with ILEI silenced as well as induce activation of LIFR/GP130. Therefore, we hypothesize that ILEI-induced EMT and CSC formation is achieved through its ligand binding and activation of the LIFR/GP130 receptor complex.  We will address this hypothesis through a set of specific aims. Aim 1 will validate the LIFR/GP130 receptor complex as the bona-fide ILEI receptor. We will show that ILEI interacts with LIF-R and induces cross phosphorylation of both LIFR and GP130 that further activates the Jak/STAT pathway. These results will allow for establishment of an ILEI-specific gene-signature. Aim 2 will elucidate the contribution of ILEI signaling to CSC formation, tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo through modulation of the ILEI pathway. We will show that abrogation of ILEI signaling will subsequently block these phenotypes. Taken together, this proposal will confirm the molecular mechanism of ILEI signaling, promoting future studies into the development of targeted drug therapies against TGF?-mediated breast cancer metastasis."
"9207442","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9259268","Project Summary  Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (i.e. bladder cancer) is the most common primary tumor of the urothelial tract. Bladder cancer recurrence and metastases remain common and are significant contributors to patient morbidity and mortality. Despite the high prevalence of recurrence and metastasis, no new treatment options have been introduced for advanced disease in the past three decades. Many patients who initially respond to standard of care treatment exhibit refractory disease within a few years. Furthermore, patients with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis often exhibit resistance to standard of care therapeutic treatment. These cases underscore the urgent need for new therapies. One potential target for new therapy is fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), which is frequently mutated in bladder cancer. In vitro studies with FGFR3 inhibitors showed promising results, however, the in vivo responses were more modest. Currently, it is unknown what modulates response to FGFR3 inhibition in vivo, but I hypothesize that the microenvironment is contributing to resistance mechanisms in bladder cancer.  The goal of this proposal is to better understand the roles that the tumor microenvironment plays in resistance of bladder cancers to Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) inhibition. The overall hypothesis is that constituents of the tumor microenvironment confer resistance to FGFR3 inhibition and promote metastasis in bladder cancer, and that response may depend on cellular differentiation state. This hypothesis will be tested by employing MicroEnvironment MicroArrays (MEMA), which consists of robotically printed growth pads made up of combinations of functional extracellular matrix (ECM) components, growth factors and cytokines found in different local and metastatic microenvironments, allowing for systematic assessment of microenvironment effects on cellular phenotypes in a rational reductionist manner. Based on preliminary data, the specific aims of this proposal are as follows: (1) Determine the role that the microenvironment plays in resistance to FGFR3 inhibition in bladder cancer, and (2) Investigate the role that the microenvironment plays in expression of differentiation state markers in response to FGFR3 inhibition in bladder cancer. Results from this proposal have the potential to provide new information that will enable us to devise novel targeted approaches aimed at anticipating or overcoming resistance to FGFR3 inhibition and preventing metastases in this disease. Thus, this project has the potential to greatly impact bladder cancer patients' quality of life and overall survival."

"9197890","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The androgen receptor (AR) is a nuclear hormone receptor and promotes prostate cancer growth through activation of its downstream target genes. Although the targets of AR activation remain unclear, they are believed to be critical for cellular proliferation because most prostate cancers express the AR and are androgen-dependent. That depletion of androgens results in significant regression of prostate tumors was demonstrated in 1941 by Charles Huggins and Clarence Hodges and heralded what is now the ubiquitous strategy of androgen deprivation therapy to treat prostate cancer. Unfortunately, within two to three years after initiating therapy, most patients invariably relapse with a more aggressive form of prostate cancer, known as castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). There is no effective treatment option for CRPC, which has mainly contributed to the mortality of the disease.  AR gene amplification has been observed in almost one-third of prostate cancers after androgen ablation therapy. Global gene expression profiling shows AR as the only gene to be consistently up-regulated in CRPC, implicating the significance of AR in disease progression. We and others have provided multiple lines of evidence demonstrating a critical role of AR in ligand-independent cell growth, implying that androgen- independent cells may still be AR dependent and that the AR can be used as a possible therapeutic target. However, the precise role of the AR in prostate cancer progression and CRPC development is still unclear. One of the main reasons for the limited progress is the lack of appropriate animal models that can be used to evaluate ligand independent AR action during the course of disease progression. To address this, we have developed several novel mouse models that allow us to investigate the progression of prostate cancer that is androgen independent but AR-dependent, mimicking what typically occurs in most human prostate cancers. In this competing renewal, we propose three different but integrated specific aims to directly test our central hypothesis that abnormal activation of AR dysregulates cell differentiation and proliferation that directly contribute to prostate cancer initiation and progression. Three specific aims are proposed in this application to address three different but related questions: 1) how abnormal activation of AR promotes tumor progression? 2) does aberrant activation of AR induce expression and activation of ETS proteins in promoting prostate cancer progression? 3) what are the molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant activation of AR in prostate cancer progression and CRPC development?"

It is essential that these be performed in a unified and standardized way so that data can be compared within projects and conveyed between them. Each project will use cell lines engineered by advanced methods for disruption or depletion of specific genes. It is essential that each cell line is propagated under optimal conditions, that the genetic identify of each cell is established beyond doubt, and that cells are free of mycoplasma and other infections. Core A will perform the clonogenic survival assays that will be fundamental to the success of all four Projects. Second, the Core will characterize, maintain quality control of, preserve and distribute a large number of cell lines, which will allow the projects the core is supporting to progress more rapidly. Finally, Core A will produce large-scale cultures of mammalian cells containing overexpressed protein for transfer to Projects when needed for subsequent protein purification."
"9213344","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bacterial biofilms consist of surface adherent bacteria that surround themselves with a polymer matrix that provides environmental protection and antibiotic resistance. Biofilms can grow on most implanted medical devices, on heart valves, and in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis, resulting in difficult to treat infections that an become blood-borne and spread throughout the body. Understanding the physical properties of biofilms is therefore of interest as such insight may lead to methods for their disruption and removal. Biofilms have been characterized biochemically, as the general composition of the matrix is known, as are the specific polysaccharides forming the bulk of the matrix for some species. Insight into physical properties of biofilms, such as elasticity and deformability, has been limited to macroscale techniques that assess averaged values. These techniques do not provide details on the spatial gradients of physical properties within a biofilm. Particle trackin is a technique in which multiple microbeads are placed in a material and observed using microscopy, allowing for the determination of physical properties and structure of the material they are embedded in. In this project, particle tracking will be used to assess various living biofilm systems. The overall goal is to gain an understanding of the structure, physical properties, and dynamics of biofilms, and to understand the effects of modulations in age and genetics of the organisms or environmental conditions. The first specific aim is to develop a system for probing the structure and properties of biofilms by using particle tracking to understand a model biofilm system. This will be accomplished by adding microbeads of various sizes and charges to a biofilm either while it is growing or after it has been formed, and then using the motion of the beads to characterize the system. The second specific aim is to actively move beads through a biofilm to understand biofilm dynamics and response to internal perturbation. Magnetic beads will be embedded into a biofilm and moved via magnetic tweezers to deform biofilm and measure how quickly it loses memory of the deformation. In addition, by using fluorescent bacteria it will be possible to analyze if applied internal forces result in bacterial displacement and motion, indicating that it may be possible to activate them within a biofilm. The third and fourth specific aims involve using particle tracking to understand internal  perturbation of biofilm structure via the analysis of bacterial strains lacking matrix components and external perturbation of biofilm structure through the addition of known dispersal agents. The technique developed in the first aim will be used to assess the structure of these biofilms as compared to native biofilms in order to understand how to best compromise the integrity of biofilm structure."
"9221274","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Breast cancer has become a curable disease if it is diagnosed at an early stage; however, more than 90% of breast cancer deaths are still attributed to metastases and bone is the major distant organ of metastatic breast tumor growth. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to elucidate the exact pathological mechanism of bone metastasis to identify a specific therapeutic target for this devastating disease. The recent cancer stem cell theory, which still remains as a hypothesis, predicts that there is a distinct population of metastatic cells that have stem-like characteristics as well as invasive ability. Our preliminary data indicate that (i) cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) from highly metastatic cell lines express a high level of hyaluronan synthase gene 2 (HAS2) which is significantly correlated with patient metastasis-free survival, (ii) HAS2 in CSCs significantly activates the expression of PDGF-BB in tumor associated macrophage (TAM) through interaction of hyaluronic acid (HA) in CSCs and CD44 in TAM, which then activates the expression of FGF7 and FGF9 in bone niche cells followed by stimulating self-renewal of CSCs and (iii) the inhibitor of HAS2, 4MU, can block this vicious cycle in the bone niche and significantly suppress bone metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In the current grant application, we propose our novel hypotheses that (i) high expression of HA in CSCs facilitates a take-over of pre-existing niche of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the bone and activates TAM and mobilizes the bone niche, which in turn promotes self-renewal of CSC and (ii) a prodrug inhibitor for HAS2 can be used for preventive and therapeutic intervention of metastatic disease. To test these hypotheses, we will first examine the role of HAS2 of CSCs in bone metastasis in vivo and also test the efficacy of a novel pro- drug of HAS2 inhibitor in our animal model of bone metastasis (Aim 1). We will also elucidate the mechanism by which HAS2 promotes self-renewal of CSC by mobilizing bone microenvironment in vitro (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will directly examine the clinical relevance of HAS2 in breast cancer metastasis and identify potential diagnostic/prognostic markers for bone metastasis (Aim 3). The ultimate goal of this project is to define the pathological process of bone metastasis and identify specific therapeutic and preventive targets for this devastating disease. We do believe that the proposed hypothesis, if proven to be valid, will present a novel paradigm to understand the pathological mechanism of bone metastasis which will significantly impact the treatment of breast cancer."

"9257987","Project Summary Recent research in evolutionary biology has begun to untangle the historical paths and mechanisms underlying how new molecular functions evolve. However, considerably less is known about why a particular path is taken by evolution or why a specific biochemical mechanism is used to evolve the new function in the first place. Was this the only path and mechanism available to evolution? Or did alternative paths and mechanisms exist, but were simply more difficult for evolution to find? Is selection capable of driving evolution towards a particular outcome or along a particular path, or is the result of evolution fundamentally dependent on chance events? What are the forces that determine the number of alternative paths and mechanisms available to evolution? Could other functions have evolved instead? To answer these questions, we need to know not only what has occurred during evolution, but also what else was possible. This project will address these questions using steroid receptor proteins as a model system. These proteins play important roles in human physiology and development and underlie risk of several human cancer types. As a consequence, the paths and mechanisms towards altered molecular function of steroid receptor proteins are of general medical relevance. To identify alternative outcomes and paths towards new molecular functions, a recently developed system for locus specific experimental evolution will be used to evolve an ancestral steroid receptor protein towards its modern function within the laboratory. By using an ancestral protein, this project will ?replay the tape of life? and explore multiple alternative evolutionary outcomes of an important transition in DNA binding specificity that underlies modern steroid receptors ability to activate distinct sets of genes in response to distinct steroid cues. In addition to determining how else the historical change in DNA specificity could have arisen, this project will evolve the same ancestral protein towards changes in DNA specificity that did not, but could have, occurred in nature to identify alternative paths that evolution may have taken given another opportunity. Using these evolved paths, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the changes in specificity will be determined and compared to the mechanism historically used by evolution. Finally, the sites of substitution, the types of substitution, and the mechanisms underlying change in DNA specificity will be compared among and between alternative paths and alternative changes in specificity to identify the determinants of why evolution found the particular outcome, took the particular path, and used the particular mechanism that it did. Answers to these questions will create a deeper understanding of how the evolutionary process works and help determine the extent to which changes in molecular function are restricted by the shape of sequence space and the evolutionary process."
"9390387","Project Summary The ability to genetically incorporate non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) in a site-specific manner has revolutionized the field of protein biochemistry by providing novel tools for studying and engineering proteins and has had a pronounced influence in several biomedical fields including regulating protein function, in vivo imaging of proteins, and designing novel therapeutics. In this technology an orthogonal amino acyl-tRNA synthetase and tRNA pair (RS/tRNA) that is evolved for new ncAA structure is added to the cell. Despite the advantages offered by ncAA incorporation, the practical limits on the size of the libraries for RS evolution restrict the number of residues that can be mutated at each round. Hence, several beneficial interactions in the first shell and all second shell interactions are overlooked. Therefore, selected ncAA-RSs don't match the catalytic constants of wild type translation resulting in low ncAA-protein expression yield and lack of selectivity under many protein expression conditions.  Rosetta computational design program offers an exciting novel option for overcoming this key limitation in genetic code expansion. Tetrazine-based amino acids (Tet-ncAAs) offer extremely fast and robust bioorthogonal chemistry for site specific labeling of proteins and therefore will be an ideal model system for Rosetta based optimization. Fast protein bioorthogonal ligations are being implemented in biomedical research and material science for many applications including in vivo imaging, probing protein function, drug delivery, and protein-polymer hybrids. Engineering Tet-ncAA-RSs is uniquely challenging in addition to the above-mentioned reasons because the more reactive Tet-ncAAs add additional stress to selection methods.  In this proposal, I will use Rosetta to design better Tet-RSs and to obtain structural insights into the residues important for binding. This information guides the generation of ?smart libraries? with a higher chance of success via screening lesser variants to overcome the size limitation. In parallel, I will also improve upon current functionalities in Rosetta by designing novel protocols and enhancing score functions. This enhancements and additions will be publicly available. The design of superior sets of RSs for efficient and selective incorporation of Tet-ncAAs provides scientists with an ideal tool for site-specific labeling of proteins in vivo in a fast and bioorthogonal manner. This ability is of unequivocal importance for many applications in biomedical research. The proposed strategy can be generalized to other ncAAs or to address other issues in the field of genetic code expansion. It will also lay the foundations of a lasting collaboration between the fields of computational protein design and genetic code expansion."
"9208534","ABSTRACT Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting over 1.5 million children and adults in the United States. Heterotaxy syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by a spectrum of CHDs that are attributable, at least in part, to abnormal left-right asymmetry. Although the link between left-right patterning and subsequent cardiac morphogenesis is not well understood, it is apparent that the ventricular chamber morphogenic defects seen in heterotaxy are more diverse than what would be expected from simple disruption of the left-right axis. This research will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying abnormal cardiac morphogenesis observed in heterotaxy using two mouse models of left-right patterning defects: Foxj1 and Zic3 deficient mice. Foxj1 is required for ciliogenesis and mice deficient for this gene fail to develop cilia at the node, a tissue required for normal left-right patterning. Zic3, the gene responsible for X-linked heterotaxy, exhibits abnormalities of the primitive streak including the node. Previously, we demonstrated that expression of Zic3 is required by the mesendodermal cells of the primitive streak for normal cardiac development, but is not required in the heart. The posterior primitive streak gives rise to cardiac progenitor/precardiac mesoderm (CPPM), and the anterior primitive streak gives rise to the ciliated node, thus Zic3 deficiency may cause CHDs via temporally distinct, combinatorial events. These results could provide explanations for the wide phenotypic variability identified in heterotaxy, suggesting a ?multiple developmental hits? model. Our findings suggest the novel hypothesis that the diverse spectrum of CHDs observed in heterotaxy results from abnormal specification, proliferation, and/or cell fate of cardiac progenitors that is distinct from the later left-right patterning effects on heart looping. We will test this hypothesis in both mouse models. The aims of this study are to: 1) determine whether CPPM and node cells independently cause CHDs, and whether cell polarity abnormalities underlie early and/or late stage events; and 2) test the hypothesis that distinct cardiac-lineages are impacted in CHDs from mice with different genetic causes of left- right patterning abnormalities. The overarching hypothesis is that PCCM abnormalities and left-right abnormalities have distinct contributions to the CHDs identified in heterotaxy and that abnormalities in cell proliferation or cell polarity underlie these abnormalities. By delineation of Zic3 function in early mesoderm, we will acquire essential information about normal primitive streak and node formation, left-right axis specification, and their relationship to cardiac looping and ventricular morphogenesis. Identification of the cell lineage contribution to CHDs seen in heterotaxy will provide novel information about causation and phenotypic heterogeneity. Collectively, these studies will define the requirement of gastrulation-stage and node-stage molecular interactions along with their impact on cell fate specification necessary for normal cardiac morphogenesis."
"9211329","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Corneal infections caused by the Gram positive bacterial Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Strep) occur in the USA and worldwide, causing painful, sight-threatening disease. Further, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are becoming more common, as MRSA are more difficult to treat and are more virulent than methicillin sensitive strains. The Aims of this proposal will focus on the role of IL1ß in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae keratitis because our preliminary data show that this cytokine has a critical role in regulating corneal infection by either bacteria. IL-1ß secretion requires tw signals - Signal 1 for transcription, and Signal 2 for enzymatic processing; therefore, Aim 1 will examine the role of bacterial cell wall in inducing NOD2/RIP2 signaling in IL-1ß-/- transcription, and Aim 2 will examine the role of Staph aureus ?-hemolysin and Strep pneumoniae pneumolysin induction of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome in caspase-1 mediated IL-1ß cleavage. Aim 3 will examine the role of ATP and purinergic receptors in amplifying inflammasome activity and IL-1ß production. Results of these studies will identify novel pathways that can be targeted for anti-inflammatory therapies."
"9294157","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research is designed to use a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach to achieve three research objectives: (1) to identify factors that can be incorporated into expanded Minority Stress Model developed by the PI; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Men of Color Health Awareness (MOCHA) program, and an enhanced MOCHA+ program that uses narrative communication strategies, in lowering stress and risk of chronic diseases in a randomized controlled trial; and (3) to determine those individual, interpersonal and social structural factors that have an impact on stress and the health of low income African- American men. The MOCHA program is the result of a grassroots, community-driven initiative to address the heavy burden of health disparities experienced by low-income African-American men living in Springfield MA. The MOCHA program is sustained by a public - private collaboration between the local chapter of the YMCA and the state Department of Public Health. The MOCHA program is designed to address the physical, mental, social, and spiritual needs of men of color simultaneously in an integrated fashion. It consists of a 12-week program comprised of: (1) 60-minutes of moderately intensive aerobic exercise twice a week; (2) small group discussions of issues facing men of color, in particular, the potentially harmful effects of socially constructed definitions of black masculinity and associated issues of stress, violence, depression and substance abuse; (3) classes on health topics pertinent to chronic disease control, such as nutrition, obesity, high blood pressure, fitness and the social determinants of health. In utilizing a CBPR methodology, university researchers will partner with the MOCHA Steering Committee in all phases of the research, from identifying the main research questions, to identifying mediating factors implicit in the MOCHA model to utilizing appropriate research instruments to answer the primary research question, to data collection and analysis, to disseminating the results of the research, in appropriate fashion, to different audiences. The proposed research methods include: individual interviews of MOCHA participants, ethnographic field observations of digital storytelling (DST) workshops, survey questionnaires and the collection of physiological measures such as cortisol, blood pressure, and BMI. The results of this research will contribute to the identification of effective interventins to address health disparities in low-income African-American men and the dissemination of effective chronic disease prevention programming."
"9239003","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are over half a million young adult cancer survivors (YACS) in the United States. YACS are an underserved and vulnerable subgroup of survivors that experience increased risk over time for obesity and chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Increasing physical activity (PA) is a promising behavioral intervention that has positive effects on physical function, body composition, cardiovascular fitness, and health-related quality of life. To date, few interventions have been designed specifically to promote PA in YACS, and none have been successful in promoting long-term adherence to PA guidelines of 150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity. Effective PA interventions have used self-monitoring as a behavior change technique to help individuals monitor daily activity, set goals, and enhance motivation. In our pilot randomized trial of a social cognitive theory-based, Facebook-delivered PA intervention for YACS (n=86), intervention participants increased self-reported total PA compared with a self-help group (237 vs. 76 minutes/week; p=0.07, d = 0.39), which was driven by differences in light PA (164 minutes/week vs. 29 minutes/week; p=0.03). The emergence of lower-cost and widely available wearable activity trackers represents a unique opportunity to simplify self-monitoring and deliver more precisely tailored PA interventions that dynamically adapt goals and messages in response to an individual's changing activity patterns over time so as to provide more relevant and timely support. Building on the promise shown by our pilot study and utilizing self-regulation approaches that our team has used to target PA as part of a successful weight gain prevention intervention in young adults, we aim to bolster intervention effects on PA using activity trackers and theory-based enhancements. This research proposes a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a theory-based, mobile PA intervention with adaptive goal-setting and tailored feedback that is aimed at increasing PA among YACS. YACS (n=280), diagnosed between ages 18-39, will be recruited and randomized into one of two conditions: 1) activity tracker + Facebook group (Self-help) or 2) activity tracker + Facebook group + adaptive goal-setting and tailored feedback (Intervention). We plan to enroll YACS in a 6-month intervention followed by an additional 6 months of tapered contacts to address the following specific aims: 1) Determine the effects of a theory-based, mobile PA intervention compared with a self-help control group on changes in total PA. 2) Determine whether changes in social cognitive factors mediated the intervention effects on PA outcomes. 3) Explore whether intervention effects differed across potential demographic and health- related moderators. Assessments of objectively-measured PA (using ActiGraph accelerometers) and other outcomes will be completed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. In the proposed study, we seek to promote PA among an underserved population of YACS using a high-reach, low-cost, technology-based strategy that can be adopted on a larger scale and thus has high potential for reducing cancer-related morbidity and disparities."
"9205502","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular disorders are permanent impairments for many people. They often stem from the loss of sensory hair cells in the inner ear, a population of cells that cannot be replaced when they die. Recent reports have shown that inner ear supporting cells, which neighbor sensory hair cells, can be coaxed into directly transdifferentiating into sensory hair cells in injured tissue. However, to achieve tue regeneration, inner ear supporting cells must also be guided into proliferation. We hypothesize that signaling through the ErbB2 receptor is sufficient to drive inner ear supporting cells to proliferate. We will test this hypothesis by over-expressing a constitutively activated (CA) ErbB2 receptor in auditory and balance supporting cells in the inner ear, and assessing subsequent proliferation. We present preliminary data with two independent CA-ErbB2 expression systems. Moreover, we show that both neonatal cochlear supporting cells and adult utricular supporting cells proliferate in response to CA-ErbB2 signaling in organ culture. Our first system uses two custom-built adenoviruses to over-express two mutated versions of the ErbB2 protein: one that is constitutively active, and one that is inert. In Aim 1, we will infect neonatal cochlear supportng cells with these viruses in vitro. We show preliminary data demonstrating that only the CA-ErbB2 virus activates phosphoinositol 3-kinase's (PI3K) regulatory subunit. Moreover, we show that the CA-ErbB2 virus drives proliferation among neonatal cochlear supporting cells in vitro. Surprisingly, CA-ErbB2 exerts some of its effects indirectly, as cells neighboring infected cells are also stimulated to divide. This finding highlights the power of using overexpression to investigate receptor function. We will quantify these results and probe the downstream effectors of the CA-ErbB2 receptor with reporter assays and chemical inhibitors. These experiments will define ErbB2's role in proliferation in neonatal mouse cochlear supporting cells. Our second system uses transgenic Tet-On technology to over-express a mutated, constitutively active ErbB2 protein in mouse supporting cells at different stages. We show preliminary data demonstrating that this system also activates PI3K. We also show that transgenic CA-ErbB2 signaling drives proliferation in neonatal cochlear supporting cells in vitro. Because Tet-On technology allows us to control both the timing and duration of the CA-ErbB2 signal, we will deliver a pulse of signaling and assess first if supporting cells divide, and second, if they trans differentiate into hair cells. In Aim 2, we propose to use this system to activate CA-ErbB2 signaling in cochlear supporting cells at different stages, with and without hair cell injury, to determine if ErbB2 signaling is sufficient to promote proliferation in vivo. In Aim 3, we will use both the CA-ErbB2 virus and the transgenic system to drive proliferation in adult utricular supporting cells in vitro, after hair cell injury. These experiments will illuminate how proliferaton in mammalian cochlear supporting cells can be regulated and significantly advance our understanding of inner ear regeneration."
"9230452","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant genetic neurological disorder, caused by an expansion in the CAG region of the human huntingtin gene (HTT). This mutation causes a toxic gain of function to the encoded mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT), which is expressed ubiquitously in both peripheral tissues and the brain. mHTT expression levels are highest in the CNS, and the striatum, cortex, and hypothalamus are most severely affected. HD typically onsets in midlife and consist of severe motor, cognitive, psychiatric, and metabolic symptoms, which worsen over 10-15 years and always lead to death. In human HD patients and in transgenic HD mice there is a robust, significant elevation in circulating glucocorticoid levels. Human HD patients show a two-fold elevation of serum cortisol and transgenic HD mice show a six-fold elevation in corticosterone, the rodent homolog of cortisol. The causes and consequences of this elevation is largely uncharacterized. However, there is recent evidence showing that elevated corticosterone in rodent HD models exacerbates cognitive deficits, causes neuropathological changes, worsens the metabolic phenotype, and hastens time to death. Additionally, Cushing's syndrome occurs in otherwise healthy patients that have chronically elevated levels of cortisol - and these patients share many of the same symptoms as those with HD, including regional brain atrophy, cognitive decline, severe weight-loss and muscle wasting, osteoporosis and an increased likelihood of severe depression and anxiety. The goal of the studies proposed here are to first characterize the consequences of elevated corticosterone in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of HD, and second to assess the role of mHTT pathology in the HPA-axis as a contributing factor to this neuroendocrine disturbance. In Specific Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that normalizing corticosterone levels in transgenic R6/2 mice will slow the onset and/or reduce the severity of cognitive (working and spatial memory), psychiatric (depression and anxiety-like behavior), metabolic (weight loss), and neuropathological symptoms (inclusion formation, gliosis, microglia activation). In Specific Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that mHTT expression in the hypothalamus and/or adrenal glands leads to hyperactivity of the HPA-axis, which in turn causes a rise in corticosterone shown by these mice. The ultimate goal of these studies is to determine whether or not the HPA-axis, and elevated cortisol/corticosterone is a suitable target for therapeutic intervention in the future."
"9331870","There is a significant gap in knowledge concerning the molecular and cellular underpinnings of triazole resistance in the important fungal pathogen Candida glabrata and how such resistance might be overcome. Our long-term goal is to improve the treatment of Candida infections by overcoming resistance to the triazole class of antifungals. Our overall objective in the present application is to identify the target genes directly regulated by this transcription factor, its protein interaction partners, and the genes that interact with UPC2A in the pathogenic fungus Candida glabrata. Our preliminary data demonstrate that loss of Upc2A function in both wild-type and triazole resistant isolates results in increased susceptibility to sterol biosynthesis inhibitors, including a reduction in fluconazole minimum inhibitory and minimum fungicidal concentrations and enhanced fluconazole activity by time-kill analysis. Our findings indicate that Upc2A is a key regulator of ergosterol biosynthesis as well as other unknown processes and is essential for resistance to fluconazole in C. glabrata. The Upc2A pathway therefore represents a potential co-therapeutic target for enhancing fluconazole activity against this inherently resistant species and restoring and preserving this class of antifungal for the treatment of invasive Candidiasis. In Aim 1 we will identify Upc2A target genes using transcriptional profiling (RNA-seq) and ChIP-seq, and we will then determine which target genes influence susceptibility to fluconazole by targeted gene disruption. In Aim 2 we will identify Upc2A interaction partner proteins using tandem affinity purification (TAP) and will determine which of these are essential for Upc2A activity under fluconazole exposure and which of these influence fluconazole susceptibility using targeted gene disruption. In Aim 3 of this proposal we will undertake screens of a transposon insertion mutant library as well as a recently developed deletion mutant library for genes that interact with, and are required for, Upc2 activation by sterol biosynthesis inhibition in order to identify and characterize the Upc2A genetic interaction network. The proposed studies are innovative as they uniquely focus on interference of activity of the transcription factor Upc2A as a strategy for circumventing fluconazole resistance in C. glabrata. Moreover, our approach is innovative as we will for the first time make use of a comprehensive set of genomic tools and techniques designed for yeast research and apply them to clinical isolates of the fungal pathogen C. glabrata. The proposed research is significant as it will provide new knowledge that can ultimately be exploited to overcome triazole resistance in this inherently resistant species of Candida and restore and preserve the use of this antifungal class for serious Candida infections."
"9386933","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mechanical forces are key regulators of cellular function for both normal growth and homeostasis of tissues, and in diseases including atherosclerosis, hypertension, osteoporosis and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to mechanical forces is therefore critical for understanding normal physiology and these disease states. Integrin-mediated adhesions provide the primary linkage through which cells both transmit and sense mechanical forces between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the cytoskeletal networks within the cell. Current views of mechanosensing center on the concept of a molecular clutch that connects the immobile, bound integrins to rearward moving actin filaments. These connections are formed through load-bearing linker molecules such as talin. Thus, forces are sensed by an intrinsically dynamic assembly whose behavior is modified by mechanical forces. Understanding this system in molecular detail is the goal of the project. The Schwartz lab has developed molecular force sensors that allow spatial and temporal measurement of tension across specific proteins. I propose to combine a talin tension sensor with fluorescent speckle microscopy for visualization of actin filament assembly, movement and disassembly. This approach will allow simultaneous analysis at near-single molecule levels of the forces and dynamics within cell adhesions. This will be done while varying both cell-derived and externally applied forces. Determining how forces modulate the molecular dynamics within the adhesions will provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction by integrin-mediated adhesions."
"9239506","Local, site-specific characteristics largely control the transmission dynamics of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). Arboviruses, in turn, adapt to local conditions, maximizing their potential to perpetuate and emerge as health threats. The adaptive potential of arboviruses is driven by error-prone replication, which creates a genetically diverse pool of competing virus genotypes within each host. This proposal examines how mosquitoes and birds act in concert to shape WNV evolution and fitness. Our previous research has allowed us to make very clear predictions about the outcome of each proposed aim and has facilitated our ability to translate our previous work to new emerging pathogens such as Zika virus. In birds, WNV fitness gains are limited by high MOI environments in susceptible vertebrates (e.g. crows) and promoted in birds that limit replication (e.g. robins). Mosquitoes also have species-dependent impacts on WNV diversification and fitness. Ironically, systemic infection of mosquitoes leads to reduced fitness in transmitted WNV populations. Therefore, Aim 1 will attempt to either reduce or increase WNV fitness by forcing it into transmission cycles with different host assemblages. We predict that crows and Cx. pipiens mosquitoes will result in WNV populations that are dramatically reduced in fitness compared to WNV that is maintained by robins and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Our results strongly suggest that the limitations on fitness gains of WNV when it replicates in crows are related to the high viremias that occur in this host relative to robins. At high MOI, coinfection of individual cells is efficient and defective (or low fitness) genomes are complemented by those of high fitness. This suppresses the overall fitness of the population. Aim 2 of the current proposal tests this hypothesis through in vivo and ex vivo studies of WNV loads and diversity in avian PBMCs, a critical site of WNV replication. We predict that at high MOI, clearly deleterious mutations (intrahost length-variants, for example) will persist and fitness will be reduced. The fitness declines that we observed in WNV during mosquito infection occur because of high virus mutation rates coupled with stochastic reductions in the population (i.e. bottlenecks) as the virus moves from one mosquito tissue to another. It is therefore critical to understand the mechanistic basis for the formation of these ?barriers? to arbovirus transmission. Our preliminary data suggests that one critical aspect that contributes to them is RNAi-based targeting of the flavivirus sfRNA. In addition, we have preliminary data suggesting that sfRNA1/2 facilitates virus escape from anatomical barriers. Therefore, in Aim 3 we will examine how mosquito RNAi targets the WNV genome, and in particular the sfRNA1 start site, and how the virus population changes as a result of being ?trapped? within a transmission barrier. This aim also will leverage our extensive experience working on WNV-host interactions to more deeply understand the emergent Zika virus. To accomplish this we will use newly developed reverse genetics systems for WNV and ZIKV that lack the ability to produce sfRNA1. Preliminary data on this is provided in the application. The significance of this work is that it will provide novel data on how different transmission cycles can impact virus genetics, and how this can lead to the emergence of new virus strains. Our proposed work will also provide important mechanistic data on why different birds and mosquitoes have different impacts on virus populations. Translating our WNV-based findings to ZIKV is also critical to this work, as we think it is our job to use what we have learned to address new arboviral threats. Finally, the significance of our work is that we have provided technical and analytical tools that are broadly useful and have permitted us to collaborate effectively with a wide array of investigators. The proposed studies are technically and conceptually innovative due to, for example, our modeling of the WNV transmission cycle, our use of single-cell approaches, and our ability to profile small RNAs within mosquito salivary glands."
"9212200","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is clear that HIV-1 can establish an independently replicating population in the CNS, and that this can also lead to the evolution of macrophage-tropic HIV-1, defined as the ability to enter cells with low levels of CD4. However, the distributin of infected cells in the brain and the occurrence of macrophage-tropic virus outside of the CNS are both controversial and both of these points are important considerations in defining strategies for the eradication of HIV-1. Our understanding of viral populations has been significantly improved with the recent widespread acknowledgement that PCR-mediated recombination can scramble phylogenetic information, and that the use of template end-point dilution in PCR (single genome amplification) is essential to define viral populations accurately. Similarly, improvements in programs modeling evolutionary processes make the assessment of phylogenetic relationships more robust, for example incorporating the Bayesian analysis program BEAST. Finally, quantitative descriptions of CD4 dependence for cell entry provide a much more robust definition of macrophage tropism than using highly variable monocyte-derived macrophage preparations to try to phenotype viruses that have evolved to use low levels of CD4 to enter cells. We are applying all three of these important advances to understand the evolution of macrophage-tropic viruses and their role in pathogenesis and to understand their potential to create a long-lived reservoir. We have recently brought these tools together to study viral compartmentalization, including compartmentalization in the CNS by examining virus in the CSF. We have now extended these studies to include samples from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC). We propose to exploit the availability of these samples, taken both prior to and at autopsy, to map the sites of viral replication in the brain in subjects how are viremic and those on therapy. We will also define the role of macrophage-tropic virus in populating centers of replication in the brain, and the ability of this type of evolutionary variant to become established outside of the CNS. Finally, we will examine the phenotype of the early rebound virus that appears after therapy discontinuation, as this represents the first virus that eradication strategies must confront."
"9248794","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The liver plays a vital role in maintaining blood glucose levels, in part, through gluconeogenic processes. Gluconeogenesis is an energy costly process that is supported through fat oxidation in hepatic mitochondria. The TCA cycle serves as a hub where acetyl-CoA from the break down of fatty acids and carbohydrates meet for oxidation to CO2 and the production of 3 NADH and 1 FADH2. Not only does the TCA cycle support gluconeogenesis through the formation of reducing equivalents that fuel the electron transport chain, but it also provides gluconeogenic substrates through cataplerotic processes. Changes in substrate concentration and redox state modulate TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes. However, the mechanisms regulating this metabolic response remain to be elucidated. In pathological conditions such as obesity and insulin resistance, TCA cycle flux and gluconeogenesis are elevated, contributing to the inappropriately high endogenous glucose production often observed in insulin resistant individuals. Still, it is no known how the TCA cycle is regulated in this diseased state. Many metabolic processes are sensitive to the energy state, and energy sensors, such as AMPK and Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) may be responsible for coordinating the response of these metabolic processes to changes in energy charge. AMPK is an energy sensor that is activated in response to high AMP:ATP ratios. In response, AMPK stimulates catabolic processes, such as fatty acid oxidation to replenish ATP. Specific Aim 1 will use ex vivo and in vivo experiments, with and without the regulatory capacity of AMPK to determine whether AMPK is responsible for changes in TCA cycle flux and cataplerotic/anaplerotic processes in response to changes in substrate concentration (ex vivo), or in an obese, insulin resistant state (in vivo). It is hypothesized that AMPK will be necessary for increases in TCA cycle flux in response to increases in substrate concentrations and that TCA cycle flux and anaperotic/cataplerotic processes will be elevated in AMPK-KO mice in response to 16 week HFD, but that constitutively active AMPK will restore the flux of these processes. SIRT3 is a mitochondrial deactylase that is activated by changes in the redox state (high NAD+/NADH) and responds by deacetylating mitochondrial proteins involved in metabolic processes. Specific Aim 2 will examine whether SIRT3 regulates the response of TCA cycle flux and cataplerotic/anaplerotic processes to changes in redox state (ex vivo) and in the obese insulin resistant state (in vivo). I hypothesize that SIRT3 will be required for normal TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes. The findings from this research will expand our knowledge of the role of energy sensors, and the function of TCA cycle flux and anaplerotic/cataplerotic processes in both healthy and diseased states. These results may provide future targets for pharmaceutical companies to treat or prevent NAFLD and/or insulin resistance."
"9250120","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxidative stress causes mitochondrial dysfunction in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the molecular mechanisms underlying the cause remain poorly elucidated. Cardiolipin (CL) is a mitochondrial membrane phospholipid required for oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis. The biological function of CL is determined by its acyl composition, which is dominated by linoleic acid in healthy metabolic tissues. In contrast, the onset of obesity and T2DM is associated with a significant alteration of acyl composition from the healthy tetralinoleoyl CL (TLCL) to the CL species enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which is highly sensitive to oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidized CL functions as ROS, initiating a chain of events of oxidative stress and CL oxidation known as CL peroxidation. Research supported by this grant has identified a key role of ALCAT1, a lysocardiolipin acyltransferse, in mitochondrial dysfunction associated with obesity and T2DM by catalyzing the synthesis of CL with a high peroxidation index. The research has also shown that ALCAT1 expression is induced by ROS associated with obesity and T2DM, triggering a vicious cycle of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance. Consequently, we show that targeted deletion of ALCAT1 in mice ameliorates diet-induced obesity (DIO) and its related mitochondrial dysfunctions. Strikingly, our new preliminary data also reveal an unexpected role of ALCAT1 in regulating mitochondrial fusion and mtDNA fidelity through the modulation of mitofusin-2 (MFN2), a GTPase required for mitochondrial fusion, linking oxidative stress by ALCAT1 to defective mitochondrial quality control. Based on these new preliminary data, we hypothesize that CL remodeling by ALCAT1 causes mitochondrial dysfunction in DIO by impairing mitochondrial fusion, which will be tested by three specific aims: Aim 1 will identify the role of CL remodeling by ALCAT1 in defective mitochondrial quality control in DIO; Aim 2 will determine the role of MFN2 deficiency by ALCAT1 in mitochondrial dysfunction in DIO; and Aim 3 will elucidate the molecular mechanism by which ALCAT1 regulates mitochondrial autophagy in DIO and T2DM. Successful completion of the proposed studies will open a new direction to study pathways that integrate CL remodeling to defective mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control in metabolic diseases. This information will have profound implications in designing new therapeutic strategies against obesity and other age-related diseases, because pathological CL remodeling is implicated in mitochondrial dysfunction associated with all the age-related diseases, including obesity, T2DM, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegeneration."
"9208773","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence implicating roles of diverse genetic mutations in aortic disease continues to accumulate, and in many cases these mutations ultimately affect the mechanical functionality or structural integrity of the wall. Moreover, many mutations preferentially affect different layers (e.g., elastin-associated glycoproteins or smooth muscle actomyosin filaments within the media). The goal of this project is to quantify and compare effects of ten different mutations that predispose to aortic disease and affect medial versus adventitial properties. This information, in turn, will provide important new insight into deviations from the different mechanobiological homeostatic targets of the media and adventitia and possibly motivate novel therapeutic approaches. The specific goals of this R03 project are, therefore, to mine and interpret an extensive data base in our laboratory on the biaxial mechanical behavior of the murine aorta (i) to delineate, for the first time, differences in medial and adventitial load carrying in diverse genetically modified mouse models and (ii) to inform a novel growth and remodeling computational model that can be used to understand better how the aorta attempts to compensate mechanically and structurally given specific genetic mutations. Toward this end, our Specific Aims are: (1) Use our recently proposed novel biomechanical modeling approach to quantify and compare biaxial stresses and associated mechanical properties of the aortic media and adventitia from ten mouse models having mutations in genes that encode: elastin, fibrillin-1, fibulin-5, collagen III, collagen I, thrombo- spondin-2, alpha smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, transforming growth factor beta receptor II, and latent transforming growth factor binding protein 3, all in comparison to two wild type controls (pure and mixed backgrounds), and (2) Extend, inform, and validate a novel thick-walled growth and remodeling model that we developed to understand constituent-specific contributions to arterial mechanics, but which now will be used to delineate better the layer-specific compensatory mechanisms that either enable aortic adaptation or lead to aortic mal-adaptation, particularly vulnerability to aortic dissection and rupture. This proposal is submitted under the R03 mechanism because it is a small, self-contained research project that will rely on a secondary analysis of existing data and yet result in the development of [a new] research methodology. Note that this proposal is not submitted under the R21 mechanism because we do not view it as high risk. Rather, given our extensive experience with model building and diverse aspects of mouse mechanics and mechanobiology, we do not anticipate any technical obstacles. Rather, we simply need modest support and time to develop, inform, and validate what we feel are much needed, highly innovative models of aortic biomechanics that will better reveal the genetic basis of aortic adaptivity versus evolving structural vulnerability."
"9222045","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of a poly- glutamine (poly-Q) repeats in huntingtin (Htt), a 350 kDa protein. People with HD experience chorea, dementia, and psychiatric disturbances. In HD, long projection neurons of the cortex and striatum degenerate by an unknown mechanism. There is currently no cure or effective treatment for this devastating disease.  Neurons depend on mitochondria to provide energy to fuel specialized processes, e.g., synaptic transmission, channel activity, and axonal transport. To meet the constantly changing energy needs of neurons, mitochondria undergo frequent fission and fusion. These dynamic processes stimulate ATP synthesis, maintain Ca2+ homeostasis, and mediate cell survival. However, excessive fission without counterbalancing fusion causes fragmented mitochondrial morphology, neuronal injury, and apoptosis. Fission and fusion is regulated by large conserved GTPases of the dynamin super-family. Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) is required for mitochondrial fission. Under physiological conditions, DRP1 GTPase activity is kept in check. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) including phosphorylation can activate DRP1. For example, transient DRP1 Ser616 phosphorylation by Cdk1-CyclinB activates mitochondrial fission.  There is strong evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early and plays a causal role in HD. For example, mitochondria from HD patients and HD mice exhibit fragmented morphology, respiratory complex inhibition, diminished Ca2+ buffering capacity, and a sensitized induction towards cytochrome c release and apoptosis. In addition, mutant Htt (mHtt) localizes to mitochondrial fission sites, directly binds DRP1, activates DRP1 GTPase activity, and alters its oligomeric ring-like structure. We have shown that decreasing DRP1 GTPase activity rescues cultured neurons from mHtt-induced excessive mitochondrial fission, axonal transport defects, synaptic injury, and cell death.  Persistent Cdk5 activation by p25 and aberrant Cdk5 subcellular localization and substrate specificity also contribute to neurodegeneration. Whether Cdk5-p25 aberrantly phosphorylates DRP1 at Ser616, thereby promoting excessive mitochondrial fission in HD, is unknown. Therefore, the specific questions that will be addressed here are: (1) Does Cdk5-p25 cause DRP1 Ser616 hyperphosphorylation and mitochondrial fission in HD? (2) Does DRP1 Ser616 hyperphosphorylation play a causal role in mHtt-mediated neuronal cell death? (3) By which mechanism does mHtt interaction and Ser616 phosphorylation stimulate DRP1 activity? Results obtained here may provide a mechanistic explanation for DRP1 hyperactivity in neurodegeneration and form the basis for new therapies."

"9205540","Recent evidence suggests that abnormalities in synaptic transmission may underlie the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders. A better understanding of normal and aberrant synaptic function may provide improved detection and treatment strategies, thereby reducing overall disease burden. Towards these ends, the use of gene targeting in mouse has provided a unique opportunity to create laboratory animals with similar mutations to human patients that have clinically defined neuropsychiatric disorders. Thorough analysis of these mutant mice, both at the behavioral and cellular level, can thus provide a wealth of information about potential mechanisms of disease formation as well as the relationship between gene dysfunction and abnormal behavior. Evidence from a variety of human genetic association studies has highlighted the functional relevance of synaptic cell adhesion molecules (SCAMs) in neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder. The Neuroligin (NL)/Neurexin complex, a prototypical SCAM pair, has been implicated in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic function. In an attempt to further explore NL function, a mouse was made with a point mutation (R451C) in the NL3 gene to mimic a mutation associated with autism in a human genetics study. The goal of this proposal is to study this mutant mouse from both behavioral and synaptic perspectives, with the hope of linking abnormal behaviors to specific underlying circuit and synaptic abnormalities. Causality will then be established through attempts to ameliorate behavioral phenotypes by addressing the underlying synaptic deficits. I have chosen to focus on functional cognitive deficits, particularly cognitive flexibility, in NL3R451C mutants, as these represent a core, debilitating feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders and their underlying synaptic mechanisms have thus far received little attention. Preliminary data suggest that NL3R451C mutants have severely impaired cognitive flexibility. During the mentored phase, I will employ viral injections to localize which synapses require NL3 function to maintain cognitive flexibility. In addition, I will employ optogenetic recruitment of cortical afferent populations in the acute slice to explore abnormalities of corticostriatal synaptic transmission in the dorsal striatum of NL3R451C mutant mice. For the independent phase, I will first explore potential abnormalities in synaptic plasticity in NL3R451C mutants. After a thorough description of the alterations of both basal transmission and activity-dependent plasticity found in the striatum of mutants, I will attempt to link these synaptic deficiencies to the observed abnormalities in cognitive flexibility through the use of cell-type and regional optogenetic manipulations. I anticipate that this proposal will uncover interesting information regarding the synaptic basis of cognitive flexibility and how perturbations of synaptic transmission in NL3R451C mutants result in rigid behavioral output. Furthermore, it will provide a template for my future studies into how other synaptic molecules mediate cognitive function."
"9398190","Project Summary Inbred miniature swine provide a unique preclinical model for the study of transplantation immunity and tolerance. Over the past two decades, we have utilized this model to study a robust form of tolerance of MHC class I-mismatched renal allografts that is routinely achieved following a short course of calcineurin inhibitors. This proposal represents the fifth consecutive renewal of this RO1, the last renewal of which was as a Merit Award (G37). During the last project period, we have made significant progress in understanding the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in the induction and maintenance of tolerance as well as in the adoptive transfer of tolerance in this model. We have demonstrated a requirement for both the donor kidney graft and the functioning thymus to maintain the balance between alloreactivity and down-regulation of immune reactivity to the graft, needed for persistence of tolerance. We have also demonstrated that the cells required for adoptive transfer of tolerance to a re-transplanted kidney are present within the kidney itself but that transfer of tolerance sufficient for acceptance of a naive, donor-matched kidney requires additional peripheral cells from the tolerant donor. In the next project period, we intend to investigate the nature of the signals that emanate from the kidney and lead to intra-thymic generation of Tregs and the nature of the cells within the kidney and in the periphery that are responsible for the adoptive transfer of tolerance to a naive recipient. Specifically, we will: 1) Examine the nature of the peripheral and intra-thymic processes responsible for the balance between alloagressive and regulatory T cell responses to donor antigens of a renal allograft; and 2) Determine the nature of the intra-graft and peripheral regulatory cells required for adoptive transfer of tolerance to a second donor kidney, following re-transplantation of kidneys from long-term tolerant (LTT) animals. The broader goal of these studies remains to develop an understanding of the mechanisms by which allograft tolerance is induced and maintained in this large-animal model, in order to permit development of appropriate protocols for induction of tolerance to organ allografts in the clinic."
"9207778","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In keeping with the missions of NIMH and NICHD, the proposed project offers to test innovative models of poverty-related risk and RCT early intervention targeting key health and mental health outcomes among low-income, ethnic minority youth. Overall, this application aims to advance our understanding of youths' trajectories of internalizing behavior and health risk across a salient life course transition (including 8th through 10th grade). Because the average age of onset for affective disorders, and the initiation of a broader array of health risk behaviors occurs in early adolescence, we plan to focus our efforts in predicting youths' health-risk behaviors and internalizing problems. Scientifically and clinically significant features of this project include an the opportunity to tet the role of key neurocognitive mechanisms that may alternately lead some youth to be at lower risk for these negative health and mental health sequelae, while other youth may face greater risk. Framed in this way, the proposed research strives to identify levers for policies and programs devoted to improving the health of adolescents in low-income communities. The specific aims of this application include the following. First, the proposed investigation will examine the long-term impact of the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP), a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a preschool intervention designed to foster low-income preschoolers' self-regulation and mental health (#R01HD046160; n = 602). Treatment-induced gains in specific domains of self-regulation including emotion regulation (ER) and executive function (EF) are hypothesized to set youth on positive developmental trajectories into adolescence. The project's second aim is to test ways that youths' trajectories of health and mental health problems may be significantly jeopardized by a range of poverty-related risk factors, defined in terms of type of risk, the timing of risk exposure, and turbulence (i.e., volatility in risk). Analses will also test whether those key neurocognitive mechanisms of ER and EF mediate the impact of poverty and early intervention on individuals' internalizing and health risk, and whether these impacts are moderated by race/ethnicity, gender, and early regulatory profiles. Statistical approaches will include measurement modeling and advanced techniques that help to strengthen causal claims and to understand development over time."
"9389108","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stem cells are some of the longest-lived cells in our bodies, with a lifespan that can exceed dozens of years. They are critical to our long-term health, and age-related dysfunction in stem cells is linked to cancer, diabetes and organ failure. The objective of this proposal is to determine how stem cells and other mitotically-active cells maintain cell health and avoid premature aging. The lifespan of stem cells includes periods of proliferation and quiescence (a reversible, sustainable cell state of non-proliferation). When proliferating, part of the stem cell population must replace cells that differentiate or die. The overarching hypothesis guiding this proposal is that cells utilize quiescence to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during aerobic respiration in mitochondria to preserve their replicative lifespan. The aims of this proposal will elucidate (1) if quiescence can extend the lifespan of cells by reducing intracellular ROS, and (2) if mitochondrial dynamics (fusion, fission  and distribution at division) are managed differently by cells during quiescence and proliferation to achieve full replicative lifespan. This research introduces an innovative, high-throughput microfluidic device for studying replicative lifespan in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a classic model for mitotically active, symmetrically dividing cells. The fission yeast lifespan microdissector (FYLM) is a microfluidic device that captures and immobilizes hundreds of fission yeast cells over their entire replicative lifespan, while they are kept in a constant, controllable environment and observed with subcellular resolution. (1) Using the FYLM and fluorescent ROS reporters of ROS, I will determine the interplay between replicative lifespan and proliferation after quiescence in S. pombe. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that cell reduce intracellular ROS levels during quiescence to extend their replicative lifespan. (2) Next, I  will directly observe the distribution and dynamics of aged mitochondria over the replicate lifespan of individual S. pombe cells. Finally, mitochondrial fusion and fission will be regulated n engineered strains to determine whether the overall turnover rate of mitochondria or the ratio of fusion to fission are critical to the cell health during proliferation and quiescence. I hypothesiz that symmetrically dividing cells equally divide mitochondria over their entire replicative lifespa, instead depending on rapid mitochondrial turnover to remove dysfunctional mitochondrial, and that during quiescence, precise balance of fusion and fission maintains mitochondrial homeostasis. Completion of these aims will delineate how symmetrical division and quiescence support longevity in a eukaryotic model for long- lived, mitotically active cells. Ultimately, thes studies will shed light on how stem cells and other long-lived eukaryotic cells are able to maintain cellular health."
"9332725","Abstract The intermingling and bi-directional transfer of maternal and fetal cells during gestation creates a fascinating and highly relevant physiological model of immunological tolerance. Although this interaction has primarily been addressed from the perspective of maternal tolerance to foreign paternal antigens expressed by the developing fetus, the fetus is also reciprocally exposed to an equally vast array of genetically foreign non- inherited maternal antigens (NIMA). Thus, potent regulatory pathways are likely in place beginning at the earliest stages of development in individuals to maintain immunological tolerance to genetically foreign NIMA. Our analysis of T cells with specificity to model antigens transformed into surrogate NIMA show compulsory developmental exposure to genetically foreign maternal antigen primes expanded accumulation of immune suppressive regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs) with NIMA-specificity. Selectively enriched NIMA-specific Treg accumulation in female offspring is associated with reinforced fetal tolerance during next-generation pregnancies sired by males expressing allo-antigens with overlapping NIMA specificity. Importantly, protection against fetal wastage and expanded NIMA-specific Treg accumulation requires persistent cognate antigen stimulation by maternal cells that establish microchimerism in offspring. Thus, genetically foreign maternal cells vertically transferred and retained in offspring maintain expanded peripheral tolerance to NIMA. Based on these exciting proof-of-concept data establishing the pivotal importance of microchimeric maternal cells in NIMA-specific tolerance and cross-generational reproductive fitness, we are exceptionally well poised to investigate how microchimeric cells naturally transferred between mother and child confer antigen-specific immunological tolerance. Aim 1 will use newly validated cell enrichment techniques combined with multi- parameter flow cytometry to establish the identity and molecular properties of microchimeric maternal cells responsible for NIMA-specific tolerance. Complementary studies will investigate the necessity for microchimeric cell-intrinsic expression of molecules required for T cell antigen presentation and/or co- stimulation/co-inhibition in maintaining NIMA-specific tolerance. To address the durability of NIMA-specific tolerance and extend the relevance for these loss of function studies for microchimeric maternal cells, Aim 2 will investigate physiological contexts where functional immune tolerance to NIMA might be naturally ?erased?. In particular, we will determine how NIMA-specific tolerance can be displaced in female offspring by fetal microchimeric cells seeded during next-generation pregnancies. Lastly, Aim 3 will evaluate whether expanded tolerance is restricted to genetically foreign antigens expressed by microchimeric cells, or more broadly extends to tissue restricted self-antigens responsible for causing autoimmunity by investigating shifts in autoimmune disease susceptibility when the inciting tissue-restricted self-antigen is transformed into a surrogate NIMA through forced constitutive expression by tolerogenic microchimeric maternal cells."
"9417181","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly three-quarters of African American women and half of non-Hispanic White women of childbearing ages in the US are overweight or obese. About one-half (46%) of pregnant women exceed gestational weight gain recommendations. This problem is significant because excessive gestational weight gain is a strong risk factor for new or persistent obesity in women and increases a woman's risk for maternal complications. Furthermore, accumulating observational studies show that higher maternal gestational weight gain is associated with higher offspring birth weight, which persists in childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. Novel intervention approaches have the potential to help overweight/obese financially disadvantaged women achieve healthy weight control during and after pregnancy and improve the health of their offspring. Our experienced multidisciplinary team will build on our promising R21 feasibility study to address the following specific aims: (1) examine the impact of a lifestyle intervention on gestational weight gain and postpartum weight loss in overweight and obese women, (2) examine the impact of the intervention on physical activity (PA), dietary intake, and quality of life (QOL), (3) examine race differences in total gestational weight gain, PA, dietary intake, and QOL; and (4) examine the impact of the intervention on offspring adiposity. Pregnant women (N=500) women, half African American and half White, will be recruited from seven obstetric clinics in Columbia, South Carolina and randomized to a lifestyle intervention (n=250) or standard care (n=250). The lifestyle intervention, grounded in Social Cognitive Theory, will target regular body weight self-monitoring and increasing PA and healthy dietary practices in pregnancy and postpartum. The lifestyle program will start within 15 weeks gestation and will continue through 6 months postpartum. In pregnancy, the intervention will consist of an individual session followed by 12 group-based sessions augmented with 12 podcasts, telephone follow-up, and social media support. In postpartum, the intervention will consist of an individual session (at 6 weeks) followed by 16 podcasts, telephone calls, and social media support until 6 months postpartum. All women will be assessed early in pregnancy (d15 weeks), at 32 weeks gestation, and at 6- and 12-mos postpartum, and offspring will be assessed at 6- and 12-mos. The study is innovative because it incorporates critical components that are missing in the larger literature. Namely, it is theoretically grounded, fully targets PA in addition to healthy eating, objectively measures PA, spans pregnancy to postpartum, includes racially and socioeconomically disadvantaged women who are overweight or obese, is powered to assess race differences in intervention effectiveness, considers the intergenerational linkage on childhood obesity, and integrates state-of-the-art behavioral strategies and approaches combined with innovative intervention channels (i.e., podcasts and social media support), all tailored to a unique population of women from a southeastern state with poor maternal and child health indicators."

Moreover, diseases once thought to be near eradication from the developed world-for example, tuberculosis, cholera, and rheumatic fever-have rebounded with renewed intensity. Currently in its 36th year, the Infectious Disease and Basic Microbiological Mechanisms training program maintains as its primary goal the training of scientists who have a career goal of solving medically relevant problems and who elect rigorous laboratory or epidemiologic training in any of the Harvard adult infectious disease programs or other Harvard-based institutions participating in this program. Over the past 36 years, the program has successfully trained leaders in academic medicine and investigators who have made important contributions to the field. In this competing resubmission application, we propose an additional five years of funding and to maintain the training program at its current level of eight postdoctoral trainees slots per year. We will use these slots to provide support directly to selected infectious disease physician fellows during mentored research, and to also provide support to selected Ph.D. trainees in Harvard Medical School infectious disease and microbiology laboratories focused on areas that have significant clinical relevance, so as to support the rich research- training environment for physician-scientists within these laboratories and to provide these Ph.D. trainees intensive exposure to medically-trained clinically-active researchers. Training will include a minimum of two years of mentored research with hands-on in-laboratory training, appropriate advanced non-degree-granting post-graduate coursework, attendance and participation of trainees at regular meetings and seminars of direct relevance to infectious disease and microbiology research, and instruction in the preparation of competitive proposals for funding, with a particular emphasis on applications for K and other career development awards, including foundation awards. The specific aims of this training program are as follows: 1. To acquire sufficient training in basic laboratory or epidemiologic techniques and approaches to conduct effective leading edge research into relevant infectious disease problems; 2. To foster the creation of important scientific contributions by means of strong and longitudinal mentorship by program faculty; and 3. To develop a primary research focus and a broad understanding of infectious diseases and microbiology, so as to both enable novel interdisciplinary research and lead to independence."
"9385381","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This work aims to identify the molecular mechanisms of cold detection, using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Sensory systems play key roles in human health. Not only is human sensory system dysfunction associated with disease, the detection of temperature is important for the survival and host-seeking behavior of insect vectors of human disease. At present, our molecular understanding of temperature detection in insects is limited: insect cold receptors have not been reported. Our preliminary data suggest two Ionotropic Receptor family members, IR21a and IR25a, are involved in cold sensing. Ionotropic receptors (IRs) are a subfamily of iGluRs in invertebrates (Drosophila has 66 IRs) known to act not as mediators of glutamate- dependent synaptic transmission, but as chemoreceptors for acids and amines. We are proposing to test the hypothesis that specific isoforms of IR21a and IR25a drive cold avoidance by acting in the cold sensors of the arista and/or labellum. Using cell-specific rescue experiments, we propose to determine which IR21a and IR25a isoforms mediate cold avoidance, and to test whether expression of these IRs in cold sensors is necessary and/or required for cold avoidance. We will also test if IR21a and IR25a mediate cold sensing. Using a combination of calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we will examine the contribution of IR21a and IR25a to cold sensing by examining how the cold-responsiveness of each set of cold sensors is altered in mutants lacking these proteins. I will also test whether IR21a and IR25a act forming a cold receptor by ectopic expression of these proteins in the fly and by heterologous expression in frog oocytes and in cultured mammalian cells. These studies will contribute for the understanding of cold-reception and the identification  of the receptors will be extremely significant to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved."

"9303580","Project summary While exogenous DNA-mediated immune response contributes to host defense, excessive host cytoplasmic DNA can result in autoimmune diseases due to interferon overproduction. Taxilin alpha (TXLNA) has been implied in autoimmune disease caused by cytosolic DNA. However, the role of TXLNA in DNA-mediated innate immunity is unknown. Thus, it is pressing to elucidate the mechanisms of how TXLNA regulates DNA-induced innate immune signaling. This application proposes a hypothesis that TXLNA is a new signaling molecule in DNA-mediated, interferon-dependent innate immunity. Aim 1 will establish TXLNA as a TBK1 regulator in DNA-mediated innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. TXLNA deficiency will establish the requirement and specificity in TBK1-mediated interferon activation in response to DNA. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanisms by which TXLNA regulates TBK1 activity in DNA-mediated innate signaling pathway. We will examine several hypotheses of TXLNA-mediated TBK1 activation and recruitment to STING signalosome. The mechanistic concepts derived from this proposal will advance our current understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in DNA-mediated innate immunity. This project will also provide graduate and undergraduate students with opportunities for significant independent research in preparation for careers in biomedical science."
"9310894","A research program will be undertaken to study agr signal transduction in the commensal pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. The accessory gene regulator (agr) locus found in all staphylococci encodes a quorum sensing (QS) circuit that controls the expression of virulence and other accessory genes. It consists of two oppositely oriented transcriptional units, of which one encodes four proteins, AgrBDCA, involved in production and sensing of an autoinducer peptide (AIP), and the other encodes a regulatory RNA that is the effector of target gene regulation. The finding that staphylococcal virulence can be inhibited through antagonism of this QS pathway has fueled tremendous interest in understanding the detailed mechanisms at play throughout the circuit. Building on recent breakthroughs that have allowed us to reconstitute much as the quorum sensing circuit using purified components, we propose to integrate chemical, biochemical, biophysical and genetic tools for the purpose of obtaining a deeper understanding into the molecular processes underlying the production and sensing of the autoinducer peptide (AIP) pheromone that is central to agr regulation. The program will move forward in three directions: Aim 1, identifying the key missing players in AIP biosynthesis; Aim 2, understanding how agonism and antagonism of the QS system relates to newly discovered conformational changes in the AIP receptor, AgrC, and; Aim 3, identifying novel modulators of agr through sophisticated target-based screens. These studies will lay the groundwork for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting agr, but also contribute to a fundamental understanding of QS systems of this type, which are pervasive in the low-GC bacterial phylum, Firmicutes."

Postdoctoral training will be directed toward evaluating the interactions between botanical characterization and molecular/genetic/physiologic approaches at both the basic science and clinical research areas to achieve the ultimate goal of understanding how botanicals can contribute to health maintenance. Thus, a resubmission of a renewal application titled, Training in Botanical Approaches to Combat Metabolic Syndrome is proposed. The continued objective of this training program is to train both Ph.D. and M.D. postdoctoral fellows to become productive research scientists capable of establishing scientific careers that further the efforts o understand the role of botanicals on the complex interactions between genetic, molecular and physiological aspects of the metabolic syndrome and for maintaining human health. Specifically, we will continually aim to bridge the divide between the plant discovery and characterization approach and the molecular biology/physiological approach. We are requesting 16 full-time postdoctoral trainee stipends across the five-year grant period. Trainees will be supported for two to three years. Each postdoctoral fellow will be encouraged to develop interdisciplinary research efforts to understand the effect and action of botanicals on components of the metabolic syndrome. The program will take advantage of the synergy and the cutting-edge technologies of an NCCAM sponsored Botanical Research Center composed of the wide range of research approaches to metabolic syndrome that are available at the Pennington Biomedical and the plant science expertise of the Rutgers Department of Plant Biology and Pathology. This broad-based training program will enable trainees to establish successful research careers in academia, academic medicine, government agencies and in the private sector in the study of botanicals and metabolic disease."
"9221977","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly apparent that cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a spectrum of mutations present in individual minor clones that aren't represented in the bulk of the tumor cells. The overall hypothesis is that tumor heterogeneity has important clinical implications for treatment sensitivity and acquired resistance to targeted therapies, using EGFR inhibitors in colorectal cancer as a model system. The introduction of more sophisticated techniques for gene sequencing has made possible the identification of low frequency mutations that were missed with standard sequencing techniques. As KRAS mutations represent a well-recognized and clinically utilized predictive biomarker, it represents an opportunity to explore the implications of KRAS heterogeneity in the setting of EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy. Recently, we and others have shown that the presence of low frequency KRAS mutations has been detected in tissue from approximately 15% of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients when high-sensitivity sequencing is utilized. These rare KRAS mutant cells are present in what are usually identified as KRAS wild type tumor by less sensitive standard-of-care testing methodologies currently used in the clinic, thereby leading to the hypothesis that these clones are rapidly selected under treatment pressure, resulting in clinical progression to treatment. Retrospective, nonrandomized datasets support this hypothesis; these low-frequency KRAS mutations have been correlated with resistance to anti-EGFR treatment. Specifically, further selection of patients eligible for EGFR mAb therapy would reduce the cost of such therapies to the health care system (with modeled savings of $200 million per year given the prospective identification of 25% of non-responding patients). In this proposal we hypothesize that treatment-induced clonal changes are a dynamic balance in a heterogeneous tumor population. We propose to evaluate tumor genetic changes by studying samples from large randomized trials, including the primary tumor and circulating free tumor DNA (cfDNA) obtained from patient plasma samples. To capture longer-term dynamics, we will apply these monitoring techniques to a longitudinal cohort with an embedded prospective clinical trial of anti-EGFR retreatment. Patient-derived murine xenograft models will be utilized to more precisely quantify tumor dynamics. Understand the mechanisms of resistance of CRC will require a more detailed understanding of the heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of genomic changes, thereby leading to improved biomarkers for benefit and novel strategies to re-challenge tumors with previously effective therapy."
"9316244","AhR is a cytosolic transcription factor that can be activated by wide range of chemicals including environmental contaminants, such as 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), which leads to metabolism and regulation of toxic effects. AhR can also be activated by endogenous ligands and dietary compounds. Recent groundbreaking studies demonstrated that AhR activation can also regulate T cell differentiation, specifically the differentiation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (T regs) and proinflammatory Th17 cells that play a role in extracellular infections and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Interestingly, AhR ligands were shown to have contrasting effects on Treg/Th17 differentiation, the reasons for which are not clear. For example, studies, including ours, demonstrated that some AhR ligands, such as TCDD, promoted the differentiation of Tregs while dampening that of Th17 cells, while a tryptophan photoproduct, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), exerted contrasting effects. We have generated exciting preliminary data indicating that AhR activation triggers dysregulation in the microRNA (miR) expression and other epigenetic pathways. Based on the above, we will test the hypothesis that AhR-ligand complex may interact with dioxin response elements (DREs) on gene promoters of microRNAs as well as induce other epigenetic pathways, which together alter the expression of the miRs, which in turn, regulate the differentiation of encephalitogenic T cells. We will test our hypothesis using an experimental model of MS called Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE). In Aim1, we will test whether TCDD and FICZ induce unique miR expression profiles in purified Tregs/Th17 cells. Based on our preliminary data, we will focus on miR31-5p and miR1192 that target the expression of FoxP3 and IL-17. Specifically, we will examine whether the interactions of AhR-ligand complex with the DREs on these miR gene promoters are responsible for the disparate responses. In Aim 2, we will test whether the contrasting effect of TCDD and FICZ is due to differential DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation of these miR gene promoters as well as due to histone modifications. In Aim 3, we will determine whether miR mimics or antagomirs as well as pharmacological intervention of DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation and histone modification would reverse the inflammatory response and clinical outcome following ligation AhR with TCDD or FICZ. The proposed studies are highly significant in that we will identify novel epigenetic pathways triggered by AhR activation leading to immune regulation. Our studies will also provide novel information on whether targeting such epigenetic pathways in vivo can prevent and treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases."
"9230824","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9378503","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though most individuals are capable of maintaining psychological integrity in the face of stress, stress-experiences are well known for instigating th onset and relapse of severe neuropsychiatric disorders including MDD and PTSD. Social stress is common to practically all mammalian species, and chronic subordination stress in rodents is most often followed by the expression of a long-lasting behavioral syndrome that includes social avoidance, anhedonia, impaired coping responses to other environmental stressors, and anxiety-like behaviors. Within the inbred strain of mouse C57BL/6J, the prominently expressed stress-induced syndrome does not occur in all individuals subjected to chronic social defeat stress, thereby allowing for measurements of resiliency. Presumably, these results suggest that individual differences across mice mediate the susceptibility or resistance to the deleterious effects of chronic stress. Nevertheless, unequivocal validation of this hypothesis is lacking since the majority of studies aimed at investigating susceptibility to chronic stress are based on experiments performed in mice that have been previously exposed to chronic stress, or mice that are subjected to molecular manipulations prior to stress exposure (ultimately altering normal brain function).Here were propose to use multi-circuit in vivo recording in conjunction with circuit selective modulation using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to characterize the circuit based mechanisms that mediate resistance to stress in C57BL/6J mice. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that variations in cortical-amygdala circuit function will be associated with stress responses, and that direct modulation of this circuit will alter stress resistance across mice. This strategy will provide an unprecedented circuit level of understanding of how stress exposure ultimately alters activity across neural circuits that regulate fear and reward processing and reveal new circuit based targets for therapeutic intervention for mood and anxiety disorders."
"9209574","OVERALL ABSTRACT General anesthesia is a fascinating man-made, neurophysiological phenomenon that has been developed empirically over many years to enable safe and humane performance of surgical and non-surgical procedures. Specifically it is a drug-induced condition consisting of unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia and immobility, along with physiological stability. General anesthesia is administered daily to 60,000 patients in the United States, the mechanisms for how anesthetics act in the brain to create the states of anesthesia are not well understood. Significant progress has been made recently in characterizing the molecular sites that anesthetics target. However, how actions at specific molecular targets lead to the behavioral states is less well understood. Addressing this issue requires a systems neuroscience approach to define how actions of the drugs at specific molecular targets and neural circuits lead to a behavioral state of general anesthesia. In this program project entitled, Integrated Systems Neuroscience Studies of Anesthesia, we will develop an integrated systems neuroscience program consisting of human, non-human primate, rodent and modeling studies of four anesthetics: the GABAA agents, propofol and sevoflurane; the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine; and the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine. The program project will also include a DATA ANALYSIS CORE, which will provide assistance with data analysis and conduct research on statistical methods. The Specific Aims are to understand how the actions of the anesthetics at specific molecular targets and neural circuits produce the oscillatory dynamics (EEG rhythms, changes in LFPs and neural spiking activity) that are likely a primary common mechanism through which anesthetics create altered states of arousal (sedation, hallucination, unconsciousness). The research will develop new, fundamental knowledge about the neurophysiological mechanisms of anesthetic actions that will have broad impact. This new knowledge will offer a new approach to real-time monitoring and control of brain states of patients receiving general anesthesia and sedation. Anesthesia caregivers will be able to relate the prominent oscillatory dynamics induced by anesthetics to their altered states of arousal through their actions at specific molecular targets and in specific neural circuits. Improved neurophysiologically-based monitoring and drug delivery strategies offer the promise of reducing the undesirable anesthetic side effects such as nausea, vomiting, neurotoxicity and post-operative cognitive dysfunction. This research will provide new, fundamental quantitative insights into the workings of the brain's arousal and cognitive systems that may translate into new approaches to creating the states of general anesthesia along with ways to treat disorders of arousal such as sleep, depression, coma and pain."
"9261875","Project Summary  Immunosuppressive macrophages have been linked to cancer-related inflammation and therapeutic resistance in cancer including chemotherapy and immunotherapy, thus representing attractive therapeutic targets. Macrophages can be polarized into extreme M1 or M2 phenotype depending on the environmental cues. Although macrophage phenotype within the tumor microenvironment is more complicated, it is clear that immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) phenotypically more resemble M2-like macrophages. In the preliminary studies, we discovered that transcription factor c-Maf is highly expressed in mouse and human polarized M2 macrophages and immunosuppressive TAM. In addition, natural product yeast-derived particulate ?-glucan treatment significantly downregulates c-Maf expression leading to enhanced T cell responses in mice. We also demonstrated that M1 and M2 macrophages have distinct metabolic profiles and c-Maf regulates many genes related to glycolysis. Based on these preliminary studies, we hypothesize that transcription factor c-Maf is an essential controller and a metabolic checkpoint for immunosuppressive TAM functional activity. Three Aims are proposed. Aim 1 determines the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which c-Maf is regulated in immunosuppressive TAM. We will investigate whether tumor secreted factors regulate c-Maf expression in TAM. We will also determine how the Raf-1 kinase pathway regulates c-Maf and c-Maf-related gene expression. Finally, we will test whether loss of function of c-Maf in TAM significantly delays tumor progression and metastasis. Aim 2 determines which TAM metabolic pathway(s) is regulated by c-Maf using systems metabolomics approach. We will first determine TAM metabolic pathways using Stable Isotope Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM) approach. Furthermore, we will determine which metabolic pathways are regulated by c-Maf. Finally we will determine the causative role of metabolic reprogramming in ?-glucan-mediated TAM functional conversion. Aim 3 determines whether the dectin-1 agonist ?-glucan modulates TAM function of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via the c-Maf pathway. We will determine whether ?-glucan treatment downregulates c- Maf expression and alters c-Maf-regulated genes in human NSCLC TAM. We will also determine whether human TAM functions are reversed upon ?-glucan treatment. Finally, we will examine whether ?-glucan treatment in patients with NSCLC downregulates c-Maf expression and alters monocyte suppressive function. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the transcriptional regulation of immunosuppressive TAM by c-Maf and establish the transcription factor c-Maf as a novel target for human cancer immunotherapy."
"9207574","DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS (Core-065) ABSTRACT Overview and Goals: CCSG Developmental Funds are used with the goal of supporting the pursuit of new scientific opportunities that, when properly selected, provide a significant boost to UCCC research activities. In the current grant period, CCSG Developmental Funds have been used in combination with philanthropic funds to promote strategic priorities of the UCCC in personalized medicine and population health by supporting two projects. The first project is the Human Tumor Model-based Databank (HTMD). The HTMD has two goals: 1) Assist UCCC members to establish their own Patient Derived Xenografts (PDX) and 2) house a central database of all `omics information on PDX so evaluated that can be used for integrative analyses and queried remotely by UCCC members seeking to study tumors with specific genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic markers. The second project was aimed at nurturing growth of survivorship research at the UCCC via support for a staff investigator, Jean Kutner MD, charged with promoting this area in our Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) program. Scientific Progress: With the goal of promoting translational research, UCCC leadership invested in the development of the HTMD. In the last 5 years established over 250 unique patient derived xenografts (PDX). Over 100 of these have been `omically profiled and are available for use and data query by UCCC members. This success allowed us to obtain a CCSG administrative supplement both promoting this UCCC program and benefitting the nation by contributing our PDXs to the NCI repository. The PDXs have been used in 24 publications and have lead or supported the initiation of clinical trials, some highlighted in our Program and SR write-ups. In the same time frame, Kutner formed a UCCC Special Interest Group (SIG) for cancer survivorship research that led to: 1) opening of eight survivorship research protocols; 2) a collaborative pilot program with the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center (AHWC) to enroll cancer survivors in a supervised, exercise program to measure the effect of an exercise regimen on quality of life and outcomes. A number of publications (33) and grants ($1.35M in 2015) can be attributed to Kutner's leadership of the SIG. Future Directions: In the next 5 years we aim to use CCSG Developmental Funds to support pilot grants with cancer relevant organizations across the UCCC consortium in a cost-shared manner with the objective to develop collaborative and synergistic scientific projects that promote exceptional research across UCCC and leverage existing institutional strengths. Projects will be selected based on their potential to exploit unique research ideas and capabilities and translate these into innovations that are likely to lead to external funding and subsequent major advances in cancer medicine. We will monitor and evaluate success of this pilot grant funding based on measurable outcomes (publications, grants, trials). In summary, this program will leverage institutional strengths and financial resources to establish and/or deepen inter and intra-institutional relationships and promote future sponsored research grant applications and cancer research innovations."
"9223656","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lassa fever is an acute and often-fatal hemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV), an arenavirus. Lassa fever is a zoonotic infection, transmitted to humans by Mastomys natalensis (the multimammate rat). The highest incidence of Lassa fever in the world is in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone. Signs and symptoms of LF, which occur 1-3 weeks after virus exposure, are highly variable, and can include fever, facial swelling, conjunctival injection, and vomiting. Frank bleeding occurs in less than a third of cases, but confers a poor prognosis. Signs and symptoms in LF patients who survive begin to subside 2-3 weeks after onset, but full recovery can require many months or longer. Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) was an important site for Lassa fever clinical and laboratory research throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The violent civil conflict in Sierra Leone from 1991 to 2002, sometimes referred to as the Blood Diamonds War, forced suspension of Lassa fever research at KGH in 1993. Following cessation of hostilities, our consortium of Lassa fever researchers and other partners began rebuilding the scientific infrastructure at KGH, with a major focus of the development of improved laboratory diagnosis for Lassa fever. There is no vaccine for LF and the efficacy of the antiviral drug ribavirin in treating LF remains a matter of controversy. There is an urgent need to develop epidemiological and clinical measures to combat the public health challenges posed by Lassa fever in Sierra Leone and across West Africa. Promising next-generation Lassa fever diagnostic immunoassays, including rapid tests, require further development as epidemiological and clinical management tools. The overall hypothesis of the Lassa ICIDR is that further development of research capacity, with emphasis on training Sierra Leonean staff, will permit the KGH Lassa fever research program to emerge as an exceptional resource for human clinical trials of NIAID's promising portfolio of Lassa fever diagnostics, therapeutics, immunotherapeutics and vaccines. The Overall Specific Aims (listed in priority order) are: Aim 1. Further enhance and utilize the symmetrical and highly productive partnership developed over the last decade between Tulane University and the Lassa fever program at KGH; Aim 2. Promote the development of laboratory and clinical research capacity at KGH, with a particular emphasis on training Sierra Leonean staff; and Aim 3. Encourage future collaborative relationships with other research groups leading to improvements in detection, prevention, amelioration, and treatment of Lassa fever in the subregion. Research question(s) to be addressed in the Lassa ICIDR Projects include for Project 1: Can second generation Lassa fever recombinant immunoassays be used effectively as point-of-care diagnostics and surveillance tools for Lassa fever, and for Project 2: What are the clinical and virological determinants of Lassa Fever outcome and is it possible to identify biomarkers of LASV infection and Lassa Fever outcome. Through the proposed research we will acquire new information regarding the natural history of Lassa fever and the demographic distribution of people exposed to LASV using second generation Lassa fever recombinant immunoassays. We will also elucidate risk factors for acquiring serious or fatal LASV infection. This new informatio will guide evidence-based investments for public health programming and policy. We will also define biomarkers of Lassa fever pathobiology through the course of illness. Identification of these factors could lead to evidence-based approaches to reduce mortality from Lassa fever. We also propose to take a major step forward to confront the challenges of Lassa fever, namely developing the capacity to perform human clinical trials."
"9220776","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In recent years, the problem of rehospitalization has come under intense focus as a major contributor to preventable morbidity and escalating healthcare costs. Substance use disorders are strongly associated with poor health outcomes and highly inefficient use of healthcare services, including repeat hospitalizations. Interventions that increase adherence to recommendations for outpatient medical care and substance abuse treatment could potentially help recently-hospitalized individuals with substance use disorders to avoid unnecessary rehospitalization, associated morbidity, and medical expenses. The current study is a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of Navigation Services to Avoid Rehospitalization (NavSTAR) vs. Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) for hospital patients with co-occurring medical problems and substance use disorders. Applying Andersen's theoretical model of health service utilization, NavSTAR will employ the promising strategies of Patient Navigation and motivational interventions to facilitate engagement in outpatient medical and substance abuse treatment, thereby lowering the likelihood of rehospitalization. Patient Navigators embedded within the substance abuse consultation liaison service at a large urban hospital will deliver patient- centered, proactive navigation and motivational services initiated during the hospital stay and continued for 3 months post-discharge. Participants randomized to TAU will receive usual care from the hospital and the substance abuse consultation liaison service, which includes referral to substance abuse treatment but no continued contact post-hospital discharge. Participants will be assessed at study entry and again at 3-, 6-, and 12-months follow-up on various measures of healthcare utilization, substance use, and functioning. The primary outcome of interest is time-to-rehospitalization through 12 months. In addition, a range of secondary outcomes spanning the medical and substance abuse service areas will be assessed. The study will include an economic evaluation of the cost, incremental cost-effectiveness, and cost-benefits of NavSTAR from the service provider perspective. This study addresses a problem of national significance. The extent of avoidable rehospitalizations in the U.S., and among individuals with substance use disorders specifically, is indicative of public health risks and constitutes a key driver of healthcare expenditures. This study is innovative in its application of Patient Navigation and motivational intervention strategies with the specific purpose of avoiding rehospitalization among individuals with co-occurring medical problems and substance use disorders. If NavSTAR proves to be effective and cost-effective in reducing rehospitalizations in this high risk patient group, it would have important implications for designing hospital discharge planning services, informing national cost containment initiatives, and improving public health."
"9252070","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia meeting entitled B Cells and T Follicular Helper Cells ? Controlling Long-Lived Immunity, organized by Drs. Stuart Tangye, Hai Qi and Ignacio Sanz. The meeting will be held in Whistler, British Columbia from April 23-27, 2017. B cells are fundamental for the development of long-lived immunological memory following exposure to infectious pathogens and, consequently, for the success of the vast majority of currently-available vaccines. The differentiation of B cells into the effector cells of serological memory ? memory B cells and plasma cells ? occurs in germinal centers. However this process critically requires a specialized subset of CD4+ T cells termed T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. The integration of signals required to generate germinal center B cells, memory and plasma cells, and Tfh cells are strictly controlled. This is to ensure the efficient selection of antigen-specific high-affinity effector cells, and to prevent the development of immune dyscrasias associated with GCs, such as autoimmunity, immune deficiency and malignancy ? conditions that can develop when the complexities of lymphocyte differentiation in germinal centers are dysregulated. Despite the substantial advances that have been made in understanding the cellular, biochemical and molecular requirements for the generation of effective T-dependent B-cell responses, major questions regarding these processes remain. Answers to such questions are needed so as to be able to harness the intrinsic function of memory B cells, plasma cells and Tfh cells in order to enhance immunity in immunocompromised individuals, improve vaccine design and develop novel vaccines for infectious pathogens, as well as to attenuate humoral immune responses in the setting of autoantibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. This meeting will bring together basic and clinical immunologists to address unanswered questions and to discuss the latest cutting-edge breakthroughs in the biology of B cells and Tfh cells to facilitate development of new translational strategies of regulating their behavior in human immunopathologies."
"9406546","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers an ideal approach to imaging congenital and acquired cardiovascular diseases in pediatric patients because it is non-invasive, radiation-free and information-rich. However, the general applicability of pediatric cardiovascular MRI is constrained by two challenges. First, currently available techniques cannot collect data faster than cardiac and respiratory motion. Second, children are uncooperative, unstable and vulnerable, making it difficult to employ conventional motion-control techniques that require patient cooperation, e.g., k-space segmentation with breath holding.  To overcome these challenges, the proposed project will translate a novel high-speed MRI framework into a data acquisition paradigm that can image the moving heart in real-time. This framework, which is called correlation imaging, can overcome the speed limit of available MRI techniques using linear data acquisition and image reconstruction strategies, providing a clinically translatable approach to improving the applicability of pediatric cardiovascular MRI.  In this proposed 5-year project, we will translate correlation imaging into a real-time imaging tool that can collect data faster than cardiac and respiratory motion on clinical MRI scanners. We will establish a new real- time data acquisition paradigm for pediatric cardiovascular MRI examination without breath holding, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring or respiratory navigation in our institution. In addition, we will develop an innovative Fourier analysis approach that can assess cardiovascular function by evaluating blood circulation periodicity from real-time images collected over a series of sequential cardiac cycles. We expect that the proposed research will transform pediatric cardiovascular MRI by reducing motion complications and thus improving disease prognosis and diagnosis.  The proposed project will be carried out by a research team of experts from the fields of engineering, physics and cardiology. We will bridge the expertise of scientific, clinical and industrial researchers in order to translate our new high-speed data acquisition technique into pediatric cardiovascular MRI. Since imaging speed is a critical barrier to many areas of clinical MRI, however, our research promises an even more widespread impact on the field of clinical imaging."
"9258206","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders (SIMD) requests support to provide scholarships for trainees to attend its annual meetings in years 2016 to 2020. The 2016 meeting will be held in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, on April 3-6, 2016. The 2017 meeting will be held in conjunction with the International Congress on Inborn Errors of Metabolism in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, September 5-8, 2017. The 2018 meeting will be held in San Diego, CA, March 11-14, 2018. The 2019 Meeting will be held in coordination with the American College of Medical Genetics in Seattle, Washington. The 2020 meeting will be held in a location to be determined in the USA. Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are an important cause of intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, neuromuscular disease, cardiac disorders, hepatic and renal dysfunction, arthritis, diabetes, growth failure and blindness. These conditions affect people of all ages, but children are disproportionately affected. The clinical and molecular spectrum of these disorders continues to expand, in part fueled by the rapid expansion of newborn screening programs with the identification of milder cases and advances in genomics (exome and whole genome sequencing) that identify patients at the most severe end of the spectrum. New therapies are becoming available for some conditions, with still relatively few clinical trials to identify new therapies for previously untreatable conditions. Much remains to be done to better understand these severe, rare disorders and to develop effective treatments for them. For the U.S. to remain pre-eminent in this important area of research, it is essential to attract young investigators into the field. One effective mechanism to achieve this goal is to provide them with the opportunity to participate in the SIMD meeting, where they can explore the field and develop scientific ties to other established investigators. The SIMD meeting is held annually and participation, especially by young investigators, has been steadily increasing each year. The availability of NIH travel awards has been a major reason for this increase. Trainees seeking funding are required to submit an abstract describing original research to be presented at the meeting. Trainees/young investigators usually submit about 30 abstracts for presentation at each meeting with twice that number for the international meeting (2017). Applications for travel awards will be competitively reviewed 3 months prior to each meeting, with the goal of making up to 15 annual awards of $ 1,000 each for the national meeting and up to 10 awards of $ 1,500 for the International meeting. Additional funds will be solicited from private sources. Women and minority applicants will be actively recruited."

Through these relationships, the core will also serve as a conduit to bring together P01 investigators with specific needs, to the appropriate local collaborators. Training and education of P01 PIs, students, postdocs, and technicians are key components of the core operating philosophy. This approach will help investigators achieve an in-depth understanding of their data while at the same time allowing the core to maintain its current low overhead. The core has already merged the hardware capabilities at Tulane with the University of Florida High Performance Computer Center, creating adequate computational resources to satisfy even substantial growth in the five-year project period."
"9385439","Project Summary/Abstract Many viruses use non-coding RNAs to manipulate host cell processes. An example of one such RNA is found in arthropod-borne flaviviruses (FVs), a class of virus responsible for serious public health threats including Dengue, Yellow Fever, and West Nile Virus. FVs produce subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs), RNA fragments about 200-500 nts in length which have been found to be responsible for the pathology of FV infection in model infection systems. sfRNA fragments are generated by cleavage of the full-length flaviviral genome by the endogenous 5??3? exonuclease Xrn1. Specific structured RNA elements within the sfRNA resist Xrn1 degradation, halting Xrn1 cleavage and leaving the sfRNA fragment behind. These structured RNA elements are known as Xrn1-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs), and mutations to xrRNAs are found to eliminate the accumulation of sfRNA fragments during flavivirus infection. A structural study in the Kieft laboratory has identified the three-dimensional fold of an xrRNA element. The folding of the RNA hints at potential mechanisms for Xrn1 resistance, however it is currently unclear whether the RNA forms a static, highly-stable RNA structure or accomplishes its activity through dynamic interactions with the Xrn1 entrance channel. A full mechanistic understanding of xrRNAs requires an understanding of the stability and molecular dynamics of xrRNA folding. In my first aim, I propose to use single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) combined with quantitative biochemical assays of Xrn1 resistance in order to quantify folding transitions in xrRNAs and demonstrate how xrRNA folding contributes to Xrn1 resistance. There are several distinct lineages of arthropod-bourne FVs, including mosquito-bourne (MB), tick-bourne (TB), no known vector (NKV), and insect specific flaviviruses (ISF). The sfRNA sequences derived from these lineages are highly divergent, therefore further study of TB, NKV, and ISF lineage sfRNA is required to determine how they resist Xrn1 degradation. In my second aim, I propose to biochemically characterize the xrRNA elements from TB, NKV, and ISF lineages in order to determine which regions of the sfRNA are responsible for Xrn1 resistance and determine their secondary structure. I also propose to determine the three- dimensional structure of these elements by X-ray crystallography. sfRNAs have been found to inhibit the activity of Xrn1 by forming a complex with Xrn1 and sequestering it, altering the regulation of RNA transcripts during infection. In my third aim I propose to further study this effect. I have created a quantitative Xrn1 resistance assay in order to determine the minimal RNA sequence requirements for Xrn1 sequestration activity and identify how sfRNAs interact with Xrn1."
"9245122","Rapid 3D-printing of Multi-functional Adaptive Nerve Conduits The PIs propose to develop an innovative platform for the fabrication of 3-dimensional (3D) nerve conduits with precise spatial and temporal distribution of biological factors (growth factors, neuron stem cells and extracellular matrix (ECM)). This rapid 3D printing platform employs a dynamic mask for photopolymerization of an entire layer simultaneously without scanning and create 3D conduits continuously, resulting in 1,000 times faster in printing speed and 100 times better in printing resolution compared to traditional nozzle-based 3D printers. Hyaluronic acid (HA), an ECM component, will be modified for 3D printing. HA is a long-chain sugar-like molecule shown to be compatible with wound healing and nerve regeneration. Because it is naturally occurring in the body and has negligible inter-species variation, HA is an excellent candidate biomaterial to use for nerve conduits. Neuron stem cells and growth factors will be printed in the conduits to aid nerve repair.  In the R21 phase, the PIs will develop the rapid 3D printing system, synthesize the HA materials and characterize the 3D printed HA conduits. The team will then implement these nerve conduits into mice to demonstrate growth of the nerve fibers along the bore of the conduit from proximal to distal end and also demonstrate reduction in time to functional recovery due to conduit-assisted growth and regeneration of the nerve fiber. Upon successful completion of these tasks and milestones in the R21 phase, subsequent work in the R33 phase will further develop the rapid 3D printing process to create designer nerve conduits with precise spatio-temporal control of physical, chemical, and biological properties and use such designer conduits for in vivo animal studies. The concepts and techniques developed herein would allow us to create precise, pre-designed distributions of growth factors and neuron stem cells with microscale resolution and enable us to investigate their effects on nerve cell guidance inside a conduit with complex architectures.  The project will be carried out by a team of collaborative talents, including Dr. Chen who is a leading expert in 3D printing and a pioneer in bioprinting, and Dr. Nguyen who is a is board certified in both Head and Neck Surgery and Neurotology/Skull Base Surgery and is the Director of the Facial Nerve Clinic at UC San Diego. Dr. Nguyen has a clinical practice specializing in facial nerve paralysis and brings both clinical expertise as well as basic science research experience to this project."
"9194394","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of the biological mechanisms that regulate cancer metastasis are poorly understood, in part, because of the lack of relevant and high-throughput assay systems that allow for the efficient study of the myriad of parameters involved. These parameters include not just the cancer cells, but the microenvironment the cancer cells encounter at various steps in the metastatic cascade. For example, in order to metastasize, cancer cells must leave the primary tumor and navigate the circulatory system via intravasation and extravasation (into and out of blood vessels). This occurs amidst a complex environment consisting of different interacting cell types that likely effect and regulate invasion/intravasation and extravasation/colonization. Here we propose to develop an in vitro high throughput model of intravasation and extravasation that incorporates several essential structure/function relationships found in vivo. Further, we will validate the in vitro assay with a in vivo mouse model and a microarray of human tissue samples from primary and metastatic mammary tumors. We will use novel micro fabrication methods (e.g. viscous fingering) to create high-throughput arrays of micro vessels (e.g. endothelial lined lumens created within extracellular matrix). The assay platform integrates microfluidics and multiple cell type 3D culture to provide an automated system for identifying the effectors of intravasation and extravasation - two key steps in the metastatic cascade. Finally, we will apply the assay platform to perform a discovery-based screen of the microenvironmental factors suspected to influence breast cancer metastasis. The screening-based approach uniquely enabled by our approach will likely discover new targets for therapeutic intervention that would have been missed in traditional approaches which don't allow an examination of the complex interactions between cancer cells, stromal cells and the extracellular matrix."
"9304717","Project Summary/Abstract Deaf children are at risk for impoverished and/or delayed exposure to language, spoken or signed. Early vocabulary is a robust predictor of later language development, and understanding the trajectory of vocabulary development in deaf children can help educators and researchers develop interventions to mitigate the risks and effects of language deprivation. Two factors that might play a unique role in sign language vocabulary acquisition are neighborhood density and iconicity. Typically hearing children track statistical information about the sounds of language to acquire new words, and words that sound similar to many other words (have high phonological neighborhood density) are overrepresented in early spoken vocabularies. Sign language phonology is not based on sounds that are sequentially organized but on features like hand configurations and locations that are articulated simultaneously. There is also a dearth of minimal pairs in many sign languages. We ask whether deaf children track statistical information about combinations of manual features as children acquiring spoken language track phonological information about words, or if the nature of sign phonology makes signs more amenable to holistic processing and acquisition. If the former is true, we expect signs with high neighborhood density to be overrepresented in early vocabularies just as in speech acquisition; if the latter is true neighborhood density should not play a role in sign acquisition. The second factor that may play a unique role in sign acquisition is the abundance of iconicity in signed languages. It is unclear whether children can make use of iconic relationships between sign forms and meanings because iconicity is confounded with neighborhood density in sign language. In the proposed study we ask for the first time whether iconicity predicts signed vocabulary acquisition while controlling for neighborhood density and frequency in child-directed speech by using parental reports of children?s ASL vocabulary skills (ASL-CDI). All of the lexical and input factors gathered in this study (expressive and receptive age of acquisition norms, type of iconicity, and frequency in child-directed speech) will be made publically available by integrating with an interactive online database of ASL vocabulary, ASL-LEX. ASL-LEX currently contains information about neighborhood density, degree of iconicity, lexical class, and frequency in adult-directed speech, as well as several other properties. This work will shed light on the factors that shape vocabulary acquisition in native signing children, and will lay the groundwork for understanding vocabulary development in deaf children of hearing parents acquiring sign language later in development."
"9204716","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is predicted to be the most burdensome disease worldwide by the year 2030. Improved understanding of the neural circuits mediating key psychological processes that go awry in the disorder will facilitate development of novel treatments for MDD. Reduced interest in pursuing previously rewarding stimuli (anhedonia) is a core symptom of MDD. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is critical to the pursuit of rewards under normal conditions, and clinical neuroimaging studies suggest this system to be hypoactive in MDD. The unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) animal model has been a useful means to study this phenomenon in rodents. Following UCMS, animals show decreased motivated behavior, which can be restored with DA system excitation. An important question that remains unanswered, however, is why the DA system is functioning improperly in MDD. Our lab has recently shown that the DA system is hypoactive in animals that have undergone UCMS (as well as learned helplessness), due to enhanced afferent inhibition of DA neurons located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We have delineated a circuit whereby increased basolateral amygdala (BLA) drive of the ventral pallidum (VP) following UCMS leads to a potent reduction in VTA DA neuron population activity (number of active DA neurons), and this appears to be critical to the mechanism whereby UCMS reduces DA system tone. However, this circuit presently omits two regions proposed to be important nodes in MDD circuitry in humans: the subgenual cingulate cortex (BA25), whose rodent homologue is the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (ILPFC), and the lateral habenula (LHb). Human studies have shown BA25 to be overactive in MDD, as is also seen for the BLA, and thus a known projection from the ILPFC to the BLA may be driving the BLA over-activation that is critical to diminished DA activity seen following UCMS. Alternatively, the LHb has a more proximal projection to the VTA DA neurons and therefore over- activation of this region may, via the rostromedial tegmentum (RMTg), inhibit VTA DA neurons. We will therefore investigate the relative roles of these two regions in UCMS-induced DA system down-regulation, via the following aims: 1) To determine the impact on the DA system of activating efferent projections from ILPFC- >BLA and LHb->RMTg in normal rats using electrophysiological and behavioral readouts, 2) To assess whether inactivating the ILPFC->BLA or LHb->RMTg projections improves DA system function in animals that exhibit impaired motivation after undergoing UCMS, 3) To define the time course for the development of alterations in regional activity level in potential circuit nodes, including the ILPFC, BLA, LHb, RMTg, VP, and VTA. With greater understanding of the afferent structures potentially down-regulating the DA system in MDD, novel therapeutic interventions could specifically target aberrantly functioning nodes in this neural circuit."
"9244067","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Serious antisocial behavior, including criminal offending, is extremely costly to society. Rates of such behavior are highest during emerging adulthood. Antisocial behavior is especially high among emerging adults (EAs) with mental illness (MI); findings suggest the majority of EAs with MI will be arrested by age 25, most with multiple arrests, and for serious charges. Thus, there is a clear public health need for effective treatments to reduce serious antisocial behavior in EAs with MI. Astonishingly, there are no established interventions with evidence of efficacy to reduce serious antisocial behavior among EAs, with or without MI. Effective antisocial behavior interventions in adolescents address the comprehensive causes of that behavior. Similarly, this team has developed and completed research on a well-defined age-tailored intervention for EAs with MI and serious antisocial behavior that addresses the correlates of EA antisocial behavior, and provides MI treatment. The intervention is an adaptation of the well-established effective juvenile antisocial behavior intervention, Multisystemic Therapy (MST). MST-EA is a single source that targets the EA correlates of antisocial behavior, including gainful activity (school, work, housing, and positive relationships) and reduced substance use, in part by targeting the proximal mechanism of poor self-regulation. MST-EA also addresses these correlates through reducing MI symptoms. The investigative team has already established the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of thi type of intervention in a successfully completed community-based open trial (R34MH081374-01, PI: Davis). The proposed study will rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of MST- EA for reducing serious antisocial behavior. Specifically, 240 EAs with MI and recent arrests or release from justice facilities will be randomized to receive MST-EA or Treatment as Usual (TAU). Assessments will be completed at months 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16, with confirmation of outcome data using collateral reports and system records. The first aim will be to evaluate the effect over time of MST-EA for improving the ultimate outcome of treatment: reduced serious antisocial behavior. The second aim is to evaluate the effect of MST-EA on (a) the key proximal target of treatment (self-regulation) and (b) the proposed intermediate outcomes of treatment (gainful activity, substance use, and MI problems). The final aim will be to determine whether MST-EA's effect on the ultimate outcome is the result of its effect on the proximal target and intermediate outcomes of treatment. There is a current absence of any antisocial behavior treatments with demonstrated efficacy in this age group. The ultimate effect of the proposed research would be decreased antisocial behavior and other public health-related behaviors (MI symptoms, substance use, homelessness, unemployment) among one of the highest-risk population of individuals with MI. With an emphasis on treatment mechanisms and the near absence of MI research focused on EAs, this innovative research has high potential to advance the field."
"9328799","Coronaviruses have the largest genomes among known RNA viruses and are phylogenetically divided into four genera. Some betacoronaviruses, such as HKU1, circulate annually in humans and cause mild yet prevalent respiratory disease whereas others, such as SARS-CoV and the recently emerged MERS-CoV, have caused pandemics with high case-fatality rates. Due to their pandemic potential and airborne transmissibility, highly pathogenic coronaviruses are now classified as NIAID Category C priority pathogens. Coronavirus cell tropism and host range are in large part determined by the viral surface spike (S) glycoprotein, which is the largest known class I viral fusion protein. After binding to host receptors and activation by host proteases, the S proteins undergo large conformational rearrangements that result in fusion of the viral and host-cell membranes. A molecular understanding of the structure, function and antigenicity of intact, trimeric S proteins would identify sites of vulnerability that could be targeted by vaccines, therapeutic antibodies and small- molecule antivirals. However, structural studies have been primarily limited to small S protein fragments, which has precluded a unifying structural framework for the biology of coronavirus S proteins. To address this knowledge gap, we have generated soluble, trimeric S proteins from HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV that are amenable to structural analysis by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. We will determine atomic-level structures of these S proteins in the prefusion and post fusion conformations to identify commonalities and differences among divergent betacoronaviruses and define the conformational end-states of the fusion process (Aim 1). With these constructs and a range of biochemical and biophysical assays, we will determine the molecular basis for receptor-induced conformational changes and investigate the effects of host proteases and acidification on this process (Aim 2). The combination of these studies will provide key molecular insights into S protein-mediated membrane fusion and answer long-standing questions regarding S protein triggering. Similar to other class I fusion proteins, such as influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and HIV-1 envelope (Env), coronavirus S proteins are the primary target for neutralizing antibodies and are thus a critical component of developmental vaccines. Currently, the best-characterized antibodies against coronaviruses target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein and prevent binding to host cells. The RBD, however, is the most variable part of the spike protein and antibodies that target this domain are unlikely to be cross-reactive, similar to most HA head-binding antibodies. Therefore, we will define the epitopes and mechanisms of antibody-mediated neutralization for novel, non-RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies isolated by our collaborator Dr. Barney Graham (Aim 3). By identifying conserved sites of vulnerability, these studies will provide the foundation for the development of immunotherapies and vaccines that broadly protect against highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses, including those that have yet to emerge."
"9404664","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant Participants of syringe exchange programs (SEPs) routinely suffer from untreated or under-treated substance use disorder, a situation that is associated with significant individual and public health costs (Degenjardt et al., 2010). These individuals are also routinely embedded within social networks that reinforce continued drug use and risk behaviors (Latkin et al., 2013a). The welfare of these individuals and the public's health can be improved by interventions directed toward reducing drug use risks and expanding drug-free support (Kidorf & King, 2008). Previous work by our research group has demonstrated that an intervention combining a risk reduction/treatment readiness group with behavioral contingencies is highly associated with increased rates of treatment enrollment and re-engagement, and reduced rates of drug use and injection behaviors, for up to one year (e.g., Kidorf et al., 2009). The present R34 application extends this work by adding a new component to the risk reduction/treatment readiness group designed to expand social support and facilitate social network change. This intervention requires SEP registrants to attend the group with a drug-free family or friend from their personal network that can provide stable support and encourage harm reduction and treatment seeking. This intervention uses an alteration network change model (Valente, 2012) and posits that repeated exposure to drug-free community support collaterally reduces exposure to network members that support risk behaviors. This model also provides a pathway to modifying existing social networks by facilitating interaction with the personal social networks of drug-free family and friends. The intervention is supported by research showing that substance users report substantial pockets of drug-free family or friends in their social networks (Bohnert et al., 2010; Kidorf et al., 2005b). It is also supportedby community reinforcement principles that have shown efficacy in treatment samples (Roozen et al., 2004), but have not been applied to out-of-treatment drug users. The study will activate and characterize drug-free support in the personal social networks of SEP participants, evaluate the feasibility of a 6-week Community Supported Risk Reduction intervention that partners with drug- free family and friends, and evaluate the efficacy of this intervention over 6-months. Primary outcomes include changes in 1) network support for reducing drug use, and 2) injection risk behaviors (sharing equipment, rates of use), while secondary analyses will evaluate changes in time spent with drug using and non-using individuals. Data will be used to support an RCT isolating the benefits of community involvement for reducing risks, expanding drug-free support, and facilitating social network change."
"9308377","Cardiomyocyte cell cycle induction offers the potential for restoration of myocardial mass, and consequently contractile function, following cardiac injury. Considerable effort has thus been invested studying the degree to which cardiomyocytes can reenter the cell cycle and progress through cytokinesis in normal and injured adult mammalian hearts. Using a transgenic reporter system to identify cardiomyocyte nuclei in tissue sections in conjunction with continuous BrdU infusion, we have developed a digital imaging and analysis system which permits both quantitation and 3D anatomical mapping of cumulative cardiomyocyte S-phase activity across the entire heart. Using this system, we observed discrete clusters of cardiomyocyte S-phase activity in mice with permanent coronary artery ligation. We also observed very high rates of cardiomyocyte S-phase activity in the remote myocardium of mice with ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The studies proposed in this application will identify the underlying mechanistic basis for the differential cardiomyocyte cell cycle responses observed following myocardial injury. In Specific Aim 1, the variability in cardiomyocyte S-phase induction and cell cycle progression following permanent coronary artery ligation will be established and the resulting data sets will then be used for mathematical modeling with the goal of establish sampling criteria to quantitate total heart cardiomyocyte S-phase activity which takes into account these intrinsic anatomical variations. Other studies will determine if the observed clusters of S-phase activity arise from the clonal expansion of a subset of cardiomyocytes which retain the potential for cell cycle reentry. In Specific Aim 2, I/R injury will be performed in reporter mice maintained in an inbred genetic background to determine if the nature and/or degree of injury are responsible for high levels of cell cycle induction in the remote myocardium. Other studies will utilize informative backcrosses to determine the extent to which modifying genes can impact cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry following I/R injury. In both Aims, the degree to which the S-phase positive cardiomyocytes progress through the cell cycle will also be quantitated. The proposed experiments will establish a 3D atlas of cardiomyocyte S-phase activity in response to commonly used and clinically relevant injury models, and will establish the degree to which increased levels of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis contribute to polyploidization, multi-nucleation, and/or cardiomyocyte renewal. In addition, these experiments will characterize the impact of gender, genetic background and mode of injury on the magnitude of cardiomyocyte cell cycle reentry, as well as determine the consequences of natural variation in cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity on cardiac function post-injury. These data will provide useful insight for the development of interventional strategies with which to promote regenerative growth of the heart, as well as provide a comprehensive reference set for studies aimed at inducing cardiomyocyte renewal."
"9344513","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research focuses on the role of mass media in state and community tobacco control efforts. The overarching goals of the proposed project are a) to develop an understanding of the amount and variety of tobacco-related information that both smokers and nonsmokers encounter across media platforms, and b) to analyze the relationships between that information and attitudes, beliefs and smoking behavior. This research is critically important for state and community tobacco control efforts because the mass media landscape has fundamentally transformed over the past five years, to include platforms such as increasingly sophisticated internet marketing and advertising strategies, social networking (e.g., facebook, twitter, and youtube), mobile messaging, and the growing fragmentation of traditional broadcast media. As a result, the amount and variety of pro- and anti-tobacco information available across media platforms has proliferated. Yet, there is very little detailed public information available about which new media is commonly used, or how much they are used across demographic groups. In addition, little is known about the extent to which smokers and non-smokers are exposed to pro- and anti-tobacco information, or how much tobacco-related information seeking and exchange is conducted across media platforms. The proposed research will conduct the first large-scale survey on new media consumption, exposure to smoking-related advertising and information seeking and exchange related to smoking/quitting across traditional and new media platforms. By combining existing data on exposure to smoking-related messages on TV, with new data collected as part of the proposed research, this project will provide the first comprehensive description of the amount and variety of pro- and anti-tobacco information that smokers and non-smokers encounter passively, and which they actively seek out and exchange. With these data, we will be able to explore whether, and the extent to which, smoking-related information delivered across various media platforms is associated with attitudes and smoking behaviors. Further, these data will enable us to examine whether and how the various type's tobacco-related information and media interact with each other."
"9347149","Project Summary/Abstract (Description) Significance: Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) respiratory infections is increasing across the globe. In the US, in those over 65 years-old, annual prevalence of pulmonary NTM disease increased significantly from 20 to 47 cases/100,000 between 1997-2007 with Hawaii having the highest prevalence at 396 cases/100,000. Pulmonary NTM is 1.4 times more common in women. These numbers are likely underestimated because of a lack of mandatory reporting in the U.S. Treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease is challenging for several reasons including the relative resistance to currently available drugs and the difficulty in tolerating prolonged treatment with multiple drugs. The only oral drugs with reliable activity against M. abscessus complex an NTM are the macrolides and clofazimine. Similar to that for M. avium complex, clofazimine was found to synergize with clarithromycin or amikacin against M. abscessus Clofazimine is an attractive agent for treatment of NTM respiratory infections including M. abscessus but cutaneous and internal organ accumulation from high oral doses cause significant toxicity. High oral doses are required to reach effective concentrations in the lungs. Inhaled doses of clofazimine have the potential to reach immediate treatment concentrations in the lungs with inhaled low doses that do not have significant systemic toxicity. Preliminary Data: Aerophase has recently demonstrated that innovative aerosol formulations of clofazimine with a new type of aerosol drug inhaler can treat TB respiratory infections without side effects from systemic toxicity. The new clofazimine formulation and aerosol device has demonstrated sustained pulmonary treatment concentration and an aerosol size range that can target the entire lung with clofazimine even alveolar regions. The Aerophase inhaled aerosol delivery method holds great promise to mitigate toxicity and allow for safe clofazimine administration directly targeted to the site of infection. Specific Aims: The first aim of this project is to treat NTM respiratory infections with inhaled clofazimine much more effectively than oral clofazimine with much lower inhaled dose. The second aim is to develop a small pocket sized metered dose inhaler with drug formulation, aerosol size, and dose optimized to treat NTM respiratory infections. The third aim will test in-vivo efficacy of inhaled clofazimine in combination with other drugs."
"9208177","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal examines how a growth factor signaling pathway is linked to synapse structure and function. Growth factors are potent neuromodulators and play diverse roles at synapses. They regulate fundamental features of synaptic biology including baseline transmitter release, synapse morphology, and plasticity. Given their importance directing synapse organization, it is important to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms coupling synaptic growth factor signaling to synapses and neuronal activity. BMP/TGF? family members are evolutionarily conserved regulators of synapse structure and function. In particular, a BMP/TGF? pathway has neurotrophic pathway activity at the Drosophila NMJ. BMP pathway mutants display striking defects in NMJ morphology and function. Remarkably, distinct ligand pools independently regulate these synaptic features. We demonstrate that the presynaptic pool regulates synaptic structure and function, while the postsynaptic pool directs overall growth of the NMJ terminal. Understanding how these information channels are separated at an endogenous synapse is essential to understand how distinct synaptic features are independently controlled. Our entry point to this work is the novel neuronal transmembrane protein Crimpy. We have demonstrated that Crimpy enables discrimination between pre- and postsynaptic BMP pools. Crimpy binds a BMP homolog called Gbb and traffics it to presynaptic dense core vesicles (DCVs). Without Crimpy, Gbb is no longer found in DCVs and is not released by presynaptic activity. In the absence of Crimpy, pre- and postsynaptic ligand pools cannot be distinguished, and the NMJs are characterized by aberrant trophic signaling at the expense of the presynaptic synapse-organizing cue. In this proposal, we build on our novel preliminary findings to define the role of activity-induced presynaptic BMP signaling in synapse structure and function. First, we define the molecular identity of the pre- and postsynaptic signals. Because Crimpy is key for marking the presynaptic pool, we will define biochemically the role of Crimpy in BMP signal transduction. Second, we will elucidate how activity-dependent BMP signals direct synapse organization. We test the hypothesis that the Crimpy-mediated presynaptic Gbb signal is a local and acute cue instructive cue driving synapse organization. And third, we will define the downstream signaling cascade. We have exciting preliminary evidence that a novel BMP receptor transduces the activity-dependent signal. We will establish the receptor's role in the pathway and characterize novel downstream components of a non-canonical activity-dependent BMP cascade."

"9311593","PROJECT SUMMARY Pneumonia is a common reason children present to the emergency department (ED) and one of the top three causes for pediatric hospitalization in the United States. Pneumonia also accounts for more days of antibiotic therapy in pediatric hospitals than any other condition. Unfortunately, extensive variation in the delivery of care for children with pneumonia is evident nationally, including differences in antibiotic selection that are often discordant with national pneumonia treatment guidelines, and inconsistent site of care decisions not explained by differences in illness severity. National research priorities for childhood pneumonia emphasize the need for standardized treatment approaches to improve antibiotic stewardship and the creation of objective risk stratification tools to optimize disposition decisions. Our research team recently developed a prognostic tool using prospective data collected from more than 2600 children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia that accurately discriminates between children who develop severe in-hospital outcomes and those who do not. Expanding and recalibrating our prognostic tool for use in the ED, where the disease burden and spectrum of illness is greatest, is a critical next step in our research. The ED is also an important setting to test innovative strategies for improving antibiotic prescribing. Few formal antibiotic stewardship programs exist within the ED, and pediatric studies addressing antibiotic overuse for pneumonia in this environment are limited. In addition to our demonstrated expertise in pediatric pneumonia, our team also possesses prior success leveraging health information technology to improve care using clinical decision support that is seamlessly integrated within the electronic health record (EHR). Use of EHR-based antibiotic and prognostic decision support applications in the ED environment are innovative approaches to improve care for children with pneumonia and a central focus of the proposed research. Our multidisciplinary study team, with expertise across the continuum of clinical care as well as in epidemiology, biostatistics, and biomedical informatics, is uniquely suited to conduct these studies. Within two free-standing children's hospitals and one general community hospital, we will test the following hypotheses: 1) Our expanded and recalibrated prognostic tool will accurately discriminate between children with and without high risk for severe outcomes in the ED; 2) EHR-based antibiotic decision support increases guideline-concordant antibiotic use compared with usual care in the ED; and 3) Delivery of EHR-based severity information generated by our prognostic tool improves appropriate site of care disposition in the ED compared to usual care. These hypotheses will be tested within the framework of a prospective, observational cohort and two pragmatic randomized controlled trials. The overarching goal of this research is to demonstrate the potential of risk stratification and high quality EHR-based decision support to improve care delivery and outcomes for children with pneumonia."
"9210074","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9314780","PROJECT SUMMARY This K23 application is submitted by Andrea A. Berry, M.D., an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Dr. Berry's long term goal is to become an independent investigator in the field of malaria translational research. Towards this goal, she proposes a mentored career development plan that provides training in microarray analysis, biostatistics, and epidemiology. An effective Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine will boost prospects for the control and eventual eradication of malaria. However, the field is only beginning to understand the requirements and characteristics of malaria protective immunity, which is key to vaccine development. A promising approach is serological profiling on high-throughput protein microarrays, which can elucidate antibody responses to hundreds of P. falciparum antigen variants simultaneously. The investigator's group uses protein microarrays containing diverse variants of key P. falciparum antigens so that they can study antigen variants associated with cross- reactive and cross-protective immune responses. However, a gap in knowledge is the ability to differentiate between antibody binding due to cross-reactivity and antibody binding due to accumulated exposure to malaria ? on protein microarrays, both responses manifest as reactivity to multiple antigen variants. Differentiating these two patterns of antibody binding is difficult in field studies because only limited data is available on participants' previous exposure, and even for ongoing infections one cannot always know the exact genetic makeup of the parasite or the exact timing of exposure. Elucidating the characteristics of cross-reactivity and accumulated exposure is nonetheless critical to gaining a better understanding of the development of protective immunity from malaria. Controlled Human Malaria Infections, in which volunteers are exposed to malaria through the bites of infectious mosquitoes, are an opportunity to study the effect of single-clone malaria infections on the immune response. This proposed work will evaluate immune responses in malaria naïve volunteers who experience single and repeated P. falciparum infections in order to inform the interpretation of immune responses in individuals living in malaria endemic regions. Protein and peptide microarrays will be used to probe sera from initially naïve volunteers after they have recovered from P. falciparum challenge. Aim 1: Evaluate the effect of single infections on the immune response by comparing two groups of volunteers  after infection with two different P. falciparum strains. Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of repeated infection on the immune response by following a group of volunteers  who experience four P. falciparum infections over two years."
"9387602","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal outlines a detailed plan for providing the investigator with the scientific training and career developmen skills to ensure a successful postdoctoral training period. His training will be mentored by Drs. Chad Pearson (sponsor) and Lee Niswander (co-sponsor) at the University of Colorado-School of Medicine. The scientific training will focus on how levels of the second messenger ion calcium (Ca2+) are regulated within subcellular signaling structures called cilia, and, in turn, how cilia Ca2+ levels impact ciia structure. Cilia are ubiquitous and evolutionarily conserved appendages that are present on nearly every cell in the human body. Since defects in cilia contribute to a plethora of devastating and currently intractable developmental disorders, this research is expected to improve our basic understanding of cilia biology and inform future ciliopathy therapies. To investigate the relationship between cilia and Ca2+, the investigator has established the hypothesis that cilia Ca2+ levels directly regulate cilia length and that the basal body (BB), which is a small microtubule structure that sits at the base of cilia, regulates the flow of Ca2+ into and out of ciia. To test this this hypothesis, the investigator proposes to accomplish two aims. In Aim1, the investigator will use Ca2+ imaging, optopharmacological manipulation of ciliary Ca2+, and genetic ablation of ciliary Ca2+ levels to directly test how ciliary Ca2+ levels impact cilia lengt. The results from this aim will resolve a fundamental question in cilia biology that is related to how the global manipulation of Ca2+ is able to specifically alter cilia length. In Aim2, the investigator will use similar tools to define how structurally defective BBs alter the flow of Ca2+ into and out of cilia at rest and during signaling events in olfactory sensory neurons. The results from these experiments will illuminate the BB as a novel regulator of ciliary Ca2+ signaling, which will open up a new area of inquiry for the investigator to pursue. In conjunction with a strong mentoring team, the investigator has also established professional developmental goals, such as manuscript preparation, attendance at national conferences and formal coursework in the areas of microscopy, digital image analysis and grant writing to ensure that the scientific training is translated into a future career as an independent investigator."
"9204819","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian middle ear is unique among tetrapods (mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds), in that it contains three distinct ossicles (the malleus, incus, and stapes) that form an indirect and usually flexible coupling path between the eardrum and cochlea, for which the majority of the ossicular mass is concentrated away from the cochlear entry axis. This differs markedly from the middle ears of non-mammalian tetrapods, in which eardrum motions are transmitted to the cochlea more or less in a straight line via a rod-like columella structure. Many theories have been presented as to the functional consequences and possible advantages of this peculiar middle-ear arrangement, especially considering that mammals are capable of hearing to much higher frequencies than non-mammals (>100 kHz vs. <12 kHz), and these theories range from allowing the ossicles to adopt lower-inertia vibrational modes at higher frequencies; to providing added flexibility to protect th cochlea against high static pressures in the ear canal or impulsive stimuli; to leveraging the off-axis mass distribution and joint flexibility to reduce the amount of ossicular inertia transmitted o the cochlea in response to skull vibrations from self-generated sounds due to vocalizations, breathing, pumping blood, etc., and thus allowing more attention to be focused on the external sounds critical for survival. In this proposal, the functioning of the mammalian ossicular chain will be tested, using measurements of 3D motion due to air and bone-conducted stimuli and 3D displacements due to positive and negative static pressure in the ear canal; and modeled, producing anatomically accurate ?CT-based 3D models of the full middle ear with accurate representations of ossicular-joint flexibility and the optional incorporation of a coiled cochlear model for testing bone-conduction responses. The measurements will be performed, and models based, on human, cat, and mouse temporal bones, with their: 1) natural ossicular chains, as well as with modified versions that 2) alter its natural freedom of motion by fusing one or both ossicular joints, and that 3) remove its indirect coupling path and off-axis mass distribution by replacing the incus with a columella-like prosthesis directly connecting the long process of the malleus to the footplate or head of the stapes. The measurements and resulting models will be used to comparatively examine the role of middle-ear structure on: 1) sound transmission from the ear canal to the cochlea, especially at higher frequencies; 2) protection of the cochlea; and 3) the transmission of sound to the cochlea via bone conduction. Comparisons across the three proposed scientifically and clinically important mammalian species will help to clarify any functional changes caused by differences in mammalian middle-ear anatomy, while comparisons across the proposed ossicular chain modifications will allow clarification of the functional implications of the structural features unique to mammalian middle ears. The measurements and models with a prosthesis replacing the incus may additionally lead to new ideas for improving the clinical outcomes of middle-ear reconstruction surgeries."
"9253551","In the era of growing antibiotic resistance, life threatening infections with several bacterial pathogens are cause for major concern. Approved vaccines exist only for a handful of bacterial pathogens. Even when a vaccine is available invasive bacterial diseases can occur due to lack of serotype coverage, poor vaccine response among vaccinated populations, or because many simply don?t get vaccinated. Thus, innovative concepts are needed to cope with these challenges. The current proposal is aimed at developing a novel post exposure treatment that is serotype independent and can be applied to a variety of gram positive bacteria. The approach, termed Infection Site Targeted universal Bridging Antigen (ISTuBA) exploits the ability of species-specific, but serotype- independent, phage-derived bacterial cell wall binding domains (CBD) to target an ?ImmunoBridge?, an antigen against which most people have antibodies, to the surface of bacteria. The CBD will redirect the pre-existing immunity against ImmunoBridge towards the new invading pathogen leading to clearance of infection. In this proposal prototype ISTuBAs will be created for Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of community acquired pneumonia as well other life-threatening infections. In preliminary studies we have demonstrated that ISTuBAs based on an attenuated staphylococcal enterotoxin B vaccine (STEBVax) as ImmunoBridge and S. pneumoniae specific CBDs can direct an S. aureus specific antibody response to mediate opsonophagocytosis of S. pneumoniae strains. Building upon these strong preliminary data, in Aim 1 we will test a wide range of candidate CBDs for binding against a broad panel of pneumococcal serotypes to identify the best CBDs. A short list of broadly reactive CBDs with high affinity will be used to create candidate ISTuBAs in Aim 2 using not only STEBVax but also diphtheria toxoid (CRM197) and Tetanus toxoid as ImmunoBridge. The candidate ISTuBAs will be thoroughly characterized for biochemical and functional properties including opsonophagocytosis in presence of anti-ImmunoBridge antibodies. Two best ISTuBA candidates will be tested in mouse intranasal model of S. pneumoniae infection in Aim 3. Upon successful completion of Phase I we anticipate a Phase II project that will focus on optimization of the constructs, extensive efficacy testing in both pneumonia and sepsis models, formulation, pharmacokinetics and other IND-enabling studies."
"9260554","PROJECT SUMMARY. Many patients with advanced prostate cancer along with their decision partners/ proxies (DPP) struggle with complex treatment decisions, such as when to start, change, or stop cancer directed treatment. Despite the utility of decision aids (DAs) to address decisional conflict, little is known about treatment decision-making for advanced cancers. The study's primary aim is to test the effects of a theory- based mHealth DA (CHAMPION) administered by Registered Nurse (RN)-Community Patient Navigator (CPN) teams to advanced prostate cancer patients and decision partners/proxies on the following outcomes: less decisional conflict/uncertainty, higher psychosocial quality of life domain (HRQL-PSY), and less regret at the time of making an anti-cancer treatment decision. The secondary aim is to evaluate the CPN role in delivery of the mHealth DA (CHAMPION) from the patients' and decision partners/proxies' perspective. Preliminary estimates of treatment effects by race to see if the data support a larger effect among African Americans versus Others in the primary and secondary aims will also be explored. This mixed-methods population-based randomized controlled trial will gather data from 158 patient/DPP pairs at three sites: University of Virginia Emily Couric Cancer Center, the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, and Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center. The pretest/posttest design will measure a time period that includes three single-event decisions over the course of their cancer-directed treatment; and a qualitative retrospective design will allow exploring the experiences of both patients and their DPPs separately in an interview at the completion of the study. Stratification by race (African-American and Caucasian/Other) and decision point (starting vs. changing vs. stopping anticancer treatment) will be used. There will be two groups: the control (enhanced usual care [EUC]) group and the decision intervention (DI) group. The DI group will receive an interactive 7-component cognitive-behavioral skills mHealth program (DA) with a RN-CPN team, primarily focusing on decision-making during cancer treatment. Self-report measures will be used for all participants in addition to probes for the taped interviews with DI. The primary outcome measures are 1) decisional conflict (uncertainty), 2) decisional regret, 3) HRQL-PSY, and 4) decision-making participation preference. Generalized linear models will be used for data analysis for the quantitative component, and qualitative evaluation of the intervention will be conducted to capture each pair's experience of the CHAMPION intervention. This innovative mHealth DA delivered by a CPN is expected to increase acceptability and the uptake of both the DA and the technology components. This addresses several NIH/NINR innovative questions, through the use of information technology to promote health-related decision-making for providers and patients, examining patient outcomes for improvement in healthcare, as well as to engage and support individuals such as extended family, lay coaches, etc. to augment provider care and recommendations."
"9186453","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prefrontal cortex is important for controlling cognition, emotion and memory in animals ranging from rodents to primates. The importance of the prefrontal cortex is highlighted in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia and depression. Pyramidal neurons are the principal cells of the prefrontal cortex, and process diverse excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. These neurons also receive extensive dopaminergic inputs from subcortical regions that modulate intrinsic and synaptic physiology. Dopamine activates metabotropic D1 receptors to enhance pyramidal neuron firing and support cognitive functions like working memory. However, previous studies have found heterogeneous effects of D1 receptors on excitatory and inhibitory responses at pyramidal neurons. We recently discovered that D1 receptors are selectively expressed in only a subpopulation of layer 5 pyramidal neurons (D1+ neurons). These neurons have compact dendrites, high input resistance, minimal h-current and pronounced burst firing compared to their D1- neighbors. Importantly, they are also selectively modulated by D1 receptors, which signal through the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway to boost excitability. The goal of this proposal is to assess how D1 receptors modulate excitatory and inhibitory responses at D1+ neurons in the mouse PFC. We first characterize the different excitatory inputs onto D1+ neurons, using a powerful combination of whole-cell recordings, optogenetics and two-photon microscopy. We then use these approaches to assess the properties of inhibitory inputs onto D1+ neurons, which derive from a variety of GABAergic interneurons. In both cases, we examine the mechanisms that underlie differential synaptic responses at D1+ neurons and their D1-neighbors. Having defined these connections, we test our hypothesis that D1 receptors regulate excitatory and inhibitory synapses only at D1+ neurons. The proposed experiments will reveal how this subpopulation of pyramidal neurons interacts with their long-range and local circuits. The results from these experiments will answer fundamental questions about dopamine regulation of cellular and synaptic physiology. They will also help to identify novel therapeutic targets for the many neuropsychiatric diseases that arise from disrupted dopamine modulation in the PFC."
"9238825","PROJECT SUMMARY Schizophrenia (SZ) is a devastating psychiatric illness with a complex etiology. While genetic sequence variation clearly contributes to SZ development, knowledge of DNA methylation patterns may provide complementary information. First, methylation studies may provide additional insights into disease processes. For example, as methylation may directly regulate gene expression and is mutable in postmitotic tissues, it provides functional information unobtainable by sequence alone and can account for clinical phenomena such as the dynamic course of illness including cycles of remissions and relapses. Second, the translational potential of methylation studies is profound. For example, pathogenic environmental events may leave methylation signatures in blood, traces of which can be preserved during cell division. As methylation marks can be measured cost-effectively in (histone-free) genomic DNA, they can potentially increase the predictive power of algorithms based on sequence variation.  Two complications hamper inferences in methylation studies of SZ. First, there are many possible differences between SZ cases and controls that may affect the methylome including lifestyle differences, disease induced psychological stress, smoking and antipsychotic use. Rather than methylation affecting SZ susceptibility, the direction of effect could be reversed with the disease causing methylation changes. Second, the procurement of brain tissue is not possible in living patients. It is therefore important to study the methylome using a combination of blood samples, which can reveal useful biomarkers, and in brain tissue, which can help identify biologically relevant functions regulated by methylation.  To address these complications we propose to study the methylomic profiles of SZ cases/controls in blood samples collected at birth. Because these samples were collected years prior to any SZ symptoms, it is logically impossible for SZ disease related confounders to cause the associations. Next, to generate causal hypotheses that can potentially be followed up with functional experiments, we integrate the pre SZ onset findings with methylation and transcription data from post SZ onset blood and brain samples using a logically rigorous analytical framework. As detailed knowledge is lacking about disease relevant methylation sites, we propose to assay all ~27 million CpGs in the human genome in all our samples.  Successful completion of this proposal will identify biomarkers and functional methylation marks for SZ generally, and may specifically identify markers with potential to predict SZ risk. Such findings would be of considerable value for improving SZ treatment and care."
"9193630","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this project is to characterize how intratumoral heterogeneity is influenced by tumor suppressive mechanisms. Specifically, the consequence of p53 loss on the development and maintenance of cell-cell genetic diversity will be investigated, based on preliminary data from mouse models. Intratumoral heterogeneity produces a substrate for evolutionary selection and adaptation to a changing environment, for example, as cells disseminate to a new site or are challenged by therapeutic intervention (13). Acquired resistance to therapy is a major roadblock in achieving durable cures for B-cell lymphomas and other cancers (4). In many contexts, resistance has been shown to originate from pre-existing drug-resistant subclones (19, 20), and thus, the level of genetic variation in the tumor underlies the robustness of the tumor to clinical intervention. Central Hypothesis: As genetic abnormalities occur, they have a greater probability of persisting in the population, as a lack of p53 levels the playing field by reducing the differences in relatve fitness between a broader array of otherwise nonviable genotypes. The inevitable result is the accumulation of intratumoral heterogeneity. Specific aims: 1) Intratumoral genetic diversity of a collection of human diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) will be measured using a single cell sequencing approach (29). The association of heterogeneity and p53 status will be investigated. 2) The role of p53 in the development of heterogeneous lymphomas will be functionally evaluated in a mouse model of B-cell lymphoma. 3) The mechanism of intratumoral heterogeneity will be explored by lineage tracing and by inactivating various p53-related sensors and effectors to determine if modification of a variety of p53-realted processes, including the DNA-damage response, cell cycle control, apoptosis, and lineage commitment, can recapitulate the diversity phenotype achieved with the loss of p53. Training Plan: The applicant will rely on an interdisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators to develop an expertise in cell & molecular biology, mouse genetics, and computational analysis of genomic data. Sufficient oncology clinical exposure will be pursued to optimize the relevance of laboratory investigations and to obtain the skills necessary for cultivating future clinical and translational partnerships. Implications/Relevance: This fellowship will effectively realize the goals of the NIH by fostering creative and innovative research regarding the cause and cure of human disease (i.e. treatment failure), and by developing the applicant to contribute over the long term to the Nation's capability to prevent disease and economic well-being through biomedical innovation."
"9251150","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 8 million bone fractures occur annually and 10% of these are delayed and nonunion fractures which fail to heal despite therapeutic intervention. Current therapeutic strategies are severely hindered by the limited supplies of autograft bone and the poor mechanical properties of artificial materials. Zebrafish are masters of regeneration, and I have found that adult zebrafish can rapidly regenerate up to half of its lower jawbone after resection. Craniofacial bone development is highly conserved between zebrafish and humans, and hence understanding large-scale bone regeneration in zebrafish may lead to novel treatments in patients. A unique feature of zebrafish jawbone regeneration is the involvement of an unusual bone-producing chondrocyte population. In this application, I aim to identify the progenitor population that generates these ossifying chondrocytes during large-scale bone regeneration, as well as the role of macrophages in stimulating this progenitor population. Utilizing Cre-based transgenic lineage tracing strategies, I will test that a Runx2+/Sp7- population of pre-osteolasts in the periosteum generate the cartilage callus during regeneration. Using a genetic ablation strategy, I will then test that macrophages are required for the earliest events in bone repair, namely the shift of periosteal cells from making bone during homeostasis to making cartilage during repair. Lastly, I propose to utilize a RUNX2:GFP transgene to isolate these periosteal cells for deep sequencing of expressed mRNAs, which will help identify macrophage-dependent genes activated in periosteal cells after injury. Together, positive findings will illuminate the role of the immune system in shifting the fate of periosteal cells from bone to cartilage during bone repair, with knowledge gained in the zebrafish model being used in the future to develop new bone repair strategies in patients."
"9245991","Project Summary/Abstract Vascular conduits are often needed for repair of congenital heart defects in children. However, current vascular grafts are not ideal for pediatric population. In particular, the graft's inability to adjust to children's growth will lead to multiple surgeries, and the risk of thrombosis will lead to life-long anti-coagulation therapy which is also undesired in pediatric age group. These limitations support the clear notion that a living, biologic tissue which can remodel and grow with the child is the key to solve all of these problems. The gold standard in pediatric vascular conduit repair remains autologous vessels, which have demonstrated good clinical outcomes, but with limited availability. Tissue engineered vascular grafts hold great promise to solve these challenges. However, the current tissue engineered vascular grafts are mostly tubular constructs, which cannot meet the demanding requirement of wide array of anatomies present in children with cardiovascular defects in a patient-specific manner. To create vascular conduit that matches the exact size and geometry of individual patient, 3-D bioprinting is a promising enabling technology, but doing so requires new printable biomaterials that can mimic the elastic properties of native soft tissues. Current available hydrogels in 3-D bioprinting are very fragile and are not able to withstand the surgical manipulation and pulse pressure when implanted in vivo. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a new class of printable elastic biomaterials that can be easily cross- linked with visible light without causing cell damage during the printing process. It is biocompatible, biodegradable and has tunable mechanical properties. The benefit of the new material is that it is synthesized from FDA approved materials and is compatible with many other newly developed biomaterial approaches thus will facilitate easy clinical translation and incorporation of the most recent biomaterial techniques for future optimization. The elastic material will allow us to engineer a vascular construct to match the native tissue biomechanics and geometries therefore avoid the compliance mismatch with better hemodynamic profile. In this work, we will further develop this elastic biomaterial for soft tissue bioprinting, and apply it toward 3-D bioprinting of vascular conduits for pediatric congenital heart repairs."
"9256206","Project Summary  Advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is almost uniformly fatal due, in large part, to late diagnosis when few effective treatment options are available to patients. Unfortunately, the current standard-of- care chemotherapeutic agents only marginally improve survival time for these patients [1], underscoring the need for an increased understanding of the molecular drivers of pancreatic cancer progression and therapeutic resistance.  Cell plasticity is an important driver of intratumoral heterogeneity, which is thought to contribute to drug resistance and disease recurrence in many tumor types [2-4]. Increasing evidence suggests that tumor cells have the capacity to undergo transdifferentiation, conceivably in order to enhance their survival in response to certain selective pressures within their environment. Indeed, numerous studies have demonstrated neuroendocrine (NE) transdifferentiation of prostate tumor cells, particularly in response to androgen- deprivation, in which tumor cells begin to exhibit an NE phenotype and express NE markers, like Synaptophysin and Chromogranin A [5-6]. Although the physiological role of these NE-like cells is unclear, the degree of NE transdifferentiation of tumor cells correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Similar results were found in lung cancer, where NE transdifferentiation was found to be an independent prognostic factor in patients with non-small cell lung cancer [7]. These data suggest that transdifferentiation of tumor cells may contribute to aggressive disease and may be an important mechanism by which tumor cells acquire resistance to therapies, though this process has not been previously described in pancreatic cancer.  The c-MYC (MYC) transcription factor is an oncoprotein and potent regulator of many tumorigenic properties, including tumor cell fate. MYC gene amplification or MYC mRNA and/or protein overexpression commonly occurs in pancreatic cancer [8]. Using a novel mouse model of pancreatic cancer, combining physiologic, low-level Myc expression with mutant Kras (KMC mice), we find that deregulated Myc accelerates Kras-driven tumor progression, generating heterogeneous tumors that recapitulate molecular and cellular features of human PDA progression. Interestingly, we detected ductal-cells that express NE markers, like Synaptophysin, suggesting ductal-to-NE conversion. Importantly, similar Synaptophysin/CK-positive lesions are observed in human PDA and correlate with poor outcome. Furthermore, Synaptophysin expression increases upon chemotherapy exposure, suggesting a mechanism of therapeutic resistance. Herein, we will test the hypothesis that NE transdifferentiation of PDA cells drives tumor aggressiveness and resistance to standard-of-care gemcitabine."
"9207110","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer.

"9222311","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As children enter early adolescence, cardiovascular and metabolic consequences of obesity become more apparent. Studies in older children show that obesity and central fat distribution are associated with these outcomes. But how did the children get there in the first place? This is a key question for chronic disease prevention. A now-vast animal experimental literature and a growing human counterpart demonstrate that factors operating at the earliest stages of human development-even before birth-can have lifelong consequences for obesity and cardiometabolic outcomes. Yet major questions still exist regarding how pre- and peri-natal factors operate, through gain in weight and adiposity, to influence these outcomes. In analyses from the previous cycle of Pre- and peri-natal predictors of childhood obesity, the findings imply both that the endocrine milieu at the time of birth is different from later in life, and that it is likely to be a key driver of weight gain in the first months of life, itself a strong predictor of later obesity and cormorbidities. While these observations are consistent with endocrine knowledge emerging from animal experiments, they raise several questions:  7 To what extent are prenatal factors such as maternal nutrition (e.g., fatty acids, vitamin D), smoking,  gestational weight gain, and gestational diabetes associated with perinatal hormone levels? 7 What other hormones are involved in these pathways? In particular, what are the roles of insulin and  insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which are correlated with leptin levels? 7 If these hormones influence childhood weight gain, do they also influence gain in adiposity, fat distribution, components of the metabolic syndrome and vascular dysfunction in early adolescence?  7 To what extent are these influences mediated by adiposity-related inflammation? The overall goal of this renewal of R01 HD 034568-10 is to examine associations of potentially modifiable prenatal factors, hormone levels in umbilical cord blood, gains in weight and adiposity in childhood, adiposity- related inflammation, and cardiometabolic outcomes in early adolescence. including components of the metabolic syndrome, carotid intima-media thickness, and endothelial dysfunction. Extending the productive pre-birth cohort study Project Viva through the age of 11 years provides the opportunity to meet this challenge. The results of this research will lead to new scientific knowledge about the drivers of growth and adiposity in childhood and may very well lead to new avenues for prevention of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease."

"9415479","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Activation of skeletal muscle fibers, which is a prerequisite for all bodily movement as well as for respiration, is initiated by electrical depolarization of the transverse tubules (TTs), causing membrane voltage (V) sensors in the TT dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) to trigger Ca2+ release via the abutting skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1)/Ca2+ release channels in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. However, the molecular mechanisms coupling the TT V sensor to SR RyR1 release activation are poorly understood, and the roles of various modulatory molecules, including S100A1 and calmodulin (CaM) are not clear. These issues are important since any pathologic interference with the Ca2+ release activation process may modify or disrupt muscle function. Here in Aim 1 we identify a previously totally unsuspected marked suppression of muscle Ca2+ release in a transgenic mouse model expressing a hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) CaV1.1 V sensor charge mutation, and characterize the mechanism(s) underlying this defect in muscle activation. Muscle Ca2+ release is also modulated by a variety of accessory proteins. During the current grant cycle we have made the novel finding that the Ca2+ binding protein S100A1 binds to the previously identified calmodulin (CaM) binding domain (CaMBD) in RyR1, which should now be referred to as a CaM/S100A1 binding domain since these molecules interact for binding at this site. In Aims 2 and 3 we utilize shRNA techniques to suppress the protein expression of S100A1, CaM or both S100A1 and CaM to investigate the effects of each of these ligands as well as their competitive interaction at sites other than the CaMBD of RyR1. We will use high speed (<50 us/line) line-scan confocal imaging of fibers containing the Ca2+ indicator fluo-4 to monitor Ca2+ signals and calculate the underlying Ca2+ release flux from the SR during single or trains of action potentials in intact fibers, or during voltage clamp depolarization of whole cell voltage clamped fibers with high levels of EGTA in the patch pipette solution. We will use adult muscle fibers with molecular biologically manipulated expression of endogenous or exogenous proteins. Parallel NMR and binding studies will examine the structures and binding affinities of S100A1 and/or CaM binding to peptides corresponding to the identified binding sites. This project will elucidate basic molecular mechanisms regulating Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle and the roles of voltage sensor charges that are mutated in hypoPP in muscle Ca2+ release. It will characterize the modulation of SR Ca2+ release by S100A1 and CaM, which might be compromised in generalized or specific muscle disease states, or in aging muscle. Thus, this project has high impact for multiple disciplines, and for problems of both locomotion and breathing common to a variety of advanced diseased states and aging."
"9207590","DEVELOPMENTAL THERAPEUTICS PROGRAM (Project-608) ABSTRACT Overview and Goals: The goal of the Developmental Therapeutics (DT) Program is to reduce the cancer burden through identification, development and testing of novel anticancer therapies and approaches. DT accomplishes this goal by hosting members with the required scientific expertise in the following areas: Target Inhibition and Companion Biomarkers, Drug Delivery, Radiation Biology and Delivery, Pharmacology, Stem Cells and Tumor Microenvironment, Immunotherapy, Preclinical Models and Imaging, Comparative Oncology and Clinical Trials. The program integrates this rich expertise into four major interdisciplinary focus groups (Drug Discovery, Preclinical Development, Early Clinical Development, and Delivery) that are linked by an overarching thematic emphasis on biomarkers and precision/ personalized medicine. Research Highlight: An example of the way the DT program takes laboratory studies forward to clinical testing is work from multiple DT members on Trametinib, a MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor, in patients whose tumors acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor (J Clin Oncol, 20131; Lancet Oncol, 20122). Program Activities: Through stand-alone and intra-programmatic retreats, monthly meetings and a new grants program, the DT program promotes the transition of early findings through the therapeutic development process across the entire UCCC. For example, preclinical studies are conducted using novel model systems, pharmacology, and functional imaging allowing for the discovery of the appropriate biomarkers and patient selection criteria for incorporation into early clinical trials of targeted agents being tested pre-clinically. Through the establishment of close interactions between basic research laboratories, clinical scientists, the NCI, and the pharmaceutical industry, the DT leadership nurtures rapid development of new treatments and biomarkers. Members: The DT program has 111 members including 57 Full and 54 Associate members. The membership represents all 3 academic consortium institutions (University of Colorado Denver (UCD), University of Colorado Boulder (UCB), Colorado State University (CSU)) and are located in six different schools or colleges (Schools of Medicine, Pharmacy, Public Health, Liberal Arts at UCD; College of Arts and Sciences at UCB; College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at CSU), and 18 departments. Current research funding is $18M. Peer-reviewed funding is $5.4M with $2.8M from the NCI and $2.6M from other peer sponsors. The DT Program produced 1,108 cancer-focused publications since the last review, of which 39% were inter- and 29% intra-programmatic, demonstrating the collaborative nature of the program. Future Directions: The program will enhance investigator initiated clinical trials (IITs) capitalizing on new investments by the UCCC that increase support for regulatory submissions and data management of IITs. The DT program will continue preclinical development of our own novel agents conceived within our program (e.g. SVC112, ONK101, neoamphimedine), and promote the identification of novel and efficacious drug combinations based on tumor molecular characteristics, biomarkers, and clinical testing of these therapies."
"9294245","Project Summary/Abstract This proposal presents a five year research career development program focused on the study of antibody mediated immune modulation in tuberculosis to expand the breadth and depth of understanding the role of humoral immunity in this disease. The candidate is currently an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Massachusetts General Hospital. The outlined proposal builds on the candidate's previous research and clinical experience in host pathogen interactions by integrating two new domains of expertise represented by her mentor team of Drs Sarah Fortune and Galit Alter at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard: tuberculosis and antibody mediated mechanisms of innate immune effector functions. The proposed experiments and didactic work will position the candidate with a unique set of cross disciplinary skills that will enable her transition to independence as a physician scientist in antibody mediated host pathogen interactions in tuberculosis. One third of the world's population carries the burden of tuberculosis (TB). Efforts to reduce this burden have been hindered by the lack effective diagnostics and a protective vaccine underpinned by gaps in the understanding of the immune response in TB disease. While cellular immunity is important, the antibody (Ab) or humoral landscape is poorly understood. Ab function is determined by the combination of antigen specificity via the Fab and ability to recruit functional responses via the Fc domain. Ab Fc mediated recruitment of cellular responses is a promising underexplored potential for immune control. The foundation for this proposal is based on preliminary studies evaluating differences in antibody profiles from a systems serological approach in a cohort of individuals with latent and active TB that suggest a potential protective role for antibodies in TB disease. How exactly antibodies might function in this context and its physiological relevance are questions that this proposal begins to address. More specifically, the aims of this proposal are 1: Define the antigen specificity of functional M. tuberculosis (Mtb) specific antibodies, 2: Dissect the role for Fc/FcR mediated intracellular Mtb restriction and 3: Identify the macrophage effector mechanisms through which Ab restrict intracellular Mtb. The scientific objective of this proposal is to begin to define the Ab Fab and Fc features with the capacity to mediate effector function against intracellular Mtb with the vision of targeted transition into an appropriate animal model to generate hypotheses that inform the direction and design of subsequent human studies to expand the repertoire for immune correlates/diagnostics and rational vaccine design."
"9213403","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine repeat in the protein huntingtin (mHtt), and is manifested by choreatic dyskinesias, personality changes, abnormal behaviors and cognitive deterioration. With the exception of symptomatic treatments there are no disease-modifying therapies for HD. Although mHtt is expressed ubiquitously in brain and peripheral tissue, it predominantly causes neuronal loss and damage in striatal tissue, a process that is poorly understood. Therefore, studies that define the mechanisms that contribute to the striatal degeneration are needed to develop new drugs that prevent and/or delay the onset of HD. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of striatal-specific proteins in HD pathogenesis for preventive and therapeutic purposes. The objective here, which is next step in pursuit of that goal, is to dissect the mechanisms of Rhes GTPase, that contains SUMO E3 ligase activity, in HD pathogenesis, and to identify its physiological SUMO substrates. Our central hypothesis is that Rhes-SUMO1-mHtt-mTORC1 circuitry elicits mitochondrial damage and HD pathogenesis. This hypothesis is formulated on the basis of our previous studies, new data and preliminary results. Our Aims are: 1: Dissect the role of Rhes-SUMO-mHtt-mTORC1 circuitry in mitochondrial dysfunction. Multiple studies support the role of Rhes in HD, but the mechanisms are unknown. Here we will dissect the mechanisms, using striatal cells, focusing on the Rhes-SUMO1 in mTORC1 activity and mitochondrial dysfunction; and 2: Challenge the deletion of SUMO1 in the amelioration of HD pathogenesis in mice. Despite known roles for SUMO1 in mHtt-induced cellular toxicity, its role in the pathogenesis of HD in mammal remains unknown. We will cross SUMO1-/- mice with N171HD mouse to elucidate behavioral and pathological outcomes; and 3: Identify SUMOylation substrates for Rhes. Besides SUMOylating mHtt, Rhes physiologically SUMOylates several striatal proteins, but their identity remains unknown. Using cell culture, in vitro SUMOylation assay, and proteomic approaches we will identify potential SUMO substrates for Rhes. Overall, the project is innovative because it employs an interdisciplinary approach, utilizing tools from mouse genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and behavior to dissect the pathway leading to striatal-specific cell loss. The results of this project will be significant, as it will advance our understanding of why striatal tissue is preferentially ost in an mHtt- dependent fashion and provide proof-of-principle for the development of drugs targeting Rhes signaling in HD."
"9188572","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and is the leading cause of lung cancer. The majority of individuals who smoke indicate they want to quit, and although half of all smokers make a quit attempt every year, only 6% successfully do so. Lower education levels, poverty, and unemployment are potent predictors of greater difficulty quitting smoking. Additionally, SES-related tobacco disparities have increased over the last several decades. Increased knowledge regarding those factors that allow individuals to be successful in staying quit is key to eliminatig smoking-related cancers and illnesses in these populations. One promising factor related to increased cessation success is mindfulness, which is the ability to attend to the present moment with purpose (e.g., not on autopilot) and without labeling thoughts/emotions/sensations as good or bad (e.g., an attitude of nonjudgment). Mindfulness is associated with increased cessation success and with key mechanisms influencing cessation such as affect and self-regulatory capacity. However, there is a distinct lack of data on real-time, real-world measures of smoking, the underlying mechanisms associated with abstinence (particularly those that may be unique among low SES populations), and how mindfulness impacts those potential mechanisms. The objective of this application is to utilize real-time, real-world measurement approaches (i.e., ecological momentary assessment [EMA] and AutoSense) to examine the impact of mindfulness on key mechanisms underlying smoking cessation among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers. Christine Vinci, Ph.D. is a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and is seeking 5 years of support through the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award through the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, in order to examine the role of mindfulness on key mechanisms implicated in cessation among low SES, diverse populations. This proposal directly addresses the mission of NIMHD to lead scientific research to improve minority health and eliminate health disparities. Dr. Vinci's research broadly focuses on cognitive and affective mechanisms (e.g., affect regulation, expectancies, self- efficacy) implicated in the development, maintenance, and treatment of substance use disorders. More specifically, her work aims to understand the mechanisms underlying smoking and alcohol use among underserved populations, with a specific focus on mindfulness. A better understanding of the effects of mindfulness on smoking and problematic drinking, and the mechanisms through which mindfulness-based interventions impact these disorders could help in the development of new and more effective interventions. For this award, the primary research aims are twofold. First, the examination of trait and state mindfulness on momentary mechanisms gathered via advanced technology (EMA and AutoSense) among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers will be conducted via secondary data analysis of existing datasets of Dr. Vinci's primary mentor, Dr. David Wetter. Second, the feasibility of providing mindfulness strategies in real-time to low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers attempting to quit smoking, based on objective data collected via AutoSense technology, will be examined. The first aim will take place during the K99 phase of the award, where Dr. Vinci will be provided with guidance by expert mentors in their respective fields. The training and guidance received during the K99 phase will directly inform the implementation of the second aim, which will take place during the R00 phase of the award. This project is highly innovative because 1) to date, no studies have examined these constructs via real-world, real-time data among low SES, racially/ethnically diverse smokers through combined approaches such as EMA and AutoSense, and 2) findings can directly inform treatment development to specify how mindfulness impacts underlying mechanisms, leading to the reduction of tobacco- related health disparities. Dr. Vinci's training goals include learning how to design and implement research protocols that utilize advanced technology to collect participant data (EMA and AutoSense), how to conduct advanced statistical analyses on multi-level, longitudinal data, and how to combine knowledge and strategies from diverse areas of research (i.e., models linking social determinants and SES to health outcomes, tobacco use and dependence, resiliency and mindfulness, self-regulation) to create intervention approaches to reduce health disparities. Both the training received through this award and the preliminary data Dr. Vinci will collect and analyze, will aid her in the transition to an independent clinical researcher, where she will examine relevant mechanisms via mobile technology and implement mindfulness-based strategies to reduce problematic health behaviors and improve quality of life among diverse populations."
"9207111","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9416654","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2006, the NICHD/NIAAA/NIDCD-funded PASS Network (Phase 11) initiated the planned enrollment of approximately 12,000 pregnant women from high-risk populations for prenatal alcohol exposure, SIDS, stillbirth, and FASD in a prospective study with follow-up of their infants to one postnatal year ( the time- frame for SIDS). This application is in response to RFA-HD-10-018 to complete enrollment and follow-up with study participants, oversee data collection, data cleaning and management, and conduct statistical analysis. This particular application pertains to the Data Coordinating and Analysis Center (DCAC) of the PASS Network. The long-term goals of the Safe Passage Study are to decrease fetal and infant mortality and improve child health in communities at high risk for prenatal maternal alcohol consumption. The primary hypothesis of the PASS Network is that prenatal alcohol exposure increases the risk for SIDS and stillbirth. Secondary hypotheses examine the role of interactions between prenatal alcohol exposure and other maternal and environmental factors upon the function and structure of the placenta, development of the fetal and infant face, autonomic function, hearing, and cortical activity in the fetus and/or infant, fetal growth and in vivo brain development with ultrasonography, and neurotransmitter and synaptic maturation in the brainstem and cerebral cortex in autopsy studies of the fetus and infant. The ability of the PASS Network to provide accurate and valid evidence of potential associations between prenatal alcohol exposure and adverse perinatal outcomes depends on extensive collaboration among the Network investigators and the collection and analysis of high quality data, all of which is facilitated by the DCAC. The mission of the DCAC is to work collaboratively with the investigators of the PASS Network and communities to: (1) Develop and maintain a network-wide infrastructure as a vehicle for communication and information exchange for the promotion of collaboration within the PASS Network and for the provision of logistical and administrative support to all members of the Network; (2) Provide biostatistical and epidemiological expertise to the PASS Network; (3) Provide leadership in protocol development and implementation for the PASS Network; (4) Provide centralized, efficient, cost-effective and quality data management to the PASS Network; and (5) To support the needs of the Network governing boards."

"9049139","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The anterior segment of the eye comprises structures essential for vision and overall ocular health. Anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD) refers to a broad spectrum of eye diseases that occur when these structures do not form appropriately during fetal development. Children born with ASD can exhibit iris hypoplasia, misplaced pupils, hazy corneas, and corneal-iris adhesions. In addition, because the tissues responsible for intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation reside in the anterior segment, ASD is commonly associated with a severe form of childhood glaucoma - a progressive blinding disease for which increased IOP is the leading risk factor. Though early malformation of the anterior segment is known to result in a variety of eye disorders, the specific mechanisms underlying its proper development remain largely unidentified. Recent data has implicated both Notch and Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) signaling in the formation of the ciliary body, the site of aqueous fluid production. Specifically, in mice deficient for the Notch2 receptor, BMP signaling was significantly diminished and the ciliary body failed to develop. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests that these pathways may also be involved in development of the iridocorneal angle, a region involved in fluid drainage comprised of the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. The experiments proposed below will test the overarching hypothesis that Notch signaling acts upstream of BMP signaling in the development of anterior segment structures important for IOP regulation. Using mouse gain and loss of function alleles, I will examine the morphogenesis of the ciliary body and iridocorneal angle following perturbation of key proteins within the pathways of interest. In addition, I will assess the long-term effects of ASD on ocular physiology in adult mice. This work will define the temporal and spatial requirements of the Notch and BMP signaling pathways during the formation and later maintenance of important anterior eye structures. Results from these studies will ultimately provide fundamental insight into the developmental biology regulating anterior segment development, as well as identify molecular targets that may prove valuable in treating children with ASD."
"9266982","Summary Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) are the leading cause of cancer in HIV-infected individuals and recent epidemiologic data suggests that these cancers are occurring in increased frequency in patients treated with combination antiretroviral treatment (cART). The underlying rationale of this program is that viral and host long noncoding RNAs play a role in gamma-herpesvirus pathogenesis and tuomorigenesis. Recent investigations into the function of human lncRNA have begun to illustrate how central this class of RNAs is to an array of cell regulatory processes such as gene silencing, transcriptional activation, gene imprinting, RNA maturation, splicing, etc. Based on our recent EBV transcriptomics work, we believe that there are likely scores of novel viral lncRNAs (vlncRNAs) expressed in different stages of the EBV infection cycle. Collaborative efforts with the Renne and Tibbetts labs to globally identify and resolve viral transcript structures are similarly uncovering dozens of novel non-coding KSHV and MHV68 RNAs revealing common themes such as vlncRNAs that can act as microRNA sponges and latency gene antisense transcripts that potentially contribute to the regulation of latency and reactivation, two steps that are crucial for virus biology and pathogenesis. In Project 2, we will investigate the functions of three distinct vlncRNA types expressed from the oncogenic latency membrane protein LMP2 locus, the protein product of which is required for growth transformation of primary human B cells. One of these vlncRNAs is antisense to LMP2 and is an apparent counterpart of the KSHV LAMP antisense transcript being investigated in Project 1. We will also investigate a series of unique sense oriented LMP2 isoforms. This includes chimeric LMP2 transcripts harboring exons from the transforming latency vlncRNA, RPMS1 (a BamHI A Rightward Transcript (BART) isoform), as well as a circular form of LMP2. We hypothesize that these LMP2 transcripts have diverse functions ranging from chromatin remodeling to interactions with B-cell receptor signaling pathways in both reactivation and possibly de novo infection and growth transformation. Importantly, Project 2 will exploit EBV's ability to growth transform B-lymphocytes to directly address the roles of both vlncRNAs and EBV regulated cellular lncRNAs in B-cell activation and in HIV-associated lymphomas, complementing similar investigations being pursued in Projects 1 and 3."
"9177760","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity and food insecurity coexist, largely because both are conditions disproportionately affecting families living in poverty. I am a pediatrician who works in a population with many socioeconomically disadvantaged children, and a researcher who has for years had a strong focused on food access in low- income communities. I am seeking a mentored career award to further develop my skills as a clinical researcher in order to achieve my goal of becoming an independently-funded investigator conducting research on policy-relevant strategies and interventions that improve the metabolic risk and long-term health of obese children who live in poverty. Preliminary studies with my patients exploring how our food-insecure patients differ from their food-secure peers have informed this proposal. Qualitative work has led to my hypothesis that food-insecure obese patients have a higher propensity towards disordered eating, and preliminary analysis with NHANES suggests that they have greater metabolic dysregulation than their food-secure peers. I am now broadening my investigations about the potential metabolic impact of food insecurity to include other more upstream markers of insulin resistance and metabolic risk. Key elements of my proposed research activities include the following: A. In order to refine understanding of the impact of food-insecurity on diet in food-insecure children, I will recruit  80 patients in order t conduct a more detailed investigation of their dietary intake and eating behaviors than  is typically feasible in the context of routine clinic. B. These same 80 obese patients (8-14 yrs.) wil have laboratory testing done to assess how overall cardio-metabolic risk (evidenced by insulin resistance or the presence of more atherogenic lipoprotein profile) compares between food-insecure children and their low-income peers. C. Conduct a randomized intervention using physician-delivered supermarket vouchers for fruits, vegetables, and whole fiber foods among 60 low-income, obese children (8 to 14 years) who are in a household that uses SNAP (food stamps). Determine impact on behavior, BMI, and biomarkers of metabolic risk. In order to solidify my knowledge base regarding nutrition measurement, consolidate statistical analysis skills, and conduct a well-executed randomized intervention, I will take relevant coursework available to me on two University of California campuses. My mentorship team is well qualified to assist me not only with completing these proposed research activities, but also with launching my career as an independent clinical scientist."
"9207593","MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY PROGRAM (Project-368) ABSTRACT Overview and Goals: The goal of the Molecular Oncology (MO) program is to harness the power of basic science approaches, from biochemistry to functional genomics, to elucidate molecular mechanisms of cancer evolution and progression, with the ultimate goal of enabling effective strategies for cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The expertise of program members is broad and deep, with major strengths in the control of gene expression, epigenetic regulation, DNA repair and damage responses, telomeres, pathways controlling cell fate and elucidation of cancer-relevant molecular structures. Research Highlights: The transcription factor HIF1A is a key mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia. Despite the importance of HIF1A in homeostasis and various pathologies, little is known about how it regulates RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). A multidisciplinary team including members at UCB consortium site showed HIF1A employs Mediator-associated kinase CDK8 to stimulate RNAPII elongation. These results provide a mechanistic link between HIF1A and CDK8, two potent oncogenes, in the cellular response to hypoxia, and which may lead to novel therapeutic approaches (Cell, 2013). Program Activities: To accomplish this goal, the MO co-leaders employ resources provided by the UCCC to orchestrate intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations through organization of annual retreats and periodic technology forums, as well as routine chaperoning of transdisciplinary collaborations. Enabled by UCCC support, the co-leaders identify and evaluate novel technologies essential to catalyze new research by MO members through the creation and expansion of Shared Resources (SR), and by providing pilot funding to use these technologies, while leveraging resources and research strengths of consortium institutions across the state of Colorado. Through coordinated transdisciplinary relays from MO members to investigators in translational and clinical research programs, the discoveries made in this program move from bench to preclinical investigations and investigator-initiated trials (IITs), which will ultimately improve diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cancer. Members: The program has 43 Full and 20 Associate members with 89 grants encompassing $3.3M NCI and $7.5M of other cancer peer-reviewed research grant funding in 2015. Members are distributed across 20 basic science and clinical departments in the SOM and SOP at UCD as well as at UCB, CSU and at non-consortium institutions. MO members published 630 cancer-focused publications since 2011 of which 30% were inter- and 13% intra-programmatic. Future Directions: We plan to enhance current strengths in functional genomics and epigenetics, develop new capabilities in metabolomics, proteomics and cryo-electron microscopy, and promote interactions with programmatically relevant organizations at UCD such as the Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome and the Division of Biomedical Informatics and Personalized Medicine (BIPM). These efforts will advance the discovery of basic cancer processes and their translation into improved cancer prevention and treatment."
"9421590","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enzymes that employ non-heme-iron cofactors are involved in many important cellular processes, including transcription, reproduction, and the production of small molecule metabolites. One class of these enzymes, the iron- and 2-oxoglutarate (Fe/2OG) oxygenases, are notable in that some members can catalyze multiple different reactions using the same active site. Several of these reactivities (e.g. cyclizations, desaturations) cannot be understood by adapting the known mechanisms of these enzymes, motivating a deeper understanding of the chemistry involved. The enzyme hyoscyamine-6?- hydroxylase (H6H) is a member of the Fe/2OG family and is responsible for the conversion of hyoscyamine to scopolamine, a tropane alkaloid pharmaceutical used in the treatment of conditions such as motion sickness and Parkinson's disease. This enzyme first hydroxylates hyoscyamine and then performs a subsequent dehydrogenation on the nascent alcohol to generate an epoxide ring. This second step is quite unusual in biology and its mechanism is not understood. In the proposed project, structures and mechanisms H6H will be determined with the goal of elucidating how this enzyme conducts these divergent reactions. X-ray crystallography will provide structural insights into how these reaction are mediated, while stopped-flow kinetics measurements will determine-in molecular detail-the precise mechanisms of both transformations. Furthermore, spectroscopic studies on the reaction intermediates will allow for definitive characterization of the chemical species involved in these reactions. Taken together, this work will help to rationalize the factors that govern the divergent reactivity of thse enzymes and will serve as a basis for the design of new medicinal compounds that target these enzymes."
"9213372","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ultrasonic imaging is the most widely used advanced imaging modality in the United States, and excluding basic x-ray exams, it represents 44% of all imaging studies. Unfortunately, ultrasound images are often subopti- mal, and some studies show degradation in up to 98% of patients. The rate of degradation and freehand nature of clinical ultrasound means that image quality is more dependent on user skill than other advanced modalities, but even in the hands of the most skilled practitioners, ultrasound imaging completely fails in 11-64% of clinical tasks. Ineffective ultrasound is particularly problematic when encountered during guidance tasks like hepatic focal lesion biopsy. Ultrasound is generally considered the best modality for routine biopsy guidance, but when ultrasound imaging fails, clinicians must use other less ef?cient and more expensive modalities. Ultimately, tumor biopsies are diagnostic in almost every patient; however, more than 72% of biopsies require multiple needle passes, and four or ?ve passes for a single diagnostic sample is not uncommon. Better quality ultrasound imaging can improve this process, which is important for public health because it enables more ef?cient and safer clinical work?ow, and supports crucial clinical studies of personalized cancer treatments. In order to address the challenge of poor visualization during ultrasound guidance of lesion biopsy, we have introduced a new advanced ultrasound image-formation method. Our approach models several mechanisms that causes degradation, and then removes those degrading components from the ultrasound signal. Speci?cally, we model the degradation that occurs from ultrasound waves that re?ect off multiple structures before the waves are turned into an image and degradation from waves that re?ect off of extremely re?ective structures. When we model for these sources and remove them, the resulting images are quantitatively and qualitatively better than uncorrected images. Our initial model of image degradation had some shortcomings, which we address as part of this proposal. We are also developing a real-time implementation of our algorithm, and assessing the utility of our methods in a small clinical study. Finally, we focus on ultrasound biopsy guidance in the liver for this proposal, but our methods are broadly useful to ultrasound imaging in general and will have far reaching impacts to public health."
"9286924","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (hPAP), a disease we previously identified, is characterized by pulmonary surfactant accumulation and respiratory failure due to alveolar macrophage (M?) dysfunction caused by mutations in the genes encoding GM-CSF receptor ? or ? (CSF2RA, CSF2RB, respectively), for which no specific pharmacotherapy currently exists. We also showed that pulmonary GM-CSF is a critical determinate of the alveolar M? phenotype and developed a novel cell transplantation approach ? pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMT) with extraordinary therapeutic efficacy in an authentic preclinical animal model of hPAP (Csf2rb-/- mice). Our long term goal is to develop an effective definitive therapy for hPAP that is acceptable for use in children, in whom hPAP most commonly occurs. The objective here is to optimize PMT therapy using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived M?s (iPS-M?s) in hPAP model mice. The central hypothesis is that iPS-M?s can be used to generate M?s that recapitulate the phenotypic and functional characteristics of alveolar M?s, permit a deeper exploration of hPAP pathogenesis, and serve as a source of gene-repaired M?s for PMT therapy of hPAP. The rationale, based on our preliminary data, is that the proposed research will establish the feasibility and lay the groundwork for development of a new personalized medicine approach for treating children with hPAP based on autologous PMT of gene-edited iPS-M?s. This hypothesis will be tested in the following three specific aims: 1) Recapitulation of phenotypically authentic alveolar macrophages from iPS cells; 2) An authentic cellular model of hPAP pathogenesis and its correction by genome editing; 3) Pulmonary macrophage transplantation of iPS-M?s as a novel cell therapy. The approach is innovative because it differs from current gene therapy approaches to generate gene-corrected primary M?s using semi-randomly integrating lentiviral vector. The proposed research will: 1) employ advanced iPS cell technology; 2) generate human hPAP-specific iPS cells and iPS-M?s to help elucidate disease pathogenesis; 3) repair mutant alleles with a non-viral, state-of-the-art synthetic endonuclease- mediated genome-editing system (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9); and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of using iPS-M?s for a novel organ-targeted cell and gene therapy (PMT) without a requirement for myeloablation or immunosuppression. The proposed research is significant because it will: 1) identify methods to accurately recapitulate the alveolar M? phenotype from iPS cells, thereby providing a new general approach to study alveolar M?s in health and disease; 2) provide an authentic cellular model with which to study the pathogenesis of hPAP; 3) permit the optimization of a novel therapeutic strategy to simultaneously perform gene repair while minimizing safety concerns related to genotoxicity from insertional mutagenesis caused by viral vectors; and 4) demonstrate the feasibility of PMT therapy of iPSC-M?s as a novel personalized medicine approach to treat children with hPAP."
"9208532","ABSTRACT The Cardiac Imaging Core (Core B) will provide service to all 3 projects with the goals of generating confocal microscopy- and in vivo ultrasound ? based analyses of cardiac development, structure, and function. Core B will be directed by Michael Rubart, M.D., who will provide expertise in confocal imaging of tissues. Dr. Rubart will be assisted by Ronald Payne, M.D., who will provide expertise in ultrasound imaging of embryonic and postnatal cardiac development and function. Core B's services enhance the efficiency of the Projects by providing consistent expertise in the capture and evaluation of images from tissue sections and hearts in vivo, using confocal microscopy and echocardiography, respectively. There are 2 Specific Aims for the Core: Aim 1 will provide high-quality, unbiased confocal fluorescence imaging of the pre- and postnatal heart, as well as quantitative image analyses. Approaches utilized in Aim 1 will quantitatively assess (i) primitive streak formation and node polarity (Project 1), (ii) sarcomeric organization and cardiomyocyte polarity (Project 1-3), and (iii) ventricular wall trabeculation and compaction (Project 3). Imaging will be performed using a laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with multiple laser excitation lines and detector channels, as well as a variety of high/low magnification, high/low numerical aperture objectives. Aim 2 will provide high-resolution in vivo ultrasound imaging of the pre- and postnatal heart in Projects 1-3 in order to generate quantitative data of structure, function, and flow relative to genetic alterations in cardiac development. In addition, ultrasound imaging will allow the study of longitudinal structural and functional data. Ultrasound imaging will utilize probes with frequency bands from 13 to 70 MHz, and linear array transducer technology, enabling imaging of hearts at different stages of development and frame acquisition at high rates, respectively. Available analysis software will enable quantification of cardiac contractile performance, chamber dimensions, and flow pattern, including detection and size estimation of intracardiac shunts. Overall, technologies utilized in the Cardiac Imaging Core will enable unbiased, quantitative assessments of changes in cardiac structure and function as a result of genetic alterations studied in each of the three Projects of this application."
"9178418","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Background/Rationale: Poor sleep quality, which is elevated in urban adolescents due to poor sleep hygiene, impairs functioning. Asthma, the most common pediatric illness, has high prevalence and morbidity among urban adolescents. Nocturnal symptoms contribute to poor sleep quality. Despite the success of asthma and of sleep hygiene in this population, no interventions concurrently address sleep hygiene and asthma control. This is of great concern given the high risk of poor sleep quality among urban adolescents. Process evaluations are often lacking during intervention development. We address these treatment and methodological gaps. Objectives: This pilot study will (1) develop an integrated, school-based intervention to improve asthma self- management and sleep hygiene in urban high school students; (2) evaluate the intervention's feasibility and acceptability; and (3) assess the preliminary evidence of intervention effects on improving sleep quality in urban high school students in NYC and Providence, RI. Hypotheses: (1) The intervention will be feasible and acceptable as evidenced by adolescents' high rates of adherence to the treatment protocol, and their high satisfaction ratings and positive responses to exit interviews; and (2) relative to controls, over 2-months post- intervention adolescents randomized to the intervention will have significant improvement on the following outcomes assessing sleep quality: (1) sleep efficiency; (2) night awakenings; and (3) sleep duration. Methods: In Year 1 we will adapt and integrate two efficacious school-based interventions for urban adolescents, our team's asthma and sleep hygiene interventions. We will retain components of each that are guideline-based and critical for asthma and sleep quality; expert feedback, as well as adolescent and caregiver input via focus groups at both sites, will also guide intervention development. In Year 2, we will conduct a randomized trial with 48 urban adolescents with persistent asthma and whose typical sleep duration is at/below what is recommended for this age group from 4 schools, 2 in NYC and 2 in RI. Students will be randomized within a school to the intervention and control, which consists of our asthma intervention in its original format, and will be followed for 2-months. University student interns will deliver both interventions. Process evaluation interviews with students, interns, and school personnel will be conducted to obtain feedback regarding intervention procedures. Significance: This study has high public health significance because it (1) targets a highly vulnerable population for poor sleep quality ? urban adolescents with persistent asthma; (2) adapts and integrates two efficacious interventions to develop a novel intervention that simultaneously targets asthma control and sleep hygiene, which has the potential to amplify intervention effects; and (3) includes a process evaluation, bridging the gap between science and practice, and aiding in the design of a full-scale RCT."
"9275454","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Of the roughly half a million Veterans with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the vast majority will progress through the advanced stage of the disease. It is important to ascertain the most safe and effective treatments for individuals with advanced AD.  Cholinesterase inhibitor (CI) medications are the mainstay of treatment for mild and moderate AD, and they are often continued in advanced disease. Anecdotal reports indicate that patients may worsen when CI medications are discontinued, but there is little rigorous evidence about the effects of discontinuation. VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management Service Guidelines recommend discontinuing CI under certain conditions, but acknowledge that the issue has not been well studied and that the recommendations are not evidence-based.  Because AD follows a variable course, the only way objectively to determine the risks and benefits of CI medications in advanced AD is through a controlled study. We propose to conduct a placebo-controlled, double-blinded discontinuation trial of CI medications in advanced AD. We will recruit 200 Veterans with advanced dementia who have been taking a stable dose of donepezil or galantamine (the main CI medications in the VA formulary), and randomize them. Half the group will carry out a blinded Real Taper: reducing the prior stable dose of CI to one-half for three weeks, then switching to placebo for three weeks. The other half will carry out a blinded Sham Taper: remaining on the prior stable dose for six weeks. We will compare the two arms in (1) ability to complete the 6- weeks successfully, and (2) changes from baseline to week 6 in cognition, functioning, behavior. Analyses will apply on a non-inferiority study design. Specific Aim 1: To ascertain if successful CI discontinuation rates are non-inferior in Real Taper compared to Sham Taper.  Hypothesis 1: The rate of successful CI discontinuation in Real Taper will be non-inferior to the  rate of successful CI discontinuation in Sham Taper. Specific Aim 2: To ascertain if changes in cognition, functioning, behavior, and caregiver burden over 6 weeks are different in Real Taper compared to Sham Taper.  Hypothesis 2: Changes in cognition, functioning, behavior, and caregiver burden in Real Taper  will not differ from changes in Sham Taper. Specific Aim 3: To identify patient-level and disease-level factors (such as behavioral symptoms and duration of treatment and disease) that predict unsuccessful discontinuation, adverse events, and worsening. Given the shortage of previous research about CI discontinuation, this aim is not hypothesis-driven. This research will clarify the risks and benefits of CI medications in advanced AD. It will inform guidelines about when to continue or discontinue CI medications, and can thus impact the medical care of tens of thousands of Veterans. More specific information about the effects of treatments for AD will reduce adverse events and maximize benefits. This research will also generate hypotheses about types of individuals for whom discontinuation has differential effects."
"9347745","Project Summary Antibiotic resistance has recently emerged as a global threat for healthcare systems. An increasing number of pathogenic bacteria are acquiring antibiotic resistance, and new forms of resistance are continuously emerging with alarming speed across international boundaries.1 In the U. S. alone, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated 2 million patients per year are directly affected by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, leading to more than 23,000 deaths.2 Providing rapid, definitive and cost effective antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) will be of increasingly vital importance in controlling this burgeoning problem. While legacy methods generally require overnight culturing, the time-urgency of determining effective antibiotics has prompted a push for rapid AST that can perform in a few hours. Unfortunately, some of the newest rapid AST instruments are either not suited to multiplexing, or are an order of magnitude more costly than legacy methods, discouraging their widespread use. A rapid multiplexed AST platform that provides minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) within hours at comparable cost to current methods will enable rapid determination of effective targeted therapy, resulting in short hospital stays and fewer additional laboratory tests, and decreasing morbidity and mortality along with associated healthcare expenses. Specific Technologies has introduced and with NIAID support commercially developed a culture system that combines detection with organism ID.3, 4 Using a printed array of chemically responsive colorimetric indicators introduced into culture headspace, the species-specific pattern of volatiles emitted during growth produce a species-specific pattern, which we have shown to reduce detection time and enable Gram status and species ID to be determined hands-free during culture. Here, we present data showing that the use of this system can be extended to very rapidly, order 1 hour, ascertain phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility. The preliminary data demonstrate that introduction of antibiotic to positive blood culture prompts a susceptibility-dependent and antibiotic concentration-dependent shift in volatile sensor response within <60 minutes. Recognizing that a commercial AST instrument must be multi-well, we have performed pilot study in which the positive sample is removed from a blood culture bottle and divided into a multi-chamber setting, in which even at pilot study stage we demonstrate a < 2 ½ hrs phenotypic AST, measuring values matching the results of the CLIA-compliant Sensititre gold standard. Moreover, the disposable is inherently low cost, as it only depends upon an inexpensive printed sheet of CSA?s. Finally, not only is this method intrinsically low-cost but low-skill compatible, as there is no sample preparation from positive blood culture. It is thus very well-suited for both 24-hour/day developed world labs, where it will speed time-to-answer, as well as the low-skill environments of the developing world. In this direct-to-Phase II application, we propose to use our CSA technology to systematically quantify, and validate the parameter-dependence of this system and then engineer and produce a benchtop instrument suitable for preclinical and clinical testing, which will provide a low cost, highly automated multiplexed phenotypic susceptibility determination directly from a positive blood sample in less than 90 minutes. We propose to develop and commercialize an instrument that integrates our rapid AST capability with our Spec80 blood culture and species ID system that is being commercialized now, offering a uniquely streamlined and low cost system with by far the fastest yet proposed time from patient sample to detection, ID and phenotypic multiplexed quantitative AST."
"9391818","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We, along with others, have shown increased levels of fucosylation with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In an effort to determine the origin of this increased fucosylation, we have performed N-linked glycan analysis of HCC tissue, the surrounding non tumor tissue, and compared this to tissue from a non-diseased adult liver. Surprisingly, no difference in the level of fucosylation was observed from the three donor groups, suggesting that the increased levels of fucosylation observed in the serum of those with HCC is not the result of increased synthesis of fucosylated proteins in the cancer tissue. In addition, the level of fucosylation observed in tissue was much higher than that observed on liver derived serum glycoproteins. On the other hand, increased levels of a tetra-antennary glycan were observed in the HCC tissue as compared to the surrounding tissue or to the non-diseased livers. Recent work by our collaborator has suggested that fucosylation controls the polarized secretion of glycoproteins and directs their secretion apically into the bil. Indeed, bile glycoforms are more heavily fucosylated than in serum and closely resemble those observed in the serum of HCC patients. It is our hypothesis that the over-expression of  ? 1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (MGAT-5), which is responsible for the increased branching we have observed, leads to a loss of a tight blood-biliary barrier and the release of fucosylated proteins into the blood. This hypothesis, along with the use of this knowledge to find new biomarkers of HCC, will be tested in 3 aims. First we will examine the role of MGAT-5 in enforcing the polarized secretion of core fucosylated proteins. It is hypothesized that the overexpression of MGAT-5 that we observe in HCC tissue leads to a defect in the blood- biliary barrier and the aberrant release of fucosylated proteins into the blood. In specific aim 2 we will perform glycoproteomic analysis of bile for markers of HCC. The logic here is that all hepatocytes have the ability to secrete into the blood stream or into the bile capillaries, which eventually forms the bile ducts. Loss of hepatocyte polarity will lead to the aberrant appearance of fucosylated proteins in the blood. In specific Aim 3 we will examine the ability of our identifid biomarkers to differentiate patients with HCC from patients with liver cirrhosis in a cohort of 1500 patients. The ability of these markers to distinguish HCC from cirrhosis as compared to AFP and other potential biomarkers of HCC will be determined."
"9207589","CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM (Project-018) ABSTRACT Overview and Goals: The goal of the Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Program is to develop and implement ways to reduce cancer risk and enhance outcomes for cancer survivors across Colorado. The scientific expertise of CPC members spans laboratory to population research and includes disciplines from basic science to behavioral science and health services research. CPC members conduct investigations into how factors that affect cancer risk, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes can be modified to reduce the burden of cancer in Colorado and beyond. The CPC program has three specific aims: 1) find new ways to prevent cancer, 2) find new ways to deliver cancer prevention services, and 3) improve cancer survivorship. Within the Colorado catchment area, health disparities research cuts across each of our aims as CPC members focus research on the growing Hispanic population, the medically underserved, and cancer survivors. CPC investigators comprehensively explore both fundamental and applied questions, as evidenced by a very diverse funding portfolio, collaborative publications, and clear impact on cancer within our catchment area. Research Highlights: CPC research has led to advancements in primary and clinical preventive services, statewide policies, and improved cancer survivorship. CPC investigators studied promising agents in pre-clinical studies, identified breast cancer risk factors in Hispanic women, developed and operated the Colorado Colorectal Screening Program, made advancements in the understanding of obesity and breast cancer, and affected cancer prevention and control policy across the state. Program Activities: Investments in pilot funds, mentorship, and program planning initiatives since the last review cycle have led to a vibrant CPC program with many new research initiatives. In July 2015, Cathy Bradley PhD, was recruited to be the UCCC Associate Director for Population Sciences Research, with nearly $6M in resources to invest in cancer prevention research at the UCCC. Members: The CPC Program is comprised of 26 Full and 35 Associate members from all 3 academic consortium institutions, 9 schools and centers, and 25 academic departments within the University of Colorado Denver, Colorado State University, and University of Colorado Boulder. Since 2011, CPC members produced 479 cancer-related publications of which 154 were collaborative (18% inter-programmatic and 21% intra- programmatic). In 2015, CPC members held 79 grants (increase of 18%), totaling $10M; $2.3M from the NCI and $3.6M from other peer-reviewed sources. Future Directions: The CPC program is infused with substantial monetary investments, stimulating new pilot work, and engaging in several active recruitments including a co- program leader who will be supported by an endowed chair, and at least three other new CPC faculty members in epidemiology, behavioral health, and/or health services research. We aim to leverage these new resources to enhance the translation of our chemoprevention research into clinical trials, expand our health services and population sciences research portfolio, and further improve our research activities in survivorship."
"9207432","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are diseases that are characterized by overproduction of mature blood cells. These diseases are commonly characterized by somatic activating mutations in the Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) pathway, including mutations in the JAK2 protein itself (JAK2V617F) or in the coexpressed thrombopoietin receptor MPLW515L/K. The most feared complication of MPN is the transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) - patients with leukemic progression show a median survival of less than six months and ultimate mortality of 98%. Conventional anti-leukemic therapies have demonstrated little efficacy in patients with MPN who develop AML, and no therapy has been demonstrated beyond supportive care for these patients, indicating a powerful need for new models and improved approaches toward therapy of this disease. Because patients with MPN usually present to the clinic before they progress to leukemia, samples from patients taken before and after progression allow us to dissect the sequence of genomic and epigenomic events that are associated with leukemic transformation. In patient samples, mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and TET2 proteins, which are functionally related epigenetic effectors, have been associated with this transformation and significantly reduced leukemia-free survival. To date, no models of transformation from MPN to AML have been developed, and there are no published data investigating leukemic cooperativity between JAK2 and IDH mutations in vivo. In order to advance our understanding of the sequential events in leukemogenesis and improve therapeutic options for Post-MPN AML patients, we will explore this process through three approaches. Human samples of paired chronic phase and post-MPN AML samples will be examined using genetic and epigenetic studies to assess the impact of specific mutations on leukemic transformation. In vitro models, including cell lines and primary bone marrow cells, will be used to assess the epigenetic and signaling aberrations that occur at the time of transformation. Finally, a mouse model of leukemic transformation will be generated by expressing JAK2V617F and IDH mutations in a temporal and spatially controlled manner. This model will be subsequently used to assess the efficacy of JAK-STAT and IDH inhibitors, alone and in combination, to determine if targeting multiple oncogenic disease alleles results in increased drug efficacy. The approaches in this proposal provide platforms to train an aspiring MD-PhD scientist in translational biology using clinical genomics and biological models."
"9209576","CORE A. DATA ANALYSIS General anesthesia is a fascinating man-made, neurophysiological phenomenon that has been developed empirically over many years to enable safe and humane performance of surgical and non-surgical procedures. Specifically it is a drug-induced condition consisting of unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia and immobility, along with physiological stability. General anesthesia is administered daily to 60,000 patients in the United States, the mechanisms for how anesthetics act in the brain to create the states of anesthesia are not well understood. Significant progress has been made recently in characterizing the molecular sites that anesthetics target. However, how actions at specific molecular targets lead to the behavioral states is less well understood. Addressing this issue requires a systems neuroscience approach to define how actions of the drugs at specific molecular targets and neural circuits lead to a behavioral state of general anesthesia. In this program project entitled, Integrated Systems Neuroscience Studies of Anesthesia, we will develop an integrated systems neuroscience program consisting of human, non-human primate, rodent and modeling studies of four anesthetics: the GABAA agents, propofol and sevoflurane; the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine; and the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine. The program project will also include a DATA ANALYSIS CORE, which will provide assistant with data analysis and conduct research on statistical methods. The Specific Aims are to understand how the actions of the anesthetics at specific molecular targets and neural circuits produce the oscillatory dynamics (EEG rhythms, changes in LFPs and neural spiking activity) that are likely a primary common mechanism through which anesthetics create altered states of arousal (sedation, hallucination, unconsciousness). The research in this center will produce volumes of neural spike train, EEG, local field potential and behavioral data. Therefore, the DATA ANALYSIS CORE will be a central project in this program. Investigators working in the DATA ANALYSIS CORE will assist the experimentalist with their data analyses and help with data and algorithm cataloguing. The analyses conducted by these investigators will provide specific quantitative constrains that will greatly facilitate the modeling research. Research in the DATA ANALYSIS CORE will develop statistical methods and signal processing algorithms in three areas that are directly relevant to the data that will be recorded in these studies: simultaneous analysis of multiple neural spike trains; dynamic analysis of phase-amplitude modulation; and source localization from high-density EEG recordings. These studies will also provide fundamental new quantitative knowledge about the neurophysiology of the brain's arousal circuits that will be relevant to studies of other neuropsychological problems such as coma, pain, sleep and depression. The signal processing algorithms and statistical techniques can also be applied to problems in areas of science and engineering. "
"9215661","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cannabis is pervasively consumed in the United States, especially during adolescence with more than 20% of 12th graders using this drug within the past year. As youngsters increasingly use this substance - and as the debates regarding its safety and legal status ensue - understanding the long-term neurobiological consequences of early cannabis exposure is paramount. Human studies convincingly demonstrate an association between early cannabis exposure and neuropsychiatric diseases ranging from substance abuse disorder (or drug addiction) to schizophrenia. In fact, these diseases are linked with earlier, more frequent consumption suggesting a causal relationship between developmental cannabis exposure and future mental health. Consistent with these epidemiological findings, animals exposed to THC, the main psychoactive component of cannabis, exhibit elevated heroin self-administration. These findings indicate that neurobiological disturbances causally contribute to addiction vulnerability later in life. Alongside these behavioral changes, adolescent exposure to THC induces long-term transcriptional changes in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region of the ventral striatum that regulates reward and reinforcement. Small non-coding miRNAs regulate gene expression and are themselves persistently impacted by adolescent THC exposure, suggesting that these regulatory mechanisms may contribute to the stable, long-term changes in mRNA expression and behavior. The primary goal of this proposal is to identify miRNAs that impact addiction vulnerability via their interaction with proenkephalin (Penk). a neuropeptide precursor induced by adolescent THC that causally mediates heroin self-administration in rats. Since Penk is enriched in a distinct pathway within the NAc, an innovative yet feasible approach to identify and separate these neurons is proposed, allowing for a focused, hypothesis-driven molecular and behavioral study within the relevant neurons. Adolescent exposure to THC increases Penk mRNA and peptide levels in the NAc medial shell, contributing to addiction vulnerability, and I hypothesize that cell type-specific alternations in miRNA contribute to these persistent transcriptional alternations. I further hypothesize that reversing these miRNA derangements in a cell-type specific manner will reduce heroin self-administration even in at-risk animals exposed to THC during adolescence. Findings based on these proposed experiments will increase our neurobiological understanding of addiction as a developmental process and will bring to focus the health-related consequences of early cannabis exposure."
"9212147","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate saccadic eye movements are crucial for vision. Since real-world scenes are often crowded with many objects, a fundamental requirement for saccades is the serial selection of single targets from a field of multiple potentil targets. Saccade target selection is subserved by a network of cortical and subcortical brain areas, but we still have little idea of how activity across these areas is coordinated. This projec investigates the interactions among the superior colliculus (SC), the frontal eye field (FEF), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). The SC is regarded as the gateway for eye-movement commands from cortex to reach the brainstem, but perturbations in SC activity do not just affect the execution of saccades; they also influence the selection of eye-movement targets. This raises a key question: Does the SC simply act as a final selection stage before transmitting saccade commands downstream, or does SC activity influence saccadic decision-making in cortex? To answer this, we will simultaneously record isolated neurons and local field potentials from SC and FEF, and apply advanced analysis techniques to reveal the interactions and likely flow of information between these two areas. Next, we will perturb activity in the SC by temporarily inactivating a portion of it, and will determine whether and how selection-related activity in FEF is altered. We will also investigate how frontal cortex influences selection in the SC. Specifically, frontal area dlPFC is thought to be particularly important for selection based on abstract rules or internal goals. We will test this idea and investigate dlPFC's influence on the SC by analyzing simultaneously-recorded activity in the two areas during performance of rule-governed and salience-based selection tasks. Finally, to test for a causal link with dlPFC, we will record behavior and SC activity while dlPFC is temporarily inactivated. The results will not only provide new information about the functional architecture of saccadic decision-making; they will also lead toward a better understanding of how cortical and subcortical brain areas interact in performance of a cognitive task."
"9269653","Abstract. The huge burden of communicable diseases on the African continent is largely made up of HIV, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The trio of diseases alone is creating societal and economic instability in most African countries across all age groups, and particularly in children. Most recent UNAIDS estimates of the global burden of HIV are that 36.9 million people are currently living with HIV-1 infection and 25.8 million of them reside in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The implementation of anti- retroviral therapy of HIV-1 infected people, which are necessary short-term solutions, comes with complications of costs and iatrogenic effects of drugs, and is not a long-term solution to stop the epidemic in SSA. HIV prevention remains critical to turn the tide of HIV infections and an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is desperately needed. The ability of HIV-1 to escape immune responses represents a complex and challenging hurdle that needs to be resolved so that a protective vaccine regimen can be developed. Similarly, continuous efforts are required to develop vaccines that would mitigate HIV-1 co-morbidities of TB and malaria. In 2015, the Office of AIDS Research announced priority areas of investigations into reducing the incidence of HIV, including the development of safe and effective HIV vaccines and research training of the workforce (NOT-OD-15-137; http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-15-137.html). In this application, we propose to train young scientists in Africa to fill the gap in ongoing efforts to build scientific literacy on the continent and to enhance the ability to perform immunology research. As the NIH is sponsoring several basic research projects as well as clinical vaccine trials in Africa, we believe that the proposed Infectious Disease in Africa symposia will lead to increased scientific knowledge and will help build future scientific leaders on the Continent.  On the back of two rounds of 3-year funding (and 6 IDA symposia), we now propose a further set of symposia, where the overarching aims are: 1) to provide cutting-edge knowledge in the fields of HIV vaccine development and related aspects of malaria and TB; and 2) to foster scientific leadership on the African Continent.  We are proposing a set of three IDA symposia that will take place in Cape Town, South Africa and we will focus on specific topics for each meeting. In the first IDA symposium, we will focus on mechanisms of HIV escape from the immune system and how this represents a major challenge for vaccine development. With our prior experience, we have developed a unique approach of student:teacher mentorship which involves a blend of on-line learning and contact time focused on round-table discussions. !"
"9193088","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hedgehog signaling has been implicated in many cancers and has been shown to be a useful target for anti-cancer therapy. Previous work, including key contributions from my lab, have established that the Hedgehog protein is one of the major regulators of animal development, playing key roles in most tissues and organs in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Using newly developed reagents and methods that open new ways to study Hh signaling, the work proposed in this application will identify and characterize the processes that Hh-producing cells use to prepare and deliver Hh protein, the processes that Hh-receiving cells use to prepare for and handle its arrival, and the processes that regulate the form and activity of Ci, the transcription factor that is responsible for Hh pathway output. These issues are critical to understanding how new and better therapeutic regimens controlling Hh activity can be developed."
"9214524","VISTA (V-region Immunoglobulin-containing Suppressor of T cell Activation) is a member of the B7 negative checkpoint regulator (NCR) family that controls normal immunity and prevents autoimmunity. Unlike other NCRs (PD-1, BTLA, etc.), many of the unique immunologic activities of VISTA would predict an important role in preventing SLE. VISTA has bi-directional functionality, acting as both a ligand and a receptor. As a ligand expressed on myeloid cells, we have shown that it suppresses the earliest events in T cell activation through a putative VISTA counter-receptor, V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 8 (VSIG8). VISTA can also act as a receptor on T cells and myeloid cells that regulates their biology. In addition, VISTA mediates the uptake of apoptotic cells, a central mechanism in the pathogenesis of SLE. All of these functions bear heavily on the central role of the VISTA-VSIG8 pathway in the development of SLE. In this application, we now provide genetic proof that the VISTA pathway does indeed protect susceptible hosts from the development of fatal lupus. Furthermore, we present evidence that VISTA may prevent end organ damage in SLE by regulating the critical myeloid cell effector phase. Our identification of VSIG8 as the VISTA counter-receptor will allow us to elucidate in full detail how this pathway controls the development of SLE. Furthermore, strategic approaches to target this pathway for therapeutic gain will be tested. The unique engineered tools and genetic models we have created in our lab will allow us to define the critical mechanisms by which the VISTA-VSIG8 pathway impacts on SLE. Finally, these studies will facilitate the design of therapeutic strategies to intervene in human SLE, a disease with a large unmet therapeutic need. Specific Aim 1. Identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of fatal SLE when the VISTA-VSIG8 pathway is disrupted. With the lineage-restricted deficiency of VISTA in the T, myeloid and/or dendritic cell compartments, we will evaluate how this loss results in the emergence of specific SLE pathologies and how VISTA deficiency on the sle1,3 background impacts on leukocyte immune function. Mice in which VSIG8 is conditionally-deleted will be used in parallel to address the impact of VSIG8-deficiency in the development of SLE. Specific Aim 2. Define the immune functions of VSIG8 as the VISTA counter-receptor. Studies show VSIG8 binds specifically to VISTA and is involved with VISTA-mediated suppression. As little is known about the function of VSIG8 in the immune system, a comprehensive, systematic approach is presented to demonstrate that VSIG8 is the receptor for VISTA that mediates defined VISTA-specific functions in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3. Targeting the VISTA-VSIG8 pathway in SLE for therapeutic gain. Multiple strategies to target the VISTA-VSIG8 pathway to achieve therapeutic success are presented. First is the use of VISTA-Ig that has demonstrated impressive therapeutic activity. Secondly, the use of ?VISTA antibodies that profoundly suppress T cell immunity in vivo. Finally, the identity of the VISTA receptor, VSIG8, provides a novel target for intervening in this pathway in SLE."
"9415520","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 15 HPV types cause virtually all cervical cancers; however, the current HPV vaccines cover only 2 HPV types causing ~70% of invasive cervical cancer and have no therapeutic effect on established infections that place women at risk. Thus, all women will need some kind of routine cervical screening for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the majority of women alive today have not been vaccinated and therefore are at risk for cervical cancer. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations on cervical cancer screening have not been updated for nearly a decade and performance measures for cervical cancer screening focus on population coverage rather than on follow-up among women with positive screening and diagnostic tests. Toward improving US cervical cancer prevention, we propose multi-tiered assessments at the statewide, systems, provider and patient levels including targeted medical record review of failures in the screening process; geospatial mapping of population-based screening, diagnosis and treatment; and application of community-based participatory approaches (CBPR) in clinical settings to identify barriers and facilitators across the processes of care including those that may enable novel patient-centered screening options. The cornerstone of our coordinated, multidisciplinary program is the New Mexico HPV Pap Registry which transcends limitations of organizational monitoring by mandating statewide surveillance of all cervical cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment. New Mexico is home to a high proportion of ethnically diverse (i.e., American Indian and Hispanic), rural, impoverished, medically disenfranchised and health-disparate populations at high-risk for cervical cancer. The specific aims of this application are to 1) Establish the New Mexico HPV Outcomes, Practice Effectiveness and Surveillance (NM-HOPES) PROSPR Research Center; 2) Establish a sustainable Screening Process Documentation Unit providing data on patients during their course of cervical cancer screening care; and 3) Integrate and fund 3 research projects with the overarching aim of informing practice and targeted interventions supported by comparative effectiveness evaluations of real-world cervical cancer screening practice and outcomes versus guidelines and innovations."
"9428196","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integrative medicine approaches, including meditation, yoga, tai chi, massage, and other practices are widely used by Americans in the hope of obtaining health benefits. Evidence for the health effects of these practices, however, has important limitations. The goal of the fellowship, Training for Research in Integrative Medicine (TRIM), is to train post-doctoral behavioral and social scientists, physicians, and other qualified health professionals to design and conduct rigorous clinical and translational research in CAM and integrative medicine. The program is based at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine (OCIM) within the UCSF School of Medicine. In the present renewal, we detail the rationale for the program and our progress to date, and we propose a program incorporating improvements based on our experience in the first five years. A key change we propose is to expand the training program to include two predoctoral positions in addition to the current four post-doctoral positions. The TRIM program provides: an interdisciplinary clinical and research environment; strong mentoring by an experienced and diverse research faculty; advanced training in biological and psychological research methodologies to support clinical research in integrative medicine; rigorous training in clinical research methodologies, with special attention to issues that are particularly relevant to integrative medicine research; opportunity to conduct original research; training in research ethics; and exposure to diverse integrative approaches to patient care involving all age groups from early childhood through geriatric patients. The TRIM interdisciplinary faculty has twelve core and eight affiliated members representing internal medicine, family medicine, psychology, anthropology, biostatistics, psychoneuroendocrinology, women's health, pediatrics, health services research, medical ethics, and psychiatry. In addition, a major strength of the training program is the clinical advisory faculty who are available to provide technical assistance and consultation on specific integrative medicine approaches that trainees might want to study.  TRIM faculty provide required and optional academic activities that are tailored to each trainee's individual learning objectives and are committed to being active mentors to trainees. The TRIM program will equip a new generation of researchers to expand our knowledge-base about how and whether integrative medicine approaches work for specific health conditions."
"9421615","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this program is to continue to provide rigorous multidisciplinary basic and translational research training for physician scientists committed to careers in academic medicine and PhD postdoctoral fellows in cardiovascular biology and medicine. The rationale underlying the training program is that basic translational and clinical cardiovascular research requires investigators with a strong foundation in molecular and cellular biology and ultimately formation of multi-disciplinary research collaborations composed of MD and PhD investigators. The program is centered in the University of Pennsylvania Cardiovascular Institute (CVI) which includes 180 members in 16 academic departments performing basic, translational and clinical cardiovascular investigation. Considerable infrastructural support from the School of Medicine is committed to the program including integrated basic and translational research space and core laboratory facilities in the recently constructed Penn Translational Research Center.

"9269708","PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT Recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Polynesia and Brazil correlate with adverse neurological disorders ? fetal microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome ? prompting the World Health Organization to declare this virus a public health emergency of international concern. No therapy is currently available to treat ZIKV infection, and it follows that there is an urgent need for readily available and safe treatment options. We discovered a FDA-approved drug (code SSZ) that inhibits ZIKV infection in Vero cells (a monkey kidney line devoid of interferon signaling) and primary placental Hofbauer cells. SSZ is approved for the treatment of arthritis and digestive disorders with a well-established safety profile. Importantly, SSZ is a category B pregnancy drug as high-dose studies in pregnant rats and rabbits did not cause abnormal fetal development. This proposal seeks to further evaluate SSZ as a safe pre-clinical candidate for ZIKV treatment alone and in combination with other active agents. Two aims are proposed in this application to be pursued in parallel with on-going animal studies in Brazil. Aim 1 is to profile the antiviral activity of SSZ in pre-clinical and translational studies. The first aim will investigate SSZ inhibition and safety in primary cells permissive to ZIKV infection. The lines to be evaluated are listed, but not limited to, cells at the site of infection (fibroblasts, keratinocytes and dendritic cells) and the central nervous system (neuroblasts). Additionally, inhibition kinetics will be assessed to model potential treatment modalities en route to clinical trials. These results will support and parallel on-going animal studies with collaborators in endemic countries. SSZ will be further evaluated in combination studies with other FDA-approved drugs that were recently found to possess anti-ZIKV activity. Aim 2 seeks to determine if SSZ primarily inhibits ZIKV directly through viral proteins or indirectly through host immune rescue. The viral non-structural protein 5 (NS5) responsible for viral RNA replication and processing and antagonizing host immune response, and preliminary data suggests that SSZ binds to ZIKV NS5. SSZ may act as a non-nucleotide NS5 inhibitor while also rescuing host immune response ? a dual host/pathogen mechanism of action. The aims outlined in this project hold promise to identify a novel mechanism of antiviral action towards repurposing a safe FDA-approved drug in rapid response to the on-going ZIKV outbreak."
"9204428","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While the role of dopamine in positive symptoms of schizophrenia (SCZ) is well established, it is increasingly recognized that dopamine may only be a final common pathway of different etiological factors. Several lines of evidence point towards a role for neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of SCZ. Neuroinflammation is also possibly related to brain atrophy, which is a consistent finding in SCZ. Positron emission tomography (PET) of translocator protein 18Kd (TSPO), a microglial mitochondrial protein provides an opportunity to study microglia activity, a marker of neuroinflammation, in-vivo. Previous studies used [11C]-PK1195, a radiotracer with many deficiencies as a PET radiotracer, and only in treated patients with SCZ. However, the role of microglia activation/neuroinflammation in antipsychotic naive SCZ, its relation to brain atrophy and clinical symptoms has not been examined using PET. Importantly, examination of neuroinflammation in Clinical high risk (CHR) subjects, which provides an opportunity for early intervention and possibly better outcome, has never been undertaken. Thus, the proposed study aims to obtain first in-vivo imaging data using a high-resolution (HRRT) scanner to investigate whether SCZ related disorders are associated with increased neuroinflammation by measuring [18F]-FEPPA binding in three groups of individuals (36 in each): antipsychotic naive SCZ patients, CHR and matched healthy volunteers (HV). [18F]-FEPPA is a novel radiotracer with desirable properties developed at Centre for addiction and mental health (CAMH), Toronto. Subjects will be scheduled for one PET scan and MRI scan each. The main objective is to test whether there is a significant effect of group (SCZ, CHR and HV) on [18F]-FEPPA binding in hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), while controlling for genotype. On Post-hoc analysis, we hypothesize that both antipsychotic naive SCZ and CHR will have higher [18F]-FEPPA binding in hippocampus and DLPFC, as compared to HV. This study addresses a relevant question in schizophrenia research; the role of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of SCZ, without the confound of antipsychotic medications, using state of the art imaging technology and second generation TSPO radioligands while controlling for genotype. Understanding the neurobiological changes associated with microglia activation has the potential to identify novel treatment targets (i.e. decrease neuroinflammation) in SCZ and in those at clinical high risk for the disease. There is increasing recognition that early identification and intervention is critical for better outcome in SCZ. By examining CHR and antipsychotic naive SCZ, potential early treatments can be conceived that could have significant impact on final outcome of SCZ, and even delay or abort its occurrence."

"9240133","The picornaviruses are a family of small positive sense single stranded RNA viruses that cause a wide range of diseases at an annual cost well into the hundreds of million dollars. Members include acute hepatitis A virus, the heart disease causing coxsackie B3 virus, rhinoviruses that cause more than half the occurrences of the common cold, and the paralyzing poliovirus. These viruses share a life cycle where RNA replication and viral assembly occurs in large membrane anchored replication complexes assembled on the surfaces of vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. The replication process is driven by a virally encoded RNA dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol) that is responsible for the synthesis of all viral RNA. This research project is focused on the structure and assembly of the viral replication centers and on structure-function studies of the viral polymerases to understand mechanisms that control of elongation rates and replication fidelity. We have solved multiple crystal structures of 3Dpol as elongation complexes with bound RNA and these structures revealed a novel mechanism by which RdRPs close their active sites for catalysis in response to nucleotide binding. In this upcoming project period we will use biophysical and structural biology methods to further our mechanistic understanding of RNA translocation by 3Dpol and to solve the structures of viral initiation and uridylylation complexes. We will also use single molecule microscopy and particle tracking methods to directly visualize the in vitro assembly of viral replication complexes onto supported lipid bilayers."
"9428569","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The program objective is to train promising new scientists in mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases, experimental strategies and technologies necessary for development of novel molecular therapeutics. The theme of the program is signal transduction within a multidisciplinary, integrated program that focuses on molecular events in cardiovascular development, proteomics, cardiac stem cells and regenerative medicine as well as the molecular basis of cardiovascular disease. Future decades will see rapid advances in our understanding of the structure and function of molecules involved in cardiovascular disease and hopefully the successful application of these insights into the development of novel treatments and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Such advances will require well-trained, energetic and productive scientists with the ability to understand and manipulate molecular events within a physiological context. These are the type of individuals that we intend to develop through the integrated predoctoral and postdoctoral components of this training program. The 36 mentor-eligible faculty members were selected on the basis of their research interests related to cardiovascular diseases, active NIH research support, ongoing collaborations, successful training and mentoring experience, and commitment to predoctoral and postdoctoral training. The Program Director and Co-Director are assisted by a Program Steering Committee and an External Advisory Committee of outstanding experts in the field of cardiovascular biology. Key components of the training program are the mentor research experience, required didactic courses providing a broad perspective of cardiovascular disease, required training and responsible conduct of research, elective courses, cardiovascular journal club, seminars, presentations at regional and national conferences, and professional development activities. The cardiovascular journal club, seminars, workshops, student research day, and annual cardiovascular retreat provide a framework for all trainees to interact, collaborate, and work together during their training experience. An integrative, multi-year evaluation plan is used to measure the extent to which the program goals and objectives are met. Our aim is to produce outstanding investigators with a broad insight into cardiovascular dysfunction who make significant contributions to the understanding of these disorders and development of therapies for cardiovascular diseases."
"9348073","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Rotavirus (RV) is responsible for an estimated 500,000 deaths each year from severe diarrhea, mostly in children in developing countries. Currently only two RV vaccines are broadly available, and are delivered by liquid drops (either directly or after reconstitution) to infants between 6-14 weeks of age. Both vaccines are labile at ambient temperatures and so bound by the cold chain, as well as being sensitive to freezing because of their liquid components. A drawback of liquid delivery to babies is the potential for spitting out the vaccine, which increases the risk of under-vaccination. Also, aside from leaving babies unprotected from RV during the crucial first months of life, the protocol of vaccinating only after 6 weeks old has been found to lead to greater rates of vaccine-associated intussusception ? a potentially fatal bowel blockage. Furthermore, the cost of these vaccines is often prohibitively high for introduction in the poorest countries, which have the highest rates and burden of RV gastroenteritis. Thus there is an urgent need to develop a cost-effective thermostable rotavirus vaccine for liquid-free administration during the neonatal time period.  International Medica Foundation (IMF) has world-wide license for a low-cost liquid RV vaccine, RRV-TV, and has designed an improved neonatal administration protocol which data indicates will reduce the rate of intussusception. This vaccine was developed as a public-private partnership project and has finished Phase II clinical trials in Ghana, and will seek WHO Prequalification for supply to UN agencies in the near future.  UST?s patented Preservation by Vaporization (PBV) stabilization technology and techniques for producing polymeric films containing PBV-dried biologicals enable buccal vaccine delivery in the dry film format. In Phase I studies with RV vaccine, UST has proven that PBV-dried vaccine in polymeric film retains high activity and long-term stability for ?2 months at 37°C and 5 months at 25°C. The application of these technologies for use with RRV-TV will decreased the cost of vaccine implementation due to the low-priced raw vaccine material, enhanced manufacturing yields possible with PBV, and refrigeration-free distribution and storage. The final product will be a thermostable RV vaccine in a mucoadhesive dissolvable polymeric film for liquid-free administration to the buccal or sublingual surfaces, to provide simpler, more accurate dosing to neonates.  The specific objectives of this Phase II project are 1) Application of PBV protocols developed during Phase I to tetravalent RRV-TV vaccine 2) Optimization of film production protocols to incorporate PBV RRV-TV vaccine and antacids, and 3) demonstrate film suitability and safety in vitro as well as in vivo using hamsters and rats, and in vivo vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy against challenge in a gnotobiotic piglet model. The long-term goal is to generate a dissolvable mucoadhesive polymeric film that contains thermostable RRV-TV rotavirus vaccine for simple oral mucosal delivery to neonates which has low cost of manufacture, store and ship and is immunogenic, safe and protective."

"9242695","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to trauma has a significant influence on developmental and mental health in young children. The proposed project is a renewal application designed to extend the findings of R01 MH079252-03 that successfully tested and modeled the relation between potential protective factors and mental health outcomes for a sample of 302 youth in foster care over three time points. The results indicated that constructs like child appraisal of events and coping or problem-solving style mediated the relation between maltreatment exposure and adjustment, specifically aggression. Moreover, the results indicated that cognitive systems like IQ operated as a moderator of the relation. Taken together, the results suggest the next line of research questions put forth in the proposed project. The project seeks to better illuminate the core components of appraisal (or threat perception) and problem-solving skills (or working memory skills) that accounted for adjustment in school-age youth by expanding the investigation to a younger age. In the proposed project, we will prospectively and longitudinally assess how dimensional components of trauma exposure (i.e., frequency, chronicity, and severity) influence the Negative Valence System (threat) and Cognitive Systems (working memory) to predict adjustment for early childhood-aged youth. The sample will be composed of 180 youth (and their parents and teachers) ages 3-5 at baseline, stratified by risk for trauma exposure making it possible to identify differential effects of trauma across a sample of youth who vary over time in their exposure to different levels of chronicity, frequency, and severity. The project will assess trauma as early as it can be reliably assessed across the spectrum of events commonly accepted as traumatic and provide a model test of the how the dimensions of those baseline traumas and new traumas over time impact emotion regulation and working memory. Moreover, the project will compare baseline emotion regulation and working memory functioning with post-trauma functioning in the smallest reasonable time frame so that the actual impact of the events on youth emotion regulation and working memory can be more reliably determined than ever before. The project will also extend the work by accounting for parental emotional response to the child in the exposure-outcome relation. The project is important and innovative in that it will include assessment of emotional regulation and working memory using state-of-the-art tools across a variety of modalities (physiological heart rate, observational measures, laboratory tasks, standardized measures, and self-report) to provide the clearest possible picture of the interaction between the constructs. Testing models of trauma dimensions over time and focusing on the core components of emotion regulation, working memory and parent-child interaction as mechanisms of how trauma confers risk to developmental health are rare and needed for the field to advance beyond long lists of the multifinality of responses youth demonstrate (both positive and detrimental) post-trauma exposure."
"9259188","PROJECT SUMMARY (COOPER CITEK): ?Secondary-sphere interactions in the activation of dinitrogen and other small molecules by synthetic models of the nitrogenase FeMo cofactor?  Nitrogen-based fertilizers are a crucial component of feeding the Earth?s expanding population. Not only do fertilizers allow modern agricultures sustain more than 7 billion people, they help farmers to produce more food with less land, thereby limiting the environmental impacts of excess water consumption or of clearing habitats critical to diverse ecosystems. Today, the Haber-Bosch process supplies enormous quantities of synthetic ammonia from atmospheric dinitrogen. However the total expense of this process amounts to 2% of global energy consumption, 4% of natural gas, and the associated impact of greenhouse gases produced.  Certain bacteria and archaea are able to derive ammonia from atmospheric dinitrogen for the benefit of themselves and the ecologies of which they are members. Biological nitrogen fixation is known to be facilitated by an iron-sulfur cofactors within conserved nitrogenase enzymes. These cofactors (the most well-known being the FeMo cofactor) both bind and reduce dinitrogen, with equivalents of biologically-derived protons and electrons and ATP hydrolysis. While dinitrogen fixation represents a significant cost to competent organisms, this input might establish a lower bound to energetic investment for nitrogen fixation. However the operative mechanism of nitrogenase FeMo cofactor is still debated at the fundamental, chemical level.  This proposal aims to probe the mechanistic significance of conserved residues in the secondary coordination sphere of the FeMo cofactor, namely a histidine that is thought to facilitate hydrogen bonding or proton shuttling during catalysis. We will employ synthetic models to mimic a hypothesized dinitrogen binding site that is adjacent to the conserved histidine and to study the pathways of proton-coupled reduction of small molecules by these models. Molecular iron complexes incorporating secondary-sphere hydrogen-bonding functionality (histidine analogs) can be accessed by known preparations and may allow for the stabilization of reactive species on-path toward dinitrogen fixation or, conversely, for the enhancement of catalytic dinitrogen reduction. In the former case, we may be able to characterize previously unobserved intermediates of the reaction of protons with reduced iron-dinitrogen species (by 57Fe Mössbauer, EPR, X-ray crystallography, electrochemistry, etc.) and their stepwise conversion to other known complexes. In the latter case, we may probe the chemical motifs that impart the FeMo cofactor with such facility for a difficult small-molecule transformation by examining catalysis kinetics, energetics, and the intimate step-by-step order of proton- and electron-additions (by reaction rates, electrochemistry, proton dependences, etc.). It is hoped that hydrogen- bonding structures may even permit milder reagents for homogeneous dinitrogen reduction. If molecular iron systems are to become essential technologies for the future, they must be understood at the fundamental level and must be compatible with sustainable sources of energy."

"9324122","Abstract The objective of the Conference on Redesigning Healthcare Organizations to Deploy New Knowledge from Data Science is to spur the evolution of healthcare delivery organizations to effectively apply emerging knowledge. Achieving this objective requires sequentially addressing three topics. First, we must understand how emerging approaches to knowledge generation - resulting from the explosion of digital health data and data science methods - are changing the characteristics of knowledge. In parallel, we need to identify the knowledge management and other organizational capabilities required to adapt to the new characteristics of knowledge. Second, we need to assess the extent to which these knowledge management and other organizational capabilities are currently in place, and how this varies by type of healthcare delivery organization. Third, where capability gaps exist, we need to determine where new evidence is needed to inform how to close the gaps. Addressing these topics requires experts in the following domains: (1) characteristics of, and delivery methods for, new knowledge; (2) application of new knowledge in healthcare delivery, on the technical side and on the organizational process side; (3) current state of, and how to evolve, knowledge management and knowledge infrastructures within and beyond healthcare delivery organizations. We will convene 20-30 experts across these domains from within and outside of University of Michigan for a 1.5-day, in-person conference. The conference will address the three proposed topics. We will then synthesize and broadly disseminate key insights from the discussion."
"9148675","PROJECT SUMMARY DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) present formidable blocks to DNA metabolic processes and must be repaired for cell survival. Because ICLs are so toxic, many ICL-inducing agents are used as anticancer therapeutics. The use of such chemotherapeutic agents can also result in the formation of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs). While proteins from several repair pathways are thought to be involved in processing ICLs and DPCs, the mechanisms of ICL and DPC repair in mammalian cells are not clearly defined. Thus, the overall goal of the proposed studies is to fill this gap in knowledge by elucidating the mechanisms of crosslink repair in mammalian cells. We and others have demonstrated that proteins from several repair pathways are involved in ICL repair, including nucleotide excision repair (NER), mismatch repair (MMR), homologous recombination (HR), Fanconi anemia (FA), and high mobility group (HMGB) proteins. However, their functions and interactions in ICL repair in mammalian cells are not well understood. The novel hypotheses to be tested are that: ERCC1-XPF is involved in the initial unhooking of ICLs in an SLX4- or UHRF1-dependent fashion; that HMGB1, but not HMGB3, is involved in the recruitment of ERCC1-XPF to ICLs to facilitate unhooking in an SLX4-independent fashion; and that ICL-induced DSBs are processed by mutagenic and error-free HR pathways, specifically regulated by HMGB proteins in mammalian cells. The long-term objectives are to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in the removal of crosslinks from the mammalian genome. Specifically we propose to: (a) determine in vivo the mechanisms of incision and mutagenesis during crosslink repair; (b) elucidate the mechanisms involved in error-free and mutagenic crosslink repair associated with ICL- induced DSB formation; and (c) determine the mutagenic and recombinogenic impact of DPCs in human cells. The proposed work is innovative because it will test novel hypotheses; moreover, a unique feature of the approach is to induce site-specific ICLs in mammalian genomes to study their repair. In addition, genetically engineered mammalian cells lines constructed for this project will allow for definitive assessment of the roles of repair proteins in ICL processing in vivo, by separating the initial unhooking steps from the subsequent DSB- induced HR processing. These experiments will define the function of novel components (e.g. UHRF1 and HMGB proteins) involved in ICL repair, and have the potential to identify as yet undetermined proteins/pathways involved in the repair of crosslinks. The expected contribution is that the mechanisms of ICL and DPC repair in mammalian cells will be elucidated, which is significant because the new information obtained will aid in the development of novel targeted strategies to control human cancers using crosslinking agents. The studies will also contribute significant fundamental new knowledge to the fields of genetic instability and DNA damage and repair."
"9226011","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although skin cancer (SC) is a largely preventable disease, it is the most common cancer in the United States. More than 3 million skin cancers are diagnosed annually. The lifetime risk of developing melanoma (an aggressive form of skin cancer) is higher among whites, but this disease is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in the Latino population. Compared with whites, Latinos have lower 5-year melanoma survival rates, especially among men (76.6% in Latinos vs. 87.0% in whites). The Latino population often presents late-stage melanoma tumors, which can cause detrimental prognoses. Many of the cases of SC that are diagnosed annually could be prevented by protecting the skin from excessive sun exposure. Latinos tend to report a lower frequency of sunscreen use, and to endorse more sun protection barriers. This group is more likely to believe that not much can be done to decrease the risk of SC and to agree that there are too many recommendation about preventing SC that it's hard to know which ones to follow when compared with whites. The long-term goal is to use a strong psychosocial measure on sun protection beliefs that can be used to better understand behavior and guide intervention development. The objective of this particular application is to apply a mixed methods approach to better assess psychosocial factors of sun protection in the Latino population, using the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the PEN-3 model of cultural influence as theoretical frameworks. The approach is innovative because it will develop a culturally sensitive, theory-based, and psychometrically strong measure of sun protection barriers and facilitators in English to assess sun protection beliefs in Latinos. In Aim 1, in-depth interviews will be conducted to collect qualitative and quantitative data using a sample of Latino adults (N=30) to create a pool of items reflecting sun protection barriers and facilitators. A cognitive interviewing session will follow u the first set of in-depth interviews (N=15), and the Sun Protection Barriers and Facilitators Scale (SP-BFS) will be developed based on information gathered in this aim. In Aim 2, the scale will be administered to a second sample of Latino adults (N=200) and it will be psychometrically examined (reliability and validity). The proposed research is significant because it will contribut to the limited literature regarding predictors of SC prevention in Latinos as a way to investigate mechanisms to improve health promotion actions. The proposed research supports NCI's goal to identify and understand factors that contribute to disparities in the incidence and mortality of cancer, and for research to help develop appropriate initiatives that are culturally relevant."
"9148676","PROJECT SUMMARY Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessive disorder caused by deficient DNA damage repair. FA patients exhibit aplastic anemia, congenital abnormalities, and profoundly elevated cancer occurrence. Cells derived from FA patients are hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents and highly susceptible to chromosome breakage under genotoxic stress. To date, 17 autosomal and 1 X-linked genes are designated as causative genes for FA, but the molecular structure of the FA pathway remains largely unclear. Lack of defined genetic model systems and a scarcity of recognizable protein domains in most FA proteins are among the major obstacles impeding the advance of FA biology. Recent genetic studies in nice revealed an intriguing link between the FA pathways and aldehyde metabolism and implicated DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) as a physiologically relevant endogenous lesion. Many DNA interstrand crosslinking (ICL) agents, such as aldehydes and cisplatin, also induce DPCs. Ionizing radiation and UV exposure also generate abundant nuclear DPCs. Therefore, DPCs is a significant type of DNA damage. Given that DPCs and ICLs are both strong obstacles of DNA transactions and that a cohort of mammalian DNA repair mutants exhibit shared ICL and DPC sensitivities, it is likely that repair of these two types of lesions assumes similar molecular mechanisms in utilizing lesion bypass synthesis, nucleotide excision repair, and FA pathway components. The main objective of Project 3 is to study how cells repair DPCs via a combined proteolytic and nucleolytic mechanisms and to determine the link between FA pathway function and endogenous DPCs potentially arisen from gene transcription reprogramming. These objectives will be achieved with two specific aims: (1) Define factors and pathways involved in DPC repair and (2) Define FA pathway function in countering endogenous DNA-crosslinking lesions. Elucidation of the DPC repair mechanism will address a critical knowledge gap in DNA repair biology. It may also reveal the underlying mechanism of the hematopoietic manifestation of FA patients. The FA pathway functions primarily in resolving replication fork-blocking DNA lesions. This type of lesion is exemplified by DNA crosslinks most frequently generated by bifunctional alkylating chemotherapeutic modalities, such as cisplatin and melphalan, and by DNA-protein crosslinks produced with high frequency from ionizing radiation exposure. For example, clinical response of many ovarian cancers to cisplatin treatment is dictated by their FA pathway status. In summary, this project is aimed at delineating the molecular pathological mechanism of Fanconi anemia with the immediate benefit of uncovering novel therapeutic targets to improve cancer treatment outcomes."
"9390589","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have engineered a synthetic antibody that neutralizes 100% of HIV strains. This antibody is built from the parts of CD4 and CCR5 that are recognized by HIV, and is named eCD4-Ig. The goal of our research program is now to maximize its efficacy. A fundamental question for our effort-and for the field as a whole-is: Which isotype of IgG has the properties that are most important for suppressing viral replication? To answer this question, we will eliminate problematic features of IgG2 and IgG3 that have historically presented a barrier to their use as therapeutics in humans, and we will compare the ability of rhesus IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 forms of eCD4-Ig to suppress SIV replication in macaques. The isotype of eCD4-Ig that most completely suppresses viral replication will be advanced to human clinical trials."
"9303706","Project Summary Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a major public health problem worldwide and the most common presenting illness among people living with HIV accounting for one in four HIV/AIDS-associated deaths. The continuing rise of multidrug-resistant strains of Mtb makes the development of new effective anti-TB drugs a high priority. In this context, re-examining the molecular mechanism of action of established antitubercular drugs that target the same well-validated biosynthetic pathway as front-line anti- TB agents but at a distinct catalytic step, thereby bypassing widespread resistance mechanisms, could have a major impact on the treatment of drug-resistant TB. Two such drugs previously used in the clinical treatment of TB, Isoxyl (ISO) and Thiacetazone (TAC), are the object of our investigations. ISO and TAC are thiocarbamide-containing prodrugs that require activation of their thiocarbonyl moiety by the Mtb flavin-dependent monooxygenase EthA for bactericidal activity. Following activation, ISO and TAC inhibit the biosynthesis of mycolic acids thereby abolishing the formation of the outer membrane of Mtb and leading to cell death. We recently identified the dehydration step of the type II fatty acid synthase (FAS-II) elongation cycle as the point at which both ISO and TAC inhibit the biosynthesis of mycolic acids. Specifically, we found that ISO and TAC block the FAS-II elongation cycle by covalently modifying the essential FAS-II dehydratase, HadAB. Despite this important breakthrough, it is still unclear whether ISO and TAC also inhibit the (non- essential) FAS-II dehydratase HadBC, and the mechanism(s) through which missense mutations in HadC increase 16 to 32-fold the resistance of Mtb to both drugs remain(s) unexplained. This application is to complete our understanding of the mechanisms of susceptibility and resistance of Mtb to ISO and TAC with the long-term goal of developing novel inhibitors of the dehydration step of FAS-II with reduced resistance frequencies and much improved potency, specificity and pharmacological features than ISO and TAC. Specifically, we propose under Aim 1 to determine whether ISO and TAC inhibit HadBC in vitro and in whole Mtb cells and, in Aim 2, to define the molecular mechanisms through which HadC missense mutations confer resistance to both drugs."
"9420759","Project Summary/Abstract  Our brains carry out complex cognitive tasks via the intricate electrical communication between neurons. The specialized site where this communication occurs is the synapse, and it is capable of various forms of plasticity that enable the constant and adaptive refinement of the communication between neurons. The amount of neuronal activity that is transmitted at the synapse typically dictates the type of modification, and raising the level of communication between neurons strengthens their synaptic connection through an adaptive increase in the number of connections. This process is collectively known as activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, and is thought to be the cellular foundation for learning and memory.  The long term goal of this project is to better understand the basic cell biological roots of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. In particular, I am interested in understanding the functional role of intracellular mitochondrial trafficking in supporting the growth of synapses adapting to increased neuronal activation. I will carry out this project using Drosophila Melanogaster larvae, or fruit fly maggots, as an experimental model system that was chosen due to the powerful genetic tools available. Like motor neurons in our spinal cord, the muscles in the body wall of the larvae are innervated by motoneurons that are responsible for sending the signal when to move. These motoneurons form a synapse onto the muscle, which is known as the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse. The presynaptic terminal of the NMJ synapse will undergo activity- dependent plasticity upon increased activity of the motoneurons, from increased movement of the larvae. I can microscopically image this synapse directly through the cuticle (skin) of the larvae using technology developed in my lab; including its changing shape and intracellular dynamics (such as changes in mitochondria) that occur simultaneously with the growth when neuronal activity is increased.  My central hypothesis is that neuronal activity induces the formation of acute synaptic growth that is eventually stabilized by the trafficking of mitochondria into this nascent growth, which facilitates its long-term maturation to becoming a mature synaptic connection. Using the tools I described, I will test this hypothesis with two specific aims: (1) I will use a genetic mutant larvae in which the trafficking of mitochondria to the NMJ is dysfunctional to see if any aspects of activity-dependent growth are successful, hence pinpointing a precise role for mitochondrial trafficking in the process. (2) I will seek to functionally characterize a molecular mediator responsible for promoting activity-dependent synaptic growth, and determine whether the driving force for its ability to promote the growth of synapses is in its regulation of mitochondrial trafficking. The insight gained from this work will uncover new knowledge on the cell biology of synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial trafficking in neurons, two processes that commonly result in neurodegenerative diseases when dysfunctional."
"9306674","For decades, a ?one bug, one drug? approach has characterized development of vaccines or treatments for specific infectious diseases. We propose a different approach based on the development of novel treatment of infectious diseases by capitalizing on common host innate immune responses that are triggered during infec- tion by influenza and other priority pathogens. Influenza virus infects up to 5 million people yearly worldwide, killing as many as ~500,000. Our strong experimental evidence demonstrates that the potent TLR4 antagonist, Eritoran (Eisai, Inc.), as well as multiple other TLR4 antagonists, significantly decreased both acute lung injury (ALI) and mortality when administered therapeutically to influenza-infected mice. Eritoran not only blocks influ- enza-mediated release of host-derived ?danger-associated molecular patterns? (DAMPs), but also blunted DAMP-mediated TLR4 signaling in macrophages that normally results in a ?cytokine storm.? While we have elucidated several novel mechanisms by which influenza mediates ALI and lethality that are counteracted by Eritoran therapy (e.g., release of host-derived DAMPS that signal through TLR4; increased tight-junction per- meability leading to pulmonary edema; a role for IL-1?/? in lethality), our understanding of the overall innate immune signaling pathways that control influenza-induced ALI and Eritoran-mediated protection remains in- complete, necessitating further investigation to develop a highly efficacious host-directed therapy. Therefore, Specific Aim 1 will focus on the identification of innate immune mechanisms that underlie both influenza sensi- tivity and Eritoran-mediated protection. We will take advantage of genetically modified mouse strains to dissect the signaling pathways engaged. Whether TLR4 must be expressed on stromal and/or myeloid cells, the role of virus-induced epithelial cell necroptosis in DAMP release, mechanisms by which non-TLR4 PRRs contribute to influenza resistance/susceptibility, and the possibility that TLR2/TLR4 dimerization is required for the host response to influenza will be evaluated as novel potential mechanisms that can be exploited to enhance thera- peutic efficacy. In Specific Aim 2, the therapeutic benefit of a novel IKK? inhibitor, E6070 (Eisai, Inc.), against influenza, alone or in the presence of current anti-influenza antiviral therapies, will be tested in cotton rats (CR), a second rodent species that permits analysis of ALI in response to infection by non-adapted human in- fluenza isolates. Aim 2 will also compare Eritoran and E6070 in CR in a model of secondary staphylococcal (MRSA) pneumonia following influenza infection. Lastly, we will assess the relative effectiveness of Eritoran and E6070 for the ability to block ALI caused by other clinically important or biothreat pathogens associated with ALI in humans (e.g., Francisella tularensis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, SARS- CoV and MERS-CoV), first in mice, and, if effective, in CR. These experiments will challenge the overarching central hypothesis that TLR antagonists represent broad-based, therapeutic agents that mitigate pathologic host responses to multiple ALI-inducing priority pathogens."
"9289988","Project Summary Macrophages are a diverse family of professional phagocytes and `accessory cells' present within most tissues, and equipped with long and motile filopodia that continuously explore surrounding matrix and cells. Macrophages recognize and scavenge pathogens as well as unfit cells and cell debris, glycoproteins and lipids, and produce a large range of bioactive molecules and growth factors. A literature that covers 150 years of research has demonstrated their important and complex roles (i) as innate immune sentinels for the uptake of pathogens, but also as (ii) regulators of epithelia and blood and lymphatic vessels morphogenesis during fetal development, postnatal homeostasis and tissue remodeling, and inflammatory and degenerative processes. An overarching hypothesis that drives the present proposal and the work of our laboratory is that the understanding the genetic and molecular events that control development, growth, and maintenance of macrophages within tissues is essential to elucidate their roles in disease and the consequence(s) of genetic polymorphisms. Early studies suggested that tissue macrophages originate and renew from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) via circulating progenitors such as blood monocytes. However, as recently shown by us and others, monocytes and macrophages play different roles in disease pathogenesis, and in fact, they represent distinct cell types, as most tissue-resident macrophages develop from embryonic progenitors distinct from HSCs and are maintained in postnatal tissues independently of bone marrow progenitors and monocytes. Furthermore, macrophages that reside in distinct tissues present with different molecular identities and functions. The tissue-specific identities of macrophages are in part maintained by their local microenvironment, but are also likely to result from developmental processes. The present project builds on these exciting and `paradigm-changing' developments. 1) We will characterize the genetic and molecular determinants that control macrophage development from embryonic progenitors in the mouse, using sate-of-the-art fate mapping methods, and explore the mechanisms that underlie the colonization of embryos by the macrophages precursors. 2) We will also take advantage of single-cell genomic and systems biology approaches to characterize the mechanisms and spatio-temporal sequence of events responsible for tissue macrophage specification in vivo. We will further test the role of novel key transcriptional regulators that control macrophage differentiation, maintenance, and functions in postnatal tissues, with a focus on Kupffer cells. Along this process we will generate novel genetic tools needed to distinguish and selectively target tissue-resident macrophages, independently of HSC and their progeny. Altogether, this work represents a ground-breaking advance toward our aim to characterize the function of tissue-resident macrophage in health and disease."
"9394164","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute lung injury (ALI) is a devastating disease characterized by alveolar-epithelial barrier disruption and resultant pulmonary edema and hypoxemia. There are currently no effective disease-modifying therapies and supportive care remains the mainstay of medical management. Ultimately, ALI leads to multi-organ dysfunction and/or death in up to 30% of patients. Neutrophils are clearly important for host defense against bacteria, however toxic neutrophil mediators such as reactive oxygen radicals, granule enzymes and neutrophil extracellular traps also contribute to the pathogenesis of lung injury by causing endothelial, parenchymal and alveolar injury. Neutrophils are prime targets for manipulating the inflammatory response and therefore it is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms that guide neutrophil responses. Dr. Clemens' long-term research goal is to understand how intracellular signaling pathways regulate neutrophil activation during acute lung injury and other inflammatory diseases. Calcium is an evolutionarily conserved signaling messenger that is a central component of multiple signaling pathways. In immune cells, increases in cytoplasmic calcium are controlled via store operated calcium entry (SOCE), where calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels allow influx of extracellular calcium when endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores are depleted. STIM proteins are ER calcium sensors which sense calcium depletion and directly gate ORAI, a pore subunit of the CRAC channel. Little is known about STIM, ORAI or the molecular regulation of calcium signaling in neutrophils. The objectives of this proposal are to define the molecular pathways that regulate SOCE in neutrophils and to determine how these pathways modulate neutrophil activation during ALI. The central hypotheses are: 1) STIM calcium sensors and ORAI calcium channels cooperate to regulate neutrophil calcium signaling, and 2) calcium-dependent neutrophil activation is critical for induction of ALI. The studies proposed in Aims 1 and 2 will identify the molecular machinery required for SOCE in neutrophils and determine the role of neutrophil calcium signaling in acute lung injury using a unique set of mice with neutrophil specific deletion in Stim or Orai genes. Aim 3 will utilize a novel approach with humanized mice to test these hypotheses in human neutrophils. This project is relevant to the missions of the NIH and NIAID since these studies will elucidate previously unexplored pathways of calcium signaling in neutrophils that may lead to new therapeutic approaches to treat acute lung injury and other inflammatory processes."
"9207103","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9402720","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 1,2-benzisoxazole heterocycle represents an important chemical motif in modern medicine. Several FDA approved drugs featuring this component, such as Zonisamide and Paliperidone, are widely administered to treat epilepsy and schizophrenia. Other small molecules that contain a 1,2-benzisoxazole are under study for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, obesity and certain types of cancer. Because these molecules are not found in nature, chemical synthesis is the only route to accessing 1,2-benzisoxazole derivatives. Current methodologies for their laboratory synthesis are chemically and economically inefficient. In order to access new 1,2-benzisoxazole medicines and to optimize derivatives currently under study, a new synthetic method is highly desired. To address this need, a palladium-catalyzed cascade merger of aryl halides and linear nitrones is proposed. This method provides a direct and selective route to 1,2-benzisoxazoles from readily available chemicals. Catalysis allows chemists to prepare complex chemicals under mild reaction conditions; thus, the proposed method will enable the synthesis of 1,2-benzisoxazole derivatives currently inaccessible. This proposal provides strategies inspired by modern technology aided by the rich history of nitrones and palladium catalysis to open new doors for medicinal chemists and ultimately modern medicine."
"9259367","PROJECT SUMMARY An emerging concept in gene expression regulation is that a diverse set of modified nucleotides is found internally within mRNA, and these modifications markedly influence the fate of mRNAs in cells. The goal of this project is to understand the function and regulation of 8-oxoguanosine (8oxoG), a nucleotide modification that can occur in RNA as a result of guanosine oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS is a major mediator of disease pathology, but the mechanisms by which ROS influences cells is poorly understood. ROS is known to induce the formation of 8oxoG in DNA, but it also induces 8oxoG in RNA. Indeed, Alzheimer's disease brains show marked increases in 8oxoG, especially in certain transcripts. However, the prevalence and function of 8oxoG in the transcriptome is poorly understood. I have developed a technique called 8oxoG- iCLIP, which maps 8oxoG sites throughout the transcriptome. I find remarkably specific enrichment of 8oxoG in certain mRNAs, and often in 5'UTRs. One region that appears to be particularly susceptible to 8oxoG formation is G-quadruplex structures in RNA. Based on my new mapping technology, I am in an ideal position to address key questions related to this novel mechanism of disease-relevant RNA modification: What is the source of 8oxoG-inducing ROS in the cell? What RNAs are oxidized and specifically where in the transcript body? How does 8oxoG regulate mRNA function? To address these questions, the goals of this proposal are to identify the pathways that control the formation of 8oxoG in the transcriptome by using my transcriptome- wide 8oxoG mapping method in conjunction with pharmacologic inhibitors of subcellular ROS sources and agonists of ROS-generating signaling pathway. These experiments will provide a transcriptome-wide analysis of how 8oxoG formation is regulated by specific subcellular sources of ROS and will identify signaling pathways responsible for transcript-specific RNA oxidation. I will also determine the effect of 8oxoG on mRNA translation. I will use circular dichroism spectroscopy to test if regions of mRNAs that accumulate 8oxoG can fold into specific structures, termed G-quadruplexes. Furthermore, I will test if 8oxoG formation in G residues of G-quadruplexes disrupts these structures. Lastly, I will use luciferase reporters with 5'UTRs containing G- quadruplexes to determine if ROS affects translation and if these effects are dependent on the G-quadruplex. Together, these experiments take advantage of my new 8oxoG mapping technology to reveal fundamental new insights into the regulation and function of an RNA modification that may have major roles in mediating the effects of ROS on cells."
"9208178","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescents may be uniquely prone to errors in self-administering medicines, and many adolescents have serious misunderstandings about potential risks or adverse effects of over-the-counter medicines. In order to successfully transition to adult health care, it is critical that adolescents understand how to appropriately us both prescription and over-the-counter medicines. In addition to promoting safe use of existing medicines it is also important to educate young people about the drug development and the clinical trials processes.         The goal of our Medicines and Me project is to increase adolescents' understanding of concepts essential for the safe use of medicines as well as to increase their awareness of the drug development and clinical trials processes. We also aim to increase the teaching and engagement skills of early career scientists participating in our outreach programs. We will accomplish this through the development of engaging case-based lessons to be used by teachers in classrooms throughout the US and by scientists leading outreach programs through the University of Rochester's Life Sciences Learning Center (LSLC). We will also create a community-based course for parents and children which will be offered at YMCAs in the Rochester, NY area.        During this five-year project we will:      * Develop six case-based lessons that will be used by secondary school biology teachers.      * Implement a dissemination plan in which we will recruit, train and support a national network of teacher-presenters to lead professional development workshops for their peers throughout the US.     * Develop two case-based lessons that will be used for scientist-led outreach programs.      * Recruit, train and support scientists to lead the outreach lessons for on-site field trips to the LSLC and for in-class visits to secondary schools throughout the Rochester, NY area.      * Use community input to create a course for parents and children that will taught at eight local YMCAs.      * Evaluate knowledge gains in program participants.         This proposed project is significant because the Medicines and Me lessons will engage students in exploring concepts that the general public should understand about appropriate use of medicines, translational research, and clinical trials. Further, it will provide a model for disseminating these lessons to teachers nationwide using peer-to-peer professional development.         This proposed project is innovative because our curriculum materials will focus on positive messages- knowledge needed to use medicines safely and to understand the importance of the drug development and clinical trials processes in producing medicines that are safe and effective. We will use known best practices to develop curricula across diverse settings, including creating an innovative model for educating adolescents and their parents about these important concepts through a community-based course."
"9207587","EARLY PHASE CLINICAL RESEARCH SUPPORT (Core-030) ABSTRACT The Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS) component provides data management support to conduct novel early-phase clinical trials designed from research findings of UCCC members. The overall objective of the EPCRS is to promote innovative clinical trials in the UCCC catchment area (the State of Colorado), to facilitate inter- and intra-programmatic translational collaboration within UCCC, and to support the development of novel cutting-edge therapies and strategies to prevent and treat cancer. These clinical trials are hypothesis-driven, high-priority, innovative, Pilot (feasibility) or Phase 0/I institutional trials focused on early phase testing of an agent or device for the diagnosis, prevention, detection or treatment of cancer. Expected outcomes include subsequent later stage clinical testing through the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), the Phase II mechanism of the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN), or in conjunction with independent peer-reviewed grant support or industry funding. Although EPCRS was not funded over the last cycle due to disapproval of our PRMS, UCCC has continued to conduct early phase trials which adhere to the NCI eligibility requirements of this mechanism and through our NCI UM1 Southwest Early Clinical Trials (SECT) Consortium (UM1CA186688) with MD Anderson Cancer Center, as well as institutional and industry support, funding has been available to translate bench observations made by our translational UCCC members, to the bedside. Going forward a number of changes have been instituted to further ensure that only the highest quality early clinical science is carried out at UCCC. These include an Investigator-Initiated Trial (IIT) structure, that includes an IIT Incubator (IIT-I) meeting chaired by Eckhardt that brings together a multidisciplinary group of investigators to discuss and promote hypothesis-driven early trials, as well as an IIT Review Committee (IIT-RC) chaired by Flaig and Eckhardt that is charged with ensuring that all components of a concept such as the scientific rationale, statistics, data management, budgeting and finance are assembled to enhance feasibility and to enable prioritization for funding decisions. In addition to the requested CCSG funds, UCCC will provide $250K/yr for early-phase clinical trials that will facilitate expansion of IITs and provide greater opportunity for the translational science of UCCC programs to impact patients in our catchment area. Our future directions include: 1) Establishing processes that stimulate direct collaborations between the UCCC clinical disease groups and the UCCC Research Programs; 2) Working with preclinical scientists in the UCCC to enable the development of novel animal models that can be used provide the rationale for hypothesis-driven early clinical trials; 3) Evaluating challenges regarding participation among racial/ethnic and socioeconomically underserved populations in early clinical trials; 4) Interacting with major UCCC wide strategic initiatives that involve early clinical investigation."
"9209577","PROJECT 1. HUMAN STUDIES OF ANESTHETIC ACTION General anesthesia is a fascinating man-made, neurophysiological phenomenon that has been developed empirically over many years to enable safe and humane performance of surgical and non-surgical procedures. Specifically it is a drug-induced condition consisting of unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia and immobility, along with physiological stability. General anesthesia is administered daily to 60,000 patients in the United States, the mechanisms for how anesthetics act in the brain to create the states of anesthesia are not well understood. Significant progress has been made recently in characterizing the molecular sites that anesthetics target. However, how actions at specific molecular targets lead to the behavioral states is less well understood. Addressing this issue requires a systems neuroscience approach to define how actions of the drugs at specific molecular targets and neural circuits lead to a behavioral state of general anesthesia. In this program project entitled, Integrated Systems Neuroscience Studies of Anesthesia, we will develop an integrated systems neuroscience program consisting of human, non-human primate, rodent and modeling studies of four anesthetics: the GABAA agents, propofol and sevoflurane; the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine; and the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine. The program project will also include a DATA ANALYSIS CORE, which will provide assistant with data analysis and conduct research on statistical methods. The Specific Aims are to understand how the actions of the anesthetics at specific molecular targets and neural circuits produce the oscillatory dynamics (EEG rhythms, changes in LFPs and neural spiking activity) that are likely a primary common mechanism through which anesthetics create altered states of arousal (sedation, hallucination, unconsciousness). In our first set of human studies we will empanel a cohort of normal human volunteers. Each volunteer will receive a controlled-dosing of one of the anesthetics while executing a behavioral task. The controlled-dosing of the anesthetic will be systematically increased to induce loss of consciousness then systematically decreased to allow recovery. During induction, maintenance and recovery, we will record in addition to standard physiological variables, up to 256-leads of EEG activity. We will characterize the altered states of arousal induced by each anesthetics by relating the dynamics of the neurophysiological and physiological variables to the changes in behavioral. In our second set of human studies we will study specifically sevoflurane and ketamine induced sedation and unconsciousness in neurosurgical patients with implanted intracortical electrodes. These latter studies provide the unique opportunity to record and study multiple single neuron spiking activity and local field potentials in the human brain during loss and recovery of consciousness. These studies will also provide fundamental new knowledge about the neurophysiology of the brain's arousal circuits that will be relevant to problems such as coma, sleep disorders, pain and depression.  "

"9387045","Project Summary  When a cell divides it must accurately segregate its duplicated chromosomes between the two daughter cells. Errors in the function or regulation of chromosome segregation can produce less viable cells with extraneous chromosomes. Interestingly, extra and unstable chromosomes are often found in cancer cells but it is unknown if genome damage created by these segregation errors can promote cancer formation or growth. To understand the impact of these abnormal genomes in cancer and other disease progression it is essential to determine how chromosome segregation occurs under normal conditions and the steps at which this process can malfunction to produce damaged genomes. The kinetochore is a ~100 component molecular machine that connects microtubule ends to chromosomes and harnesses the power of depolymerizing microtubules to segregate chromosomes. Importantly, kinetochores must maintain their connection to chromosomes and microtubule ends while under high tension. Weakening kinetochore microtubule connections can halt cell division or promote incorrect chromosome segregation. While the kinetochore components that bind microtubules are mostly determined, it is still unknown how these components coordinate to bear the forces necessary to regulate and perform chromosome segregation. For this proposal, I will use purified components to reconstruct the minimal human kinetochore microtubule interface at its native attachment strength. I will accomplish this by testing the load-bearing strength of different combinations of purified kinetochore components at microtubule ends. Additionally, I will test if multiple copies of the binding components strengthen microtubule attachment by assembling into a specific geometry or increasing the number of binding interactions. Attachment strength will be measured using an optical trap to precisely manipulate and measure the forces experienced by the kinetochore components bound to microtubule ends. My reconstitution of the kinetochore microtubule attachment interface will establish a minimal system by which to test the role of load-bearing strength in the function and regulation of cell division. Importantly, this reconstituted system provides a means by which to examine native kinetochore microtubule attachments in a highly controllable environment outside of cells. Increasing the complexity of this system by introducing regulatory signaling molecules will test how microtubule kinetochore attachments control the progression of cell division. Identification of error-prone interactions within the regulatory pathways of chromosome segregation will promote the development of novel experiments into the role of cell division errors in cancer and other diseases. Understanding how significant aberrant genomes form is important to improving our identification, prevention and treatment of damaged genome diseases, such as cancer."
"9251282","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through a series of recent studies with gold nanoparticles (GNPs), the current research team has shown that x-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT), traditionally a synchrotron-based imaging modality, can be performed on a benchtop setting for small-animal-sized objects using an ordinary diagnostic energy range polychromatic x-ray source. Consequently, one can now envision a widespread use of XFCT for biomedical research, especially in light of ever-growing interest in high atomic number (Z > ~50) metal nanoparticles such as GNPs for various cancer diagnostic/therapeutic applications and preclinical testing of such applications using small animal models. Once fully developed, benchtop XFCT will offer a powerful tool to determine the biodistribution of GNPs and other metal NP probes in vivo without cumbersome and time-consuming ex vivo analysis after sacrificing animals. Moreover, it will enable seamless multimodal imaging with micro-CT (µCT) in a single platform, resulting in images showing greater anatomical details while retaining all the benefits from spectroscopic quantitative imaging. Furthermore, when performed with bioconjugated/functionalized GNPs and/or other metal NP probes, benchtop µCT/XFCT will provide an unprecedented multimodal/multiplexed molecular imaging option for more effective drug discovery and development. Despite significant research advances on benchtop XFCT in recent years, however, there are some critical technical challenges that must be overcome to realize these possibilities. Thus, this project brings together a team of experts from Brookhaven National Laboratory, University of Massachusetts Medical School, and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to surmount the key technical hurdles that prevent the envisioned benchtop µCT/XFCT system from being used routinely for in vivo imaging under realistic constraints. The following three specific aims will be pursued to achieve the goal of this project: (1) Design and optimization of a benchtop µCT/XFCT system; (2) Development of novel high energy-resolution solid state array detectors for benchtop XFCT; (3) Investigation of multimodal/multiplexed molecular imaging capability of a benchtop µCT/XFCT system. Upon successful completion, a practical benchtop µCT/XFCT system will become ready for routine preclinical molecular imaging studies and further improvements. A fully-developed benchtop µCT/XFCT system will offer novel imaging options that can considerably improve the efficacy of preclinical testing of NP- based diagnostic/therapeutic strategies, thereby increasing the likelihood of bringing paradigm-shifting advancements in cancer nanomedicine. A novel high energy-resolution detector system developed from this project will also offer new opportunities for a wide range of quantitative x-ray imaging applications beyond benchtop XFCT."
"9263413","Project Summary Richter's transformation (RT) is an aggressive and incurable diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that clonally evolves from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most prevalent leukemia in adults. Patients who develop RT have few treatment options and face a grim prognosis of only 6-8 months despite aggressive multimodal therapy. Importantly, RT has become the most common type of disease progression observed in CLL patients receiving targeted therapies such as the BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib and the Bcl-2 inhibitor Venetoclax (ABT-199). As the use of these agents continues to grow, emergence of resistance and progression to RT are of increasing clinical concern. Recent data suggests that RT is a biologically and clinically distinct disease entity from CLL and DLBCL. Because of this, well-defined risk factors for CLL cannot be applied to predict which patients will develop RT, indicating clear, unmet needs to identify epigenomic lesions predictive of patients at the highest risk for transformation and to bring forward novel treatment options with real curative potential for this fatal complication. Clonal evolution is considered a key feature of cancer progression and relapse. About 80-90% of RT cases arise from the underlying CLL clone although the mechanisms driving RT are poorly understood. Currently no driver mutations have been identified leading to the hypothesis that acquired epigenetic lesions may favor the emergence of the more aggressive RT clone. Approximately 50% of RT tumors display epigenetic changes affecting cMYC over-expression and P53 inactivation, suggesting these pathways may play a major role in the pathogenesis of RT. BRD4 and PRMT5 are epigenetic modifiers essential for P53 and c-MYC activity that we have shown to have transforming potential in several lymphoma models. In contrast to CLL patients who do not develop RT, our preliminary data show that PRMT5 is abundantly over-expressed in CLL tumor cells months to years prior the development of RT. Novel targets of both PRMT5 and BRD4 regulation have not been characterized in CLL/RT. Our preliminary data supports the existence of a BRD4-PRMT5-MYC/P53 feed- forward loop that drives the malignant phenotype of RT and represents an ideal driver axis to deliver targeted therapy. This proposal will utilize a highly novel, integrated epigenomic approach to mechanistically address how BRD4 and PRMT5 contribute toward global epigenetic changes favoring the emergence of the RT clone. If successful our experiments will identify unique epigenomic disease associated with risk of RT. Additionally, the use of innovative, spontaneous, immune competent murine models of RT we have generated coupled with novel, first-in-class agents that selectively target BRD4 and PRMT5 place us in a unique position to make a significant impact for patients with this disease by developing preventive and therapeutic approaches that can be translated into the clinic."

"9393784","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this K25 Mentored Career Development Award is to facilitate the candidate's career transition from a biostatistician to an HIV prevention scientist dedicated to promoting HIV preventive behaviors in at-risk populations. We now have efficacious biomedical interventions for combined HIV prevention (e.g. male circumcision, treatment as prevention and PrEP). However, the impact of these strategies on the epidemic is contingent on behaviors including acceptance, adherence/retention and prevention of risk compensation. My long-term goal is to conduct independent social epidemiologic research to identify and interpret individual and societal factors influencing HIV preventive behaviors, to develop statistical methods to address the analytic challenges encountered in such research, and provide leadership in the design, implementation and evaluation of interventions to promote health seeking behaviors for HIV prevention. The training and mentorship through this K25 will allow me to become well grounded in the theoretical and methodological frameworks that underlie behavioral HIV preventive interventions. Building on the mentoring expertise at the Johns Hopkins University and the research infrastructure of the Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) in Uganda, the proposed mentored research seeks to identify and interpret multilevel predictors for medical male circumcision (MMC) uptake in Rakai. MMC is an important HIV prevention strategy for sub-Saharan Africa (S-SA), and its long-term population impact on the HIV epidemic depends on the pace of uptake and level of coverage in men. RHSP conducts annual HIV/STI, health and behavioral surveillance in consenting residents aged 15-49 in 50 communities through the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS),and since 2007 has provided free MMC services in Rakai District. However, despite wide dissemination of information on the health benefits of MMC and free service provision, uptake in RCCS communities remains suboptimal (35% coverage among non-Muslim men in 2013). Research on determinants of MMC uptake is urgently needed for demand creation and targeted service provision. Using RCCS data, this study will identify individual sociodemographic, behavioral and psychosocial predictors of MMC acceptance; and by adding a new survey module to the RCCS 2015 surveys, the study will identify interpersonal and community level predictors of MMC uptake. Additionally, qualitative in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with men will be conducted to elucidate reasons why certain men do or do not accept MC. The quantitative evidence, augmented by the qualitative observations, will serve as the basis for an R21/01 to develop targeted strategies to increase MMC uptake and enhance the population level impact of MMC. Combining with the candidate's existing quantitative skills, the training in behavioral science theories and introduction to qualitative methods will help the candidate to establish an independent career in promoting health behaviors associated with a broad range of HIV preventive interventions (e.g. MMC, ART, pre-ART HIV care, PrEP and PMTCT)."
"9404585","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circulating markers from blood represents an exciting in vitro diagnostic scenario because of the minimally invasive nature of securing these markers and the plethora of marker types found in blood, such as biological cells, cell-free molecules (proteins and cell-free DNA) and vesicles (nanometer assemblies such as exosomes). Unfortunately, many of these blood-borne markers have not been effectively utilized in clinical practice to manage challenging diseases such as cancer, infectious diseases and stroke to name a few. This deficiency has arisen primarily from the fact that disease-associated blood markers are a vast minority in a mixed population making them difficult to find and analyze due to the lack of efficient platforms for their isolation and systems that can determine the molecular  structural variations they may harbor. To address this pressing need, a new Biotechnology Resource Center is proposed (CBM2), which consists of a highly accomplished and multidisciplinary team that will generate innovative systems for the selection of circulating markers from whole blood and process disease-specific molecular signatures. The envisioned system takes advantage of multiple length scales (mm-to-nm) to affect unique processing capabilities offered by the system. The system will process whole blood (=1 mL) and concentrate clinically relevant markers to nL volumes (>106 enrichment factor) and search for a variety of sequence variations from both DNA and RNA molecules using a solid-phase ligase detection reaction (spLDR) carried out on millions of polymer pillars fabricated in a single step using replication-based technologies.  spLDR products are electrokinetically swept into nanometer flight tubes with their identification based on molecular-dependent electrophoretic mobilities; single-molecule processing will be carried out using nanometer flight tubes with detection performed non-optically. The system will provide the ability to select all clinically relevant markers (cells, cell-free DNA and exosomes) from a single blood draw and secure pertinent information from those markers in a fully automated fashion to allow transitioning the platform into clinical practice. The research will be facilitated by extensive infrastructure alreay in place and an aggressive Collaborative and Service Project Center portfolio. Novel technology dissemination and training to the biomedical community will be facilitated through compelling workshops offered by CBM2 and the members' extensive networks."
"9379684","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I system is critical for all phases of human development, growth, and maturation. While it is well established that IGF-1 production is highly dependent on growth hormone (GH) during postnatal life, mechanisms of regulation are still poorly understood, as reflected by the 1-2% children who drop below the normal growth curves, many of whom respond poorly to GH (including therapeutic GH) and are IGF-1 deficient. GH regulates the production of IGF-1 primarily through activation of the GH receptor (GHR) signaling cascades. The identification of rare mutations of STAT5B (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5B) in children who resembled patients carrying GHR defects, with severe postnatal growth failure, GH insensitivity (GHI) and severe IGF deficiency (IGFD), confirmed the critical importance of STAT5b, over that of the STAT1, 3 and 5a signaling pathways, in IGF-1 production and human growth. Patients with STAT5b deficiency, moreover, also presented with histories of immune dysregulation, indicating the importance of STAT5b in many cytokine systems. These clinical presentations of a STAT5b deficiency state are unique to humans. Of note, the presence of the closely related STAT5a (which shares >90% similarity with STAT5b at the protein level) could not compensate for human loss of STAT5b functions, thereby providing the first compelling in vivo evidence for human STAT5b and STAT5a as having distinct and non-redundant functions despite their high degree of identity.  The hypothesis of this proposal, based on clinical observations, is that GH regulation of IGF-1 production in humans is mediated predominantly, if not exclusively, through STAT5b. This proposal will address how STAT5b transduces GH signals to regulate IGF-1 production by investigating molecular mechanisms of STAT5b actions, from structure/function to cell signaling, and their relationship to clinical endocrinology and immunology, using identified mutations as human functional knockouts. The Specific Aims will (1) decipher the specificity of human GHR-STAT5b structural interactions, the critical first step in regulating IGF-1 production; (2) delineate STAT5b properties necessary for IGF-1 production from those necessary for immune functions; (3) determine whether cross talk with other cytokine signaling pathways modulate STAT5b- dependent activation IGF-1 production. Humanized mouse model can then be generated to recapitulate the human STAT5b deficiency condition. Exome sequence analysis of unresolved clinical cases of severe IGFD with immune deficiencies has revealed potential new mechanisms of modulating STAT5b actions. At the conclusion of these studies, this proposal will have identified and confirmed the mechanism(s) for specificity of GHR-STAT5b interactions, identified new mechanism(s) for modulating STAT5b activation and regulation of IGF-1 production, and identified new targets for analyzing GHI and IGFD syndromes. In the long term, these results will provide the basis for improved diagnosis and therapy management of affected children."

"9207591","HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES PROGRAM (Project-265) ABSTRACT Overview and Goals: Hematologic malignancies represent some of the most aggressive forms of cancer, and in many cases, current therapeutic options are very limited. Thus, the goal of the new Hematologic Malignancies (HEME) Program, which was formally established in early 2015, is to define key biological features of leukemia and related blood cancers and translate these into improved therapeutics. HEME was formed in 2015 based on the vision of the UCCC leadership with concurrence of our EAB and leverages the enormous growth in the hematologic malignancies community at AMC over the last 5 years. The major scientific strengths in HEME focus on the epigenetic regulation of cellular processes, key molecular events occurring as normal cells transition to malignant states, metabolic processes that define tumor-specific properties, and characterizing malignant stem cells. Research Highlight: Recently members discovered that germline mutations in ETV6 are associated with thrombocytopenia, red cell macrocytosis and predisposition to lymphoblastic leukemia opening up novel avenues for prevention and assessment of cancer predisposition risk in such patients (Nat Genet, 20151). Program Activities: To accomplish this goal, HEME co-leaders employ resources provided by the CCSG to orchestrate intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations through organization of annual retreats and periodic technology forums, and routine chaperoning of transdisciplinary collaborations. Program members utilize Shared Resources (SR) for preclinical mouse models and employ patient-derived specimens and tumor models as a means to evaluate candidate therapies. In addition, work across the consortium with CSU/FACC on spontaneous disease models in companion animals complements an extensive adult and pediatric human clinical trials portfolio at that seeks to advance multiple targeted therapies across all ages. Members: The HEME program is comprised of 24 Full and 11 Associate members with 65 grants and $1.4M NCI and $1.3M other peer-reviewed cancer research grant funding in 2015. The group of multidisciplinary investigators includes the entire spectrum of pediatric and adult blood cancer research groups across the UCCC consortium. 86% of members (30) are located in 10 clinical and basic science departments at UCD and CSU; and the remainder are at non-consortium institutions. From program inception (7/2014) the group produced 77 cancer-focused publications, of which 32% were inter- and 13% intra-programmatic. Future Directions: We expect the HEME program to expand substantially. Ongoing recruitment efforts include clinical research leadership roles in immunotherapy, pediatric BMT, myeloma, and expertise in adolescent young adult (AYA) populations. In addition, growth in immunology, pharmacology and molecular biology is expected to further strengthen our basic science efforts. For this dynamic program, we will focus on supporting interdisciplinary and translational studies, collaborative projects, training and mentoring of junior investigators, and the development of key resources required for laboratory and clinical research."
"9209579","PROJECT 3: RODENT STUDIES OF ANESTHETIC ACTION General anesthesia is a fascinating man-made, neurophysiological phenomenon that has been developed empirically over many years to enable safe and humane performance of surgical and non-surgical procedures. Specifically it is a drug-induced condition consisting of unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia and immobility, along with physiological stability. General anesthesia is administered daily to 60,000 patients in the United States, the mechanisms for how anesthetics act in the brain to create the states of anesthesia are not well understood. Significant progress has been made recently in characterizing the molecular sites that anesthetics target. However, how actions at specific molecular targets lead to the behavioral states is less well understood. Addressing this issue requires a systems neuroscience approach to define how actions of the drugs at specific molecular targets and neural circuits lead to a behavioral state of general anesthesia. In this program project entitled, Integrated Systems Neuroscience Studies of Anesthesia, we will develop an integrated systems neuroscience program consisting of human, non-human primate, rodent and modeling studies of four anesthetics: the GABAA agents, propofol and sevoflurane; the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine; and the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine. The program project will also include a DATA ANALYSIS CORE, which will provide assistant with data analysis and conduct research on statistical methods. The Specific Aims are to understand how the actions of the anesthetics at specific molecular targets and neural circuits produce the oscillatory dynamics (EEG rhythms, changes in LFPs and neural spiking activity) that are likely a primary common mechanism through which anesthetics create altered states of arousal (sedation, hallucination, unconsciousness). In our rodent studies we will use multi-electrode arrays to record multiple single unit activity and local field potentials from two or more sites in the frontal cortex, thalamus, parietal cortex, while unconsciousness is induced by systematically controlling anesthetic dosing. The dosing will be systematically decreased to allow the animal to recover consciousness. The animals will be trained to execute a continually administered cognitive visual task so we track the changes in its arousal state. We will characterize the altered states of arousal induced by each anesthetic by relating the dynamics of the neurophysiological changes to the changes in behavior. The rodent studies will allow simultaneous recording from multiple brain areas to gain a detailed description of how anesthetics alter brain circuit dynamics to produce a specific behavioral state. We will also conduct neural modulation experiments using optogenetics and local pharmacology to understand how changes in specific circuits alter network dynamic and lead to changes in arousal state. These studies will also provide fundamental new knowledge about the neurophysiology of the brain's arousal circuits that will be relevant to problems such as coma, sleep disorders, pain and depression.  "
"9199227","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase I proposal, we plan to develop two technologies to dramatically increase the expression and crystallization of properly folded recombinant membrane proteins from mammalian cell culture. The most common methods to produce high yields of recombinant proteins at low cost rely on bacterial, yeast, or insect-cell expression. However, the proteins produced in these systems are very difficult to purify in native form, and they lack the mammalian glycosylation patterns that are often necessary for proper folding and native activity.  We plan to develop a novel protein fusion partner that enables mammalian expression of proteins that are otherwise nearly impossible to produce. A second technology will add an internal motif to greatly enhance structural stability and facilitate crystallization of the target membrane protein. Together, these technologies have the potential to improve protein yields in mammalian cell culture by over 20-fold and to allow crystallization of proteins that are currently impossible to study."
"9302016","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coxiella burnetii's pathogenicity depends on its ability to grow in a lysosome-derived hostile vacuole within human cells. However, metabolic processes critical to C. burnetii's intracellular growth are largely unknown. This lack of knowledge has prevented both the understanding of its basic biology and pathogenesis, and the development of better therapeutic agents. The long-term goal is to understand the molecular details of Coxiella's distinctive physiology, and to apply this knowledge to developing novel therapeutic strategies. The objective of this application is to identify metabolic pathways that are vital to C. burnetii's intracellular growth. The central hypothesis, which was formulated based on preliminary data, is that C. burnetii evolved from a tick- associated ancestor by acquiring critical metabolic genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). A novel evolutionary genomics approach will be used to identify metabolic pathways that are critical to C. burnetii's intra- cellular growth. The rationale for the proposed research is that once metabolic processes important to C. burnetii's intracellular growth are identified, pharmacological agents that block these pathways could be developed to treat chronic infections more effectively. The objective of this project will be accomplished by three specific aims: (1) Identify metabolic pathways that distinguish C. burnetii from tick-associated Coxiella. The working hypothesis is that genes critical to C. burnetii's intracellular physiology will not be present in avirulent tick- associated Coxiella. The genome of a closely related Coxiella from the tick Ornithodoros rostratus will be sequenced and compared to C. burnetii's genome. (2) Define metabolic pathways that are critical to C. burnetii's intracellular growth. The working hypothesis is that genes acquired via HGT are being maintained in C. burnetii because they are critical to the pathogen's physiology. Phylogenetic approaches will be used to identify HGT-derived genes, and their functions will be validated using RNA-seq and genetic tools. (3) As a proof of principle, determine the importance of heme biosynthesis to C. burnetii's intracellular growth. The working hypothesis is that heme biosynthesis is crucial to Coxiella's growth. Heme production and intracellular growth of heme pathway-deficient strains will be assayed. This study is innovative because it (a) uses a novel approach that overcomes the current limitations in studying Coxiella at a genome-wide scale, and (b) is based on a novel concept that the human pathogen evolved from a tick symbiont via massive HGT. The proposed project is significant because it will (a) uncover metabolic pathways that are critical to the pathogen's intracellular growth, (b) identify new therapeutic targets, for example, HemA and HemL are essential for heme biosynthesis in C. burnetii but are not present in humans cells, (c) provide a model approach for identifying genes involved in host adaptation, which could be applied broadly to other pathogens such as Francisella and Rickettsia spp. where avirulent tick symbionts could be compared to virulent human-specialized strains."
"9212176","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This T-32 Training application is to competitively renew the current T32 pulmonary training program, anchored within the Indiana University School of Medicine, the only medical school in the state of Indiana. The proposed program builds on the success of the current training award, being multidisciplinary, highly collaborative, and including established investigators and highly qualified and dedicated mentors. We will continue to expose trainees to classical elements of basic and clinical-translational research, to which we incorporated novel technologies and a robust component of regenerative medicine, building on our local strengths. New in this application is a partnership with Pediatric Pulmonology at IU, fueled by the realization that adult lung diseases start in childhood or even prenatally, and by the strong history of cross training our fellows in research. Given the success and growth of our program, we are also proposing an increase in the number of trainees, adding one predoctoral and one postdoctoral spot to the three postdoctoral positions from the current program. The addition of one predoctoral position will also allow us to more efficiently to recruit future leaders of pulmonary and critical care medicine at an early stage. Finally, we propose to offer to interested postdocs a track for training in life science entrepreneurship, as an alternatie but yet important science career track. The ultimate goal is for us to train investigators that wil accelerate the advancements in lung research and close the gaps in knowledge that prevented for so many decades the development of phenotypic characterization, effective preventive intervention, and disease-modifying or even curative druts for most patients with lung disease. We maintain the strong commitment to training underrepresented minority talent and by a strong oversight from leaders in the field."

"9207130","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9232554","Project Summary/Abstract Title: Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Microbiota and Persistent Human Papillomavirus Detection Abstract: In the US, there are about 7 million new genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infections with high-risk oncogenic HPV types each year. About 10% of these, or 700,000 are persistent; this is an important risk factor for cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical cancer. The dynamics of HPV infection and the subsequent development of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are not well understood. The proposed study will characterize the temporal relationship of vaginal microbiota associated with Metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV). It will also examine whether Metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic BV is associated with detection of oncogenic HPV and persistence of oncogenic HPV infections. The proposed pilot study will utilize existing vaginal swabs from 80 women followed over six months from the BRAVO study, a randomized controlled open labeled clinical trial examining Metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic BV. The vaginal microbiome will be characterized using high throughput 16s rRNA encoding gene pyrosequencing. The proposed research fits with priorities of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). NCI has prioritized racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence and mortality of certain cancers and prevention or early detection of these cancers in specific populations and NIAID has set ?screening, diagnosis and interventions for target populations to determine how to triage various groups for appropriate prevention, treatment and education strategies? as an overarching priority. There are also compelling public health reasons for supporting this application: In spite of the availability of prophylactic HPV vaccination, there are still more than 528,000 new cases and 266,000 deaths worldwide from cervical cancer related to persistent HPV infections each year.

"9207127","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sensory systems process incoming information via multiple, parallel pathways that break the complex representation of the external environment into distinct processing streams. These parallel pathways encode a subset of stimulus features and contribute to specific aspects of a unified sensory percept - for example, motion and form in vision. While well-described and recognized as fundamental to sensory processing in other modalities such as vision, parallel pathways in the olfactory system remain poorly understood. This project will characterize for the first time how outputs from the olfactory bulb - the first synaptic level of processing in the olfactory system - differ in their representation of odor information as a function of their projection target. The project uses recently-developed optical, genetic and molecular tools to enable recording activity from individual olfactory bulb output neurons tagged according to their axonal projection to specific regions of primary olfactory cortex. To accomplish this, genetically-encoded Ca2+ reporter proteins (GCaMP) or light-activated channels (ChR2) will be expressed in olfactory bulb projection neurons using a viral vector driving Cre-recombinase dependent expression of the transgene and a mouse line expressing Cre-recombinase selectively in mitral and tufted cells of the olfactory bulb. The experiments take advantage of the fact - newly established by our laboratory - that these neurons can be infected through their axons, allowing expression in only those neurons projecting to specific areas of olfactory cortex. Odor responses in such target-defined neurons will then be recorded with in vivo imaging or with electrophysiology in both anesthetized and awake mice. All aspects of this methodology have recently been developed and work robustly in our laboratory. Using this approach we will ask how neurons projecting to distinct olfactory cortical areas differ with respect to their odorant- evoked response properties and their degree of modulation in the awake, behaving animal. The experiments will address important questions regarding the nature of olfactory processing streams that emerge from the olfactory bulb: Do projections to different cortical targets carry distinct representations of sensory information - a occurs, for example, in the parallel representations of motion and form in the visual system? If so, what is the nature of these differences in the context of odor coding and odor perception? In addition, do the different classes of olfactory bulb output neurons - classically identified by ther dendritic morphology and somatic location - map to distinct anatomical pathways according to their cortical targets or to distinct functional coding streams according to their odor response properties? Together the proposed experiments should lead to a significant advance in understanding parallel olfactory processing streams in a functional and behavioral context."
"9212812","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, is a neurodegenerative disease often associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and characterized by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) leading to visual loss. Among the various types of cell death associated with neuropathologies, the major cellular pathways underlying apoptosis and necrosis have been well characterized. However, in addition to these intrinsic mechanisms underlying primary cell death, intercellular communication via gap junctions (GJs) appear to play a major, yet poorly understand, role in secondary or `bystander' cell death. GJs, proteins that form cytoplasmic bridges between neighboring cells, act as conduits by which toxic materials are passed from dying cells to their neighbors leading to their death. Studies in CNS suggest that progressive secondary cell death mediated by GJs may, in fact, account for the majority of cell death associated with a number of insults, including ischemia, excitotoxicity, and trauma. Consistent with these findings, our preliminary data in retina show that blockade or ablation of GJs can significantly reduce the loss of RGCs and amacrine cells (ACs) in experimental glaucoma. We therefore posit that GJ-mediated secondary cell death is a crucial mechanistic element of glaucomatous injury, resulting in the majority of RGC and amacrine cell (AC) loss, and thereby offers a novel target for neuroprotective treatment. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use mouse models of experimental glaucoma to show directly that pharmacological blockade of GJs or genetic ablation of their constituent connexin subunits results in a significant reduction in in the loss o RGCs and the ACs to which they are coupled. Different GJs, based on the composition of their connexins, can have selective permeabilities, suggesting that the makeup of a GJ may determine whether it promotes cell death following injury. We will therefore use knockout mice in which selective connexins are ablated to determine which GJ cohorts support cell loss in glaucoma and should thus be targeted to promote neuroprotection. Finally, we will carry out electrophysiological and behavioral experiments to assess whether increasing RGC and AC survivability in glaucoma by blocking GJs results in preservation of visual function. In these experiments, we will record the electroretinogram (ERG), and use patch-clamp and microelectrode array recording techniques to assess retinal function. We will also record visual evoked potentials (VEP) and measure the optokinetic response (OKR) to assess central visual function. The results of this study should elucidate a new and important mechanism of RGC degeneration associated with glaucoma and, in so doing, reveal a novel target for neuroprotective treatment. While the proposed work will be directed at glaucoma, the therapeutic strategies that emerge should be applicable to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases seen in other parts of the CNS."

"9223661","Project 2. Expansion of clinical research capacity at Kenema Government Hospital  Lassa virus (LASV), a member of the family Arenaviridae, is the etiologic agent of Lassa fever (LF), a severe  and often fatal hemorrhagic illness. It has been reported throughout West Africa from Guinea in the west to  Nigeria in the east. Humans contract LASV primarily via direct or indirect contact with body fluids of rodents of  the genus Mastomys, the natural reservoir. Nosocomial transmission can lead to large hospital outbreaks. The  possibility of aerosol transmission and the lack of a vaccine have led to its classification as a BSL-4 and  Category A Select Agent. Previous studies performed in the 1980's estimated up to 300,000 human LASV  infections per year with 5,000 deaths per year. However, the natural history and mortality rate of disease  remain poorly defined. Since these landmark studies were performed, significant advances have been made in  LF clinical diagnostics as well as the laboratory capacity in endemic areas. Using newly developed Ag, IgG and  IgM recombinant ELISAs (rELISA) and improved capacity at the site, we are now able to accurately study  viremia and the immune response. This proposal will test the hypothesis: Development of IgM, but not a  cellular inflammatory response, and decline in viremia during the early stages of symptomatic LF disease  decreases mortality.  Aim 1 is too identify clinical and virological determinants of Lassa fever outcome in a cohort of symptomatic  Lassa fever patients presenting to Kenema Government Hospital. Previous studies have identified several  clinical features and clinical laboratory parameters that predict a poor prognosis. However, no study has  determined if degree of viremia correlates with clinical features or laboratory test abnormalities. We will test the  hypothesis: Prolonged viremia correlates with disease progression and increased mortality. We will identify  clinical and laboratory diagnostic and prognostic risk factors for LF and correlate them with viremia and risk of  mortality. This aim will establish the natural history of LF disease and determine if the time course can be  divided into distinct stages as previously suggested. Aim 2 is to identify biomarkers of infection and mortality.  Recent development of rLASV IgM and IgG ELISAs as well as increased capacity at the KGH Lassa Fever  Laboratory provide a unique opportunity to identify specific immune correlates with disease severity and risk of  mortality. We will test the hypothesis: Delayed development of the humoral and an increased TH1  inflammatory immune response correlates with increased mortality. We will correlate specific humoral and  cytokine profiles with disease progression and outcome. These studies are critical for the design of future  interventional trials and the development of therapies for LF and other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Aim 3 will  initiate Clinical trial capacity training. Over the past decade, a significant amount has been learned about the  pathogenesis of LF and the human immune response. Trials are now needed to test existing and novel  therapies for this disease. The objective of this aim is to build on previously funded capacity at the site and  train critical team members in the essential elements needed to conduct clinical trials. This training is critical if  the KGH site is to continue to contribute to our knowledge of and management strategies for VHFs."
"9310995","Abstract Gap junction (GJ)-mediated electrical synapses were recently reported to underlie important network properties in the dorsal cochlear nucleus and anatomical evidence suggests they are widespread along the auditory pathway. However, the properties of auditory electrical synapses remain poorly understood. As their chemical counterparts, electrical synapses are ?plastic?, that is, they modify their strength with activity. Changes in the strength of electrical synapses dynamically reconfigure neuronal circuits in various neural structures. Thus, the presence and plastic properties of electrical synapses could fundamentally change the way we understand the organization of auditory circuits and, ultimately, the processing of auditory information. This proposal aims to contribute to our understanding of electrical transmission in the auditory system by investigating the molecular mechanisms causing plastic changes in GJ communication at mixed, electrical and chemical, contacts that couple primary auditory afferents to the Mauthner (M-) cells in fish. Our work in goldfish shows that electrical (and chemical) transmission at these mixed synapses undergo activity-dependent potentiation. Because these dynamic properties were later found to occur at mammalian electrical synapses. M-cell mixed synapses are considered a valuable model to study plasticity of vertebrate electrical transmission. In contrast to chemical synapses, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie changes in the strength of electrical synapses. It is currently thought that plastic changes in GJ conductance are due to direct modification of the properties of already existing channels. However, our progress suggests that regulated insertion and removal of GJ channels may also contribute to plasticity. We propose to investigate the contribution of regulated trafficking of GJ channels to plastic changes of electrical transmission and its molecular underpinnings. To directly examine this possibility, we will take these unique model mixed synapses to a new level of analysis by investigating their properties in larval zebrafish. The amenability of zebrafish larvae to image the movement of fluorescently-tagged GJ channels in-vivo should allow monitoring of active synapses undergoing plasticity. This approach will provide an unprecedented window for the analysis of electrical transmission at which detailed molecular mechanisms will be investigated by combining in-vivo imaging, electrophysiology and time-resolved ultrastructural analysis with powerful genetic manipulations. Aim 1 is to investigate the conditions under which electrical synapses in larval zebrafish undergo potentiation. By combining electrophysiology and pharmacology with electrical and optogenetic stimulation, this aim will identify the conditions under which larval mixed synapses undergo potentiation of electrical (and chemical) transmission. Aim 2 is to test whether insertion and removal of GJ channels are required for plastic changes. This aim will explore the notion that electrical synapses are complex synaptic structures at which channels turnover and that their proper function and regulation results from interactions between multiple proteins. The description of novel molecular mechanisms involved in their regulation will contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of circuits relevant to auditory dysfunction and the potential identification of novel therapeutic targets."

Core A provides central administration of the Program Project Grant activities, which serves to enhance scientific interactions, resource sharing, collaborative interactions, and compliance requirements for all participants of this Program Project grant. The ultimate goal of Core A is to enhance Project efficiency and scientific output. RELEVANCE CHDs resulting in ventricle phenotypes have the poorest clinical outcomes. Thus, gaining an understanding of the etiology and molecular mechanisms that cause CHDs resulting in altered ventricular morphogenesis has the potential to benefit thousands of pediatric patients annually."
"9059663","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposed CTDD program will help translate the enormous resource of high- throughput cancer genome characterizations into functionally validated, cancer-genotype based therapeutic targets. Over the past several years, members of this project have developed powerful tools and strategies for functionally annotating cancer genomes. These have enabled the identification and validation over fifty cancer genes, several of which are compelling therapeutic targets. Here, we propose to synthesize and optimize those strategies into a unified blueprint that can be applied across many tumor types. At the core of our philosophy is the use of powerful computational tools to narrow the extent of the genome that must be surveyed functionally. This enables the use of more precise human and mouse models to assess drivers and dependencies and approaches to combinatorial interactions that could not be carried out on a genome wide scale. We will apply these tools to select cancer types and gene sets in order to identify new oncogenic drivers, genotype-specific cancer dependencies, and to test strategies for the systematic identification of targets for combination therapies. We envision the impact of our project not only as the identification of genomically informed targets for several tumor types but also as providing tools and strategies that can be used throughout the consortium and the community."
"9209578","PROJECT 2: NON-HUMAN PRIMATE STUDIES OF ANESTHETIC ACTION General anesthesia is a fascinating man-made, neurophysiological phenomenon that has been developed empirically over many years to enable safe and humane performance of surgical and non-surgical procedures. Specifically it is a drug-induced condition consisting of unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia and immobility, along with physiological stability. General anesthesia is administered daily to 60,000 patients in the United States, the mechanisms for how anesthetics act in the brain to create the states of anesthesia are not well understood. Significant progress has been made recently in characterizing the molecular sites that anesthetics target. However, how actions at specific molecular targets lead to the behavioral states is less well understood. Addressing this issue requires a systems neuroscience approach to define how actions of the drugs at specific molecular targets and neural circuits lead to a behavioral state of general anesthesia. In this program project entitled, Integrated Systems Neuroscience Studies of Anesthesia, we will develop an integrated systems neuroscience program consisting of human, non-human primate, rodent and modeling studies of four anesthetics: the GABAA agents, propofol and sevoflurane; the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine; and the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine. The program project will also include a DATA ANALYSIS CORE, which will provide assistant with data analysis and conduct research on statistical methods. The Specific Aims are to understand how the actions of the anesthetics at specific molecular targets and neural circuits produce the oscillatory dynamics (EEG rhythms, changes in LFPs and neural spiking activity) that are likely a primary common mechanism through which anesthetics create altered states of arousal (sedation, hallucination, unconsciousness). In our primate studies we will record brain activity using multi-electrode arrays designed to target at least two brain regions simultaneously and record multiple single unit activity and local field potentials. We will record from paired sites in the, frontal cortex, thalamus, and parietal cortex while unconsciousness is induced by systematically controlling the anesthetic dosing. The dosing of the anesthetic will be systematically decreased to allow the animal to recover consciousness. The animals will be trained to execute a continually administered behavioral task so we track the changes in the animal's arousal state. We will characterize the altered states of arousal induced by each anesthetic by relating the dynamics of the neurophysiological changes to the changes in behavior. The primate studies will play a particularly crucial role in the research to be conducted in the program project. They will allow us to relate for each anesthetic neural activity in relevant brain regions to the concomitant changes in behavior the drug induces. These studies will also provide fundamental new knowledge about the neurophysiology of the brain's arousal circuits that will be relevant to problems such as coma, sleep disorders, pain and depression.  "
"9239972","Abstract Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and its clinically most devastating presentation, alcoholic hepatitis, is a result of cumulative biological events such as leaky gut, hepatocyte damage and inflammation that collectively contribute to the severity of liver damage. Our studies delineated a unique role for interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in alcohol-related inflammation and hepatocyte damage. We reported that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adapter, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), is required for IRF3 phosphorylation and that IRF3 induces mitochondrial apoptosis in hepatocytes. Preliminary data shows that both alcohol binge or chronic alcohol increase circulating bacterial 16S DNA and mitochondrial DNA levels in mice and humans. These double stranded DNAs are ligands for the cyclic GMP-AMP kinase (cGAS) that produces 2?3?-cGAMP (cGAMP) that can activate STING to trigger IRF3 activation and Type I IFN production. We postulate that STING activation is at the crossroads of alcohol-induced liver pathology and in addition to ER stress, STING is also activated via cGAS-cGAMP in ALD. We further hypothesize that cGAS-mediated signals and STING activation represent a trigger for an acute-on-chronic alcohol-induced liver injury often seen in acute alcoholic hepatitis. We proposee that the cGAS-cGAMP-STING activation axis plays a role both in hepatocytes and immune cells in alcoholic hepatitis. We also discovered that sterile danger signals released by damaged hepatocytes activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in immune cells and that disruption of inflammasome activation pathways can ameliorate ALD in mice. We propose that inflammasome activation and ER stress are bi-directionally regulated in ALD. Our Aims are: 1. To investigate the role of the DNA sensor, cGAS, and dsDNA in STING-IRF3 activation in ALD; 2. To delineate the cell-specificity of cGAS and STING activation in ALD in hepatocytes and innate immune cells; 3. To investigate interactions between ER stress, inflammasome activation and STING-IRF3 activation in ALD; 4. To investigate the biological effect and therapeutic benefit of cGAS and STING inhibition on liver damage, steatosis and inflammation in ALD. These experiments will test novel roles of the cGAS-STING innate immune signaling pathways in ALD and identify key signaling molecules, for designing new therapies for ALD.  "
"9258270","Project Summary/Abstract Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a loosely-defined class of RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides, make up a significant fraction of the eukaryotic transcriptome. Thousands of lncRNAs have now been catalogued in numerous species, but relatively few have been functionally characterized, particularly in animal models. Because of the dearth of molecular evidence of lncRNA function and consistently weak signals of lncRNA conservation, the extent of their impact on organismal biology and disease remains unclear; more functional studies in animal models are necessary to fully understand lncRNA biology. The long term objective of this proposal is to investigate lncRNA functions in the key developmental process of oogenesis in a classic animal model: Drosophila melanogaster. The genetics and development of Drosophila oogenesis are well characterized, facilitating investigations of how lncRNAs may impact specific developmental processes and interact with key oogenesis genes. Further, many aspects of oogenesis are shared across all animals, and thus insights into lncRNA biology from Drosophila will be informative for human biology. This proposal has three specific aims. First, the localization of ovary-enriched lncRNAs will be characterized in oogenesis. Analyses of existing ovary RNA-Seq datasets in Drosophila have identified a set of 28 antisense and intergenic lncRNA loci that are enriched in the ovaries and likely conserved in multiple Drosophila species, suggesting functional importance. The cellular and intracellular localization of these lncRNAs throughout oogenesis will be determined using single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH). Second, oogenic phenotypes will be characterized for lncRNA mutants. Standard mutational approaches like targeted gene deletion are often insufficient for investigating lncRNA function, as overlapping DNA regulatory elements are common and can confound interpretations. Instead, this proposal aims to develop and implement mutational approaches that specifically target the lncRNA transcript. Third, the mechanisms of lncRNA function will be characterized. Comparative RNA-Seq experiments between lncRNA mutants and wild-type flies will reveal specific regulatory targets of lncRNAs and whether the lncRNAs function in cis or in trans. RNA/DNA double-FISH will be used to confirm regulatory interactions of lncRNAs and their targets, and treatment with an RNA polymerase II inhibitor followed with smFISH will reveal whether lncRNA activity is due to the RNA product or nascent RNA transcription itself. The successful completion of this proposal will provide significant insights into lncRNA biology. As many lncRNAs are also associated with diseases like cardiovascular disease and cancer, knowledge gained from Drosophila will prove valuable to understanding how lncRNAs contribute to human disease."
"9148674","PROJECT SUMMARY DNA crosslinks, including interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are forms of DNA damage that arise continuously in DNA from endogenous and natural sources. They must be removed in order to allow accurate genome duplication and gene expression. Despite the importance of crosslinks in cancer etiology and treatment, mechanisms of DNA crosslink repair are known only in outline, and many steps are simply assumed. Project 1 is concerned with the biochemistry of key steps at the heart of the mechanism of ICL repair. When DNA replication fork stalling occurs at an ICL, a frequent outcome is processing by structure- specific DNA nucleases to unhook the crosslink. ERCC1-XPF is implicated as a key enzyme for ICL unhooking. Major unknowns include the nature of the substrates that are cut, and the roles of other components that are involved in ICL unhooking. ERCC1-XPF interacts with SLX4-SLX4IP, MSH2-MSH3, and RPA and is stimulated by these components, but their roles are not understood. In Aim 1, research will define conditions under which ERCC1-XPF efficiently cleaves an ICL fork structure in concert with a protein complex containing SLX4, MSH2-MSH3, and DNA binding proteins. The mechanism of another critical step, the bypass of the unhooked ICL, will be assessed in Aim 2. Major unknowns are whether the pol ? holoenzyme can fully bypass an unhooked ICL, if all subunits are necessary, and whether an additional DNA polymerase is required. The contribution of other DNA polymerases to ICL processing will be assessed systematically in defined cellular assays. We will determine whether single-stranded DNA binding proteins including HMGB1/2/3 promote bypass. We will biochemically determine subunits and activities required for unhooked ICL bypass using a newly developed expression and purification system for pol ?. Bypass of differently sized DNA-peptide crosslinks will be examined with the same group of DNA polymerases. We will also examine the mechanism of recruitment of pol ? to crosslinked damaged DNA by newly discovered interfaces with nuclease components. The Central Hypothesis of Project 1 is that is that many under-studied protein factors that have major influences on ICL cleavage and in bypass of crosslinked structures. These studies will address overall Program Project Goals defining Pathways of crosslink repair, new Components, and repair of DNA-Protein crosslinks.  "
"9221293","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasingly, there has been a realization of the importance of accurate assessment of chromatin modifications for both clinical care (for example for cancer detection, prognosis, determining treatment, designing new therapies and predicting response) as well as for understanding carcinogenesis. Currently available approach for identification of specific genome-associated proteins or DNA modifications, the chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, is of limited clinical utility given that it requires time consuming/labor intensive pre-analytical sample preparation, provides low throughput, and is associated with epitope loss (raising concerns about data accuracy/reproducibility). To address some of these issues, we developed the Matrix ChIP, a microplate-based method which accelerates the analytical process, and increases assay's throughput, sensitivity and reproducibility. We now (Aims#1&2) propose to develop next generation microplate based platform, PIXUL-ChIP, which will integrate cancer sample preparation/ chromatin fragmentation with immunoprecipitation. PIXUL-ChIP will provide high throughput, simultaneous, and automated analysis of a wide range of chromatin marks which will allow us to dramatically expand our understanding of the role of chromatin alterations in health and disease. Current approaches to collect and prepare clinical specimens are not optimized for chromatin analysis. To assure the success of the PIXUL-ChIP, in Aim&3 we will develop and validate methods for collection, fixation, storage and ultrasound treatment of human normal and cancer (tissues/fluid) specimens. Specifically we propose:  Aim#1. To build a pixelated ultrasound (PIXUL) processor for fast and high-throughput chromatin fragmentation. We will utilize our recently pioneered ultrasound technology to build a PIXUL microplate processor for cell culture and tissue chromatin fragmentation in 96 well plates.  Aim#2. To combine sample preparation/chromatin with immunoprecipitation into an integrated microplate platform for high throughput epigenetic analysis, PIXUL-ChIP. The ability to shear chromatin in a microplate will streamline sample preparation, immunoprecipitation and ChIP DNA analysis.  Aim#3. Using PIXUL technology we will develop and validate practical cost-effective approaches for sample collection from human cancer tissues and their preparation for analysis of epigenetic alterations. Sample preparation and storage conditions dramatically affect the epitope loss, thus determining how to best collect/process/store biospecimens is of great importance. To this end we will develop protocols for sample collection/ preparation/storage and analysis for snap-frozen fresh and for formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. The user-friendly, high sensitivity/throughput PIXUL-ChIP technology will greatly increase the utility of new and archived cancer biospecimens and will facilitate basic and translational research to exploit epigenetic information from the vastly unexplored human cancer biospecimes."
"9212178","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  My overarching goal is to become an independent investigator in the area of lifestyle interventions for prevention and reduction of cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF) in adults with spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of this application is to augment my previous training in obesity, behavioral science and research design with additional tools necessary to make this transition.  As a behavioral scientist, my research and clinical practice focus on lifestyle interventions for obesity. After completion of my doctorate in Health Education and Promotion, I completed a competitive T-32 fellowship in Comparative Effectiveness Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), with special focus on tailoring lifestyle interventions for specific populations. This training furthered my understanding of adapting interventions for specific needs of special populations and measuring the effectiveness of these interventions using randomized controlled trials and real world clinical trials. Throughout my doctoral and post-doctoral training, I also received clinical training in the UAB Department of Nutrition Sciences. In this clinical role, I learned nutritional and physical activity considerations for treating obesity in a variety of chronic diseases, as well as how to incorporate behavior change strategies to improve adherence to dietary and exercise recommendations. I also had the opportunity to work with individuals with a variety of physical disabilities including SCI. It was during this clinical training that I began to understand the barriers individuals with physical disabilities face in developing healthy dietary and activity routines, and the lack of evidenced-based recommendations for reducing obesity and other CMRF in this population.  To further my training, this career development award (CDA) will focus on three goals. First, I will increase my understanding of the unique disease processes associated with SCI that influence cardiometabolic risk factors after injury. Second, I will augment my current knowledge of psychosocial determinants of obesity with an increased understanding of the unique determinants of behavior change in adults with SCI. Third, I aim to increase my understanding of how to leverage emerging technology to develop novel interventions that can directly address barriers to adherence among adults with SCI. Completion of these training goals, along with the proposed study will put me in a position to apply for R01 level funding by the end of the CDA period.  Despite significant evidence on CMRF and obesity among adults with SCI, there is little evidence on the best methods for addressing these significant health issues. Lifestyle interventions consisting of diet and exercise recommendations along with behavioral strategies to increase adherence to these recommendations, are considered the first line of treatment for weight loss and reduction of CMRF, but little research has explored how to adapt these interventions for adults with SCI. Specifically, dietary adherence continues to be an obstacle to long term weight maintenance, and this may be compounded in adults with SCI given the metabolic, psychosocial and environmental barriers associated with this disability. Reduced carbohydrate (CHO) diets have been found to improve CMRF in non-SCI groups. They have also been associated with decreased hunger and cravings, and improved mood and energy levels, all of which may lead to improved dietary adherence. The purpose of the proposed study is to assess differences in dietary adherence, body composition and insulin, glucose, lipids and hs-CRP between a reduced CHO and standard diet in obese adults with SCI. This study will employ a novel home-based telehealth intervention utilizing an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platform designed specifically for individuals with SCI.  I have developed an excellent mentoring team to guide this CDA. James Rimmer, PhD, will serve as primary mentor.

"9411492","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have enabled low-dose spiral CT to become an effective tool for lung cancer screening. The majority of pulmonary nodules detected on CT, however, are small and difficult to diagnose. While CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (CT-TTNB) has high diagnostic accuracy (70% to 90% depending on nodule size), the risk of complications such as pneumothorax and bleeding is high. Diagnostic confirmation by transbronchial lung biopsy using virtual bronchoscopy or electromagnetic navigation and endoscopic ultrasound is a safer alternative. However, the diagnostic yield is generally 10% to 20% lower than CT-TTNB. Current endoscopic ultrasound is limited by the size of the imaging probe, spatial resolution, and its inability to display blood vessels in the lesion. Furthermore, non-solid lung nodules are not well visualized by ultrasound. Owing to its large size, the ultrasound probe cannot be inserted through a biopsy needle or catheter. In lieu of this, a guide sheath is used to extend the working channel to allow insertion of biopsy forceps after removing the ultrasound probe to take a biopsy without-real time confirmation of the biopsy site. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for safe and accurate biopsy tools that can sample small pulmonary nodules under real-time image guidance.  The goal of this project is to build and evaluate image-guided biopsy tools to address this knowledge gap. In Aim 1, we will develop a small optical coherence tomography (OCT) catheter that combines Doppler OCT with autofluorescence sensitive imaging. We will integrate these AF/OCT imaging catheters with biopsy tools that will enable localization and forward sample collection from lesions perpendicular to the airway as well as with side-collecting transbronchial biopsy tools in the wall of a bronchus parallel to the biopsy probe. Aim 2 is to evaluate, in a swine model, the feasibility and ability of the tools developed in the preceding aim to collect tissue samples with sufficient yield to enable standard and molecular pathology diagnosis and prediction of the biological behavior of malignant lesions."

"9207586","PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (Core-361) ABSTRACT The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) of the University of Colorado Cancer Center (UCCC) is an integral component of the clinical research performed at the UCCC consortium. This component was disapproved in 2011 and subsequently re-engineered by a new chair, Jonathan Gutman MD, Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine and a clinical investigator in allogeneic stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies. These efforts led to re-approval by the NCI in June 2015. PRMS functions for cancer clinical trials across the UCCC consortium include: 1) review of scientific merit prior to submission to an IRB; 2) assessment of study priority and feasibility, and 3) monitoring of intervention trials for accrual and scientific progress. The PRMS collaborates with, but operates independently of the IRB and the UCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The PRMS is comprised of two committees, the PRMS-Executive Committee (PRMS-EC) and the PRMS-Scientific Review Committee (PRMS-SRC). Members of these committees reflect the breadth and diversity of disciplines of UCCC. The PRMS-EC and PRMS-SRC meet on alternating weeks resulting in efficient disposition and flow of protocols. The PRMS-EC assesses prioritization and feasibility of protocols and grants expedited approval if appropriate. Evaluation of scientific merit is performed by the PRMS- SRC. New protocol submissions to PRMS are reviewed with differing levels of intensity depending on the type of protocol. Institutional and industry intervention trials receive the most comprehensive review before being approved to submit to the IRB. Once a protocol is activated, the PRMS-EC monitors scientific progress. PRMS- EC membership includes the PRMS chair, deputy chair, PRMS administrator and all disease site leaders. Inclusion of disease site leaders ensures that larger scope issues ? prioritization, feasibility, and progress ? are continuously revisited by those responsible for leading clinical research in their respective areas. The PRMS- SRC provides focused, well documented scientific reviews of institutional and industry intervention protocols. PRMS-SRC membership includes the PRMS chair, deputy chair, PRMS administrator, biostatisticians and a diverse group of investigators from all oncologic disciplines. Since 2013, PRMS has reviewed and prioritized 397 intervention studies. 25% (98) were NCTN or external peer reviewed studies that received a feasibility and prioritization review only. The remaining 75% were institutional (45) and industry (255) studies. Of the institutional studies, 7 (16%) were disapproved. During this same period 67 six month low accrual warning letters, 39 ten month low accrual warning letters, and 42 twelve month low accrual warning letter were issued for intervention studies and 35 were closed by PRMS for a lack of progress or closed voluntarily by the PI following receipt of letters from PRMS. During the next grant period PRMS will continue to apply a careful evaluation of feasibility and prioritization and perform a rigorous review of scientific merit to ensure that UCCC investigators open studies that are scientifically meritorious, feasible to complete, and meet the priorities of the UCCC."
"9421133","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of milder and more efficient methods towards complex molecule construction is a vibrant area of research within organic synthesis. In particular, certain structural motifs have achieved a privileged status within organi chemistry, due to their seemingly ubiquitous presence in bioactive molecules. For example, the benzylic carbon stereocenter is a common motif found in medicinal agents, agrochemicals, and natural product isolates. The substitution and functionality provided on the carbon framework can profoundly alter cell membrane permeability, half-life time of the molecule in a biological environment, and potency of a drug within the human body. Thus, the generation of a broad catalytic platform for this motif would be highly desirable.     Recent advances in copper(I) hydride chemistry have demonstrated the potential of this catalytic platform for producing diastereoenriched and enantioenriched molecules under mild conditions with inexpensive sources of copper and silane. Still, significant advances could be achieved with this chemistry towards other asymmetric methodologies. Two specific aims outlined in this proposal detail two transformations that are catalyzed through reductive copper catalysis: enantioselective hydroarylation and enantioselective benzylic alkylation. The starting material proposed is styrene, a class of molecules produced on a millions of tons scale each year, and a variety of commercially available or easy-to-produce electrophilic sources.     Lastly, mechanistic investigations will be pursued to isolate any competent intermediates in the catalytic cycle, identify the presence of any Cu(II)/Cu(III) or radical intermediates, and to develop a stereochemical model. Computational, kinetic, and spectroscopic investigations will, in turn, be applied to second-generation ligand framework synthesis and the expansion of this asymmetric methodology to other classes of olefins."
"9395382","Correct tissue shape is essential for proper tissue function and morphogenetic dysregulation results in many common congenital disorders. Yet, how groups of thousands or even hundreds of cells coordinate to yield stereotypic shape change through large-scale movements is still poorly understood. One way for cells to interact is through mechanical coupling. In fact, largescale networks of actomyosin connections between cells span developing tissues across various model organisms. The highly reproducible developmental program and powerful genetic tool-kit of Drosophila makes the Drosophila ventral furrow an ideal system for studying such networks. During furrow formation cells coordinate pulsed constrictions to yield tissue-wide bending. The tissue possesses a dynamic myosin network which fully forms prior to folding. Little is known, however, how mechanical information in the network guides collective constriction. This proposal will address how a network of mechanical connections is established to drive tissue folding. First, how a 2D network of intercellular connections promotes epithelial folding will be established. A novel approach, adapting methods from both astronomy and the mathematics of network theory will map the previously unquantifiable myosin network across hundreds of cells in a developing tissue. Preliminary studies have identified an initial growth phase and a subsequent contractile phase in the network. Growth Phase: We hypothesize that persistent network connections are established when neighboring cells simultaneously undergo a pulsed myosin accumulation. To test this hypothesis the position and timing of myosin recruitment will be coupled with the creation or reorganization network connections. Embryo injections inhibiting myosin pulsing will test the requirement of pulsing for network formation. Contractile Phase: We hypothesize that signatures in network geometry guide stereotypic tissue folding. Tissue-wide connectivity will be correlated with regions of coordinated cell constriction. Laser cutting will test the importance of connectivity patterns for tissue folding by selectively severing configurations in the network. Our approach could identify a novel unit of cooperation between the cell and the tissue scale over which cells synchronize. Second, how RhoA signaling influences cell interactions across a tissue will be investigated. Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) can activate myosin directly through phosphorylation or indirectly via inhibitory phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase (MP). To test the hypothesis that the balance between ROCK and MP dictates myosin network connectivity, MP will be constitutively activated at varying levels uncoupling its activity from ROCK regulation. This technique yields a phenotypic regime whereby the network is disrupted with varying severity. The global MP to ROCK activity required for myosin network regulation, as well as the local role of ROCK in shielding myosin filaments from disassembly, will be addressed. Taken together the two aims will form a foundational framework to understand general rules that govern how cells interact to reproducibly change tissue shape."

"9207583","STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY SHARED RESOURCE (Core-405) ABSTRACT Overview: The Structural Biology Shared Resource (SBSR) aims to facilitate and promote the application of macromolecular structural biology methods in cancer research for UCCC members. SBSR meets these goals by providing UCCC members instrumentation and expertise in X-ray Crystallography (X-ray) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR). Examples of projects studied in the SBSR fall into three main topic areas: Dynamics of cancer target activity, gene regulation, chromatin and epigenetics, and molecular targeting for the development of novel anti-tumor agents. Equipment: The SBSR capabilities have expanded significantly over the last 5 years through institutional support and the NIH Shared Instrument Grant Program. As a result, the X-ray facility has acquired a new in-house data-collection system that consists of a Rigaku MicroMax-007 X- ray generator, PILATUS3 R 200K Hybrid Pixel Array Detector with VariMax Optics and Oxford cryo-cooling systems. It also has a Rigaku/MSC robotics system for production of crystallization screens, drop setting and plate imaging. The NMR facility is equipped with Agilent/Varian 500, 600 and 900 MHz spectrometers at the Anschutz Medical Campus and an Agilent/Varian 800 MHz spectrometer at the UCB campus. Services: The SBSR provides expertise and access to highly specialized instrumentation for X-ray crystallography and NMR based structural studies of biomolecules relevant in cancer biology. Consultation and Education: SBSR personnel provide advice on sample preparation, data collection, structure determination, and data presentation for publication. Hands-on instrument training is important function of SBSR staff. Management: The SBSR is an institutional core managed by the institution as part of the Structural Biology and Biophysics Core Facilities. CCSG funding represents 34% of the annual operating budget. The remaining support comes from institutional support (50%) and user fees (16%). In regard to UCCC, SBSR is overseen by the Associate Director for Basic Research. Use of Services: Since July 2011, 54 investigators have used the services. Thirty-five percent of users were UCCC members, representing five of the six UCCC Research Programs and resulting in 55 peer- reviewed publications. Future Directions: The SBSR has several primary future directions that will enhance the SR and UCCC member cancer research: 1) Outreach to UCCC members from non-structure labs to create awareness of the opportunities SBSR technology offers and provide training in such technology; 2) incorporate into SBSR the new Cryo-Electron Microscopy resources that are currently being developed; 3) Collaborate with PMTSR to develop a comprehensive protein expression and purification service; 4) Initiate lifecycle replacement of several NMR resources."
"9397388","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enzymes are responsible for catalyzing all of the chemical reactions in the cell. The activity of some enzymes changes in response to levels of specific nutrients in the cell. One important and abundant nutrient is glucose. When glucose (sugar) is present in high levels in cells, it is redirected into a pathway that leads to the stimulation of an enzyme known as O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine Transferase (OGT) that is responsible for the addition of ?-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to over 1,000 proteins in the cell. The addition of these groups to target proteins can affect the localization, stability, and activity of the target proteins, as well as their interactions with other biomolecules. The misregulation of OGT has been linked to diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer disease. More tools are needed to enable us to study how aberrant regulation of OGT occurs and how it affects signaling processes in the cell that lead to disease. This will help us to determine if OGT could be a good candidate for therapeutics. Small molecule chemical probes are ideal for studying these signaling processes, because they can be used to study enzymes in their natural environment. Some tool compounds have already been developed to inhibit OGT, but few of them have been shown to act selectively against only OGT and to work against OGT inside cells. There is a clear need for better, more potent chemical tool compounds to study OGT. We are working to develop improved probes that are based upon a promising inhibitor, known as OSMI-1, that was developed in our laboratory, but that has some drawbacks that limit its utility. The aqueous solubility of OSMI-1 is limited, and it contains functional groups that ar known to be metabolically unstable. OSMI-1 exhibits modest levels of activity against OGT inside cells, but it causes a reduction in cell viability after 24 hours of inhibitor treatment. OSI-1 lacks sufficient potency and metabolic stability to move past use as an in vitro probe.       We propose to develop improved tool compounds with higher potency against OGT in cells. To enable quantitation of potency in cells, we will develop a fluorescence-based assay for determining global O- GlcNAcylation levels. We will also work to crystallize OGT:inhibitor complexes to gain structural information that will inform on the mode of inhibition and on compound design. Finally, we will elucidate inhibitor off-targets using affinity-purification. We expect that these studies will lead to highly potent and selective tool compounds that will be valuable for studying cellular processes in which OGT participates. An improved understanding of these signaling pathways will increase our understanding of how OGT contributes to various disease states, and will help to determine if OGT could be a target for therapeutics.       In accordance with the project outline above, we propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1- Develop potent non-covalent and covalent inhibitors of OGT beginning from the OSMI-1 scaffold. Specific Aim 2- Characterize on- and off-target cellular activity of promising small molecule OGT probes."
"9378504","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this NCI K22 career development proposal is to develop the PI, a PhD, and trained social worker in health disparities, into a successfully funded independent cancer researcher. The proposal contains both career development and structured research plan activities focus on advancing cancer-health disparities research with incarcerated men. Incarcerated men have not generally been the focus of cancer health studies although multiple reports indicate that approximately 60-80% of inmates in the United States have histories of tobacco use, compared to 30% of the general population, and over 80% of individuals involved in the criminal justice system report histories of substance use, including alcohol, marijuana and crack cocaine. This is an alarming statistic, considering that tobacco, marijuana, crack cocaine, and alcohol use are associated with an increased risk of developing lung and liver diseases and certain cancers. Little is known about incarcerated men's cancer-health disparities and how incarceration affects their health behaviors upon release to the community. This program builds upon the PI's prior work including her strong background in HIV/AIDS research, clinical practice, and mixed-methods research experience. The specific career goals are: (1) to become proficient in research skills, focusing on advanced quantitative methods, data analysis and grant writing (enroll in cancer epidemiology and longitudinal research courses); and (2) to gain experience in prison cancer-health disparities research (collecting primary cancer- health disparities data across three different correctional facilities). The proposed research will assess the cancer-health disparities and smoking behaviors of men ages 18 years and over who are currently incarcerated in facilities of three different security levels (i.e., detention, minimum, and medium). The specific aims are to: (1) assess the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about cancer and describe the smoking behaviors of incarcerated men; and (2) adapt the Cancer 101 (a cancer education resource to improve cancer knowledge, survival rates and cancer control in vulnerable populations) for incarcerated men in three different correctional settings. The results from the K22 described in this proposal are intended to inform the basis of a NCI R01 grant application. The long-term goal is to design and implement a culturally appropriate prison-to-community cancer-health prevention trial for incarcerated men returning to their communities in order to ultimately reduce the cancer burden affecting men with criminal justice backgrounds."
"9379370","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CANDIDATE/TRAINING: My goal for this career development award is to obtain the necessary training to become an independent physician-scientist studying novel circuits that control regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation and functio. I am a transfusion medicine fellow who earned a Ph.D. in Immunology studying the regulation of T cell receptor gene assembly. Subsequently, I began pursuing a specific interest in the differentiation of na?ve T cells into TH subsets. Building on foundational skills in molecular genetics, I now plan to add expertise and mentored research experience in cellular immunology, chemical biology and animal models of inflammation to further our understanding of Treg development and function in the context of inflammatory disease. My mentor is an immunologist leader in IBD genetics and biology and provides an unparalleled environment uniquely suited to the success of this project and my career. My research advisory committee brings all necessary additional expertise and my oversight committee comprises successful investigators who are excellent mentors. My prior research and clinical training, together with mentored research and coursework during the award period will build fundamental skills and highlight important findings in the regulation of Treg differentiation that I will follow up as an independent, R01-funded investigator with the long-term goal of understanding how T cell biology is modulated in the context of inflammatory disease. PROJECT: Tregs are critical anti-inflammatory cells, impaired development and/or function of which leads to inflammatory disease. Emerging data shows that Tregs typically exhibit organ-specific specializations to facilitate niche-relevant roles, calling nto question whether current approaches to expand Tregs ex vivo can adequately reproduce such functions. I hypothesize that local microenvironments contain the cues necessary to induce specializations required for niche-specific functions. Our pioneering unbiased chemical biology efforts identified novel small molecule enhancers of Treg differentiation, including harmine and 2 scaffolds from the Broad DOS collection. The experimental pipeline described in Specific Aim 1 highlights optimized enhancers based on these scaffolds. Harmine and the optimized DOS enhancers are used to address the core hypothesis in Specific Aim 2, that delivery of small molecule Treg enhancers to mucosal surfaces promotes Treg development and function locally and distally, both at steady state and using in vivo models of inflammation. In Specific Aim 3, we address novel and testable mechanistic hypotheses raised by pilot studies with harmine, including lineage plasticity, as well as the role of novel candidate genes (DYRK1a and DYRK2) and pathways (Creb and NF-kB1 signaling) in Treg differentiation. These studies have important impact on the conceptual approach to Treg-based therapy and are likely to highlight novel regulators of Treg differentiation, as well as point to multidisciplinary approaches to rapidly generate mechanistic hypotheses, enhancing our basic understanding of Treg biology in the context of inflammatory disease."
"9121240","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cortical blindness (CB) results from damage to the primary visual cortex, presenting as a loss of vision in the contralateral visual field. Work from my lab and others have previously shown that visual training can recover simple and complex visual motion discriminations at trained, blind field locations in CB subjects. However, recovered contrast sensitivity and discrimination of fine direction differences are poor compared to those in  intact portions of the visual field, suggesting that recovered vision is not fully functional. The main question addressed in this grant is: can these residual visual deficits be overcome in CB fields, both with respect to feature processing and spatial transfer of learning? To address this question, I have developed two specific aims to test (1) whether manipulating feature-based attention (FBA) or spatial attention (SA) will aid in overcoming residual visual deficits and (2) whether locations of training induced recovery are predicted by regions of spared retinotopic activity. In the first aim I will investigate the residual inability to perform fine direction discriminations following psychophysical training on coarse direction discrimination. I will attempt to overcome this impairment using FBA and SA coupled with visual discrimination training to recover visual performance. Both FBA and SA have been demonstrated in visual intact subjects to promote improvement of fine discrimination thresholds, and they will likely have the same effect in CB subjects. My second aim investigates the relationship between the visual field of CB subjects and retinotopic activity. Training-induced recovery is retinotopically localized to trained locations with respect to depth in the blind field, but not along the blind fild border. I will test the hypothesis that location of recovery can be predicted based on pre-training  fMRI retinotopic maps and that vision can be recovered only in regions of the visual field where residual cortical activity is present. Humphrey perimetry and psychophysical measures of direction and orientation discrimination will be used to assess the spatial extent of training-induced recovery, which will be correlated with retinotopic maps obtained from fMRI. Finally, I will assess whether and to what extent retinotopic specificity of recovery deep into the blind fiel can be overcome by manipulating exogenous spatial attention. The proposed experiments will provide further insights into the properties of training-induced visual recovery in cortically blin fields, documenting the effects of attentional manipulations on training, investigating a possible mechanism by which training induced recovery occurs, and determining the spatial spread and limitations of recovered vision. A better understanding of these properties will not only improve treatment cortical blindness, but will also improve our understanding of plasticity within the adul visual system by studying to what extent visual function can recover following a large, permanent injury."
"9289242","ABSTRACT:  Chronic conductive hearing loss due to middle-ear diseases can lead to cochlear neuropathy. While our diagnosis and management of middle-ear diseases are not perfect, in part due to incomplete knowledge of the eardrum function for sound transmission. Multiple contradictory theories of eardrum function have been proposed in the past 150 years. These theories are based on incomplete descriptions and misinterpretation of existing eardrum characterizations. Almost all previous measurements of the eardrum response to sound have used steady-state tonal stimuli, while environmental sounds, such as music, noises and speech, are transient in nature. Little is known about the eardrum transient response in the real world. Incomplete knowledge of the eardrum also limits our views on how to repair the diseased ear. Our first goal in this study is to provide evidence to distinguish between these different theories of the eardrum function. Our second goal is to improve our knowledge of the eardrum response to transient sound. Our third goal is to explore clinical application of the measurement of the eardrum transient response for differential diagnosis of middle-ear diseases. To achieve these goals, we propose three aims in this study. Aim 1 employs a state-of-the-art High Speed Holographic Interferometry System (HSHIS) developed in our laboratory to quantify the eardrum transient responses to acoustic and mechanical transient stimuli, at a very high spatial (>100,000 points) and temporal (>100k frames per second) resolution. ?Experimental modal analysis? will be applied to extract three important yet poorly quantified characteristics of the eardrum: (1) natural frequencies; (2) the magnitude and spatial pattern of modal responses; (3) damping. Results in aim 1 will enable us to understand and describe eardrum function with a level of sophistication that has not been available, and resolve contradictory theories of eardrum function. Aim 2 will quantify the eardrum transient response in cadaveric human ears with simulated middle-ear diseases. Results in aim 2 will evaluate eardrum function in pathological ears, and assess the use of our techniques as an objective tool for differential diagnosis of middle-ear diseases. Aim 3 will study the eardrum function in live chinchilla ears in normal and diseased middle ear conditions, such as Otitis Media with Effusion. Very little detailed surface motion of the live eardrum has been reported in the literature, results in aim 3 will fill in that gap. Measurements will be repeated just after euthanasia to directly quantify any post-mortem changes in eardrum function. This aim also serves as a pilot study to evaluate the clinical utility of our system before clinical trials in patients."
"9331296","Project Summary In this application we address the need for influenza drugs with novel targets, and specifically we propose to discover antiviral compounds that target the influenza virus polymerase complex. Currently there is only one class of influenza drug that is clinically useful; the neuraminidase inhibitors. Relying on a single drug class is problematic as the emergence of resistant virus could render these drugs ineffective as has already happened with the adamantane drugs targeting the viral M2 protein. In fact, concerns about resistance to oseltamivir, an oral neuraminidase inhibitor that is the most widely prescribed influenza drug, are driving the call for influenza drugs with new targets and mechanisms. The viral polymerase is an essential catalytic component of all viruses, and has proven to be an excellent target for development of potent antiviral drugs, but as yet no polymerase inhibitors have been approved for influenza treatment. In preliminary studies we have performed a high-throughput screen of a 900,000 compound library using a cell-based assay and identified 744 hits with influenza antiviral activity. We propose to use a novel in vitro influenza polymerase assay to rapidly identify polymerase inhibitors amongst these validated hits. This unique assay captures all the essential steps leading to formation of the final RNA product and thus will allow us to identify novel compounds that inhibit endonuclease activity, mRNA cap-binding, RNA-binding, and RNA synthesis. Specific assays will be employed to elucidate the antiviral mechanism and we will also perform studies to select for resistance as a means to identify the target and determine the barrier to resistance. Our overall goal is to identify one or more influenza virus polymerase inhibitors that are potent and display antiviral breadth across multiple influenza A virus subtypes and influenza B virus. Such compounds present an exciting starting point for antiviral development but will also serve as probes in ongoing efforts to define influenza virus polymerase function."
"9197282","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, with roughly 500,000 new cases and 300,000 cancer-related deaths globally occurring each year. Our group has comprehensively characterized the genomic alterations in HNSCC, and we previously reported that NOTCH1 is among the top genes mutated in this disease. The spectrum of NOTCH1 mutations we found suggested the gene is a tumor suppressor in HNSCC, and we recently published experiments which confirmed this by demonstrating restoration of the NOTCH1 gene to HNSCC cell lines with naturally occurring NOTCH1 mutations impairs their growth both in vitro and in vivo. We now have data demonstrating that NOTCH signaling similarly impairs the growth of HNSCC cell lines lacking mutation and expressing wild type NOTCH1 receptors, raising the possibility that this pathway may someday be exploited in a targeted fashion to treat patients with HNSCC. Our preliminary data also show that NOTCH activation in HNSCC lines inhibits cell migration, activates a program of changes in molecules that regulate cell adhesion and adhesion-dependent signaling, and induces genes associated with differentiation and tumor suppression. In addition, we have novel data linking NOTCH reactivation to suppression of proto-oncogenes, a-Catulin and Axl kinase, which have been shown to regulate malignant properties of tumors - suggesting the possibility that loss of these proteins could mediate the tumor suppressive phenotypes in HNSCC induced by NOTCH activation. These observations support a central hypothesis that NOTCH inactivation results in more aggressive tumors because NOTCH activation disrupts adhesion-dependent signaling, causing cells to become more differentiated, lose proliferative capacity, become less migratory or invasive, and upregulate tumor suppressor genes. To test this hypothesis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which NOTCH activation inhibits malignant properties will be determined in HNSCC cell lines harboring mutant or wild type NOTCH1 receptors, while the impact of NOTCH mutation on tumor aggressiveness will be studied in genetically-engineered mice and cell lines, and in a clinical patient cohort. Th proposed work should advance our knowledge regarding the biological and clinical significance of the NOTCH pathway in HNSCC, which is critical in order to correctly understand how the pathway may be used for therapy or prognosis in this disease. As inactivating NOTCH1 mutations have now been detected in squamous cell carcinomas from lung and esophagus, knowledge gained from this work could have far reaching implications in our understanding and treatment of solid tumors from multiple types of cancer."
"9325109","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for a NIDA Independent Scientist Award (K02). The candidate, Amelia J. Eisch, Ph.D., is a tenured Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at UT Southwestern Medical Center. Dr. Eisch is a pioneer in understanding the reciprocal relationship between certain forms of hippocampal plasticity such as adult hippocampal neurogenesis and behaviors relevant to addiction. The first award period of this K02 provided Dr. Eisch with the protected time she needed to accomplish her past goals, which included renewing her NIDA R01 grant on opiates and neurogenesis, securing additional federal funding, advancing her work from correlative to more mechanistic and causative studies, and being promoted to Associate Professor and receiving tenure. This K02 renewal is requested in order to continue this protected time and to allow Dr. Eisch to utilize the momentum she has established in understanding the proposed reciprocal role between new neurons in the adult brain and addiction. The receipt of a K02 renewal award would allow her continued protection from administrative burdens, and thus allow Dr. Eisch to advance: (1) research on the relationship between adult-generated neurons and behaviors relevant to addiction; (2) dissection of the cellular, molecular, and genetic control of adult-generated hippocampal neurons;  (3) newly developed collaborations on translational profiling, ultrastructural analysis, and circuit-level impact of new neurons;  (4) application of new techniques for these collaborations (BAC-TRAP, optogenetics, EM, electrophysiology); (5) data collection for grant applications: the 10-year renewal of her existing R01 on opiates and  neurogenesis, a new NIDA R01 relevant to the molecular control of hippocampal neurogenesis, and a new  NIDA R01 relevant to behavioral and circuit-level impact of adult-generated neurons. By providing this protected time, Dr. Eisch can work closely with her collaborators and rapidly advance her new ideas, thus benefitting the fields of addiction research and stem cell biology and neuroscience as a whole. The stability and protected time offered by this K02 award would ultimately support at least two new projects exploring the intriguing relationship between adult-generated hippocampal neurons and behaviors relevant to addiction. As these studies hold great potential to improve our understanding of the complex mechanisms by which drugs of abuse affect brain function, they therefore may open new avenues for treatment of addiction and relapse to drug seeking. As these studies also will also shed much-needed light on how adult-generated neurons influence complex behavior - such as drug/context association, extinction from drug-seeking, and behavioral response to stress - they will be important to future efforts to harness neural stem cells for repair of the injured, even addicted, brain and to our understanding of what new neurons can/will do in the adult brain."
"9346165","Malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax threatens over 2 billion people globally and sickens tens of millions annually. Radical cure for P. vivax malaria includes therapy aimed both at the acute attack (blood schizontocidal) and against future attacks (hypnozoitocidal). The only hypnozoitocide available are 8- aminoquinolines such as primaquine or tafenoquine. However, clinicians often do not prescribe 8- aminoquinolines due to the high prevalence (8%) of individuals with various levels of inherited Glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) deficiencies, because these drugs can cause life-threatening acute hemolytic anemia in patients with moderate to severe G6PDH deficits. There is an urgent need to quantify both Hgb and G6PDH for patients stricken with malaria or prior to the administration of 8-aminoquinilones. All current quantitative methods for G6PDH determination are laboratory based spectrophotometric methods, requiring diluents, reagents, pipettes and trained personnel. There are currently no commercially available point-of-care (POC) tests that can quantify both Hgb and G6PDH directly from a finger-stick sample. Developing a robust, quantitative assay for field use in low resource areas is a high priority for overall malaria control and elimination. In this proposal, In Vitro Diagnostic Systems (IVDS) will establish the feasibility of developing a POC test, the PreQuine Test, in which Hgb and G6PDH levels can be quantitated simultaneously from a 30 ?L blood stick sample. In pilot studies, we have successfully assessed Hgb and G6PDH levels using independent test strips. To develop a dual Hgb and G6PDH test strip, we propose develop a lysing protocol to maximize liberation of Hgb and G6PDH from blood samples (Aim 1), optimize Hgb and G6PDH assay conditions (Aim 2) and then combine the Hgb and G6PDH assays into a single test strip (Aim 3). The PreQuine Test results will be compared to results obtained with a calibrated hand-held meter; demonstration of concordance of the results from the PreQuine Test strip and calibrated meter to reference samples will indicate success. In Phase II, we will establish real-time and long-term stability of the PreQuine Test, implement a meter temperature compensation program, conduct pre-clinical testing as well as field testing, and use NCLIS guidelines for performance testing. The ability to identify G6PDH deficient individuals using a rapid POC test and also to monitor patients for G6PDH levels and Hgb levels during therapy would have great impact on malaria treatment strategies."
"9266983","Project summary The transforming human gammaherpesviruses EBV and KSHV establish stable latent infections in B cells, providing a lifelong reservoir of virus that can contribute to the development of malignant disease. Thus, defining the mechanisms that govern long-term latency is critical for designing rational strategies to prevent disease. In vivo studies of gammaherpesviruses in humans have been severely limited by the difficulties of working in the natural host. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is related to EBV and KSHV and causes lymphomas and lymphoproliferative disease in mice, providing a readily manipulable small animal model for mechanistic studies of the virus/host relationship in vivo. Like EBV and KSHV, MHV68 expresses lncRNAs whose functions during infection and pathogenesis are largely unknown. As virus-encoded lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in vivo in B cells during long-term latency and in hyperplastic B cell lesions during lymphoproliferative disease, we hypothesize that these lncRNAs play key roles in latency and lymphomagenesis. In support of this, our new data demonstrates that the MHV68 TMER4 transcript acts a unique lncRNA that is essential for latency and pathogenesis. Using a combination of cutting-edge high throughput sequencing approaches and a novel bioinformatic pipeline, we have now generated a comprehensive map of validated MHV68 lncRNA transcripts. With results from this discovery phase in hand, we will now test the hypothesis that MHV68 lncRNAs are essential for latency and tumorigenesis. We will: 1) Determine the roles of high priority MHV68 lncRNAs during in vivo infection; 2) Define the molecular mechanism by which lncRNA TMER4 facilitates latent infection, and determine the tripartite regulatory relationship between the novel M3M2 lncRNA, antisense TMERs/miRNAs and latency protein M2, and 3) Determine the role of virus and host lncRNAs in lymphomagenesis. The use of new genomic, bioinformatic and mutagenesis technology, in conjunction with systematic in vivo analyses of MHV68 lncRNA mutants, provides an extremely powerful means to determine the molecular mechanism by which lncRNAs contribute to gammaherpesvirus infection and lymphomagenesis in vivo. Further, the unique collaborative nature of this program project should allow us to define the contribution of common lncRNA-targeted pathways to latency and tumorigenesis."
"9147605","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research."
"9379323","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term research strategy for a career as a translational physician-scientist is to: discover neuroendocrine and neuroimaging endophenotypes in postpartum depression (PPD), translate findings to develop methods to identify pregnant women at highest risk of developing PPD based on biological markers and develop gender-specific treatments targeted to underlying pathophysiology in women at high-risk of developing PPD. Depression is the leading cause of disease burden and years lost to disability for women in their childbearing years35. Women with a history of PPD, for unknown reasons, are at high risk of developing PPD with subsequent pregnancies 36-38. Suicide accounts for up to 20% of postpartum deaths39. Differential regulation of gonadal steroids, including neuroactive steroids (NAS), and ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) during late pregnancy and the postpartum, via modulation of corticolimbic functional connectivity, may be involved in the pathophysiology of PPD. My pilot data prompted me to hypothesize that PPD is associated with: abnormal NAS and GABA regulation during pregnancy and abnormal postpartum cortical GABA and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fc). No study has prospectively investigated the effect of perinatal gonadal steroids on GABA and resting-state functional connectivity in PPD. My research findings will fill this knowledge gap and will advance scientific knowledge of biomarker identification in gonadal steroid-modulated mood disorders. To my knowledge, it is the first combined GABA MRS/resting-state functional connectivity MRI study in PPD and the first to investigate the role of sex steroids in resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fc) in PD. Specific Aim 1: To measure plasma NAS and GABA in late pregnancy and in the postpartum in those at low-risk (LR) and high-risk (HR) for PPD. Specific Aim 2: To measure cortical GABA/Creatine with magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and corticolimbic rs-fc in HR depressed and LR non- depressed postpartum women using the ACC as a seed area. I hypothesize that: abnormalities in the biosynthetic/metabolic pathway of progesterone, evidenced by altered NAS levels during pregnancy will be associated with decreased GABA levels during pregnancy and in the postpartum in the HR cohort; decreased plasma GABA levels in HR cohort both during pregnancy and the postpartum will be associated with PPD; PPD is associated with decreased cortical GABA in the ACC and decreased ACC rs-fc with limbic areas. Further hypotheses are discussed in the proposed research plan. The NIMH K23 is the bridge (i.e. pathway for training and mentorship) for this early stage investigator to develop into an independently-funded physician- scientist. The K23 will advance my knowledge of reproductive endocrinology with an emphasis on developing novel investigative techniques and train me in neuroimaging to investigate the interactions of the reproductive endocrine system on neural circuitry in depression so to elucidate the pathophysiology of depression during times of reproductive flux with the goal of developing gender-specific treatments in women."
"9223660","International Collaboration in Infectious Disease Research on Lassa fever (Lassa ICIDR)  Project 1: Evaluation of 2nd generation recombinant assays as point-of-care diagnostics and surveillance  tools for Lassa fever.  Much of what is known about Lassa fever was elucidated in specialized isolation units in endemic areas  and represents the most severe clinical manifestations of disease. Studies have shown that treatment with  ribavirin is effective at controlling viremia in acute Lassa fever patients but is most effective when  administered early in disease progression. However, onset of Lassa fever is gradual and nonspecific,  making the disease difficult to recognize. Patients presenting with early signs of Lassa fever are nearly  impossible to distinguish from other febrile diseases, such as malaria and typhoid, based on clinical  findings alone. Patients are more likely to visit a peripheral health unit (PHU) during the early stages of  disease, when clinical signs and symptoms of Lassa fever are nonspecific. These PHUs have limited  laboratory capacity and personnel. Febrile patients are commonly administered antimalarial and antibiotic  drugs and sent home, only to return days later with more severe disease. It can be several days after onset  of symptoms and after no response from antibiotics that clinicians consider Lassa fever at which point  patients are referred to the specialized units that can diagnose and treat Lassa fever patients. Over 75% of  patients presenting to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) Lassa Ward had symptoms for over 7  days. The delay in treatment likely attributes to the 69% case fatality rate in LASV antigenemic cases seen  at the Lassa Ward.  We hypothesize that building diagnostic capacity for Lassa fever at PHUs will enable community health  workers to diagnose and refer suspected Lassa fever cases earlier, and as a result, are more likely to  consider and screen for Lassa fever when febrile patients present to their PHUs. This will enable us to learn  more about the early stages of disease. Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate deployment of next-generation Lassa  fever recombinant antigen immunodiagnostics for point-of-care detection in peripheral health units. Specific  Aim 2 is to determine feasibility of using reLASV diagnostics as an epidemiological tool for country-wide  seroprevalence studies. Specific Aim 3 is to utilize recombinant LASV diagnostics to define correlates of  immunity to Lassa fever in patient contacts with little or no disease thereby identifying resistance patterns  and susceptible cohorts for Lassa fever. Specific Aim 4 is to develop the data collection and data  management capacity at the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH)."
"9256283","Abstract Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen that causes a wide range of hospital- and community- acquired infections. The greatest obstacle to treating these infections is antibiotic resistance; the rising preva- lence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa is a major public health concern. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics, which can circumvent drug resistance mechanisms applied by bacteria. Inhibrx has developed a platform based on single domain antibodies (sdAb) to enable development of novel antibiotics based on different mechanisms of action to circumvent the development of resistance. This platform is a modular format wherein multiple camelid heavy chain only antibody binding domains are joined end to end, together with an effector domain (Fc), to create multi-specific, multivalent antibodies targeting multiple epitopes. We propose to develop a therapeutic antibody against P. aeruginosa that simultaneously targets mul- tiple secreted toxins as well as a cell-surface target, in a molecule that also contains a functional human IgG1 Fc domain. Inhibrx has used its versatile antibody format to develop two lead hexavalent, tri-specific, human- ized molecules with specificity against two epitopes of a crucial component of the T3SS virulence mechanism and against an outer membrane lipoprotein that is highly conserved in all P. aeruginosa strains. These antibod- ies bind to all Pseudomonas strains tested and show improved efficacy in a murine infection model compared to the current leader in potential anti-Pseudomonas antibody therapeutics. We hypothesize that a therapeutic based on these antibodies will prove superior to all other existing P. aeru- ginosa therapeutics. Toxin blocking functionality is expected to protect immune cells recruited to the site of in- fection, while cell binding ?capability will enable opsonization of the bacteria, followed by their phagocytosis and clearance by the immune system. ?In this project we seek to take our candidate antibodies through Investiga- tional New Drug (IND) enabling toxicology. In Phase I (Specific Aim #1) we propose to characterize these anti- bodies for their ability to bind P. aeruginosa and block T3SS dependent cytotoxicity in vitro and to compare their efficacy in in vivo models of infection, establishing one of them as a clinical candidate. Phase II of this pro- ject will focus on performing IND enabling research to facilitate taking the candidate antibody selected in Phase I to clinical trials. Pharmacokinetics (PK) will first be tested in Specific Aim #2 in human FcRn transgenic mice, as human antibodies generally have relatively short half-lives in wildtype rodents. IND-enabling multi-dose tox- icity studies will then be performed in non-human primates (NHPs) to determine safety and PK of our clinical candidate. At the conclusion of this project, Inhibrx will have developed a much needed antibody therapeutic for treating MDR Pseudomonas that will be ready for IND filing. We expect this therapeutic to be highly im- pactful and transformative for MDR P. aeruginosa infections."
"9209575","CORE B. ADMINISTRATIVE CORE General anesthesia is a fascinating man-made, neurophysiological phenomenon that has been developed empirically over many years to enable safe and humane performance of surgical and non-surgical procedures. Specifically it is a drug-induced condition consisting of unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia and immobility, along with physiological stability. General anesthesia is administered daily to 60,000 patients in the United States, the mechanisms for how anesthetics act in the brain to create the states of anesthesia are not well understood. Significant progress has been made recently in characterizing the molecular sites that anesthetics target. However, how actions at specific molecular targets lead to the behavioral states is less well understood. Addressing this issue requires a systems neuroscience approach to define how actions of the drugs at specific molecular targets and neural circuits lead to a behavioral state of general anesthesia. In this program project entitled, Integrated Systems Neuroscience Studies of Anesthesia, we will develop an integrated systems neuroscience program consisting of human, non-human primate, rodent and modeling studies of four anesthetics: the GABAA agents, propofol and sevoflurane; the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, dexmedetomidine; and the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine. The program project will also include a DATA ANALYSIS CORE, which will provide assistant with data analysis and conduct research on statistical methods. The Specific Aims are to understand how the actions of the anesthetics at specific molecular targets and neural circuits produce the oscillatory dynamics (EEG rhythms, changes in LFPs and neural spiking activity) that are likely a primary common mechanism through which anesthetics create altered states of arousal (sedation, hallucination, unconsciousness). This program project will be a unique research collaboration among anesthesiologists, neuroscientists, bioengineers, a neurosurgeon, a neurologist, a statistician and a mathematician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston University. The day-to-day management of this program project will require an active team of support staff to accomplish its several goals. The responsibilities of the administrative core will include day-to-day administrative and financial management, along with planning of bi- weekly program project meetings, bi-weekly Executive Committee meetings, and planning of the annual Scientific Advisory Committee meeting.  "

"9378003","Co-registered photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging for non-invasive ovarian cancer detection  and characterization  Abstract  We propose to develop a new transvaginal imaging device using co-registered photoacoustic and ultrasound technique for dual-modality non-invasive detection and characterization of ovarian cancer and abnormality in situ. The photoacoustic technique provides optical contrast of tumor angiogenesis and tumor hypoxia with ultrasound (US) resolution for deeply seated lesions of up to 3-4 cm. The ability to image early angiogenesis changes as well as tumor hypoxia in the ovary with this non-invasive imaging modality would greatly enhance the care for women at risk for ovarian cancer.  Data obtained from our ex vivo imaging of normal, abnormal and malignant ovarian tissue have demonstrated that there is a significantly different angiogenic formation when malignant cancers and abnormal ovarian tissues are compared to normal ovarian tissues. We have developed a prototype co- registered photoacoustic and US system, which allows us to validate the hypothesis that this new imaging device will improve the current clinical practice for non-invasive diagnosis of early stage ovarian cancers and ovarian abnormality and will guide surgical intervention of high-risk ovarian cancer patients.  In this proposal, we will 1) develop a transvaginal photoacoustic/US probe and system suitable for in vivo dual-modality non-invasive detection and characterization of the ovary; 2) characterize normal, abnormal and cancerous ovarian tissue ex vivo by comparing imaging results with histopathology and microvessel density counts and distributions as well as average optical absorption; 3) evaluate the prototype probe for in vivo imaging of patients who are scheduled for prophylactic oophorectomy; 4) monitor a group of high-risk premenopausal women during their menstrual cycles to determine the cyclic changes in functional and morphological parameters that may differ from angiogenesis changes associated with the malignant process. Approximately 60 patients will be recruited for the ex vivo study in Aim 2, which will allow us to validate the initial sensitivity and specificity of the proposed technique. Approximately 40 patients will be recruited for the in vivo study in Aim 3, which will allow us to evaluate the technique and validate the ex vivo results. Approximately 20 to 25 premenopausal high- risk patients will be recruited for the in vivo study in Aim 4, which will allow us to assess the efficacy of this new technique within a premenopausal population.  The successful completion of the project will provide a means to improve the current clinical practice: it will provide necessary technology to improve the ability to determine if a cancer is present and to avoid surgery in a substantial number of women."
"9199427","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care. Carnegie Mellon University, one of the Nation's leading institutions for Computer Science will coordinate this project to assure a productive collaboration with four clinical sites: Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh), U. Colorado Denver, Duke University, and Harvard/Brigham & Women's hospital. By achieve consensus amongst stakeholders, we hope to assure the acceptance of CORA into practice and ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of the treatment of end-stage heart failure."
"9203069","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synchronized oscillations in the pallido-thalamo-cortical circuit have been hypothesized to underlie the development of parkinsonian motor signs by altering connectivity between the basal ganglia and cortical structures. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves parkinsonian motor signs; but how it changes basal ganglia cortical interactions remain unclear. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the changes in synchronization and effective connectivity that occur between the basal ganglia and motor and supplementary motor cortices (MC and SMA, respectively) in the parkinsonian state and during therapeutic DBS of the internal segment of the  globus pallidus (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). A second goal of this study is to examine the feasibility of exploiting the presence of these oscillations in the pathological state for use as biomarkers in the development of a closed loop control system for DBS. These goals will be accomplished by simultaneously recording from populations of neurons in both subcortical and cortical areas at rest and during movement; characterizing the physiological changes in synchronized oscillatory activity and effective connectivity between the basal ganglia and MC and SMA in the parkinsonian state and during therapeutic DBS in the nonhuman primate MPTP model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Putative biomarkers, identified as part of the first phase of the study, will be evaluated as triggers for closed loop stimulation delivery during a goal directed reaching task in the final stuy phase. The results of this study will provide critical new information to help us to understand the changes in interactions that occur across the MC, SMA and basal ganglia network in PD, identify biomarkers that can be used as triggers for  closed loop control of DBS and compare the relative effect of STN versus GPi DBS on basal  ganglia cortical interactions and as sites for triggers in a closed loop control system."
"9391867","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission of a renewal application for continued support of an established T32 Training Grant in Circadian and Sleep Research to train and support predoctoral and postdoctoral students at Northwestern University (NU) and the University of Chicago (U of C). The integration of circadian biology and sleep research in both animal models and humans has been the cornerstone of the relationship between the preceptors on this Training Grant at the U of C and NU for over 20 years, and we have added the term circadian to the title of our Training Program in recognition of the importance of combining these fields in the training of the next generation of young investigators. This Training Program will be led by two established senior investigators under the Multiple Leadership Plan and will involve 13 Primary Training Faculty who have their primary appointments in either basic science or clinical departments. The proposed Training Program will offer predoctoral and postdoctoral students interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary training in a wide range of scientifi disciplines that are highly relevant to understanding the function, regulation and health implications of sleep and circadian rhythmicity. Central to this Program is the training of student in modern basic science, translational research as well as patient oriented research. Multiple research perspectives have fueled for more than a decade the productive interactions and cross-fertilization that have developed between the preceptors in this Program. During the current grant period, the scope of the research activities of the Training Faculty has expanded to include bench to bedside investigations of the impact of sleep-disordered breathing on metabolism and cardiovascular function and we propose to further broaden the program in our renewed program with the addition of six outstanding physician-scientists to the training faculty. As our nation is facing unprecedented epidemics of obesity, diabetes and their cardiovascular consequences, the Training Program proposed in the present application is uniquely positioned to train an interdisciplinary workforce of academic and industry investigators as well as government decision makers to address the roles of sleep disturbances and circadian dysfunction in these public health challenges. A key feature of our Training Program is the inclusion of 10 Collaborating Faculty with additional clinical, scientific and/or educational expertise that greatly enhances our training environment, and conversely, they will benefit from their participation in the program by developing mentoring skills. Our Program will enable trainees to integrate cutting edge approaches and techniques in the areas of genetics, genomics, endocrinology, metabolism, pharmacology, neurobiology, pulmonology, cognitive neuroscience, gerontology and chronobiology into their training in sleep and circadian research. Because the preceptors in this Training Program are actively involved in research at the molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral and epidemiological levels, trainees will be trained in a rich environment of activities that are integrated together for the study of the basic mechanisms of sleep and circadian function at all levels of biological organization."
"9187442","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are no means for curing advanced breast cancers. Breast cancer has a very high metastatic predisposition to bone. The immense skeletal compartments consisting of 206 bones allow for increasing cancer burden, further metastases, recurrence, cachexia, and eventually, death. In addition, bone metastasis often causes bone destruction, extreme pain, fractures, and paralysis, leading to poor quality of life or death from associated complications. Breast cancer cells not only produce bone-destroying cytokines/chemokines, but also stimulate osteoprogenitor cells to produce factors leading to osteoclastic bone resorption. Although treatments like bisphosphonates and denosumab decrease skeletal events to a certain degree, patients still suffer from skeletal complications and drug side effects such as AVN or atypical fractures. We plan to establish new mechanism-based therapeutic strategies that will reduce cancer burden, prevent skeletal complications, and prolong the life of patients with advanced breast cancers with massive skeletal metastases by effectively killing breast cancers in bone and targeting their osteolytic interactions with bone cells. Our proposal stems from clinical observations. We have consistently observed expression of phosphorylated Extracellular Receptor Kinase (pERK) 1/2 in pathological fracture surgical specimens from patients with breast cancers and well- established aggressive human breast cancer cell lines extensively used in literature. ERK1/2 is downstream of Ras-Raf-MEK1 and is phosphorylated in pathologic conditions such as inflammation and cancers. Our Preliminary Data shed light on a critical role of pERK1/2 in two clinically important angles of bone destruction and cancer cell death. First, breast cancer cells with higher pERK1/2, such as MDA231, cells exhibited more bone destruction than pERK1/2-low breast cancer cells such as MCF-7 following implantation in the proximal tibiae of nude mice. We identified a set of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines that are specifically regulated by pERK1/2 signaling on RT-PCR cytokine/chemokine arrays. Furthermore, breast cancer cells phosphorylate ERK1/2 and trigger expression of cytokines/chemokines in osteoblasts that are co-cultured with breast cancer cells. Second, pERK1/2 targeting alone with AZD6244, a clinical-grade MEK1-pERK1/2 inhibitor, or in combination with doxorubicin increases cell death in breast cancer cells. Our hypothesis is that MEK1-pERK1/2 targeting prolongs the survival of breast cancer-bearing subjects by promoting cancer cell death and blocking pro-osteoclastogenic inflammation in bone. Specific Aim 1 (Mechanism of Bone Destruction) is to determine a pro-osteoclastogenic role of pERK1/2 in aggressive triple-negative breast cancer cells and interacting osteogenic stromal cells. Specific Aim 2 (Mechanistic Enhancement of Cancer Cell Death) is to determine a role of pERK1/2 in breast cancer cell survival and chemoresistance. Specific Aim 3 (Therapeutic Translation in vivo) is to establish pERK1/2 targeting as an effective molecular adjuvant therapy for aggressive osteolytic metastatic breast cancers in bone."
"9226061","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this revised career development proposal is to enable Dr. Allison Robertson to become an independent investigator conducting evidence-based policy and implementation research to improve treatment and reduce recidivism for people with serious mental illness (SMI) and often co-occurring substance use disorders (COD) who are involved in the criminal justice (CJ) system. People with SMI-and especially those with COD-are critically overrepresented in the U.S. CJ system. Many policy and program interventions have been devised over the past 20 years to divert people with SMI away from the CJ system and instead into community-based mental health and substance abuse treatment, all with the hopes of promoting successful community integration and recovery. Evidence for these interventions is promising, but the overall impact has been modest; and substance abuse is a leading predictor of recidivism. Further, little attention has been given to the policy- and practie-level challenges to widespread adoption and implementation of evidence-based interventions for this population. Dr. Robertson aims to focus her future research on identifying effective treatment approaches for persons with SMI and CJ involvement and improving the adoption and implementation of evidence-based policies and practices that can improve health outcomes and reduce recidivism. To that end, she proposes a set of mentored training and research activities in this career development award to develop new skills to pursue her career objectives. Dr. Robertson will develop additional expertise in: (1) understanding of the organization, workforce challenges , and coordination of the public behavioral health and criminal justice systems, with close attention to issues around implementation of evidence-based practices; and (2) implementation science and research, including new training in stakeholder survey methods, some qualitative research training for conducting key-informant interviews, and multi-level modeling for testing intervention effects within and across settings. She will pair mentored training with a set of research projects to study the use of evidence-based substance abuse medications paired with psychosocial treatments-also called medication assisted treatment (MAT)-for treating co-occurring substance abuse among justice-involved people with SMI. Very little is known about the use of MAT among people with COD and justice involvement; yet the evidence base for MAT is strong, and the prospects are substantial for wider use of these treatment regimens to reduce substance abuse, subsequent criminal offending, and promote SMI recovery. In her research projects, Dr. Robertson will (1) use existing merged, administrative data for a population of adults with COD and CJ involvement in Connecticut during 2002-2009 to estimate the effectiveness and penetration rates of MAT as used in conjunction with SMI treatment (versus SMI treatment alone); (2) conduct a two-state survey of relevant stakeholders plus key informant interviews to assess the clinical, systems, and policy considerations for wider adoption and implementation of MAT for use in justice- involved adults with COD; and (3) prepare for a R34 implementation pilot study to improve the use of MAT for this population. R34 development activities will include identifying the appropriate implementation theory to test; designing the experimental intervention for MAT implementation; and early drafting of a manual for an MAT implementation intervention. The training and research proposed herein will build the foundation for the NIMH R34 application during the award period that, itself, will precede a subsequent multi-site implementation trial of MAT for persons with COD who are involved in the CJ system."
"9382562","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The assembly and release of HIV-1 particles is quite complex, in that a number of viral and cellular RNAs and proteins participate, and while much has been learned about this process, much remains to be discovered. The Gag protein is central to the assembly and release of HIV-1 and all other retrovirus particles. A key function of the Gag protein that will be one focus of tis proposal is the recruitment and packaging of viral genomic RNA (gRNA). Reciprocally, gRNA may help to drive the recruitment of additional Gag molecules into a virion as assembly progresses. However, the full extent to which RNA participates in particle assembly in cells, and how Gag:RNA interactions change as assembly is initiated and completed remain to be defined. The experiments proposed in specific aim 1 will be the first to determine precisely how HIV-1 Gag and gRNA interact in cells. These studies could identify the very first as well as subsequent interactions between Gag protein and gRNA as well as between gRNA and antiviral cytidine deaminases.  Following assembly, HIV-1 particles depart from the surface of the infected cell, to colonize neighboring or distal uninfected cells. During the previous funding period, we identified an IFN-induced membrane protein, termed tetherin, as a host defense molecule that inhibits HIV-1 particle release. Our work has demonstrated  that tetherin acts directly, to retain nascent virions on the cell surface, but key mechanistic details of how  tetherin functions, and what role t plays in preventing the dissemination of viral infection in cultured cells  and in vivo remain to b determined. In specific aim 2, we will perform a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments to address these key questions."
"9228926","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skeletal muscle is critical for survival and quality of life, as it is required for respiration, ingestion, and locomotion. Aberrant muscle differentiation impairs these activities and can lead to disease and death. During myogenesis, myoblasts differentiate into myocytes, which fuse to form mature myotubes containing thousands of nuclei. Gene expression must be correctly regulated spatially and temporally to ensure proper myogenesis and maintenance of normal skeletal muscle function. Mature myotubes in vivo display regional specialization in function and protein expression and myonuclei exhibit nonequivalence of protein localization and transcript production. An open question is how transcription factors and other nuclear proteins can be targeted to one nucleus and not to its neighbors in a multinucleated myotube. Proteins that regulate gene expression are synthesized in the cytoplasm and must traverse the nuclear pore to access their targets in the nucleus. To enter the nucleus, proteins must translocate through nuclear pore complexes (NPC) composed of multiple nucleoporins (Nups). The NPC allows free movement of small molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm but excludes proteins larger than 40 kDa. Larger proteins must be bound to a nuclear transport receptor, which recognizes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the cargo protein, in order to pass through the NPC. We examined nuclear import in cultured primary murine myotubes using an in vitro nuclear import assay and found that a subset of nuclei were incompetent to import a protein reporter containing the most common NLS, the classical NLS (cNLS). When cNLS import-competence was investigated across myogenesis, we found that, while almost all myoblast nuclei are cNLS import-competent, as myoblasts differentiate into myocytes, only a low percentage of myonuclei are cNLS import-competent. However, as myocytes develop into mature myotubes, cNLS import is restored. We hypothesize that modulation of nuclear import competence in differentiating muscle cells is a mechanism by which transcriptional activity of a nucleus is regulated. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine if cNLS import-incompetent nuclei are competent for other import pathways by analyzing the ability of myonuclei to import reporter proteins containing a cNLS compared to other NLS motifs. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify differences in Nup stoichiometry and post- translational modifications among myoblast, myocyte, and myotube nuclei and analyze their functional significance by mass spectrometry analysis of NPCs from three stages of myogenesis and subsequent inhibitor and siRNA experiments. In Specific Aim 3, we will compare transcriptional activity of cNLS import- competent and -incompetent nuclei by examining markers of active transcription by immunocytochemistry and the expression of specific transcripts by in situ hybridization in relation to the cNLS import-competent nuclei. Understanding muscle differentiation and coordination of transcriptional activity between many nuclei in a common cytoplasm could provide novel targets for preventing loss of muscle mass in disease and aging."
"9314691","Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection."
"9253460","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Developing Skills in Health Literacy (DSHL) project will develop innovative materials for teachers and students to improve the health literacy skills of middle and high school students. Health literacy is a stronger predictor of health than age, income, employment status, education level and race. Unfortunately, nearly 9 out of 10 adults have difficulty using everyday health information that is routinely available in our healthcare facilities, retail outlets, media and communities. Increasingly, adolescents are turning to the not-always-reliable Internet seeking health-related information. The DSHL project will develop a program accessible at no cost through a website that includes:  Online, interactive modules for middle school and high school students each containing five inquiry-based lessons focused on developing skills needed to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of health information. Students also will learn about career possibilities in the biomedical sciences. The modules will feature the research-based BSCS 5E Instructional Model and be tied explicitly to the Next Generation Science Standards.  Online, implementation guides for middle school and high school teachers that include annotated step-by-step instructions for the lessons, background information, common ideas students have about health, answer keys, assessment strategies, examples of student work, advice on teaching controversial topics, and strategies for having students share their newly acquired knowledge with family, friends, or other members of the school community. The guides will also enhance teachers' abilities to use research- based pedagogy to increase the achievement and motivation of all students, especially those who are underrepresented in the sciences. The DSHL materials will be designed and disseminated using an eLearning platform. The online approach enables students to learn using their preferred medium and makes them available to anyone with access to the Internet. Development of the DSHL materials will involve collaboration between health literacy experts, science educators, classroom teachers, and education technology experts. This collaboration helps ensure that the materials are accurate, reflect best pedagogical practices, and are engaging for middle school and high school students and teachers. Rigorous evaluation and research will be an integral part of this project. During development, the DSHL materials will be pilot tested and field tested with students and teachers across the country. A well-powered, quasi-experimental efficacy study of the materials will examine the program's impact on student understanding of health literacy concepts, student motivation and interest in science and biomedical careers. The results of the efficacy study will provide valuable evidence about best practices for educators teaching health literacy."
"9384868","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbiomes of humans and other animals are complex and poorly understood, but there is growing appreciation that they affect health in a wide variety of ways. Most potential invading pathogens interact extensively with a complex ecosystem of resident microbes before they can even contact host tissues. These interactions are clearly important, but have been very difficult to study for lack of tractable experimental systems. Our innovative recent work has established an experimental system in which the resident microbiome can protect against invasion by some species of bordetellae but not others that are very closely related. We further made the complementary finding that other bordetellae can displace the resident microbiota from the respiratory tract, including long-term chronic colonizers. Our extensive experience with the comparative biology and genomics of these closely related species has revealed candidate genes involved and our reverse genetics has allowed us to begin to identify roles for some of these, as described in our preliminary results. These data are beginning to reveal the complex interactions with resident microbiota as a critical aspect of an invading pathogen's initial colonization of the mammalian respiratory tract. This proposal will determine the ecological mechanisms involved in this competition, and identify molecular mechanisms (genes), in the context of naturally occurring interactions with resident microbiota that determine susceptibility/resistance to invading pathogens."
"9304551","Project Summary:  The proposed research leverages recent technological breakthroughs to investigate essential facets of RNA modification in the human fungal pathogen C. albicans. Increased resistance to the few treatment options available for C. albicans infection underscore the importance of understanding how fungal pathogens differ from humans at the molecular level. Our research addresses fundamental questions about essential features of C. albicans biology by investigating aspects of pseudouridylation unique to C. albicans.  Our long-term objective is to understand how RNA modification and processing differ between humans and pathogenic fungi. The proposed research investigates pseudouridylation, an RNA modification found in a wide variety of RNA molecules in all kingdoms of life. Although pseudouridylation is widespread, the amount and mechanism by which pseudouridylation occurs varies tremendously between taxa. Our preliminary data suggest that a number of aspects of pseudouridylation in C. albicans are distinct from analogous processes examined in S. cerevisiae and humans. We hypothesize C. albicans pseudouridine synthases modify different classes of RNA than S. cerevisiae pseudouridine. Furthermore, we hypothesize A and B homologs of C. albicans pseudouridine synthases act on distinct sets of substrates. In addition, while C. albicans rRNA has a similar number of rRNA pseudouridylation sites as S. cerevisiae, how these modifications are catalyzed are unknown. Moreover, the role/s of C. albicans snoRNA redundancy has not been investigated.  To answer these questions will demand the performance of medically relevant experiments on an important human fungal pathogen. Students will gain experience in a wide variety of fundamental molecular biology techniques including cutting-edge CRISPR genome-editing technology. Students will be directly supervised, and will participate in experimental design, data collection, interpretation, and dissemination. Furthermore, students will be put in a position to make discoveries that have a direct impact on our understanding of fungal pathogenesis.  "
"9422246","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes the development of portable, cost-effective, and energy-efficient chemical sensors for detection of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, methanol, ethanol, acetone, and hydrogen. Sensing these volatile compounds could both prevent and diagnose health problems. Some diseases are attributed to exposure to low levels of a volatile compound. For instance, formaldehyde, a common indoor pollutant, has been correlated with asthma rates. On the other hand, the human body exhales a set of molecules containing diagnostic information on the health of the individual. For example, trained dogs can detect lung cancer by the smell of a person's breath. Cost-effective and low-powered gas sensors could be deployed in an always-on networked array to prevent exposure to harmful chemicals; portability could extend application of gas sensors to monitoring personal health, which could revolutionize breath vapor analysis in health care. Current sensor technologies are limited. While gas chromatography is the gold standard for accurately identifying trace compounds, the instrumentation is costly and requires specialized training to operate. Other platforms to detect volatiles (fuel cells, infrared spectroscopy, etc.) may be simpler to operate, but face problems with sensitivity, selectivity, cost, and power consumption. To tackle these issues, an electronic nose strategy has been explored in which an array of sensors is utilized in concert to determine the chemical fingerprint of a vapor sample. In particular, Swager and coworkers have investigated resistive sensors based on functionalized carbon nanotube networks, potentially leading to inexpensive, low-powered, robust, and portable chemical sensors. Further improvements in sensitivity and selectivity of these sensors could lead to commercially viable devices.     The goal of this research is to make a network of single-walled carbon nanotubes connected by organometallic linkages. These linkages are designed to increase electronic communication between adjacent nanotubes and, thus, the overall resting conductivity. Select volatile compounds are expected to disrupt these organometallic centers via oxidation, reduction, or ligand substitution. The overall sensor should be more sensitive and selective than purely organic-functionalized or metal-functionalized nanotube networks. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop sensitive, portable, and always-on sensors to detect environmental VOC exposure at levels well below toxicity thresholds and to monitor breath vapor VOCs of patients to aid in diagnosis of diseases such as lung cancer."
"9409997","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomedical investigators are witnessing a limitation in our collective ability to translate the remarkable basic science discoveries of the current era to the clinic. The divide between basic discovery and clinical application has been appropriately termed the valley of death. A dearth of both physician scientists focused on translational research and lack of training programs creatively focused on translational research methodologies compound this problem. The aim of this program is to develop a novel training program in bench-to-bedside research methodology and to train the future generation of clinical and basic researchers in a translational approach to vascular biology, with a specific emphasis on the pulmonary circulation. While there are many T32 programs focused on systemic vascular biology, to our knowledge there is not a single program focused on Pulmonary Vascular Biology and Pulmonary hypertension. We have engineered a new approach to training in translational bench-to-bedside research, focused on providing the trainee with a translational research core competency tool-set, starting with immersion in a concentrated training period in translational research, that includes novel elective one-month rotations focused on pulmonary hypertension therapeutics at the FDA, intramural NIH Clinical Center Regulatory and Pharmacy Development Program, and Industry. With the fundamental tools for human subjects research in hand the trainee will then engage in a two-year intensive training fellowship with our translationally-oriented vascular biology and pulmonary hypertension mentors. The fellowship mentorship will include a basic-science oriented mentor paired with a clinical-science oriented mentor to provide for comprehensive training in basic science with the necessary application to the clinical and patient environment. Projects are focused on patient oriented bench-to-bedside (T1) research, with constant attention to trainee career development. Our faculty include 19 NIH funded investigators with a long- standing history of scientific productivity in pulmonary vascular biolog and successful mentoring. We also include 4 junior training faculty who are highly focused on pulmonary vascular research, are recent recipients of R-level NIH funding, and will be paired with senior mentors to maintain a continuous pipeline of faculty mentors. Substantial institutional support and resources are available through endowments to the VMI and a translational program project directed by Dr. Gladwin. The field of Pulmonary Vascular Biology has matured to the point that we can no longer rely on back door training for the next generation of pulmonary vascular researchers. The proposed training program and the existing investigators and infrastructure at The University of Pittsburgh are strongly positioned to create a novel and rich bench-to-bedside translational training program, designed to address the growing and severe valley of death between basic research discoveries and clinical application."
"9299853","Project Summary  The goal of the proposed study is to identify and determine the function of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in innate immunity. Appropriate activation of the immune response is crucial for host fitness. While effective control of invading pathogens depends on rapid and robust induction of immunity signaling pathways, prolonged or aberrant activation, either systemically or locally, can lead to pathological conditions in humans such as autoimmunity and cancer. Thus both the magnitude and duration of innate immunity signaling need to be tightly regulated. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), exemplified by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), play a critical role in modulating antiviral innate immunity in a wide variety of organisms. Recent advances in deep- sequencing technology and computational biology have greatly expanded the repertoire of regulatory ncRNAs, with circRNAs as the latest addition. Besides their unique configuration, circRNAs are also distinct from their canonical linear RNA siblings by harboring frequent exon scrambling events. Originally viewed as merely by-products of rare ?head-to-tail? splicing events, circRNAs have recently been characterized as an abundant class of RNAs in nematodes, flies, mice and humans. With the exception of only a handful of circRNAs, the function of the vast majority of circRNAs is unknown. We identified a collection of Drosophila circRNAs that are differentially expressed in response to bacterial infection, and our preliminary studies have implicated select circRNAs in modulating innate immunity. We hypothesize that select circRNAs function as modulators of innate immunity signaling, and propose to employ a combination of genomic, computational, genetic, and biochemical approaches to comprehensively discover these enigmatic RNA species, and establish their function in the context of innate immunity signaling.  Completion of the proposed study will establish circRNAs as a novel class of regulatory ncRNAs and uncover their function in modulating innate immunity. This will advance our understanding of their evolutionarily conserved mammalian counterparts, and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying innate immunity signaling and ncRNA function."
"9148677","PROJECT SUMMARY Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are the most toxic lesions in the cell and are known to be effective in cancer treatment. Understanding how ICLs are repaired in cancers will allow us to take advantage of these agents for cancer treatment, to avoid therapy resistance, and to develop biomarkers that can be used to prevent overtreatment for patients who are not responding to these agents. However, despite extensive studies in this area, it remains challenging to come up with a detailed hypothesis and reveal precisely how multiple DNA repair enzymes and pathways act together in ICL repair. This Program Project brings together experts in various aspects of DNA repair pathways and aims at addressing this difficult question. Project 4 focuses on a critical scaffold protein SLX4. Aim 1 of this project will determine the mechanisms underlying the cell cycle- dependent regulation of SLX4-containing protein complexes and investigate how SLX4 and MSH2 complexes act together to promote ICL repair. Aim 2 will define mechanistically how SLX4 and SLX4IP are recruited to DNA damage sites and participate in ICL repair. Aim 3 attempts to uncover the connection between SLX4 complex and FA pathway in ICL repair and further determine the significance of these repair components in cancer therapy. These studies, together with the ones proposed in Projects 1-3, will provide a framework of ICL repair in humans."
"9207066","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal regulation of glycemia (dysglycemia) has a very long time course, from its earliest stage, labeled pre-diabetes, to the onset of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), to the development of clinically detectable microvascular changes and measurable atherosclerosis, to clinically manifest complications with attendant morbidity and mortality. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) focused on the pre-diabetes stage of dysglycemia and demonstrated powerful beneficial effects of lifestyle intervention (ILS) and metformin (MET), compared with placebo (PLBO), in preventing or delaying the onset of T2D over a 3-year period in a high-risk population (n=3234). The DPP also investigated and described the interventions, phenotypic and genotypic risk factors associated with T2D development, the effects of the interventions in the setting of these risk factors, the health economic implications of T2D prevention, and other outcomes of interest. Based on these results, the DPP lifestyle program has been widely implemented. The 11-year follow-up DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS) explored the longer-term effects of T2D prevention, bridging the period between pre-diabetes and T2D, and examined outcomes that required more time to develop than the relatively brief 3-years of DPP. DPPOS showed longer-term salutary effects of the original interventions on T2D prevention and on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Prevention was cost-saving with MET and cost-effective with ILS. Overall, the risk for microvascular disease was significantly greater in subjects who developed T2D and increased with longer duration and higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C). There were no significant differences by treatment group in the prevalence of the aggregate microvascular outcome; however, compared with PLBO and MET, ILS significantly reduced the risk of microvascular disease among women and those who had A1C ?6.5% at study end.  The proposed DPPOS Phase 3 will study the DPPOS cohort for 10 more years, taking advantage of the long-term randomized exposure to MET and the densely phenotyped and genotyped DPPOS cohort (n=2778), which includes nearly 1600 patients with known T2D duration and ~1200 who have not developed T2D, to address yet unanswered questions about long-term exposure to MET and ILS initiated during pre-diabetes. DPPOS Phase 3 will examine outcomes that are of increasing public health concern in the aging population with pre-diabetes and T2D, including the putative benefits of MET on development of CVD and cancer. The main goals of DPPOS Phase 3 are to examine efficiently: 1) the long-term effects of metformin therapy begun in the pre-diabetic phase on risk for CVD and cancer; 2) the long-term effects by intention-to-treat of ILS and MET on further development of T2D and on traditional and more recently recognized complications of dysglycemia, and of their economic impact; and 3) the clinical course of dysglycemia, evaluated by categorical diagnoses (pre-diabetes vs diabetes) and as a continuum, and their associations with the development of complications, including analyses of interactions with DPP interventions and established and novel risk factors."
"9208536","ABSTRACT Ventricular trabeculation and compaction are two distinct but related morphogenetic events that are essential for normal ventricular myocardial wall development. Dysregulation of these events can lead to Left Ventricular Noncompaction (LVNC, MIM300183 and 604169). LVNC is an inherited cardiomyopathy, and is clinically defined by persistent LV trabeculae, increased inter-trabecular recesses, and thin LV walls, particularly at the apex. LVNC is often associated with other congenital heart diseases (CHDs). The etiology and pathogenesis of LVNC are elusive due to the genetic heterogeneity of the patients and the overall lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms orchestrating ventricular trabeculation and compaction. Previously, we have generated a number of genetically modified mouse models which exhibit LVNC. Collectively these studies suggest a hypothesis wherein Dishevelled-associated activator of morphogenesis 1 (Daam1) plays a key regulatory role in directing compaction of the ventricular wall. Daam1 is an effector of non-canonical Wnt Planer Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling and impacts actin polymerization, and Daam1 genetic ablation leads to ventricular noncompaction. We hypothesized that Daam1-mediated signaling is critical to establish cardiomyocyte polarity, sarcomere maturation, and through this process regulates ventricular wall compaction. Project 3 builds upon these findings and will directly address the aforementioned hypothesis. Experiments proposed in Aim 1 will delineate the molecular pathways which give rise to positive and negative regulation of Daam1 activity, and determine their impact on ventricular wall compaction. Experiments proposed in Aim 2 will examine a number of additional LVNC mouse models and test the hypothesis that Daam1-mediated loss of cardiomyocyte polarity constitutes a common underlying molecular etiology for the genesis of LVNC. Collectively, the experiments proposed in Project 3 will provide insight into how ventricular compaction is regulated, establishing novel understanding of signaling pathways that when disrupted result in the pathogenesis of LVNC in mice and potentially in humans."
