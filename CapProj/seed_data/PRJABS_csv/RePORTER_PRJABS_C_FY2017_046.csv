"9365346","ABSTRACT  The increased aromatase activity in the abundant fat tissues of obese men results in enhanced conversion of androgens to estrogens, (estradiol [E2], estrone), leading to high estrogen levels. This in turn sends negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal unit resulting in reduced gonadotropins, and decreased testosterone (T) production and a condition called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HHG). Accordingly, T therapy may only lead to increased substrate (T) for aromatase activity and further E2 increase.  Although weight loss (WL) results in increased T levels, WL by lifestyle change alone is limited by the lower magnitude of rise in T and weight regain which is common. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) can reduce E2 production and increase T but little or no information is available on the efficacy of adding an AI to WL to produce enhanced aromatase inhibition in improving symptoms in obese men with HHG. The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of an AI as an adjunct to WL (AI+WL) compared to WL alone in severely obese men with HHG. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the addition of an AI to WL (diet+exercise) will lead to reversal of the hormonal abnormality in obesity-associated HHG resulting in improvement in hypogonadal symptoms without significant adverse effects on body composition (and metabolic risk factors) and bone. We hypothesize that: 1) AI+ WL will completely reverse the hormonal abnormality in obesity-associated HHG because of the additional effect of an AI over and above that of WL alone in reducing aromatase activity in the expanded adipose tissue volume, 2) AI+ WL will result in greater improvement in muscle strength, muscle mass and symptoms compared to WL alone because of the greater increase in T, 3) AI+WL will lead to a greater increase in lean mass due to a greater increase in T compared to WL alone but may attenuate the loss of fat mass and metabolic improvement from WL due to a greater reduction in E2, and 4) although AI+WL will have the potential of reducing bone mineral density (BMD) and impairing bone quality because of a greater reduction in E2 compared to preservation by WL alone, this will be minimized because of high levels of E2 at baseline and the increased muscle mass. We will randomize 100 obese men with BMI ?35 kg/m2, total T <300 ng/dl, E2 > 40 pmol/L and luteinizing hormone <9 mIU/L to AI, anastrozole (1 mg daily), +WL, or placebo daily+WL for 12 months. Additionally as a secondary aim, we will elucidate the mechanism for our central hypothesis in an integrated manner by using simple/partial correlation and multiple regression analyses to determine which of the hormonal factors and mediators may explain the observed changes in muscle strength and symptoms, muscle mass, body composition (and metabolic risk factors), BMD and bone quality.  Results from this study will establish the utility and safety of AIs in conjunction with WL in men with severe obesity among whom the etiology of hypogonadism is related to excess estrogen production, thus representing a potential strategy among the growing number of obese hypogonadal men."
"9374086","Project Abstract. Children of depressed mothers are at increased risk for developing multiple psychiatric disorders in their lifetime. Devastatingly, these affective and behavioral disorders appear to emerge early in these high risk youth, with some studies showing elevated rates by age 5 or 6?highlighting the need to uncover etiological mechanisms that occur in the first five years of life. One putative mechanism of risk for psychopathology is aberrant responding in reward and social circuitry that is associated with less motivation for and pleasurable enjoyment of positive experiences. However, when, how, and why these reward disruptions emerge is unclear. One possibility is that compromised caregiving during the first years of life may fail to reinforce healthy reward function in offspring, given that warm, synchronous interactions appear to serve as a social reward. The conceptual model of this proposed BRAINS award is that positive reciprocal and synchronous interactions between mother and child during the crucial infant- toddler years may serve to reinforce brain development in offspring reward systems via oxytocin- dopamine-frontostriatal pathways. For children of depressed mothers, this loop may be compromised by less synchronous interactions and the negative impact of these asynchronous interactions may have cascade effects for child social behavior, including affect regulation with and by others, perspective- taking, and empathy, and for child psychiatric illness, especially anxiety and disruptive disorders. Using a multi-method, accelerated longitudinal design, a diverse sample of 160 mothers (half meeting criteria for depression) and first-born children will be recruited into three cohorts (at child age 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months at study entry) and will be assessed yearly for three years. Mother-child synchrony during play will be assessed for each cohort yearly using affective (shared positive affect) and behavioral (harmonious, reciprocal play) indices. Simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an optical imaging technique that is non-restrictive and child-friendly will be used to measure neural responding to mother-child play in both mothers and children at all ages. Mother-child synchrony of neural responding in cortical neural regions implicated in reward responding, social flexibility, synchronous interactions, and mentalizing will also be explored. Starting at child age 3, child neural response to reward and social feedback will be assessed using developmentally-appropriate NIRS reward paradigms. At age 5, children will undergo an fMRI scan to explore activity in and connectivity among reward and social networks. Changes in child prosocial behavior and aggressive behavior and emergence of preschool psychopathology (anxiety, disruptive disorders) will be measured at child ages 3-5.Mother- child bio-behavioral synchrony will be evaluated as a predictor of these changes and the onset of disorder."
"9256995","Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most prevalent persisting adverse effects reported in epidemiological studies of environmental toxicant exposure. Cognitive as well as emotional dysfunction have been found in children after developmental exposure to a wide variety of toxicants including pesticides, heavy metals and polycyclic and polyhalogenated hydrocarbons. Cognitive and emotional impairment are also seen in experimental animal models of developmental neurotoxic exposures, showing the cause-and-effect relationships between developmental toxicant exposure and persisting deficits in learning, memory, attention and anxiety. In our previous research in the Duke University Superfund Research Center (DUSRC) we have demonstrated the adverse effects of organophosphate (OP) pesticide exposures and persisting cognitive as well as emotional effects in rat models. These have been found to be related to OP induced disruptions of the transmitter systems acetylcholine (ACh) as well as the monoamines, dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT). These neurotransmitter systems have been shown in a wide variety of studies to play important roles in the neural bases of cognitive and emotional function. In the next phase of research with rats, we will determine how disruptions of ACh, DA and 5HT across different toxicant classes can impair cognitive and emotional function. We hypothesize that the persisting impacts of pesticides, flame retardants and polycyclic hydrocarbons on cognitive and emotional function involve an adverse outcome pathway converging on this neurotransmitter triad. Pharmacological challenges will determine causative relationships between ACh, DA and 5HT disruption and behavioral impairments. The neurochemical and pharmacological studies will inform our innovative development of therapeutic treatments of persistent cognitive and emotional deficits, directly helping people who have cognitive and emotional dysfunction due to early life neurotoxic exposure. We will complement the classic rat model with the innovative higher throughput zebrafish neurobehavioral model. We will determine conserved neurobehavioral pathways for the neurotoxic induction of cognitive and emotional impairment across toxicant classes. Showing that the ACh, DA and 5HT triad is conserved in the zebrafish model will establish a higher-throughput model to expand the number of chemical exposures that can be evaluated and related to mechanistic changes that underlie behavioral dysfunction. Understanding the neurotransmitter involvement in neurotoxicant induced cognitive and emotional dysfunction will not only provide a common basis for understanding the functional impairments caused by diverse toxicants, it also provides a basis for devising effective therapeutics for neurotoxic damage. This will bring generalized advances to the understanding of neurobehavioral toxicology based on underlying synaptic mechanisms rather than on the behavioral effects of individual chemicals. This multi-component biologically-based investigation progresses beyond classic adverse outcome pathways to an adverse outcome interacting systems approach."

"9330469","2017 CSHL CONFERENCE ON EUKARYOTIC DNA REPLICATION & GENOME MAINTENANCE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This conference will be the 16th biennial meeting on Eukaryotic DNA Replication and Genome Maintenance and follows the highly successful meetings that have been held at Cold Spring Harbor every other year since September 1987. It is the only regularly occurring meeting that is exclusively focused on eukaryotic DNA replication. Because of this focus, the meeting has played a major role in the rapid growth in our understanding of the eukaryotic DNA replication process and how it is integrated into the cell division cycle. This year's conference will be devoted to fundamental research topics related to chromosome duplication, structure and function, and will include important areas of biological research in the areas of cell cycle and growth control, genomic amplification, and the response of the replication apparatus to DNA damage. As the field has moved forward over the past decade, we have placed an increased emphasis on the central role of DNA replication in the DNA damage and replication stress response, and strategies used by cells to minimize threats to genomic integrity arising from DNA replication. The rapid convergence of the DNA replication and DNA damage response fields makes this a timely meeting. The format of the meeting will ensure that recent results are communicated and discussed face-to-face, which will enhance progress and collaboration. The participation of young investigators, minority, and women scientists is strongly encouraged.  The 2017 meeting will include a diverse array of topics, systems, and approaches including studies of chromosomal replication and gene amplification in organisms as diverse as yeast, Drosophila, Xenopus and mammalian cells. Sessions will cover (1) Replication Initiation and Origin Site specification; (2) the Replication Program, Chromatin, and Development (3) Mechanisms that Initiate Replication and ensure fidelity of Replication Fork Progression; (4) how cells respond to Replication Stalling and Replication Fork Stress; (5) integration of DNA replication with the Cell Cycle and with Transcription; (6) the response to DNA damage including Checkpoints and Post-Replication DNA repair; (7) effects on Genome Instability and Mutagenesis when replication is deregulated; (8) Diseases arising from dysfunctional DNA replication, including Cancer and other Chromosome Instability syndromes. Uncontrolled DNA replication is a hallmark of tumors and errors in DNA replication lead to genomic instability, while the process of chromosome replication is a major target for chemo- and radiotherapy. The relevance of this meeting to cancer research, and ultimately to improved therapies, cannot be overemphasized.  Replication of DNA is a fundamental process in all (eukaryotic) life. This meeting will focus on understanding the mechanism by which this process occurs, and how DNA replication contributes to genome stability and maintenance of the epigenetic state of a cell. The intellectual merits of this conference include the opportunity for leading investigators at all stages of their scientific careers to share and discuss their latest results and concepts. The informal peer review in oral and poster sessions is invaluable in providing rapid feedback that will fruitfully steer and accelerate future research. This conference also provides ample opportunity for learning and for building collaborations. We do not plan parallel sessions within the schedule so that all attendees share a common experience, while the secluded venue maximizes the likelihood of productive scientific exchange.  Large, established conferences generally can have significant impact, and this Cold Spring meeting has undoubtedly driven forward research in DNA replication. Unique aspects of this conference that have particularly broad impact are the active participation of younger scientists who will particularly benefit from the opportunity to present their latest ideas. The conference archive (Leading strand video archive accessible by the internet) allows participants to share aspects of the conference with their colleagues who were unable to attend while protecting the right of the presenting authors to present unpublished research."
"9318603","Flexibility of thought and action is a hallmark of human and animal behavior. While the basic mechanism of long-timescale flexibility (synaptic modifications) is largely agreed upon, the neural signatures and mechanistic underpinnings of short-timescale flexibility are not yet understood. Here we investigate the motor cortex (i.e., the primary motor cortex and adjacent premotor areas), which participates in the production of a great variety of behaviors, each requiring different internal computations. Yet it remains unknown how the motor cortex accomplishes this flexibility. Indeed, we lack two very basic pieces of knowledge. First, what physical mechanisms could allow such flexibility? Second, what are the empirical signatures of such mechanisms; how could they be recognized in neural response data? Unfortunately the currently available conceptual and analytical tools are ill-suited to study flexibility- e.g., a typical approach is to characterize a fixed relationship between a neuron's response patterns and a measured stimulus or movement parameter. Viewed using standard tools, neurons in many cognitive and motor areas appear to display complex responses that have little if any reliable relationship with identified quantities. This raises a difficult question: how should one attempt to characterize a system whose central feature is flexibility? A key first step is to be able to identify neural signatures of changing computations. Fortunately, modern theoretical neuroscience offers a key idea: large recurrent networks are reservoirs of response components from which complex computations can be built. Different computations require different components, and components are a unique weighted combination of neurons - a single 'neural dimension' within the n -dimensional space of n neurons. Thus, different computations occur in 'orthogonal subspaces' - disjoint sets of neural dimensions. Does this computational structure exist in biological neural networks? Answering this question requires experiments and analytical tools that can identify this potential signature of flexibility within a population of heterogeneous neural responses. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advance understanding of the ability of the motor cortical system to flexibly and quickly change the computation it performs. This research will have biomedical impact that directly speaks to NINOS goals: improved understanding of the neural basis of movement should lead to better prosthetic technologies, assistive technologies, and treatments for the millions who suffer from motor disorders."
"9313337","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have discovered that the CACNA1A gene, which encodes the P/Q type voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) is bicistronic. The CACNA1A mRNA encodes both the a1A subunit and a second protein, a1ACT, a transcription factor, that is translated as a second open reading frame due to a cryptic internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Simultaneous expression of two proteins in the same cellular mRNA, one of which is a transcription factor, may be a powerful strategy used by calcium channels and other cellular genes to coordinate expression of an ensemble of genes. To understand this new class of IRES and bicistronic genes we will: 1. Determine how the CACNA1A IRES is regulated by RNA-binding proteins and miRNAs; 2. Define the novel properties of bicistronic genes of the VGCC family. 3. Determine whether altered bicistronic gene expression leads to the complex phenotypes of VGCC disorders. This study will help us to understand the biology of bicistronic cellular genes in particular among other VGCCs, the nature of the IRES regulatory mechanisms and proteins they encode, and the possible role in the pathogenesis and treatment of complex human genetic disease."
"9380989","This is a renewal application for the RO1 study ?A longitudinal immunological study for ME/CFS biomarker discovery?. We will recruit and follow-up new cases and a sample of cases of the UK ME/CFS cohort, focusing on detailed immunological and clinical phenotypes and analyses of their inter-relationships. Participants and longitudinal assessments: 110 ME/CFS cases (½ severe, ½ mild-moderate) meeting all of the CDC-19942, Canadian1 and IOM4 criteria will be assessed every 6 to 12 months for 5 time-points, enabling the mapping of changes in biomarker expression onto clinical parameters (and vice versa); to precisely stratify different case types; and to accurately analyse biomarkers at different stages of disease progression and their time-relationship with clinical parameters. Activities and objectives: In a prospective cohort study, we will: i) recruit and follow up a total of 110 ME/CFS cases, of which at least 100 cases will have complete data and sample sets; ii) stratify patients according to trends in symptom severity, a) ?improving?, b) ?stable? or c) ?worsening?, using scores related to pain, fatigue and functional status39. For in-depth immunological profiling, we will: i) conduct detailed ex vivo phenotyping of PBMC populations by flow cytometry; ii) measure the functional response of NK and T cells after in vitro stimulation by flow cytometry; iii) analyze secreted cytokines in supernatants of stimulated PBMC cultures by multiplex bead array; and, iv) genotype donors for MHC Class1 and KIR to inform analysis of flow cytometry data. To integrate analyses and map immunological data onto clinical data and determine whether changes in immune parameters precede, follow, or predict the clinical trajectory, we will: i) quantify correlations between immunological biomarkers and ii) identify biomarkers associated with changes in ME/CFS clinical status. We will consider patients? perspectives, ethical, legal, societal issues at all stages. To ensure quality and maximum research output we will continue using the UK ME/CFS cohort procedures and protocols during the longitudinal follow up of patients. We will follow standardised clinical, data and samples handling and laboratory procedures in the follow up of ME/CFS patients meeting specific clinical criteria. Innovation and Strategic Need: This is, to our knowledge, the first long-term prospective study of ME/CFS to incorporate both ambulatory and severe cases and to include comprehensive clinical data and in-depth immunological profiling. The study is unique for its strict inclusion criteria and detailed clinical phenotyping, adding specificity and validity to our analyses. In the long term, identification of robust biomarkers will allow the correlation of ME/CFS phenotype with disease severity and prognosis and may reveal new options for interventions. Because 1- 2.5 million Americans have ME/CFS4, this study has the potential to improve the lives of a large patient population in the U.S. as well as advance the state of the field in the U.S. and internationally. Patients and stakeholders are involved in all aspects of the research."
"9380741","ABSTRACT Recording the electrical impulses of individual neurons in intact brain circuits in real time has been a longstanding goal in neuroscience. One potentially widely applicable use of voltage recording would be to test postsynaptic responses upon physiological or optogenetic activation of presynaptic partners. Recording a neuron while its inputs are controlled would enable a detailed understanding of how individual neurons process information. This understanding becomes important when circuity is altered in disease, e.g. in the striatum with Parkinson's or Huntington's diseases, as it would help explain the pathogenesis of the mutant phenotype and suggest possible therapies. However, the only way now to reliably measure membrane voltage in vivo is to perform electrophysiology, whose difficulty and low throughput hamper widespread adoption. We aim to develop a new paradigm for determining the input-output relationshps of neurons using genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) and two-photon imaging. GEVIs can provide information on subthreshold voltage changes, which form the basis of neuronal computation and modulate excitability, and on timing and order of neuronal action potentials. These constitute basic essential information required for understanding information processing in brain circuits. However, in vivo voltage imaging is currently limited. No published GEVIs respond with sufficient speed and amplitude for spike detection in single trials under two-photon excitation. In this project, we will develop methods to record electrical activity from individual neurons in the brain at depth using two- photon microscopy. Our approach combines engineering of GEVIs that can respond to two-photon illumination with the establishment of conditions for using GEVIs in brain slices and living brains. Specifically, we will carry out the following aims: (1) Generate brighter and more responsive variants of ASAP2s, the best performer under two-photon excitation, and of Ace-mNeonGreen, a leading performer under one-photon excitation; (2) validate GEVI variants for their ability to report contributions of specific inputs to subthreshold and action potential responses in a variety of neurons of the fly visual system, in single trials, in vivo; and (3) systematically test GEVI performance under two-photon excitation in mouse striatal spiny projection neurons in ex vivo acute brain slices and in living mice in vivo, using GEVIs to determine the role of cell type- specific inputs to a recently discovered phenomenon of long-lasting dendritic voltage plateaus. This project will integrate the expertise of three groups spanning protein engineering, optical method development, and systems neuroscience to improve two-photon imaging of GEVIs so they can be used to image voltage transients in single trials. If successful, this project will open up in vivo two-photon imaging of GEVIs to many interested researchers, potentially catalyzing a transformation in how we measure neuronal responses in living brains."
"9357419","Project 3: Inhibition of radiation-induced phenotype conversion in glioblastoma SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite a tremendous effort in basic science, clinical trials, drug development, and technical advances in surgery and radiation oncology, glioblastoma remains incurable and improvements in overall survival have been marginal. While radiotherapy is still one of the most effective treatment options for glioblastoma, it cannot control the disease over time. This led us to conclude that novel combination therapies are desperately needed to improve radiation treatment outcome for patients suffering from this disease. The studies outlined in this proposal are based on a hypothesis that is backed by our extensive preliminary data and rigorous published data in the literature. Specifically, we hypothesize that radiation causes a phenotype conversion of differentiated glioma cells into therapy-resistant glioma-initiating cells (GICs), and that interfering with this process will increase the efficiency of radiotherapy. The three aims of this study will address this aspect of glioma biology using an innovative tool to track GICs and their progeny, while leveraging the unique resources and expertise available in the proposed UCLA SPORE in Brain Cancer. In Aim 1, we will study spontaneous and radiation-induced phenotype conversion in glioblastoma under different microenvironmental conditions, and determine if this process generates tumorigenic GICs in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will attempt to prevent phenotype conversion of non-tumorigenic cells into GICs using dopamine receptor antagonists. Finally, in Aim 3, we propose a novel clinical trial to test whether quetiapine, a dopamine receptor antagonist, can reduce the number of GICs in patients with recurrent GBM and prolong their survival. If successful, results from these studies could have a wider impact on cancer, as these principles may apply not only to glioblastoma but to many other solid tumors."
"9360054","ABSTRACT Opioid abuse in the USA has recently reached epidemic proportions, with 29,440 of the 47,055 fatalities from drug poisoning in 2014 attributable to either therapeutic opioids or heroin. Prescription opioids such as morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl as well as heroin are widely abused. The recent increase in opioid abuse is mirrored by a skyrocketing 500-1000% increase in the number of pain prescriptions over the last decade, although the abuse of therapeutic opioids is largely a result of diversion. In spite of the alarming statistics it must be acknowledged that pain requires and demands treatment. The role of pain in opioid addiction is murky; with some studies claiming addiction liability is enhanced by pain, yet others claiming that pain is protective. Technically challenging self-administration of morphine, oxycodone and remifentanil in mice (that were developed during the past funding period) will be used to assess the influence of neuropathic pain on phases of the establishment of opioid self-administration followed by cycles of withdrawal (extinction) and relapse (re- exposure). Our preliminary data suggest that neuropathic pain does not alter initial oxycodone self- administration but enhances drug-seeking during extinction and causes an enhanced escalation in drug taking during re-exposure. These findings will be expounded upon in Aims 1a and 1b using different opioid drugs and doses in self-administration protocols. The duration of time after sciatic nerve injury will be a variable since we have recently shown that pain symptoms can dissipate over time due to an increase in constitutive signaling of mu opioid receptors (MOR), yet negative affect continues to incubate over time. Given negative affect accompanies both chronic pain and opioid withdrawal, we will test in Aim1c if inhibiting neuroinflammation (published during the past funding period to be induced both by chronic opioid treatment and chronic pain), or kappa opioid receptors, (that we show in preliminary data have markedly increased function during chronic pain) will modify oxycodone reinforcement behaviors in animals with or without neuropathic pain. To identify MOR cell types and the striatal and/or habenula circuitry that are required for aspects of the opioid reward profile, Aim 2 will use conditional deletion or knock-in strategies to remove or insert MOR in striatal and extra-striatal neurons. Preliminary data shows marked differences in the self-administration profiles of these mice. For example, removing MOR from D1 neurons increases oxycodone consumption and drug seeking during extinction despite a complete absence of oxycodone-induced locomotor sensitization, while the converse is seen in mice lacking MORs on D2 neurons. Electrophysiological analyses will determine if pain alters properties of different striatal neurons following opioid self-administration. Finally, as D2 cells contribute to negative affect during withdrawal, we will use optogenetic stimulation of D2 neurons to show how these neurons modulate drug-seeking in the presence of pain. Together, Project III will assess the circuitry involved in different phases of opioid self- administration and its influence by different pain and dysphoric states."
"9486359","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The outcome of this research will be a demonstration that family health history (FHH) risk data can be used efficiently to deliver more effective healthcare in geographically and ethnically diverse clinical care environments. Although FHH is a standard component of the medical interview its widespread adoption is hindered by three major barriers: (1) a dearth of standard collection methods; (2) the absence of health care provider access to complete FHH information; and (3) the need for clinical guidance for the interpretation and use of FHH. In addition, the time constraints of the busy provider and poor integration of FHH with paper medical records or electronic medical records (EMR) impede its widespread use. We hypothesize that patient- driven and electronic collection of FHH for risk stratification will promote more informed decision-making by patients and providers, and improves adherence to risk-stratified preventive care guidelines. We will use an implementation sciences approach to integrate an innovative FHH system that collects FHH from patients. Intermountain Healthcare will provide the information technology expertise with EMR design to develop an innovative solution to a storage model standard for FHH data as well as a centralized standards-compliant open clinical decision support (OpenCDS) rule development architecture to analyze FHH and to generate evidence-based, individualized, disease risk, preventive care recommendations for both patients and providers. Five health care delivery organizations will participate in this demonstration project: Duke University, the Medical College of Wisconsin, the Air Force, Essential Health, and the Marshfield Clinic. The study will take place in 'real world' clinical, socio-cultural, and demographically diverse (rural, underserved, academic, family medicine) care clinics (n=34) in 6 states (CA, ID, MN, NC, ND, WI) that include genomic medicine 'early adopter' and 'nave' sites, as well as those that are EMR-enabled and others that are not. Using a cluster randomized controlled pragmatic hybrid type III implementation-effectiveness observational study design, we hypothesize we can demonstrate uptake of the Genomic Medicine Model and its clinical and personal utility. We will recruit a minimum of 7000 English or Spanish speaking adults over a 3-year period and we will capture process metrics and outcomes that are measured in the course of usual care. Our goals are: 1)To optimize the collection of patient entered FHH in diverse clinical environments for coronary heart disease, thrombosis, and selected cancers, 2) to export FHH data to an OpenCDS platform and return CDS results to providers and patients (and to EMRs where relevant) and to explore the integration of genetic risk and FHH data at selected sites, 3) to assess the clinical and personal utility of FHH using a pragmatic observational study design to assess reach, adoption, integrity, exposure, and sustainability, and to capture, analyze, and report effectiveness outcomes at each stakeholder level: patient, provider, and clinic/system, and 4) to take a leadership role in the dissemination of guidelines for FHH intervention across in diverse practice settings."
"9346071","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the Drosophila eye, inner photoreceptors (PRs) R7 and R8 mediate color vision and belong to two subtypes, expressing UV-sensitive Rh3 in R7 and Blue-Rh5 in R8 (p subtype), or UV-Rh4 in R7 and Green-Rh6 in R8 (y subtype). Reminiscent of the stochastic distribution of L and M cones in the human retina, the two subtypes are distributed stochastically, with a p:y ratio of 35:65. We have deciphered the gene regulatory network that controls PR subtype specification. The random choice between p and y fate is controlled by stochastic expression of the transcription factor Spineless in 65% of R7s where it induces yR7/Rh4 fate. We have shown that each spineless allele makes an intrinsic stochastic choice to be expressed; however, inter-chromosomal communication synchronizes expression of the two alleles. We will address whether the mechanisms of stochastic choices can be generalized, and why Drosophila uses a stochastic distribution while other species exhibit highly deterministic PR patterning. We will use transcriptomics and cis- regulatory dissection to continue our investigations of PR subtype specification. Finally, we will investigate how PRs that are stochastically determined find their corresponding targets in the optic lobes to convey color information to the brain. Aim 1. Stochastic vs. deterministic choices in photoreceptor determination. Using the MS2 system, manipulation of the spineless proximal promoter and its epigenetic landscape, we will live image spineless transcription in PRs to understand whether spineless is initially stochastically repressed, or if noisy fluctuations are locked-in at a given time. We will analyze the role of spineless in other species, e.g. in butterflies that have two R7s that make independent stochastic choices, and use CRISPR to knock out spineless in these species. Another fly family, Dolichopodidae (Doli), has eyes with alternate stripes of Green and Blue R8s. We will address the regulation and function of spineless in this deterministic process. We will swap the Doli spineless gene into D. melanogaster to make it deterministic. Finally, we will analyze how the neural network is reconfigured in the visual system of males of many fly species to build an improved motion detector. Aim 2. Cis- and trans-regulatory logic of photoreceptor subtype specification. We have obtained a comprehensive knowledge of the gene regulatory network controlling PR determination and the cis-regulation of Rh promoters. However, PR specification precedes Rh expression by two days. We will therefore analyze how early genes (dpr11, dve, warts and melted) are expressed in subtypes of PRs and compare the logic of regulation at several stages for these different genes with functions in PR specification or axon pathfinding. We will compare the early and late transcriptomes of the four types of color as well as polarization PRs and identify potential regulators predicted by our cis-analysis of Rh promoters. Aim 3. How do stochastically determined PRs find their target in the optic lobes? We will investigate whether and how p and y R7 and R8 connect to dedicated subsets of neurons in the medulla and address how these neurons are specified to transmit color information. We will study the role of Ig proteins Dprs and their DIP receptors that allow the matching of PRs and their target in the medulla. Finally, we will study how stochastically determined PRs specify their target neurons or allow survival of pre-existing medulla neurons."
"9352830","PROJECT SUMMARY? Enrichment Program The Enrichment Program of the Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research (CCDTR) is designed to advance research in diabetes translation and promote scientific exchange among Chicago-area and national investigators with research interests in these topics, and to enhance interactions between diabetes researchers and investigators from other fields with relevant expertise. Diabetes translation research encompasses a broad array of research methods from clinical trials to community-based participatory research to cost- effectiveness analysis, and the proposed enrichment program reflects the diversity of these research methods. Successful diabetes translation research also requires that investigators maintain intellectual relationships with the basic sciences and clinical investigation in diabetes. The goals of the Enrichment Program will be achieved through seminars with local and guest speakers, special guest lectureships, the Annual Chicago Diabetes Day (organized in collaboration with the Chicago Diabetes Research Training Center), the Annual Research Symposia of the Chronic Disease Policy Center, and regular workshops in Outcomes Research, Research-in-Progress, Health Economics, and Research Writing. The CCDTR is also closely aligned with NIDDK supported T32 training programs in adult and pediatric endocrinology as well as other training programs relevant to the mission of the center such as an AHRQ T32 and K12 programs in health services and patient-centered outcomes research. Notably, the CCDTR leadership and affiliates are actively involved in programs focused on growing and strengthening the pipeline of underrepresented minorities entering the health care professions. Overall, the CCDTR enrichment program will help to shine a new light on research activities in diabetes translation and will leverage the wide range of diabetes and translation-related research enrichment activities that already occur at the University of Chicago."
"9311283","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Preventing infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus is a public health imperative, but there is currently no effective vaccine. Clinical trials for S. aureus vaccines and immunotherapeutics have focused on preventing infection in adults with a particularly high burden of S. aureus infections, but no efforts have been made to challenge the existing dogma and develop an immunization strategy that will afford early and broad population- based protection. We hypothesize that seemingly benign exposures to S. aureus in early childhood pattern deleterious immune responses, effectively ?trapping? the immune system, a concept introduced by Francis as ?original antigenic sin?. Therefore, we predict that a successful S. aureus vaccine will require an alternative, highly mechanistic approach to vaccine design with the goal of overdriving original antigen sin, and implementation in the pediatric population to deliberately drive the host immune response toward a protective phenotype prior to the establishment of natural suboptimal responses. The studies in this proposal will test this hypothesis using tractable animal models of S. aureus infection and clinical studies in healthy and S. aureus?infected children. Taking advantage of the convergence of natural and vaccine-elicited immunity in our mouse model, we will use a novel vaccine and newly synthesized peptide MHC (pMHC) tetramers as tools to precisely define the mechanisms by which synergistic antibody and T cell responses impact local inflammatory responses and bacterial outgrowth at the tissue level. A mechanistic approach to overdrive infection-patterned immunity in the mouse model will be complemented by a targeted investigation in healthy and S. aureus-infected children to determine the onset and impact of patterned immunity. This clinicotranslational approach is anticipated to lay the foundation for future vaccine trials in the pediatric population."
"9333127","Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke,  relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as  cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While  vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a  dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.    We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center)  to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our  preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores. The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people. Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.    The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and  create a sustainable data-sharing consortia. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.    The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and  revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility."
"9310284","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A Novel Role of Protein S in Blood Coagulation Protein S (PS) is an important anticoagulant, deficiencies of which are one of several known risk factors for thrombophilia and increased risk of blood clots such as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE). In severe cases of PS deficiency, soon after birth infants develop a life-threatening blood clotting disorder called purpura fulminans. However, despite 30 years of study of this important anticoagulant, the exact function of PS is still unknown. Protein S was initially characterized as a cofactor of activated protein C (APC), but PS confers only a modest increase in APC activity. Plasma assays in the absence of APC suggested other important, APC-independent roles of PS. Some reports suggest that PS inhibits prothrombin activation to thrombin, but the validity of those reports has been questioned because of artifacts due to PS multimerization. In 2006, it was shown that PS acts as a cofactor of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in the initiation of coagulation. Our recent work has shown that PS inhibits factor IX (FIXa); importantly, we used conditions, e.g., high concentrations of phospholipid vesicles that avoid artifacts from PS multimers. Our goal is to mechanistically define both the physiologically relevant function of PS and the specificity of PS inhibition of FIXa. We will use a multifaceted approach to identify the regulatory role of PS. Our proposal involves detailed in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies to establish that protein S inhibition of FXa is specific and physiologically important. This proposal consists of two aims: 1) Determine the contact regions between FIX and PS and 2) establish the physiological significance and specificity of protein S inhibition of FIX. Successful completion of our proposal will sharply defie a novel regulatory role of PS that operates independently of APC and TFPI. The knowledge we acquire of the mechanism of this novel regulatory function will enable future development of new therapeutics designed to target the contact point between FIX and PS. Also, inhibitors of PS activity will form the basis of an adjunct therapy for hemophilia, and, by inhibiting hyper- functional FIX, PS could be used in the treatment of X-linked thrombophilia."

"9513662","PROJECT SUMMARY Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is a common, morbid and highly lethal disease. Importantly, there are currently no therapeutic strategies that limit the growth of aneurysms, due in large part to a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of disease and progression. In addition to advanced age, genetic predilection, and male sex, the most important risk factor for AAA is a history of tobacco use. Work from our laboratory has recently shown that subcutaneous infusion of nicotine accelerates experimental AAA formation. Furthermore, we have identified a signaling pathway whereby nicotine induces vascular oxidative stress and NF-?B activation leading to decreased miR-24. Reduced miR-24 activity releases the brake on several inflammatory genes, most notably Chi3l1. Moreover, we have shown that manipulation of this pathway can alter the course of AAA disease. We now propose to leverage this knowledge and discover whether inhaled nicotine has similar effects upon vascular redox state, inflammation, and ultimately AAA formation. The outlined studies will compare different doses of inhaled nicotine vapor and determine relative effects compared to cigarette smoke or subcutaneous delivery. In Specific Aim 1, we will define inhalation protocols that result in serum nicotine (cotinine) levels that mimic moderate-heavy smokers and determine the impact on aortic ROS production, Smad signaling, and ultimately miR-24 levels. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine the downstream impact of inhaled nicotine-induced miR-24 expression upon inflammatory gene expression focusing on Chi3l1. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will investigate the effects of inhaled nicotine upon AAA formation and whether there are gender differences in response. These specific aims will investigate a novel mechanism that may underlie inhaled nicotine-induced vascular inflammation and aneurysm formation as well as provide the basis for advancing future research and clinical translation."
"9322585","ABSTRACT Currently, there are no FDA cleared molecular-based tests for urinary tract infection (UTI) pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to replace the 'gold standard' of dipstick urinalysis and urine culturing. All pathogen identification tests still rely on clinical isolates from urine cultures, largely unchanged from Koch's postulates developed in the 19th century as general guidelines to identify pathogens. What has changed over time, however, is the dramatic and progressive emergence of antibiotic resistance among these pathogens. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) indicate that 70% of the pathogens isolated from hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) now are resistant to at least 2 major classes of antibiotics. Recent developments in molecular diagnostic testing for multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens can provide a sensitive, specific, and real-time solution to support active surveillance-driven infection control interventions, but these PCR-based tests can only be performed on simple specimen matrices such as swabs or positive blood culture media (1:10 blood-to-broth ratio). No molecular-based method is cleared by the FDA to test directly on urine or whole blood samples. The goal of this Commercialization Readiness Pilot (CRP) Grant is to accelerate the commercialization effort of the program outcome from our NIAID SBIR R44AI088756 project titled ?An Integrated Diagnostic System for Rapid Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST)?. We propose technical assistance on regulatory strategy development and cost-effective manufacturing, as well as later stage research and development activities on independent replication of key studies in compliance with FDA requirements and ISO 13485 standards. The goal of our NIAID Advanced Technology SBIR project is to develop and validate RAST (rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing), an integrated and compact diagnostic system that enables clinicians direct point-of-care (POC) with an evidence-based selection of antibiotics for treatment of acute bacterial infections. Our first compact automated system is capable of rapid pathogen identification (ID) and AST directly from patient's samples with evidenced-based information to start patient-specific antimicrobial treatment. It is expected to obtain a CE Mark after the coming ISO 13485 surveillance certification audit in February 2016. However, the FDA clearance is hindered by: (1) no molecular-based predicate test cleared by the FDA for urinary tract infections (UTI), (2) the low cost of conventional dipstick urinalysis tests, and (3) the lack of fresh urine specimens through a multi- site clinical feasibility study. We will overcome these hurdles through the following aims: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE Aim 1: Obtain a risk-based classification of the Class II device through a de novo request with external regulatory assistance from NSF International (an international certification organization) in 18 months Aim 2: Reduce the cost of goods sold of <$3 for cartridge and <$5k for system with external manufacturing development assistance LATE STAGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES Aim 3: Conduct a multi-center clinical performance study and demonstrate >95% clinical sensitivity/specificity and >95% susceptibility categorical agreement In this study, we focus on validating the rapid UTI diagnostic device according to federal regulations 21 CFR 866.2660 (microorganism differentiation and identification device), 21 CFR 866.1640 (antimicrobial susceptibility test powder), and 21 CFR 866.1645 (fully automated, short-term incubation cycle antimicrobial susceptibility testing system). The FDA product codes for such systems are ?JSS? and ?LON.? The regulatory strategy will be finalized in Aim 1 (Regulatory) for preparation of the clinical protocol and multicenter clinical performance study in Aim 3 (Clinical study) that will utilize the cost-effective system and consumables optimized in Aim 2 (Manufacturing)."
"9217573","Project 3: Attenuating RSV with Mutations in Its Methyltransferase  PI: Jianrong Li, DVM, PhD  Abstract:  Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading causative agent of pediatric respiratory tract disease  worldwide. Despite major efforts, there is no vaccine currently available to combat this virus. Live attenuated  vaccines are the most promising vaccine candidates for RSV. However, it has been a challenge to identify  an attenuated RSV strain that has an optimal balance between attenuation and immunogenicity. The  objectives of this project are to rationally attenuate RSV by targeting the viral mRNA cap methyltransferase  (MTase) and to develop MTase-defective viruses as novel live attenuated vaccine candidates for RSV. The  RSV mRNA cap structure is methylated at the guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) and ribose 2?-O positions by a single  conserved region VI (CR-VI) located in the large (L) polymerase protein. Amino acid residues essential for  G-N-7 and/or 2?-O MTase activities will be characterized and will be introduced into an infectious cDNA  clone of RSV. Recombinant RSVs defective in G-N-7 and/or 2?-O MTase activities will be recovered, and  their attenuation in cell culture will be characterized. These recombinant viruses will be tested for their  infectivity and ability to spread in primary, well differentiated, human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. Next,  their replication, pathogenesis, immunogenicity, and capacity to induce protection will be examined in cotton  rats, the best available small animal model for RSV. By adding interferon-producing NS1 mutations (Project  1) and ?repaired G? mutations (Project 2) to the most promising MTase mutations in L to RSV, we expect  that we will generate a panel of ideal RSV vaccine strains that grow well in Vero cells, are attenuated in vitro  and in vivo, genetically stable, and highly immunogenic. These new, improved live RSV vaccine candidates  can then be used for future trials in nonhuman primates."
"9323759","ABSTRACT The suppression of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) from infected individuals is the ultimate goal of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Major advances have been made towards this end with the advent of ART regimens. However, despite the sustained suppression of plasma viremia below detectable limits in infected patients for many years on ART regimens, replication competent virus can still be recovered from a variety of sites within the host, and most notably from long-lived quiescent memory CD4+ T lymphocytes. This viral reservoir represents the final impediment to the eradication and clearance of HIV infection or to a sustained virologic remission in the absence of ART. Currently, our understanding of HIV reservoirs in ART recipients is incomplete. Data assessing the impact of early ART initiation during acute infection on reservoir size are limited, especially in the tissues, as are virologic and immunologic surrogates of remission or control of HIV-1. Recent data from my laboratory has shown that persistent viral reservoirs are established very early in SIV infection [1]. However, very early ART can limit the seeding and expansion of cellular reservoirs of HIV [2-4]. Moreover, ART initiated in the earliest stages could significantly limit the size, location and genetic diversity of the HIV-1 reservoir, thereby improving the chance of a virologic remission. The efficacy of potent latency reversal agents (LRAs) or other immunotherapy delivered to very these early ART-treated reservoirs is unclear. Thus, detailed mechanistic studies are needed to define the impact of early ART on virological and immunologic outcomes that are relevant to achieving HIV remission and durable virus control after the cessation of ART [5]. Such investigations are detailed in this proposal. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine the impact of early ART on the nature and distribution of the SIV reservoir during early viral establishment. 2. Assess SIV distribution and clonal expansion during ART initiation and after ART cessation. 3. Determine the impact of combination immunotherapy (TLR7 agonist and PD-L1) on the stability of the viral reservoir after ART cessation."
"9281530","Multiplex FRET Imaging of Kinase-Epigenome Interregulations in Live Cancer Cells Kinase inhibitors have been applied to mitigate pancreatic cancer development. However, adaptive epigenetic responses including histone modulations can lead to the alteration of large scale gene expressions which can ultimately result in heterogeneous drug resistant responses of cancer cells and life-threatening relapse of diseases. At the current stage, it remains unclear how tyrosine kinase activities are dynamically coupled with epigenetic histone modulations to determine cancer cell responses upon drug treatment. Therefore, investigating and manipulating the regulation of histone modulations and codes have crucial implications in cancer treatment and drug screening. In this proposal, we will harness the power of directed evolution and high-content screening methods to systematically develop fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors for the dynamic monitoring and quantification of crucial histone methylations (H3K4, H3K9, H3K27) in single cells. We will also apply this approach to optimize a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) FRET biosensor for the visualization of FAK kinase activity. Together with an existing Src FRET biosensor optimized by us, these biosensors will be incorporated into the genome of pancreatic cancer cells using CRIPSR to minimize the heterogeneity of signals across different individual cells. We will further incorporate new FRET pairs emitting colors distinct from the popular FRET pair (CFP and YFP) to simultaneously monitor two different signals in the same live cell, e.g. one histone methylation and one kinase activation. Using a common molecular signal as a reference across different individual cells, these crucial molecular events will be mapped together with correlative FRET imaging method (CFIM) developed in our labs to generate dynamic landscapes of kinome-epigenome interactions. Pharmacological reagents will be applied to study their impact on these dynamic landscape of molecular interactions and adaptive epigenetic responses. We will then correlate these multiplex molecular profiles to cancer outcomes under these pharmacological reagents, and hence provide quantified multiplex indices to evaluate drug efficacy at the single-cell level with the goal of minimizing drug resistance. Three specific aims are accordingly proposed: (1) Develop and optimize histone methylation and tyrosine kinase FRET biosensors; (2) Apply CRISPR to genetically engineer FRET biosensors into pancreatic cancer cell lines for the calibration of inhibitor efficacy in single cells; (3) Multiplex imaging of histone methylations and kinase activities in the same PDAC cells for assessing adaptive epigenetic responses upon kinase inhibition. Given the importance and critical needs of new imaging tools to investigate the kinome-epigenome connection in cancer cells, developed FRET biosensors and imaging system should provide powerful means to unravel the molecular network for cancer biology, and allow multiplex and high throughput platform for drug screening with minimal resistance. As such, the success of the project will contribute transformative enabling technologies to the field of cancer research and pharmaceutics, toward an ultimate goal of eradicating pancreatic cancers."
"9395389","Project Summary/Abstract  The organization of proteins, both in space and time, is ubiquitous in natural processes. Engineered protein systems, on the other hand, typically lack this organization. Organizing biosynthetic and regulatory systems promises to improve yields of difficult-to-produce biomolecules and provide insight into the mechanisms of organization-related pathologies. These include many neurodegenerative diseases; spatiotemporal regulation is also implicated in processes of signaling, metabolism, and aging. Self-assembling, heritable proteins, known as prions, offer a promising method to organize biochemical processes in yeast and other organisms, and in turn to reveal principles underlying organization-related dysfunction.  The aims of the proposed research are three-fold: (I) Develop a toolkit of orthogonal prion domains to organize biochemistry; (II) Use prion domains to enhance biosynthesis and organize information flow; and (III) Use systems-level models to identify candidate pathways for prion-based organization. A recently discovered suite of prion-like proteins will be mined systematically for self-assembling domains conferring desirable phenotypes for biosynthetic and regulatory organization. Well-studied and newly discovered prion domains will be used to organize model enzymatic pathways and transcription factors, and to understand the effects of prion-based organization. Opioid synthesis will also be organized in this manner in order to improve titers and yields. Finally, a spatially resolved reaction-diffusion model will be implemented to examine the function of prion-based organization in detail and predict pathways that will benefit from organization in an intracellular prion phase. This model will make quantitative predictions of experimentally inaccessible quantities, such as the detailed concentration gradients within prion-based membraneless organelles.  Engineering the spatiotemporal organization of biosynthetic processes has the potential to greatly increase our ability to generate useful quantities of recalcitrant biomolecules. These could range from opioid molecules and their precursors to complex macrocyclic antimicrobial compounds, all of which resist chemical synthesis and lack high-yielding biosynthetic routes. Understanding the mechanisms and function of prion-based organization also promises to reveal strategies to combat human pathologies, a growing number of which are found to be related to aberrant protein organization."
"9305119","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury remains a significant problem in the US and globally, affecting 3-5/1000 liveborn infants in the US, and contributing to 23% of neonatal deaths globally. Therapeutic hypothermia decreases the outcomes of death and neurodevelopmental disability, but only by approximately 15%, so outcomes remain poor for 50% of affected, treated infants. Biomarkers that accurately reflect the degree of brain injury the timing and evolution of injury, and response to therapy are critically needed for clinical management of these patients and for research. Ideal biomarkers would differentiate infants who do not require treatment from those at risk of permanent sequelae; infants that might benefit from intervention from those for whom treatment is futile; and would identify infants who are within a therapeutic window for a specific treatment. Such biomarkers would also be important for research because they would allow for the accurate identification of at-risk infants, decreasing variability among enrolled subjects, thereby decreasing the numbers of patients required for adequately powered studies. We have developed a nonhuman primate model of perinatal asphyxia in which brain injury is induced by occlusion of the umbilical cord prior to birth. Our nonhuman primate model provides an unmatched opportunity to assess circulating and excreted metabolites and proteins after a timed injury, and to study structural biomarkers as brain injury evolves. The response to therapeutic hypothermia will be determined, and potential biomarkers will be correlated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. Finally, at necropsy, this clinical information can be correlated to pathologic outcomes. We hypothesize that by combining sequential metabolomic, proteomic, and structural assessments, we will develop an assessment panel for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) that will, with high sensitivity and specificity, diagnose early severity of illness, prognosis, and likely response to therapeutic hypothermia with long term neurodevelopmental status as a final outcome. Using a macaque nemestrina model of HIE we will develop: 1) Sensitive and specific diagnostic early biomarkers of severity of acute brain injury. To ensure accuracy of categorization, we will use neurobehavioral and structural (MRI and necropsy) outcomes at 6 months of age as a gold standard; 2) Early prognostic biomarkers of long term outcomes of HIE, using sequential evaluations of the proteome, metabolome, MRI and MRS to correlate individual acute response to injury with long-term structural and functional outcomes; and 3) We will develop biomarkers which predict an individual's response to therapeutic hypothermia. Results of this study will be directly applicable to both clinical practice, and will also advance the field by defining biomarkes that can be used for research purposes."
"9341215","Project Summary/Abstract ? Clinical Intervention and Translational Core Clinical research is such a priority for the Colorado NORC that we have a scientific core laboratory devoted to fostering clinical research. The Clinical Intervention and Translation Core (CIT) of the Colorado NORC began operation in August of 2010, year 16 of this grant. It was created because of a growing need by many NORC users for help with a wide range of clinical research studies involving modification of body weight, diet and exercise to evaluate impact on a range of physiological and behavioral outcomes. During the first 15 years of funding for the Colorado NORC, we experienced substantial growth in the number of investigators in the user base interested in weight management and in assessing the impact of diet and exercise interventions on health. This gave us the opportunity to create a center of excellence in weight loss maintenance and behavioral interventions, that we believed could make substantial contributions to the scientific underpinnings to the national agenda to address the problem of obesity. The CIT takes advantage of the newly built Anschutz Health and Wellness Center (AHWC), a 95,000 sq ft state-of-art center for supporting lifestyle intervention studies. The CIT offers consultations for NORC researchers interested in designing and implementing clinical or translational research involving nutrition, physical activity, weight management and wellness. This includes consultation on research design, target populations, outcome assessment, and study implementation. The CIT has expertise in conducting research in traditional clinical settings and in schools, worksites and communities. In addition, the CIT core offers a number of different programs for producing and maintaining weight loss including the Colorado Weigh, My New Weigh, The State of Slim, Destination Boot Camp and others. NORC investigators can use these programs in their research studies. Costs of the programs will be negotiated with individual researchers and costs depend on the level of involvement of CIT staff. The CIT Core has worked to support the development and implementation of exercise interventions for research projects as well. The 30,000 sq ft fitness facility at the AHWC has state of the art cardio and resistance training exercise equipment (Technogym, Cesena Italy) that utilizes a ?key? system that provides sophisticated ?supervision? and monitoring of compliance with a prescribed exercise intervention. This technology allows accurate reporting of the actual bouts of exercise performed by individual subjects participating in an exercise training program. Over the next 5 years, the CIT will increase activities in support of m and ehealth interventions, electronic information systems support for ?personalized medicine? projects, support for epidemiological and cost benefit studies as well as continuing the work in physical activity and nutritional interventions."
"9217553","The overall goal of this project is to identify new therapies that target influenza virus replication. The global health burden of annual influenza epidemics coupled with the emergence of highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus has highlighted the urgent need for new effective treatments A primary concern with the current drugs (amantadines and neuraminidase inhibitors) used to treat influenza is the development of resistance mutations that negate therapeutic benefit. Published evidence suggests that targeting the influenza virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a rational approach for antiviral therapy. The RdRp is responsible for a number of functions including 5'cap recognition, endonuclease activity, replication, transcription, and polyadenylation. Recently, cryo-EM reconstitution studies identified branchedribonucleoproteins (RNPs) structures as putative replication interhiediates and suggested a mechanism for viral replication by a second polymerase activity on the RNP template . The second polymerase activity is believed to be a function ofthe polymerase complex. Clearly, the RdRp provides multiple functional domains that could be targets for antiviral drug therapy. Previous studies showed that mutations in the conserved regions of PB1 subunit of the polymerase complex produce inactive RNA polymerase. We hypothesize that compounds that specifically target the polymerase complex might reduce the frequency of escape mutations, or promote escape mutants that are unfit for replication. We have recently identified potential hit compounds from previous HTS screens that significantly inhibit the influenza virus polymerase activity in an RdRp transient assay. These hit compounds were effective against three different strains of influenza viruses in CPE assays. We propose to characterize these compounds and use high-throughput screening (HTS) of novel small molecule libraries to identify anti-polymerase candidate compounds, chemically optimize them, and establish their effectiveness in an influenza mouse model.  \"
"9360610","We propose a concurrent multiphoton magnetic resonance imaging (COMPMRI) system for mouse imaging, in response to RFA-EY-16-001, BRAIN Initiative: New Concepts and Early-Stage Research for Large-Scale Recording and Modulation in the Nervous System (R21).

To understand molecular cellular origin of the large-scale neural activity, we need simultaneous imaging both at cellular resolution and over the whole brain, which is concurrent MPM and MRI as in our proposed COMPMRI. Furthermore, we will leverage our latest breakthrough in MPM using 3-photon excitation with long wavelength that enables through-skull cellular resolution imaging, making it possible to perform MPM at multiple cortical regions. Our proposed COMPMRI will take advantage of this 3-photon microscopy and the large bore size of a 3T human MRI system to scan the brain of a live mouse.

"9350365","Project Summary Molecular motor proteins operate in a complex and crowded cellular environment. Many cargos have opposing motors bound simultaneously; these motors may operate in teams functioning either cooperatively or competitively during organelle transport. High resolution live cell imaging of organelle dynamics suggests that, in addition to vesicular transport, opposing motors drive organelle dynamics including cytoskeletal switching, membrane tethering, and membrane tubulation. Here we will focus on the role of oppositely directed motors at two critical junctures in cellular organelle trafficking: early endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). We will use in vitro models with increasing complexity to dissect the mechanisms involved, and compare these studies to the dynamics observed in live cells imaged with high temporal and spatial regulation. Specifically, we will focus on the following three aims: (1) To examine the interactions of opposing motors bound to the same cargo, including actin-based and microtubule-based motors, at microtubule-actin filament intersections both in vitro and in the cell. We hypothesize that the tuning of motor parameters determines outcomes at intersections, giving cells an adaptable toolbox to regulate organelle dynamics. We will develop this hypothesis in vitro, starting with myosin-1b and kinesin-1 motors in crossed filament assays and moving to more realistic models of the cellular cytoskeleton using nets of crossed actin filaments and intersecting microtubules. We will develop membrane tubulation assays at cytoskeletal intersections using multiple motors. We will then test the predictions of the model for motor function during tubulation at the TGN in cellular assays. (2) To examine the role of opposing dynein and kinesin-3 motors in modulating membrane tubulation and cargo sorting at early endosomes. We hypothesize that the dynamically balanced forces of opposing dynein and kinesin-3 (KIF16B) motors act at early endosomes to induce tubulation and to facilitate cargo sorting. We will model lipid dynamics induced by the opposing activities of these motors in vitro, and compare these observations to the dynamics of tubulation and sorting of early endosomes in live cell studies. (3) To examine the role of the microtubule-organelle linker protein Hook1 and the BAR-domain protein sorting nexin-6 (SNX6) in the regulation of motor function during endosome tubulation. We hypothesize that the microtubule-organelle linker Hook1 interacts with dynein and dynactin to coordinate the dynamics of sorting and tubulation at the early endosome. SNX6 binds to dynactin and has also been proposed to regulate tubulation at the early endosome. Here, we will examine the roles of Hook1 and SNX6 in regulating tubulation using comparative in vitro reconstitution and live cell imaging approaches. Together, these studies will provide insights into the roles of the three molecular motor families in regulating organelle motility, morphology and remodeling. The guiding hypothesis will be that motors generate asymmetrical forces to move organelles but also to remodel organelle membranes, leading to dynamic sorting and trafficking in the cell."
"9351670","Summary/Abstract While the structure of the adult intestinal stem cell niche has become well defined, little is know about the structure and regulation of the immature stem cell niche. In the adult mammalian crypt, dedicated stem cells are referred to as Crypt Base Columnar (CBC) cells are regulated by interdigitated Paneth cells in the small intestine and a subtype of goblet cells in the large intestine. Here we propose that the immature stem cell compartment is regulated by cells analogous to the Paneth and goblet cells, that regulate growth and transformation of an immature stem cell niche into the adult structure. Using the advantages of external development and transparency of the zebrafish model system to manipulate and visualize the developing intestine, we identify regulatory cells within the immature stem cell compartment, which differentiate at the fold base beginning at the end of embryogenesis and continuing through juvenile phase. Preliminary data indicates that these cells are involved negative regulation of epithelial proliferation and there are two different groups, one group that differentiates during the first half of juvenile period and a second group that forms as the intestine matures to the adult structure. In Aim 1 we will focus on disrupting the function of these cells to determine their role in regulation of the architecture of the developing stem cell compartment leading up to maturation of the adult intestinal stem cell compartment. In Aim 2 we will determine whether the identified regulatory cells modulate epithelial proliferation by modulating the Wnt pathway. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine whether thyroid hormone plays a role in differentiation of the group of regulatory cells that differentiates as the intestine matures to the adult structure. Together, these studies will identify new features of the network controlling growth of the immature stem cell compartment as it matures into the adult structure. In the long term, this work has the potential to shed light on intestinal diseases resulting from congenital defects due to errors during establishment of the intestinal epithelial stem cell compartment."

"9323319","Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center ? Core C  Project Summary Project Summary  Composition, architecture, and structure across physiological hierarchies, at the organ, tissue,  matrix and nanoscale-levels, are key intermediate traits that link gene expression with functional  outcomes; however, analysis of these traits requires advanced and costly instruments and  supporting expertise in chemistry, engineering, and biomedical imaging. The Structural and  Compositional Assessment Core (Core C) will provide access to the facilities and skilled  knowledgeable experts necessary to quantify composition, architecture, and structure of all  musculoskeletal tissues. Core C will include micro-Computed Tomography (µCT), nano-  Computed Tomography (nano-CT), in-vivo micro-Computed Tomography (in-vivo µCT) and  Raman spectroscopy as its major components. These technologies were chosen for their broad  applicability and their large user base at the University of Michigan. Investigators at Michigan  pioneered the use of µCT and Raman spectroscopy to study musculoskeletal tissues and are  leaders in applying these technologies to solve musculoskeletal problems. Core C will leverage  their expertise to support the current Research Community, both intellectually and financially, in  performing structural and compositional analyses of all musculoskeletal tissues. Core C will also  focus, as part of its mission, on expanding its offerings to enhance the opportunities available  and to expand the Research Community. Four Aims are proposed: the Core will provide  expertise and guidance on the design of experiments in Aim 1, and in Aim 2, access to state-of-  the-art technologies and experts to allow quantification of tissue composition, architecture, and  structure and training in these in methods. Further, in Aim 3, the Core will provide guidance with  interpretation of results and make recommendations for future studies. Lastly, the overall goal of  Aim 4 is to enable the research community through ongoing technology development and  education. Genetic and/or environmental perturbations often lead to measureable changes in  structure and architecture that have mechanical and other functional consequences. Therefore,  accurately quantifying these traits is critical to advancing understanding of the mechanisms  underlying musculoskeletal biology and health and to develop and evaluate strategies for the  prevention and treatment of disease."

"9323757","ABSTRACT Antiretroviral therapy blocks HIV replication, but is not curative, as quiescent integrated HIV DNA is not eradicated by classical drugs. HIV reservoirs of latently infected cells persist indefinitely in infected patients even after long-term periods of treatment and cause rapid viral rebound if the treatment is stopped. Our identification of some patients who were able to durably control viremia after therapy discontinuation (Post- Treatment Controllers, PTCs) introduced the concept of sustained HIV remission and provided proof of concept that such status is achievable at least in some patients. HIV remission in PTCs is characterized by the presence of infected cells, although at low levels. This implies that this situation of long-term viral control requires balanced interactions between HIV-1 and the host. Yet, intriguingly, PTCs do not have the genetic, clinical or immunological characteristics that are commonly found in the rare patients able to naturally control HIV-1 without therapeutic intervention (HIV controllers). HIV remission appears to be favored by the early initiation of antiretroviral treatment and its maintenance for several years before discontinuation. We believe that PTCs benefited from an early treatment that limited the establishment of viral reservoirs and allowed optimal maturation/priming and preservation of critical immune responses. However, only a small fraction of early and durably treated patients are able to control infection after treatment interruption. There is therefore an urgent need to identify the precise mechanisms associated with post-treatment control of infection and define biomarkers that predict the outcome of cART discontinuation. For this, it will be essential to better understand (i) the dynamics of the establishment and maintenance of cellular HIV reservoirs, (ii) the interplay between immune responses and infected cells, and (iii) the impact of early cART on these parameters. We will compare immunological and virological parameters in PTCs and in patients on effective long-term cART, initiated during primary or chronic HIV-infection. We will use empirical analyses and mathematical modeling to (i) define correlates of protection that could identify ART-receiving patients with the highest probability to achieve HIV remission; and (ii) provide a detailed characterization of the effect of treatment initiation on the pattern and the size of the viral reservoirs and immune responses and how this impact the dynamics of viral rebound at the time of treatment initiation. To develop this project we will benefit of access to unique samples from patients in ANRS PRIMO and ANRS VISCONTI Cohorts and to the empirical data generated in a large non-human primate study of 66 SIV-infected macaques initiating cART at different times and maintaining the treatment for 2 years before interruption."
"9360122","The association between smoking and suicide has been repeatedly documented, yet the proposition that smoking contributes directly to suicide risk is controversial and definitive evidence remains elusive. However, a growing body of research suggests that smoking may directly increase risk for psychiatric disorders, which would likely increase suicide risk. The global aim of this proposal is to examine whether smoking is a contributing cause for suicide and more proximal adverse mental health outcomes. We will leverage state tobacco control policy changes as natural experiments that lead to reduced prevalence of smoking. We propose that, as a result of their influence on smoking, these policy interventions also influence risk for suicide and mental health problems, including substance misuse. We will examine whether strengthening of tobacco control policies results in reduced risk for suicide and for adverse mental health outcomes. Furthermore, we will examine whether these associations are specific to smokers, as predicted by our model. We discuss our proof-of-concept study, which shows that strengthening of state tobacco control policies corresponds to reductions in suicide risk. We propose a three-year study that seeks to extend this finding using data on over one million survey participants with smoking measurements and prospective mortality follow-up. This will enable a much a much stronger analytical design than our initial study. We will also examine the associations of tobacco policy changes with psychiatric disorders and other adverse mental health outcomes, including suicidal behavior. This will enable us to identify specific channels through which smoking might influence mental health. We will take advantage of large, nationally representative epidemiological data to conduct these analyses and apply sophisticated analytic techniques that reduce the role of observed and unobserved confounders. These studies would have substantial impact on science by being a part of an emerging body of work that is challenging the traditional interpretation of the smoking-mental health link being due to ?self-medication.? This work will also have impact on public health and policy by providing key parameters to cost/benefit analyses of tobacco control policies. Confirmation of our hypotheses could result in increased awareness of the importance of smoking cessation for mental health patients, and also prompt basic researchers to more closely scrutinize the influence of nicotine on phenotypes relevant to mental health. This latter contribution could be critical as emerging tobacco products grow in popularity."
"9334091","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex, heterogeneous condition that is the most common cause of disability in the aging population. The hallmarks of the pathophysiology of OA are the breakdown of cartilage in joints and the associated changes in adjacent soft tissue and subchondral bone that lead to debilitating joint symptoms such as pain. The public health impact of OA, especially knee OA, has and will continue to increase dramatically, but there are no FDA-approved disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs), i.e., drugs designed to delay or avert the OA-related structural changes to cartilage and bone. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been made, however, that have improved our understanding of the relationship between pathology and the structural changes to cartilage, subchondral bone and the surrounding soft tissues of the joint in OA. The proposed study builds on the strengths of two ongoing studies, the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and the Pivotal OAI MRI Analyses (POMA), an ancillary proposal to the OAI. The OAI was designed to address the lack of biomarkers for the development and progression of knee OA. Through POMA, we have utilized the OAI MRIs to identify imaging biomarkers of knee OA development and progression up to 48 months prior to the onset of radiographic knee OA (ROA). The overall objective of this proposal is to take advantage of a time-limited opportunity to build on our prior work and leverage the wealth of longitudinal data, including high-resolution MRI imaging at 3 Tesla(T), which has already been accumulated in the OAI. We will be able test whether structural changes detectable by MRI predict the onset of radiographic knee osteoarthritis (ROA) and the development of important clinical outcomes 24 months to 120 months later, and therefore much earlier in the disease course than currently established. A 120-month visit will be added to the OAI for participants with knees that did not have ROA at baseline. The specific aims are to identify imaging biomarkers of the development of incident radiographic knee OA (ROA) earlier in the disease course; and to identify the association of imaging biomarkers with changes in pain, function and performance associated with the onset of radiographic knee OA. Ultimately, this line of research will help to identify key risk factors for the development of OA and OA structural disease progression, and to identify potential targets for preventative and/or therapeutic interventions."
"9344568","Abstract  Despite the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), central nervous system (CNS) disease remains a significant challenge in patients with HIV. The abuse of drugs such as heroin is associated with treatment non-compliance, greater risk of viral transmission, and more rapid clinical progression of HIV disease. The overarching hypothesis behind the present project is that the analysis of molecular profiles of neuronal and glia cells will reveal key genes that are dysregulated by HIV and by the interaction of HIV with heroin abuse, resulting in cognitive impairments and depression. Their identification will point to transformative new mechanistic hypotheses on neuroAIDS pathogenesis and, consequently, to novel therapeutic targets to improve neuropsychological functioning in people with HIV. To test the present hypothesis, we propose to use validated systems biology strategies for the reconstruction and interrogation of a genome-scale integrated gene regulatory network (interactome) using gene profiles by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) from HIV-1 transgenic (Tg) and wild-type rats in a state-of-the-art paradigm of voluntary intravenous drug self-administration under long access (LgA) conditions, which leads to dependent heroin intake, and short access (ShA) conditions, which is characterized by a non-dependent, more ?recreational? pattern of heroin use. Because of the pivotal roles of glia cells in the pathogenesis of neuronal dysfunction in the setting of neuroAIDS as well as in neuroinflammatory processes induced by drugs of abuse such as opiates, for the proposed interactome we will profile neurons, astrocytes and microglia purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from key brain regions involved in the effects of HIV and drug dependence. We will interrogate the interactome to identify the gene network dysregulations driven by the interaction of HIV and dependent and non-dependent heroin intake. Specific mechanistic hypotheses derived from interactome reconstruction and interrogation will be tested with viral vector-mediated overexpression or down-regulation and genetically modified rats and mice in conjunction with additional rounds of gene expression profiling, behavioral analyses and neuropathology analyses to elucidate their contributions to the effects of HIV and heroin on cognition, depression-like behavior, and neurodegeneration.  Central nervous system (CNS) disease remains a pressing problem in the HIV pandemic despite the introduction of cART. Injection drug use is associated with treatment non-compliance, greater risk of viral transmission, and more rapid clinical progression of HIV disease. The present proposal will bring to bear a systems biology approach to identify and test new mechanistic hypotheses that may lead to novel transformative therapeutic concepts to improve neuropsychological functioning in people with HIV."
"9323595","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV-infection from a fatal to manageable disease but adherence to ART remains critical to optimize outcomes. Existing measures of ART adherence such as self-report, pill counts, electronic pill-bottle caps, and prescription refills, provide only inferred measures of actual drug intake and most offer no real-time notification capability. Directly observed therapy measures actual drug intake but is not practical. These limitations constrain research into medication adherence and more importantly, limit our ability to develop real-time interventions based on feasible, in vivo monitoring of adherence among HIV-infected people to facilitate medication-taking. The Proteus digital health feedback (PDHF) system, a pill ingestible sensor based adherence measuring and monitoring system developed by Proteus Digital Health, addresses these limitations. It involves use of an ingestible sensor, a tiny edible material that i over-encapsulated along with prescribed medication. The sensor is activated by ingestion and is sensed by a patch worn by the patient with an embedded monitor and sensor. The monitor sends a Bluetooth signal to a mobile device, which in turn sends an encrypted message to a central server, thus effecting real-time monitoring that a dose has been taken. We propose to develop a data receiving hub and add to these components an automated text message that is sent to the patient when a dose is missed. The ingestible sensor and patch monitor system is already FDA-approved as safe, but has yet to be tested in HIV- infected patients in clinical setting. The first goals of this study are to confirm the bioavailability of over- encapsulated antiretrovirals (ARVs) and to pilot-test the use of the PDHF system in 15 participants prescribed ARVs to test and identify approaches that optimize the use of this measuring and monitoring system. The next goals are to determine the system's feasibility, acceptability, sustainability, accuracy and efficacy in fostering ART adherence. Feasibility, acceptability and sustainability will be assessed by patients' rating of the system and the rate of dropping off from using the system. Accuracy will be evaluated by the associations between adherence to ART measured by the PDHF system and other adherence measures such as plasma drug level concentrations of ARVs and self-report. Efficacy will be assessed by comparing adherence of participants assigned to the PDHF system and participants assigned to usual care (UC) over time, with exploratory outcomes of viral load and CD4. We will recruit 120 of HIV-infected patients 18 years or older with sub-optimal adherence. Participants will be randomized to receive the PDHF system or UC for 16 weeks with monthly assessments. The durability of effects of the PDHF system after stopping the use of the system will be determined during a 12-week follow-up stage. In summary, we will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of using the PDHF system; assess the accuracy of the PDHF system in measuring adherence to ART; and evaluate the efficacy of the PDHF system for monitoring and leveraging adherence to ART. 1"
"9114565","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal seeks to conduct FDA-required pre-clinical testing of a retinal prosthesis designed and assembled by our team at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Our retinal prosthesis is designed to restore vision to patients who are blind from either retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or age-related macular degeneration (AMD).  There is no treatment to restore lost vision for either disease, although promising research in other fields also offers some hope of being able to help these patients.  RP is the leading cause of inherited blindness in the world and is particularly devastating because it causes a slowly progressive loss of vision across the entire visual field of both eyes.  AMD, which is the leading cause of blindness in the industrialized world, causes loss of central vision that robs a patient of being able to read or easily recognize faces.  Our prosthetic system is composed of two components.  The first component is a modified pair of glasses that contains an ultra-small camera that captures details of a visual scene; the glasses are connected to a cell phone-like device that processes the visual images.  The digital visual signal and operating power are sent wirelessly to the second component of the prosthetic system, which is implanted around the back of the eye.  The implanted component receives the visual signal and a custom-designed computer chip uses the incoming operating power to distribute electrical pulses to the retina.  These electrical pulses will initiate nerve impulses t the brain via the optic nerve.  The primary goal of this prosthesis is to improve the quality-of-lie of severely blind patients by allowing them to navigate in unfamiliar environments.  Once achieved, the device also has the potential to facilitate other activities of daily living, like reding street signs, addresses on buildings, bathroom designations (i.e. male vs. female), and finding and reaching accurately for glasses, plates, and utensils, among other things.  The quality of vision that can be restored depends substantially upon the number of stimulation channels, or pixels.  Our device has the largest number (256) of individually-controllable stimulation channels of any neural prosthetic device in the world.  This relatively large number of stimulation channels should provide higher quality vision compared to the other devices.  Following completion of the work described in this grant proposal, our team would hope to receive an FDA approval to conduct a subsequent Phase I safety study of our device."
"9410944","PROJECT SUMMARY Men who have sex with men (MSM) are the most at-risk group for contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the U.S., comprising 67% of new HIV diagnoses in 2014. However, the HIV epidemic impacts some groups of MSM disproportionately. Latino MSM comprise 25.1% of new HIV infections among MSM between the ages of 13 and 29 years. The daily medication tenofovir/emtricitabine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in 2012 and has demonstrated strong efficacy in reducing the risk of HIV infection. When taken consistently, PrEP has been shown to reduce new incidence of HIV by 92%. Despite the promise of PrEP to transform HIV prevention, there remain significant barriers to PrEP use among those who would benefit the most, resulting in low rates of uptake. Although Latino MSM have reported the lowest use of PrEP (6.6%), they also reported the greatest willingness to use PrEP compared to White and Black MSM. There have been no known interventions that have been designed to assist Latino MSM with accessing PrEP-related health care or adhering to PrEP. Patient navigation may be an ideal intervention to aid in PrEP uptake among Latino MSM by assisting individuals in overcoming barriers to obtaining and using PrEP. To our knowledge, no known patient navigation programs for PrEP have been developed for Latino MSM. The objectives of this proposed study are to develop, pretest, produce, and pilot test a patient navigation intervention designed to address multiple components of the PrEP cascade among Latino MSM between the age of 18 and 29. During Phase 1, qualitative data will be collected through 30 in-depth interviews to assess needs and assets of young adult Latino MSM regarding engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade. From these findings, health care provider and staff feedback, and through the guidance of a Participatory Planning Group, a patient navigation intervention will be developed and pre-tested through 25 in-depth interviews. During Phase 2, the patient navigation intervention will be pilot-tested with 60 young adult Latino MSM. The patient navigation intervention will be compared to usual care plus written information to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study methods, as well as the intervention's potential in improving engagement and retention in PrEP-related care. The project will investigate the following specific aims: 1) to assess the needs and assets of young adult Latino MSM regarding engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade; 2) to develop, pretest, and produce a patient navigation intervention designed to facilitate engagement and retention in the PrEP cascade among young adult Latino MSM; and 3) to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the patient navigation intervention by comparing it to usual care to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact. The proposed study has significant public health implications and is expected to contribute to efforts to reduce HIV-related disparities and increase adherence to PrEP."
"9281739","The goal of the proposed project, Health and Wellbeing Impact of Contamination of Traditional Food and Water  on the Navajo, is to determine health risks and community impacts (e.g., consumption issues, threats to cultural  values, spiritual concerns, and public health impacts) from exposure to environmental uranium and arsenic  contamination of traditional food and water for Navajo communities. The approach for this project is to utilize a  community-engaged research model to explore exposure pathways and to identify culturally applicable and  community-constructed models for mitigation of the impact of the identified chemical contaminants on Navajo  communities. An outcome of this project is the development of a model that will support culturally relevant and  community-created policy with respect to contaminated traditional foods and water that will be scalable to other  Native American communities, and potentially beyond those communities to other environmentally impacted  cultural communities. The Specific Aims of the proposed project are to: 1) Characterize the extent of metal  contamination in culturally significant food and water sources for two Navajo communities; 2) Model dietary  metal exposure and utilize the Indigenous Health Indicator to assess health impact; and 3) Develop a  Community-Participatory Multi-Level Policy Intervention Model. Uranium associated with abandoned uranium  mines and arsenic in traditional food such as sheep as well as water are a major concern to the Navajo. Aim 1  will determine the extent of contamination in the food and water sources of the two Navajo communities.  Following initial characterization of metal contamination, field work with subsequent chemical analysis is  proposed. Aim 2 will focus on collecting a dietary history of individuals in the Navajo communities to model  uranium and arsenic exposure through consumption of traditional foods and water. Community level socio-  cultural public health pathways will be identified and evaluated. The physiological exposure pathways and  socio-cultural significance will be integrated in a culturally relevant and effective impact assessment model  called the Indigenous Health Indicator (IHI) developed by Swinomish tribal environmental health workers. In  Aim 3, results from Aims 1 and 2 will be utilized to develop a culturally-relevant policy focused on  contamination of traditional Native American foods. We are proposing to deploy a culturally directed,  empirically tested model that will allow Native American communities to establish (and assess) culturally  applicable environmental health interventions. It will be important in the policy work to consult with the  Traditional Knowledge Holders from the tribes to best shape policies around traditional food consumption. We  believe that this approach will result in policy that other Native American tribes can adapt to address  contamination of traditional foods in their communities."
"9323536","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Most real world visual scenes are complex and crowded. Instead of a single isolated object, multiple objects compete for attention and directed action. Thus, any purposeful action requires the selection of a single goal from multiple possibilities. In daily life, the ability to orient attention, select an appropriate target, and direct various types of visually-guided actions towards the selected target is normally taken for granted. Its importance only becomes apparent once the system fails. This project aims to determine how multiple  systems are integrated to select a target from among many possibilities within complex visual scenes and select an appropriate action in response. The proposed research will examine whether brain motor areas that independently generate saccadic eye movements and reaching movements also participate in target selection for the respective motor responses (effector-specific target selection). The project will also assess  whether saccade-related brain regions are involved in more abstract, general-purpose target selection for other actions besides saccades, such as reaching (effector-general target selection). Finally, the proposed research will investigate whether mechanisms for effector-general target selection encode the history of target selection for both saccades and reaching movements across trials."
"9355497","Project Summary/Abstract Cellular transitions are fundamental to many steps of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Such transitions are broadly studied, but general models have been historically limited to qualitative descriptions. This contrasts with phase transitions in physical systems, which are well characterized within the context of the physico- chemical laws, and can be partially understood, in a predictive capacity, using simple, precise models such as the Ising model. Such models are based upon a system of interacting lattice sites. A parameter (e.g. Temperature) is varied, and the fluctuations of the lattice sites are analyzed as the system approaches and passes through a critical point. All critical system-specific details are captured in the interactions between the lattice sites, and the models can yield specific, experimentally verifiable predictions. Ising-like in silico models have guided theoretical studies of transitions in various gene or protein regulatory networks, although resultant predictions can be challenging to experimentally test. We seek a general approach where the experimental input is a statistically large number of single cell measurements, with many protein and metabolite analytes quantitatively measured per cell. From this data we capture the fluctuations and thereby determine the analyte-analyte correlations. In an Ising model analogy, such measurements define the site interactions. These inputs permit straightforward theoretic models for resolving cellular steady states, transitions between steady states, and for making testable predictions. Studies of the chemically-induced-carcinogenesis transition provide preliminary data/proof of concept. For Aim 1 we develop a picture of cancer cell steady states using integrated metabolic and proteomic single cell assays on cancer models of Glioblastoma Multiforme and Melanoma. In Aims 2 and 3 we expand this approach to two apparent cellular transitions associated with resistance against targeted therapies: the adaptation of heterogeneous brain cancers to certain targeted inhibitors, and a drug-induced cellular de-differentiation observed in melanomas and other tumors in response to immunotherapy and targeted inhibitors. All aims are joint experiment/theory aims. Aims 2-3 involve in vivo testing of predictions, as well as exome sequencing and global RNA-seq kinetic studies to complement the single cell kinetic analyses. Anticipated outcomes of the work include a general, quantitative approach towards describing cellular transitions associated with cancer. Further, we propose to mine those descriptions of cellular transitions to identify therapy combinations that are designed to hit targets that drive tumor growth, as well as those that drive the transition (and thus promote resistance) Preliminary data to support of this goal is provided. Additionally, guidance for non-continuous therapy dosing (e.g. metronomic or pulsatile regimens) that exploit knowledge of the kinetics, barriers, and reversibility of the transition to resistance is anticipated"
"9310339","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a painful, deadly, and incurable disease for which effective treatments remain to be discovered and tested. The OVERALL OBJECTIVES of this study are to define mechanisms underlying the regulation of PDAC cell growth, by focusing on further characterizing a novel pathway for which individual components can be targeted pharmacologically. Previous studies along with our preliminary data indicate that mitotic aberrations and PDAC cell growth, two highly interrelated processes, rely on signaling from Aurora A (AurkA) to the HP1?-G9a pathway. Mutations or aberrant expression of either AurkA or the HP1?-G9a complex are implicated in the development of neoplasms of different origins, including PDAC. We will test the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that a novel AurkA-HP1?-G9a pathway regulates mitotic progression and PDAC cell growth in a manner amenable to pharmacological inhibition using combination therapy. Congruently, our SPECIFIC AIMS are: 1. To characterize the function of the HP1?-G9a complex as a downstream mediator of the effects of AurkA on mitotic progression in PDAC cells; 2. To characterize cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to the inhibitory effects of the AurkA-HP1?-G9a pathway on PDAC growth; and 3. To characterize the effects of combined targeting of the AurkA-HP1?-G9a pathway on PDAC progression in orthotopic xenografts and genetically engineered mice models. Thus, our research will span from the level of molecules to cell populations to the whole organism. These studies are feasible for our laboratory, which has developed the appropriate conceptual framework, reagents, trained personnel and established collaborations to execute the proposed research. The design of this proposal is innovative as it seeks to maximize the yield of new mechanistic knowledge and pharmacological interventions, which impact on PDAC tumor growth. Since PDAC is a dismal disease, the discovery and proposed study of this novel AurkA-HP1?-G9a pathway bears significant biomedical relevance."

The goal of this screening and development project is to utilize high-throughput in vitro screens and select infection models with an established track record for projecting human antifungal therapy outcomes to identify novel antimicrobial natural product scaffolds from the ICBG collection. The UW Antimicrobial Testing Facility has extensive experience with clinically relevant in vitro and murine models for the drug-resistant fungal pathogens on which AP5 is focusing. Studies from this facility have frequently been used in FDA submissions. This Facility will perform both the primary, secondary and in vivo assays along with the pharmacological assays needed to select high-value antifungal drugs. In fact, the above UW facility has successfully utilized these tools to discern the clinical efficacy of more than 100 individual compounds, including more than a dozen that have progressed into clinical use. The Facility has designed a natural product compound progression plan to use efficacy and safety in these in vitro screen and clinically relevant in vivo models as an early decision point in lead optimization. AP4 will work closely with the other APs, especially AP2 and AP5, to test promising compounds that advance from AP1, AP2, and AP3 via a logical and progressive screening and development plan."
"9324203","ABSTRACT  Iron homeostasis is tightly regulated to provide this critical element for growth and survival, but to prevent the toxicity of iron excess. Abnormal regulation of systemic iron balance leads to common diseases including anemia and the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis. Hepcidin is a master regulator of overall body iron balance that acts by downregulating the cell-surface expression of the iron exporter ferroportin to control iron absorption from the diet and iron release from body stores. However, the mechanisms by which iron levels are sensed by the liver to regulate hepcidin expression are not fully understood. We have previously demonstrated that 1) hemojuvelin (HJV) is a co-receptor for the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-SMAD signaling pathway, which is a central transcriptional regulator of hepcidin expression in the liver, 2) BMP6 is a key endogenous ligand of HJV in the regulation of hepcidin expression and systemic iron balance, 3) the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway is critical to hepcidin regulation by iron, 4) there are at least two mechanisms by which iron activates the BMP-SMAD pathway: liver iron induces liver BMP6 mRNA expression and circulating iron stimulates SMAD signaling downstream of BMP6, 5) the BMP- SMAD signaling pathway intersects with most other known hepcidin regulatory pathways including the hemochromatosis proteins HFE and TFR2 and inflammation, and 6) modulators of the BMP-SMAD pathway regulate hepcidin expression to treat hemochromatosis and anemia of chronic disease in animal models. These studies have already yielded important insights into the pathophysiology of hemochromatosis and have identified the BMP-SMAD pathway as a novel therapeutic target for iron disorders. In this competing renewal, we will address important unanswered questions about how iron is sensed by the liver to regulate hepcidin, and the key role of the BMP-SMAD pathway in this process. In Specific Aim I, we will use our novel conditional Bmp6 KO mice in specific liver cell populations to determine the cellular source of BMP6 that regulates hepcidin expression, and we will use in vitro approaches together with an in vivo bioluminescence assay in mice to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying iron-mediated BMP6 induction. In Specific Aim II, we will use genetic and pharmacologic approaches in vivo coupled with biochemical and cell culture studies to identify other specific functional components of the BMP-SMAD signaling cascade that are critical for hepcidin regulation and iron homeostasis. The long-term goals of this project are to understand the role of the BMP signaling pathway in regulating hepcidin expression and systemic iron balance, to gain insights into the physiology and pathophysiology of iron homeostasis in health and disease, and ultimately to develop new therapeutic strategies for treating disorders of iron metabolism."
"9322294","PROJECT SUMMARY Temporal lobe epilepsy associated with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is common, frequently difficult to treat medically and therefore many patients have epilepsy surgery. Although temporal lobe resections are often successful at stopping seizures this approach usually fails to improve the commonly identified memory comorbidities and can make those impairments worse. A therapeutic approach in which MTS is modified in a way that reduces epileptic phenomena and leads to an improvement in memory would have a major impact on the quality of life of many patients with MTS. Implantation of interneuron precursors has been shown to reduce seizures and improve cognition. We hypothesize that transplanted interneuron precursors will restore temporal organization of hippocampal pyramidal cells thereby improving abnormalities in rate, temporal and population coding that underpins normal cognitive behavior. In addition they will also minimize hypersynchrony leading to seizure reduction. We propose to study interactions between multiple simultaneously firing hippocampal neurons recorded from CA1 and CA3 bilaterally in awake, freely moving rodents during foraging and during an active place-avoidance task. Systems level changes at the level of rate coding, temporal coding and population coding will be compared between implanted and non-implanted rats. We will use standard and novel analytical tools developed in our laboratories to apply to these data. A detailed systems level understanding of how neural networks need to change in order to improve disease outcomes will guide optimization of cell based therapies and will provide a target for other interventions such as electrical stimulation or optogenetics."
"9322469","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a major cause of blindness. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the primary risk factor for glaucomatous optic nerve damage and reducing IOP remains the only treatment for all forms of glaucoma. Loss of the ability to appropriately regulate the outflow resistance, i.e. to maintain IOP homeostasis, due to a variety of genetic or environmental causes, is a hallmark of much of glaucoma. Understanding the mechanisms regulating IOP homeostasis, which is the focus of this proposal, is thus central to improved function based therapy for this common blinding disease.  Our prior studies point to the following framework for IOP regulation. Extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, initiated by trabecular meshwork (TM) matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is required to maintain the aqueous humor outflow resistance and thus IOP. In response to a significant and sustained pressure change, the outflow pathway initiates an IOP homeostatic response in which adjustments are made to the outflow resistance, thus restoring IOP to within a narrow normal range. TM ECM turnover is central to this process. Sustained pressure changes are sensed by cells within the juxtacanalicular region of the TM and/or Schlemm's canal (SC) inner wall as mechanical stretching or distortion. These cells then initiated a complex program of ECM turnover to adjust the outflow resistance over several days' time and restore IOP to within acceptable bounds. In addition, outflow is highly segmental around the circumference of the eye, which has dramatic consequences for understanding all aspects of outflow facility and the mechanisms of IOP homeostasis.  We propose two aims focused on unraveling the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating IOP homeostatic outflow resistance adjustments. These studies will rely primarily on TM and SC cell culture and perfused anterior segment organ culture. Specific Aim 1 will entail detailed molecular comparisons of high flow regions with low flow regions for 1x vs. 2x perfusion pressures at a series of time points during which the IOP homeostatic resistance adjustment is occurring using both normal and glaucoma eyes. Methods will include: quantitative RT-PCR, PCR arrays, direct regional dissection, and laser capture microdissection as well as confocal immunohistochemistry, Western immunoblots, and ELISAs. Specific Aim 2 will be to identify the signal transduction pathways that regulate the regional outflow resistance changes that occur in response to the 1x to 2x pressure change. This will include assessing activation states of key components of select signal transduction pathways and transcriptional modulators. Verification of involvement in the IOP homeostatic process will include using pathway inhibitors or activators and genetic manipulation of pathway components via RNAi and gene overexpression to modulate specific pathway components and thus affect the IOP homeostatic process. This detailed molecular and cellular understanding of how the IOP homeostatic process is regulated in normal and glaucomatous eyes will provide new targets to restore this homeostatic process in glaucomatous eyes."
"9379771","PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to understand genome biology and the consequences of genetic variation on individual health depends heavily on technologies that allow researchers to read and write DNA. Sequencing technologies have recently seen dramatic improvements that have made personal genomes affordable for virtually any laboratory and even directly available to consumers. Yet the corresponding DNA synthesis technologies lag far behind these developments, causing a major hindrance in synthetic biology efforts to study genes, variants, and genomes of interest by synthesizing them. This proposal aims to develop a novel DNA synthesis technology to address the greatest challenge faced by current platforms: maintaining sufficient accuracy for precision applications and throughput for large-scale applications while remaining cost-effective for accessibility. To achieve this, the traditional phosphoramidite method of synthesizing DNA oligonucleotides will be adapted onto nanoparticular beads, which will be moved through droplets containing synthesis reagents along a plasmonic surface array. This `conveyer belt' will be optically controlled via C-shaped engravings (CSEs) that concentrate light from below, serving as optical traps. In this way, the beads and reagent droplets can be individually, rapidly transported to specific optical traps in multiple lanes simply by changing the illumination wavelengths, allowing millions of unique oligonucleotides to be synthesized simultaneously on a single array. By tailoring the reagent droplet size and concentration depending on synthesis scale, the method will be optimized to target the entire bead surface, maximize yield, and eliminate excess reagent usage. Quality will be assessed by testing synthesis of diverse DNA sequences. The main advantages of this novel DNA synthesis platform will include: 1) faster reactions (cycle time 45 sec), 2) lower error rate due to decreased acid exposure (<1:1000), 3) high yield (>5 attomoles/bead), 4) increased length of oligonucleotides (>300 bases) due to cleaner synthesis, 6) significantly less hazardous waste production, 7) generation of >25 million unique oligonucleotide sequences in a single run that can be individually isolated for downstream applications, and 8) a cost of $0.0000001/base, two orders of magnitude less than the least expensive method currently available. A DNA synthesis technology with these properties will enable unprecedented genomic investigations, allowing researchers to test the functional and clinical impact of thousands of genes and genetic variants."
"9394212","Project Summary Proper blood cell formation by rare, self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM) results from a complex series of fate decisions that are controlled via an array of genetic, epigenetic and metabolic programs. Notably, mutations in genes regulating these programs often lead to HSC dysfunction and/or the development of hematological malignancies. Recently, somatic mutations in pre-RNA splicing factors such as U2AF1 have been observed in hematopoietic cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous and difficult-to-treat clonal blood disorder characterized by cytopenias in one or more blood lineages and the potential to evolve into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Notably, U2AF1 mutations are considered early events in MDS pathogenesis, suggesting that aberrant pre-RNA splicing in HSCs drives the evolution to disease by deregulating HSC fate. However, the role of U2AF1 in regulating HSC function in normal hematopoiesis, and the contribution of mutant U2AF1 to disease is unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that MDS, AML and other hematological malignancies are associated with prior or concurrent onset of chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and obesity, and indeed MDS itself is typically characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and hyperactive innate immune signaling. Moreover, inflammatory signals such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) can directly impact HSC fate, leading to overproduction of myeloid cells at the expense of self-renewal and balanced lineage output. Strikingly, U2AF1 has been shown to play an important role in regulating cellular responses to inflammation by generating anti-inflammatory splice forms of key immune signaling genes such as MyD88. Thus, we hypothesize that U2AF1 plays a critical role in regulating HSC responses to inflammatory signals, with aberrant splicing leading to hyperactive responses to inflammatory signals, resulting in a positive feedback loop that promotes deregulated blood production and altered HSC self-renewal. We propose that aberrant mRNA splicing and inflammation are therefore mechanistically linked and are crucial drivers of hematopoietic dysfunction and, potentially, evolution to MDS and other blood disorders. This proposal seeks to identify how pre-RNA splicing, and U2AF1 in particular, regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs in the context of inflammation using a combination of in vitro assays and in vivo mouse models of chronic inflammation using WT and U2AF1S34F transgenic mice. These investigations will fill a significant gap in our understanding of how aberrant splicing promote hematopoietic dysfunction and eventual progression to malignancy, by investigating whether aberrant splicing in U2AF1 mutant HSCs exacerbates their response to inflammatory signaling. Collectively, they will provide needed insight into the role of U2AF1 in regulating HSC responses to inflammation and stand to identify a previously unexplored link between aberrant pre-RNA splicing, chronic inflammation, and the pathogenesis of complex blood disorders such as MDS."
"9407931","PCHPI Project Summary Essentially every step in the HIV life cycle interfaces intimately with the host cell machinery. The Pittsburgh Center of HIV Protein Interactions will focus on the steps and interactions that occur with the host after engagement of cell surface receptors and membrane fusion through integration of the viral genome into that of the host, the so called ?early events?. Several essential molecular interactions and enzymatic activities occur within this time window, necessary for productive progression of the viral life cycle. Thus, it represents a pivotal period in the infection process, during which the susceptibility of the virus to disruptive interventions is likely to be high and little explored. Broadly speaking, the processes that we will focus on include uncoating (the process by which the capsid disassembles), reverse transcription, evasion from innate immune factors, nuclear entry and integration. Given the importance of the capsid structure and its interactions for many of these processes, we will also explore maturation and in particular formation of the capsid core. We plan to build on our successes and apply the extensive and complementary experimental expertise of our team to carry out 1) biochemical and high-resolution structure studies of individual proteins and complexes, 2) biochemical, biophysical, and proteomics analyses to identify novel interactions and complexes, 3) virology and imaging studies to understand protein function in the context of the cell and virus infection, and 4) computational analyses to elucidate the physical basis of capsid formation and capsid interactions with binding partners. Broadly, the program comprises projects on capsid interactions, the engagement of Vpr with the DNA repair machinery, and retroviral intasome structure. Further, we plan two new Technology Development Programs, one to develop nanocrystal screening specifically for MicroED and the other to develop ultra-fast MAS NMR methods for structure determination of native particles."

"9256998","Duke University?s Superfund Research Center examines the problem of early life exposure to hazardous chemicals and later life consequences. Project 4 addresses this issue in an ecological context, and takes advantage of real world case of multigenerational exposures to mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). An important aspect of long term environmental pollution, often associated with Superfund sites, is that of adaptations by exposed organisms over multiple generations that improve the abilities of populations to thrive in polluted ecosystems but also incur fitness costs. Of particular importance in this regard is the phenomenon of pollution-driven genetic adaptation, that is, the potential for pollution to act as a significant selection pressure potentially driving evolution. This phenomenon of ?evolutionary toxicology? has important ramifications for environmental science and management, including conservation biology, the elucidation of fitness costs, environmental risk assessment, and the evaluation of remediation efforts. Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) inhabiting the Elizabeth River in the Tidewater region of Virginia provide an excellent ?natural experiment? for exploring this phenomenon. Moreover, this system is very relevant to the goals of the Superfund Research Program ? several areas are highly contaminated with mixtures of PAHs emitted by wood treatment plants, including a designated Superfund site, and other contaminants. The Project?s Specific Aims are: 1. To elucidate ?omic differences among Elizabeth River subpopulations of killifish reflecting different PAH exposure histories. 2. To determine associated physiological impacts (e.g. fitness costs) in these subpopulations, including deficits of bioenergetics, aerobic performance and behavior, and in a subset of these populations, evaluate responses to natural stressors (hypoxia and temperature). 3. To determine the persistent and transgenerational effects of PAHs on mitochondrial structure and function and associated organismal impacts using zebrafish and killifish. 4. To monitor temporal responses of selected endpoints in killifish populations from a site undergoing remediation for PAHs, a site high in PAHs not being remediated, and a low PAH reference site. This proposed research project will build upon previous DUSRC research and involve integrated field and laboratory studies utilizing two piscine models ? the Atlantic killifish and zebrafish (Danio rerio). Field studies will center focus on several subpopulations of killifish inhabiting discrete sites in the Elizabeth River that cover a large gradient of PAH contamination, and include sites undergoing remediation. These studies will elucidate relationships among PAH exposures and selected aspects of molecular biology in these populations, as well as their responses to remediation. Laboratory studies will employ offspring of wild- caught killifish to explore fitness costs associated with adaptation to PAH contaminated environments. Studies with both killifish and zebrafish will elucidate impacts of PAH exposures mitochondrial structure and function and associated impacts on aerobic performance and behavior."

"9322631","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excess body weight is a major public health crisis in the United States and worldwide. Although the essential cause for obesity is an imbalance in energy intake v. expenditure, the indirect causes leading to this imbalance are complex and multifaceted. Numerous studies have found that insufficient sleep increases risk of weight gain and unhealthy behavioral patterns (increased caloric intake, decreased physical activity). Stress is also an important indirect factor for obesity, and stress and sleep deficiency exacerbate one another. Unfortunately, very little is known about how stress and sleep interact and manifest behaviorally for individuals in the natural environment. Findings from this study will contribute t the scientific literature base by providing data about the interrelationships between social rhythms, sleep and weight gain after involuntary job loss, a life event that is often stressful and disrupting to an individual's daily routine. The investigative team will enroll 250 participants ina prospective, longitudinal 18-month design. They will employ gold-standard assessments of social rhythms, sleep, weight gain, and dietary intake and energy expenditure in order to further specify the mechanisms by which weight gain occurs. They will also employ multivariate, growth curve modeling to elicit valuable information about the temporal precedence of changes in social rhythms, sleep, and weight gain. It is proposed that: (1) unemployed individuals with less consistent social rhythms and worse sleep will have steeper weight gain trajectories over 18 months than unemployed individuals with stable social rhythms and better sleep; (2) disrupted sleep mediates the relationship between social rhythm disruption and weight gain; and (3) reemployment is associated with a reversal in the negative trajectories outlined above. Overall support for these aims will indicate that sleep and social rhythms operate as mechanisms of weight gain in the aftermath of involuntary job loss. Moreover, these findings will advance obesity research by testing the interrelationships among daily behavioral activity, sleep, and stress in the natural environment. Positive findings will provide solid support for the development of prevention campaigns targeting sleep and social rhythms in an accessible subgroup of vulnerable individuals."
"9332329","Increased acquisition in the Step/Phambili trials, coupled with the lack of efficacy in HVTN-505 indicate that vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cell responses can mitigate protection and, in some cases, increase acquisition. This frames a major issue in HIV vaccine development; how to elicit the CD4+ T cell responses necessary for B cell help without increasing the numbers or phenotypes of target cells for HIV infection that attenuate protection? Early studies in non-human primates (NHPs) showed that immunization with a varicella zoster gp120-SIV (VZV-gp120) dramatically increased SIV replication, prefiguring the Step/Phambili trials. NHP studies following the AdHu5 efficacy trials confirmed that AdHu5 immunization increases transmission of SIV, probably due to the increase of mucosal CD4+ CCR5+ T cells that appears to be a general property of this vector system. In this Program, we show that the ability of vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cells to attenuate protection extends to other vector systems and to subunit protein-adjuvant formulations in NHPs. Currently, there is no direct test of the hypothesis that vaccine elicited CD4+ T cells can attenuate antibody-mediated protection. This gap in knowledge is a key problem in HIV vaccine development. Our long-term goal is to develop an effective HIV vaccine, which is supported by our overall objective in this project to determine whether vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cells play a causal role in attenuating antibody-mediated protection. The central hypothesis of this project is that vaccine-elicited CD4+CCR5+ T cells can attenuate passive protection by a broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody. This hypothesis was developed pursuant to NHP protection studies where inverse correlations between protection in repeat low-dose challenge studies and levels of vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cells are observed, even at putative protective antibody titers. Our approach will employ a new glycan-shield bnmAb, N60-B1.1, which passively protects NHPs against a rectal high-dose challenge with SHIV162P3. N60- B1.1 will be used to test whether vaccine-elicited CD4+ CCR5+ T cells attenuate its protective efficacy. The rationale for the proposed research is that if vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cell responses attenuate N60-B1.1 protection, causality will be demonstrated between such responses and attenuated antibody-mediated protection. Testing our central hypothesis and thereby accomplishing our overall objective will be pursued via three specific Aims. Aim 1 will titrate N60-B1.1 to define a dose that affords optimal sensitivity for attenuation by vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cell responses. Aim 3 will directly test the hypothesis that AdHu5 vector-elicited CD4+ T cells attenuate the efficacy of passively administered N60-B1.1 against a high-dose rectal challenge with SHIV162P3. This will be accomplished using an AdHu5-SIV-Gag/Tat immunogen that is known to elicit high levels of rectal CD4+ CCR5+ T cells. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that subunit/adjuvant-elicited CD4+ T cells attenuate the efficacy of passively administered N60-B1.1. This will employ a Gag/Tat subunit protein formulated in Iscomatrix, an adjuvant that our preliminary data shows favors acquisition over protection."
"9315875","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-HL-14-019 Low-Cost, Pragmatic, Patient-Centered Randomized Controlled Intervention Trials. Cardiopulmonary arrest is the critical illness resulting from sudden cessation of heart function and circulatory blood flow. Sudden out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (OHCA) is a major public health problem, affecting over 300,000 persons in the United States each year, with only 8% surviving. Successful cardiac arrest resuscitation requires delivery of life-saving oxygen to the heart and brain. Airway management is the process of opening the mouth and throat to deliver oxygen to the lungs for circulation to the vital organs. Paramedics commonly accomplish airway management using endotracheal intubation (ETI), the insertion of a plastic breathing tube through the mouth and into the trachea. However, paramedic ETI is risky and resource intensive. Supraglottic airways (SGA - such as the King Laryngeal Tube, Combitube, and Laryngeal Mask Airway) are simpler alternatives but have unproven outcomes. The best strategy for OHCA airway management remains unknown. We propose a multicenter pragmatic clinical trial comparing 1) ETI with 2) SGA airway management in paramedic resuscitation of adult OHCA. We will carry out the trial using the massive existing infrastructure of the NHLBI-funded Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC), a highly successful 10-city collaborative specializing in OHCA trials. The aims of the study are:  ? Specific Aim I: Prepare the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium for execution of a pragmatic trial of  airway management strategies in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest. Per the RFA, we will complete  preparatory tasks necessary to carry out the trial. ? Specific Aim II: Determine the effect of paramedic airway management strategy (SGA vs. ETI) upon outcomes after adult OHCA. We will test the hypothesis that rates of OHCA 72-hour survival are higher with SGA- than ETI-based airway management strategies. This landmark trial will answer one of the most urgent and controversial clinical questions in OHCA care; What is the best way to manage the airway? The study findings will have immediate and lasting impact upon paramedic clinical practices internationally. ROC is the only network in the world poised to efficiently carry out a trial of this design and magnitude. The study will be spearheaded by the world's leading experts in out-of- hospital airway management and cardiopulmonary arrest."
"9294134","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Technological advances have hyper-accelerated gene discovery and hold great promise of bringing genomic technologies to the clinic as a first-stage diagnostic tool. However, many challenges remain to reach that goal, including the fact that variable penetrance and expressivity are highly prevalent, even in traditional monogenic traits and that our understanding of the genetic mechanisms that contribute to phenotypic variability remain largely elusive. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) has served as a useful model for understanding genetic architecture and for dissecting second-site modification in humans. As part of our long-standing investigations, we have identified a significant fraction of causal BBS genes, we have interrogated the nature of second-site modification and we have developed in vivo tools to dissect the effect of variants on the phenotype and model epistasis. Further, we have unified BBS and other clinically-overlapping disorders under the ciliopathy umbrella and have shown that the distribution and nature of dysfunction in the primary cilium and its anchoring structure, the basal body, can inform disease causality and severity. Our competing renewal is composed of three Aims. First, saturated nextgen sequencing of the ciliary proteome, as well as more traditional studies, have identified primary mutations in ~80% of BBS patients. We propose to use whole exome sequencing in families bereft of causal ciliary mutations to identify novel BBS genes. Second, our preliminary data suggest that CNVs are a major contributor to the mutational burden of BBS and other ciliopathies. As such, we will use a custom-designed CGH array with ultra-high density across the ciliary proteome to systematically identify the CNV burden in these disorders and to uncover both causal and potential epistatic interactions. Finally, we have significant new data that implicate the proteasome as a protagonist for the diverse signaling defects observed in BBS animal models and patients. We will therefore ask whether pharmacological agonists of proteasomal activity are of therapeutic benefit to BBS animal models by assessing whether administration of such compounds to mouse BBS models can improve phenotypic outcomes in key sites of pathology. Taken together, our studies will a) illuminate new pathogenic mechanisms orthogonal to the ciliary disease paradigms; b) enrich our understanding on the contribution of CNVs in ciliopathies, and inform genetic architecture; and c) provide the first therapeutic lead that, if successful, would b suitable for clinical trials."
"9325006","MMPC-UCD MICROBIOME RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT ABSTRACT (RESEARCH PROJECT)  Bariatric surgeries, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), achieve rapid improvements in glucose homeostasis and long-term maintenance of reduced body weight. Obesity in humans and rodent models is associated with changes in the gut microbiota and bariatric surgery produces significant changes in the gut microbiota in obese humans; after RYGB the gut microbiota more closely resembles that of lean individuals. Similar changes are seen in rodent models of bariatric surgery; both RYGB and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) produce significant changes in the gut microbiota. The diversity of the gut microbiota and abundance at phyla and genera level differ in the different regions of the GI tract in rodent diet-induced obesity. How these changes in the microbiota in the different gut regions contribute to body weight gain or insulin resistance, or how these are modified after bariatric surgery is not known. The overarching goal of this study is to determine how the gut microbiota contributes to the physiological improvements seen with RYGB. A further goal of this proposal is to establish the pipeline to measure, analyze and integrate data from metabolomics and transcriptomics with the microbial community taxonomic profiles using bioinformatics tools and multivariate modeling. This project will utilize the expertise, resources, and services of all 4 Cores in our MMPC-UCD: Animal Care (Core B) and the 3 Phenotyping Cores (C, D, and E). Further, the metabolomic and functional characterization of the microbiota and host as well as the integrative analyses will be made available as Core services to clients of our Center. In Specific Aim I, the temporal and regional microbiota, host and microbial transcriptome, and metabolome of the intestinal tract after RYGB surgery will be determined. The hypothesis to be tested is that the gene expression and metabolism of the microbiota after RYGB induce changes in energy balance in the host that result in maintenance of weight loss and improved glucose homeostasis. Using a multi- omic (metagenomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic) approach, the microbial community and metabolome of the luminal microbiota in the small and large intestine during both the active weight loss phase and stable weight maintenance phase after sham or RYGB surgery in male and female mice will be determined. The transcriptional responses of the gut and microbial population will be characterized, and data used to identify important biological pathways involved in the beneficial response to RYGB surgery. Specific Aim II will determine whether transplantation of RYGB microbiota protects mice from the deleterious effects of a HFD. The hypothesis to be tested is that that the RYGB microbiota regulates host physiology through production of metabolites and altered host-microbe crosstalk to decrease body weight and adiposity, and improve metabolic status. Contents from different regions of the gut from sham or RYGB mice will be used to colonize male and female germ-free mice subsequently challenged with low-fat diet (LFD) or HFD. The multi-omic approach developed in Specific Aim I will be used to identify microbial populations, and to characterize the transcriptional responses and metabolites of the gut, luminal contents, liver and skeletal muscle. We anticipate that we will identify a number of metabolites and a transcriptional signature that distinguishes RYGB microbiota recipients from sham recipients and that changes in metabolites and transcription are involved in the mechanisms bestowing protection from the negative effects of a HFD."
"9397970","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a severe disorder that affects 3-7% of all pregnancies. It is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preeclampsia is characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation. Left untreated, it can lead to maternal seizures, multi-organ failure, and death. Delivery is the only cure, which often necessitates preterm birth. Despite extensive investigation, the etiology of preeclampsia is poorly understood. Improved understanding of the disease could significantly improve clinical care for pregnant women. Recently metabolomics (i.e., metabolic profiling, meaning the examination of cellular metabolites such as sugars, amino acids, organic acids, nucleotides, and lipids) has emerged as a promising technique for understanding complex diseases, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. This approach is also useful for understanding disorders of pregnancy, since maternal metabolites represent the output of a network of interactions between maternal, fetal, and placental compartments. Initial metabolic profiling experiments in women with preeclampsia have demonstrated altered metabolites; however, these studies have significant limitations. Specifically, (1) the metabolic signatures reported in women with preeclampsia have been unique in each study; (2) subgroups of women with preeclampsia have been analyzed together (i.e., those with early- and late-onset disease); (3) only one time point in gestation has been analyzed in each study; (4) urine analysis is lacking from most studies. We propose here the first longitudinal, global metabolic profiling of both maternal plasma and urine in each trimester of pregnancy in women who developed early-onset preeclampsia (requiring delivery prior to 37 weeks). The samples for this analysis are already banked and ready for use. The cohort includes 2105 total women, 56 of whom developed early-onset preeclampsia. We will characterize the global metabolic profile in maternal blood and urine in women with early-onset preeclampsia and matched controls using well-established liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy platforms. Changes in metabolites will be analyzed between trimesters for each patient. Additionally, differences in metabolites between preeclamptics and matched controls will be analyzed by trimester. We will then assess if the metabolic phenotype can identify subgroups of patients based on their clinical phenotypes with a focus on gestational age at delivery, infant birth weight, and abnormal laboratory studies. These experiments will define the metabolic profile throughout pregnancy in women who develop early-onset preeclampsia and will enhance our understanding of pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. Ultimately, this knowledge has the potential to lead to new predictive tests and treatments for preeclampsia."
"9358364","Abstract  Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) describes cognitive impairment resulting from cerebrovascular disease or dysfunction. VCID is a frequent co-morbidity with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as a single dementia-causing entity. The most common vasculopathy associated with cognitive impairment is cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). It is highly likely that SVD significantly contributes to the clinical manifestation of dementia, and therefore is a viable target for disease-modifying therapies, whether alone or in combination with AD-targeting therapies. One major obstacle for therapeutic development is the lack of biomarkers that are predictive of the presence and course of SVD-VCID. In this proposal we present candidate biomarkers for SV-VCID that will contribute to the consortium.  We have identified MRI imaging modalities of 3D FLAIR, ASL, and DTI as our imaging candidate biomarkers. We have also identified IL-12 p70, TNF?, PIGF and VEGFD as our candidate fluid biomarkers that discriminate SVD well in the subset of our cohort that we have analyzed. In this application we have a plan for developing our candidate biomarkers and validating them through the UH2 phase an individual research group, and also through the UH3 part as a member of the consortium. In addition, we bring significant strengths that will help synergize and move the consortium as a whole forward in our collective goal of developing biomarkers that are ready for large scale clinical trials and FDA qualification in years 6-7 of the consortium. These strengths include a well characterized, longitudinal cohort supported through our ADC and other NIH initiatives, our long history of active participation in consortia providing the experience and infrastructure needed to ensure success in this UH2/UH3 mechanism, our history of data sharing, resource sharing including samples, recruitment of research participants for longitudinal studies, and our foundation in basic and translational science."
"9379032","PROJECT SUMMARY The purpose of this R01 application is to investigate whether memory immunity induced in mice after vaccination with different types of candidates [rBCG, protein fusion in adjuvant, live attenuated mutant] induce similar or different subsets of CD4 memory T cells. Then, in a second series of studies, we will determine if this makes any difference if the vaccinated animal is then infected with newly emerging virulent clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis which we have recently demonstrated differ in terms of their fitness, as well as their capacity to elicit regulatory T cells capable of interfering with protective immunity. These are practical issues in the field that are, as yet, not being addressed. Most of the proposed studies will be performed in the Flow Cytometry Core facility within our Level-III building at CSU [the PI is the Director] and will employ flow cytometry and high speed cell sorting, as well as our more usual highly standardized animal modeling techniques. Even if we do not see major differences in terms of the overall generation of memory T cell responses, the study outcomes may still reveal which type of vaccine ?works best? [such head to head studies have not been done as yet, and this may spur the field to use these approaches to better prioritize current candidates]."
"9341211","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overall Component This is an application for a 5 year competitive renewal for the Colorado Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC). The broad goal of the NORC is to support and enhance ongoing nutrition/obesity research and to promote interdisciplinary collaborative, vertically integrated research among members of the Colorado NORC research base. We are now in our twentieth year of operation and the NORC supports over 96 regular and 16 mentored investigators in the research base who generate over $43,000,000 per year in direct costs for nutrition/obesity research. The resources of the NORC have been leveraged to secure over $70,000,000 (not counting individual research grants) in support for nutrition/obesity research at the University of Colorado. The research supported by the NORC ranges from cellular and molecular to clinical research to research in the community. We have made a commitment to foster team science within our research base because we believe this is the logical next step in the evolution of our NORC - to use NORC resources to create and support research teams to address big and important research questions that can best be addressed via an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach. We have organized our research base around 4 research team - 1) Maternal-Fetal Origins of Obesity; 2) Investigations in Metabolism, Aging, Gender, and Exercise (IMAGE); 3) Weight Management; 4) Obesity and Metabolic Dysregulation. These teams have already been successful in raising additional resources for team science. The research base is supported by 3 scientific cores that support basic, clinical and community researchers: 1) Molecular & Cellular Analytical; 2) Energy Balance Assessment; 3) Clinical Intervention and Translation. The Colorado NORC has strong leadership with Dr. James O. Hill continuing to serve as NORC Director and Drs. Dan Bessesen and Paul MacLean serving as Associate Directors. The Colorado NORC is located within the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center (AHWC) which is located within the University of Colorado, School of Medicine. A mission of the AHWC is to promote research translation and AHWC facilities provide an opportunity for translation of research emanating from the NORC. Our pilot and feasibility program has been extremely successful in helping develop our new investigators into independent researchers and national leaders in nutrition/obesity.

"9324969","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hematopoiesis is the process where the body's blood and immune cells are generated from a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These events take place in, and are regulated by, unique parts of the bone marrow termed niches. And while HSCs are responsible for producing nearly one trillion hematopoietic cells a day, mutations in this process can lead to a range of pathologies such as leukemia and bone marrow failure. Further, deficits in homing and engraftment in hematologic disease and during HSC transplant procedures used to treat these diseases significantly reduce patient survival. Previous in vivo and in vitro investigations have identified putative niche components and modes of action, yet culture platforms to predict HSC engraftment, maintain quiescence or direct differentiation do not exist. A major bottleneck is that it remains unclear how the diversit of microenvironmental signals that exist in close spatial and temporal order across the marrow impact HSC response. The goal of this proposal is to use a biomaterial approach to investigate the impact of spatially-organized biophysical signals and marrow-derived niche cells on HSC fate. We will use an engineered bone marrow (EBM) platform to test and revise biophysical hypotheses related to niche regulation of HSC quiescence and activation. To accomplish this goal, we have integrated microfluidic forming tools and orthogonal hydrogel chemistries to generate libraries of optically-translucent 3D biomaterials. Each EBM contains overlapping patterns of marrow-inspired matrix, biomolecule, and cell cues. This approach allows us to isolate small numbers of HSCs from the marrow, establish then manipulate niche signals surrounding these cells in defined increments, and track their response. Uniquely, this system allows selective, stepwise addition of multiple niche-inspired signals in order to reveal their individual versus coordinated impact. Our aims are three-fold. AIM 1: Dissect how overlapping patterns of niche-inspired biophysical signals shape HSC fate. AIM 2: Define the contribution of bone marrow niche cells on quiescence vs. activation. AIM 3: Resolve defects in engraftment and self-renewal for Pcl2-/- HSCs. Leveraging the well-characterized murine hematopoietic system, this approach offers the potential for mechanistic insight regarding native marrow niches, whose rarity and complexity limit direct in vivo examination. This project will generate essential information to aid development of a biomaterial rheostat to control human HSC homeostasis. Such a system would be invaluable for personalized-medicine approaches. As the marrow is the site of leukemogenesis and the target for donor HSC engraftment, EBMs could facilitate more accurate investigations of the etiology, progression, and treatment of hematopoietic diseases. Predictions realized by this approach may also suggest patient-specific improvements in HSC transplant regimens to reduce patient mortality, such as expanding HSCs pre- transplantation vs. pre-conditioning donor niche cells to improve engraftment post-transplantation."
"9371075","PROJECT SUMMARY  The University of North Alabama (UNA) Industrial Hygiene (IH) Program is currently one of four baccalaureate programs in the US accredited by ASAC of ABET. The UNA IH Program offers a double major in IH and general chemistry and has earned a reputation for graduating a pool of qualified industrial hygienist who are providing valuable services to workers and employers in this geographical region and beyond. Enrollment in the program continues to trend upward with a record number of graduates (15) the previous academic year. The continuation of the NIOSH Training Project Grant (TPG) is essential to remain effective in recruiting and retaining students with good scholastic merits, to maintain the current expectations of academic quality, and to expand into new and promising foreseeable opportunities. Therefore, the objectives of this proposal for the continuation of the NIOSH-TPG are threefold: promote the recruitment of qualified students in the OH&S field; support the efforts of continuous academic improvement; and expand the educational opportunities and services of the IH Program.  Recruitment will be promoted by academic scholarships (NIOSH TPG and departmental) and planned activities to reach potential candidates including underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (mailings; presentations; and participation in internal and external recruitment events). Continuous improvement will be approached by periodic evaluations of program objectives, annual evaluations of educational outcomes, and timely correction of shortcomings. Educational opportunities will be sought after in support of the new, four-year degrees in Engineering Technology (within the Department of Engineering Technology) and Earth Systems Sustainability (within the Department of Physics and Earth Science) at UNA.  The NIOSH TPG has been pivotal in supporting this baccalaureate program in IH housed at a regional university. From dismal enrollment figures that threatened its viability, the UNA IH program blossomed into a successful academic program that is often highlighted as exemplary by UNA administrators and noticed by stakeholders as an effective contributor to the advancement of OH&S. The discontinuation of this grant may certainly halt the continuous path of success and affect our ability to recruit students, particularly those academically gifted students who we have seen populating our program over the years."
"9384024","Project Summary/Abstract The objective of this Career Development Award is to support new mentored training in cognitive neuroscience studies of dopamine-related function in healthy adolescents and first-episode psychosis, as the candidate begins an independent research program. Psychosis is a devastating illness that afflicts ~3% of the world?s population, and has sever economic and social/emotional consequences for both patients and their caregivers. Prior research has implicated deficits in dopamine systems in both the etiology and pathology of the disorder, and thus remediation of this system has been a prominent target for intervention. Although these deficits have been well documented, open questions remains as to how and why these deficits emerge. Prominent models of psychosis have implicated aberrant development of neural systems regulating the activation of dopamine systems. However, very little research has investigated how these regulatory systems develop in normative populations; let alone how deviations from normative development may be implicated in psychosis. Thus, a full understanding of psychosis necessitates a characterization of dopamine-related networks in healthy adolescence and deviations from these trajectories in psychosis. These findings will provide insight into determinants of risk for conversion from a developmental perspective and in turn the timing of interventions.  The proposed award will build upon the candidate?s prior training in cognitive neuroscience, to extend this knowledge into the domain of normative development in adolescents and aberrant development in psychosis within dopamine-related networks. Aim 1 will investigate the normative development of neural systems regulating engagement of the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, the core of the mesolimbic dopamine system, using multimodal neuroimaging. These developmental neuroimaging markers will then be associated with direct and indirect measures of dopamine to assess how they relate to dopaminergic function. Aim 2 will evaluate how individuals with first-episode psychosis deviate from the normative trajectories characterized in Aim 1, and further probe how these deviations relate to anti-psychotic medication status. Finally, Aim 3 will have first-episode patients return for a 2-year follow-up to characterize how the clinical course of psychosis relates to early markers of dopamine-related dysfunction. Mentored training will compliment the candidate?s expertise in neuroimaging of dopamine-related circuits in healthy adults. Paralleling the proposed research, training will focus on the candidate gaining expertise in conducting neuroimaging studies in adolescent (Aim 1) and psychosis populations (Aim 2,3). Further, the candidate will gain expertise in the translation of animal models of behavior in adolescent and psychosis population, with a focus on understanding the nature of homology across multiple species (Aims 1-3). Finally, the candidate will gain expertise in experimental techniques associated with studying neurodevelopment (e.g., longitudinal data analysis; Aims 1-3), psychosis (e.g., adjustment for antipsychotic medication, characterizing clinical phenomenology; Aims 2-3), and translational neuroscience (e.g., integration of direct/indirect measures of dopamine; Aim 3). The candidate has recruited a mentoring team with expertise in all of the above domains led by mentor Dr. Bea Luna, an expert in adolescent development, and co-mentor Deanna Barch, an expert in neuroimaging in psychosis populations. Further, the candidate will take advantage of the known strengths of the schizophrenia and adolescent research communities, as well as the emphasis on cross-species translation at the University of Pittsburgh. The proposed research will offer novel insight into dopamine dysfunction in psychosis through the lens of adolescent neurodevelopment. Further, the training will lay the foundation for an independent research program assaying the neurodevelopmental of neuromodulatory systems in psychosis. !"
"9336819","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cigarette smoking are both associated with significant impairment in Veterans and cost to the Veterans' Affairs (VA) system. Though naturalistic and laboratory studies suggest smoking is linked with PTSD symptoms, existing smoking cessation treatments targeting PTSD smokers have not utilized standardized, evidence-based PTSD treatment. The most effective smoking cessation approach to date for PTSD smokers, Integrated Care for Smoking Cessation (ICSC), relies on delivery of smoking cessation treatment by the individual's PTSD treatment provider. In a recent trial comparing ICSC to VA specialty Smoking Cessation Clinic care, ICSC produced significantly better prolonged smoking abstinence. However, ICSC was associated with only modest improvements in PTSD symptoms, with no difference between ICSC and smoking cessation treatment alone, suggesting a likely avenue for improving ICSC. We have developed an intervention that combines evidence based treatment for PTSD [cognitive processing therapy (CPT-C)] with evidence based smoking cessation for PTSD [Integrated Care for Smoking Cessation (ICSC)] and interactive phone technology for maintaining smoking abstinence. The objectives of this Career Development Award are to: 1) Evaluate study feasibility and treatment delivery procedures of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing CPT-C/ICSC to a comparison condition combining present-centered therapy (PCT) with ICSC; 2) Characterize the difference between the combined CPT-C intervention and a PCT/ICSC condition in effects on smoking and PTSD symptoms. Confidence intervals will be constructed around calculated effect sizes to reflect uncertainty regarding the reliability of the effect size; and 3) Use feasibility trial datato design a RCT combining evidence-based PTSD treatment and ICSC to improve smoking cessation in PTSD. PCT is a manualized, active treatment for PTSD with data supporting its effectiveness in reducing PTSD symptoms. PCT also controls for treatment time, supportive relationship, and instillation of hope in treatment, providing an ideal comparison condition. Fifty Veteran smokers with PTSD will be randomized to participate in fourteen study sessions, ending with the final follow-up session six months after the scheduled quit date. The development of a combined CPT-C/ICSC intervention with established empirical support would benefit the many Veterans with PTSD who smoke by providing them with treatment of two pervasive problems with significant associated impairment. In addition, this treatment could substantially reduce the cost of administering two individual treatments separately by administering them in combination."
"9319341","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The ability to advance our understanding of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is critically dependent on the comparison of postmortem brains from SUDEP cases to control brains from patients with epilepsy who died from other causes and patients without epilepsy who died suddenly. We seek to better define the evidence to support or refute leading theories about the causes of SUDEP: the role of brainstem dysfunction and the role of serotonin and adenosine. Specifically, we hypothesize that alterations of interneurons, purinergic and serotonergic systems in vital autonomic brainstem structures are increased in SUDEP compared to controls. We will use advanced 9.4T MRI imaging complemented by quantitative stereological and immunohistochemical techniques to study the neuronal, interneuronal and astrocytic densities in the central autonomic network structures such as the insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala, with a focus on critical brainstem regions (e.g., cardiorespiratory and median raphe nuclei) and the neurotransmitters serotonin and adenosine. We will leverage the world's largest collection of formalin fixed SUDEP brains, prospective collection of frozen and formalin fixed brains, and tissue from epilepsy surgery cases to study our hypotheses. Our systematic brainstem/autonomic neuropathological analysis will provide the most complete comparative map of the histopathological and biochemical autonomic system abnormalities that are altered in SUDEP. The combined study of human brain tissue and detailed phenotypic data will provide the strongest and most direct link between potential biomarkers and neuropathological studies in living patients with neuropathological findings from SUDEP cases. Our living patients can link ictal and other phenotypic markers (e.g., MRI) to activity in serotonergic (5-HT1A and 5-HT1C receptors, 5-HT transporter) and the enzyme of serotonin synthesis tryptophan hydroxylases) and purinergic (adenosine kinase activity and adenosine receptor binding) systems in their brain tissue. Our SUDEP postmortem studies will link 9.4T images of the entire brain, as well as serotonergic and purinergic activity in cortical, subcortical and brainstem regions. Together, these studies will, for the first time, bridge detailed phenotypic data, cortical and brainstem studies of serotonergic and purinergic activity. Our study will also work with SUTRA 5: Genetics and Epigenetics of SUDEP to study the potential role of nonsynonymous substitutions in serotonergic and purinergic genes, and how these relate to our quantitative stereological and immunohistochemical findings and phenotypic markers."

"9256992","The ultimate goal of the Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to facilitate prevention and intervention strategies that result in community-level reductions in exposure to targeted contaminants, either through changes in behavior that reduce or eliminate pathways to exposure or through community-driven actions to remediate the sites of contamination. The CEC will accomplish these goals by connecting communities impacted by environmental contaminants to the research conducted by the Duke University Superfund Research Center (DUSRC). Given the focus of the DUSRC on the ways in which exposure to hazardous substances during pregnancy or early childhood can lead to serious health consequences in later life, the CEC will focus on preventing early life exposures. To achieve this goal, the CEC will partner with the communities of Cradock, in Virginia, and Badin, Castle Hayne and others in North Carolina. We will work with these communities to collaboratively devise optimal strategies for reducing and preventing exposures in pregnant women and children to: mercury and PCBs from subsistence consumption of fresh water fish from contaminated waterways; from air, soil and water borne PCBs, PAHs, TCE, heavy metals, etc. from former metal processing industrial sites; and from pesticides and soil contaminants, particularly heavy metals and PAHs, in community and school gardens built on brownfield and other contaminated sites. The CEC will take an innovative approach to community engagement, one that will be highly participatory and bidirectional, involving communities in conjunction with DUSRC Investigators and Trainees in determining the questions we ask, the methods we use to answer them, and the ways in which the results we generate will be applied. The DUSRC CEC?s model for community engagement will inform our approach to accomplishing each of our specific aims and will follow a similar set of iterative steps, tailored to each project and community: 1) identify and form partnerships with at-risk communities; 2) work collaboratively with the community to understand current sources of exposure; 3) work collaboratively with the community to analyze pathways to exposure; 4) apply results to develop and implement community-led action plans and materials to disseminate more broadly; 5) analyze and report on outcomes and disseminate models broadly."
"9293905","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Embryonic stem cells (ESC) will revolutionize medical research and patient treatment. However, two major hurdles do not allow the rapid transition of ESC therapies to clinical settings: 1) the lack of protocols precluding homogenous cell populations that exactly reproduce those in vivo; 2) the uncertainty about the fate stability of ESC-derived cells after in vivo grafting. Overcoming these limitations will ameliorate safety concerns associated with ESC-derived cell therapies. Our long term goal is to efficiently generate ESC-derived cells that functionally integrate into organs. We have recently developed efficient protocols to derive terminal cell fates from ESC. When expressed in differentiating ESC, Ngn2- Isl1-Lhx3 (the NIL transcription factors) and Ngn2- Isl1-Phox2a (the NIP transcription factors) are sufficient to program spinal or cranial motor neuron identity respectively. This also happens extremely rapidly: Within 48 hours more than 97% of the cells acquire all the features of terminally differentiated motor neurons. Moreover, programmed neurons correctly integrate into the developing spinal cord projecting axons mirroring the endogenous neurons. Although, NIL and NIP factors do not provide the motor neuron subtype identity required for precise muscle innervation, our preliminary data suggests that it can be acquired by the activity of developmentally relevant signals. We hypothesize that NIL and NIP factors program generic motor neuron fate through a rapid transcriptional sequence, and that subtype identity can be independently imposed either by genetic factors or by the host environment after grafting. Here we propose 3 aims to test these ideas: Aim 1- To understand the molecular mechanisms of direct cell programming, we will map the NIL and NIP genetic and epigenetic requirements for efficient programming. This knowledge will facilitate the future design of programming strategies for different clinically relevant cell types. Aim 2- To increase the cellular precision of direct programming, we will impose subtype identity to NIL- programmed neurons by the activity of developmentally relevant signals or transcription factors. This novel strategy will generate neurons at a level of efficiency and precision compatible with clinical applications. Aim 3- To dissect the influence of the host tissue on ESC-derived neurons, we will test the cellular stability of NIL-programmed neurons after implantation into the spinal cord. These results will investigate if ESC-derived neurons change fate after interacting with the host tissue. Completing this proposal will impact not only future therapies for spinal cord injurie, but will also produce general principles to differentiate disease relevant cells at high efficiency These are necessary steps to accelerate the transition of ESC to clinical applications."
"9290086","Project Summary  Atherosclerotic arterial disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among Americans. Atherosclerosis preferentially develops in arterial sites such as curvatures and bifurcations, where endothelial cells are activated by local disturbed flow. Recent studies have suggested new genes and previously unsus- pected biology that mechanistically contribute to atherosclerosis; however, the interplay between genetic pre- disposition of atherosclerosis and flow-mediated endothelial functions remains to be elucidated.  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and subsequent investigations identified PhosPhatidic-Acid- Phosphatase-type-2B (PPAP2B, also known as LPP3 or PLPP3) as a gene at chr 1p32.2 that significantly influences risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Moreover, reduced endothelial PPAP2B is associated with increased CAD susceptibility. We recently discovered a new mechanism that links disturbed flow to reduction in endothelial PPAP2B through a microRNA-mediated mechano-transduction pathway: disturbed flow activates endothelial miR-92a, which in turn suppresses PPAP2B directly and also indirectly by inhibiting the transcription factor KLF2 that activates PPAP2B; reduced endothelial PPAP2B then leads to increased endothelial inflammation and compromised monolayer integrity. Furthermore, previous studies showed that systemic delivery of miR-92a inhibitor suppressed miR-92a in a wide range of tissues and lessened atherosclerosis in mice. Although these results suggest that flow-sensitive miR92a-PPAP2B pathway contributes to the athero-susceptible endothelial phenotype, the potentially causal relationship between endothelial miR92a-PPAP2B pathway and atherogenesis in vivo remains uncertain. Moreover, the mechanism by which the CAD-associated causal variant in PPAP2B exerts its effect and its potential roles in endothelial mechano-transduction remains unexplored.  We have gathered very strong evidence that PPAP2B genetic variation interacts with unidirectional flow in concert to promote endothelial PPAP2B. The overall goal is to elucidate the molecular convergence of CAD genetic predisposition and mechano-transduction mechanisms in the endothelial miR92a-PPAP2B path- way, dysregulation of which is hypothesized to causatively promote atherosclerosis. Our proposed studies ad- dress three questions of fundamental importance: 1) Does the endothelial miR92a-PPAP2B pathway causally regulate atherosclerosis in vivo? We test this in Aim 1 with new mouse models and innovative nanoparticles to selectively modulate endothelial miR92a-PPAP2B signaling. 2) How does the CAD protective allele at rs17114036 influence PPAP2B expression? In Aim 2, we functionally characterize the rs17114036-depedent enhancer in PPAP2B employing complementary in vivo and in vitro genetic approaches. 3) What is the addi- tional role of KLF2 in regulating allele-specific PPAP2B expression? We address the dynamic regulation of this rs17114036-containing enhancer by mechanical and pharmacological stimuli via KLF2 in Aim 3."

Attendees of the 2007 Understanding Interventions That Encourage Minorities to Pursue Research Careers Workshop pointed out the tasks that must be accomplished to advance research-based interventions and thus the diversification of individuals in STEM careers: on-going review of interventions research; development of appropriate research questions; technical assistance for effective intervention research methodologies; encouragement of a community of intervention researchers. Building on their prior organization of three Understanding Interventions conferences, Long Island University and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, propose a five-year (7/1/2012- 6/30/2017) Understanding Interventions Project. The long-term goal is to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in STEM research careers; the objectives are to provide venues and platforms to promote the work needed to accomplish the tasks delineated in 2007. The project is significant because it will advance the identification of contributing factors and practices that determine interventions' effectiveness in increasing underrepresented minorities in STEM research careers. An annual conference will provide: A) a venue for dissemination of interventions research; B) opportunities for researchers/practitioners to interact and collaborate; C) a mechanism for discourse on research-based interventions' implementation across modalities, stages and venues. An enhanced and interactive Understanding Interventions website will provide additional linkage of the understanding interventions (UI) community as well as an accessible and searchable internet-based annotated database of Interventions research articles and resources; both will expand the dissemination of broadening participation research. A quarterly online/email-based newsletter that distills and disseminates research findings, development opportunities, and general announcements will provide an additional platform for dissemination of interventions research. Social/behavioral sciences and student affairs professional societies and organizations such as the American Association of University Professors, American Association of State Colleges and Universities, and American Association of Universities that influence higher education will be added to the annual conference list and they will receive the newsletter. Achieving the objectives will significantly increase the research based interventions community, its linkages, and its sphere of influence and thereby assist in achieving the goal of increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in STEM research careers."
"9323817","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        The shock and kill treatment strategy has been envisioned as a controlled induction of virus reactivation in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to reveal latently infected cells for immune system recognition and destruction. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have potential for HIV reactivation in patients; however, further optimization of these strategies is needed to effectively reduce the size of latent reservoir. Emerging evidence from gene expression studies points to existence of secondary mechanisms of action of HDACis that may interfere with induction of HIV expression. Based on differences in the degree of HIV reactivation in response to HDACis in model systems that use different cell types, we propose that these inhibitory effects may vary among CD4+ T cells of different maturation phenotypes. The optimal reactivation strategy would be able to induce HIV expression from all CD4+ T cells with a minimal number of additional interventions; however, it is possible that maturation phenotype-specific interventions would be required. The objective of this proposal is to identify host genes and proteins modulated by HDACis in CD4+ T cells of various maturation phenotypes that can be therapeutically targeted to enhance the activation effect of HDACis. The central hypothesis is that HIV is reactivated by HDACis with different potencies and via different mechanisms depending on CD4+ T cell maturation state, and that reactivation may be augmented by counteracting the secondary effects of HDACis that interfere with HIV expression. The rationale for this study is to improve on existing strategies for HIV reactivation by identifying possible targets to counteract inhibitory effects of HDACis across cells of all majo maturation phenotypes to ensure HIV eradication from the entire CD4+ T cell reservoir. To achieve our goals, we will measure induction of HIV expression in naïve, central memory and effector memory cells using the in vitro latency model developed by Dr. Spina. We will then characterize global gene and protein expression changes induced by HDACis by methods of RNA-Seq and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and identify effects that may specifically interfere with HIV expression in CD4+ T cell subsets. Based on RNA-Seq and LC-MS data, a set of targets will be selected for validation studies, including validating changes in expression in a time course and in another latency model (developed by Dr. Karn), and knockdown / overexpression studies in the presence of HDACi to test for synergy. The expected positive impact of this work is identification of therapeutic candidates with strong potential to improve HIV reactivation currently achieved. Dr. Beliakova-Bethell will work with one primary mentor and three co-mentors, who are leaders in the field of HIV research. Exposure to a collaborative and diverse scientific environment, as part of the VA Healthcare System HIV research group, as well as the Center for AIDS Research at the University of California San Diego, will advance her career development. Her long-term career goal is to become a leader in the field of HIV-host interactions, HIV latency and immunology, and a successful VA scientist. During the period of the award, she will focus on obtaining training in: (1) HIV latency and human immunology; (2) proteomics; (3) translational research; and on developing skills necessary to build a solid, independently funded clinically relevant research career. To accomplish these goals, her career plan includes regular interactions with mentors, participation in specific didactic courses in career development, and acquiring expertise in new experimental techniques.

"9358729","The objective of the Zoster Eye Disease Study (ZEDS) is to determine whether prolonged suppressive oral antiviral treatment with valacyclovir reduces complications of Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO), thereby improving clinical outcomes in this common and potentially vision- and life-threatening disease. There are 1,000,000 new cases of Herpes Zoster (HZ) per year in the USA, with 10-20% being HZO. The first aim of this double-masked, placebo controlled multicenter randomized clinical trial will test the hypothesis that suppressive antiviral treatment for 12 months with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily reduces the rate of new or worsening dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis or uveitis compared to placebo, at 12 months as the primary endpoint, and at 18 months including 6 months of follow-up after treatment, as the secondary endpoint, in patients with HZO who have had an episode of one of these disease manifestations during the year prior to enrollment. The second aim is to test the hypothesis that suppressive treatment for 12 months with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily reduces the severity and duration of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), compared to placebo, at 12 months and at 18 months as secondary endpoints, in similar patients with HZO. PHN is a debilitating chronic pain syndrome that negatively impacts quality of life, especially in elderly patients. The study will enroll immunocompetent patients age 18 years and older who have HZO diagnosed at variable times in the past, with these types of active anterior segment ocular segment disease within the past year. Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to long-term suppressive treatment with oral valacyclovir 1000 mg daily or placebo for 12 months, plus usual ophthalmic care, and followed every 3 months for a total of 18 months, to determine outcomes of new or worsening dendriform epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, endothelial keratitis or uveitis and/or severity and duration of PHN during 12 months of treatment and for 6 months following treatment discontinuation. The results with regard to PHN may be applicable to HZ in other locations. If suppressive valacyclovir treatment is determined to be effective, the potentially devastating disease burden of HZO and HZ may be reduced for patients, as well as the annual costs to society, estimated in the USA to be one billion dollars."

"9504000","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goals of this proposal are to understand how the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler CSB is distinct from other chromatin remodelers and how its unique features enable this enzyme to protect cells from genotoxic stress. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers use energy from ATP hydrolysis to alter DNA- histone contacts, leading to changes in nucleosome position, composition or conformation. Thus, they have critical functions in regulating fundamental processes, such as transcription and DNA repair. The importance of these enzymes to health is exemplified by the variety of diseases that result from defects in their activities, which include developmental syndromes and cancer.  Mutations in the CSB remodeler lead to Cockayne syndrome: a devastating premature aging disorder associated with numerous developmental and neurological defects. There are more than 30 known and predicted ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers in humans; CSB, however, is the only remodeler that is essential for transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR), a process that rapidly removes transcription-stalling DNA lesions. Moreover, CSB is critical for relieving oxidative stress. We have made significant advances in understanding how this chromatin remodeler is uniquely equipped to carry out its functions. (1) The association of CSB with chromatin is tightly regulated. In general, only 10% of CSB is chromatin bound, but upon UV irradiation or oxidative stress, more than 90% of CSB becomes chromatin associated; this is in stark contrast to other, well-studied remodelers such as SWI/SNF and ISWI that are constitutively bound to chromatin. (2) Using separation-of-function derivatives, we have demonstrated that the chromatin remodeling activity of CSB is essential for its function in transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR). (3) The chromatin remodeling activity of CSB is tunable: CSB, on its own, displays weak remodeling activity (~20-fold less than SWI/SNF or ACF). Strikingly, together with NAP1-like histone chaperones, CSB remodels chromatin robustly, to a level similar to SWI/SNF or ACF. (4) CSB interacts with the CTCF protein and through this interaction becomes significantly enriched at CTCF binding sites upon oxidative stress. Given that CTCF is a key player in regulating higher- order chromatin-structure, CSB may collaborate with CTCF to reorganize chromatin structure in response to oxidative stress to facilitate coordinated gene expression or efficient DNA repair. The experiments outlined in this proposal will exploit these unique properties of CSB to understand how this ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler is uniquely equipped to protect cells from genotoxic stress. Moreover, this work may shed new light on the causes and mechanism of Cockayne syndrome."
"9306889","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature declines in function among adults with cerebral palsy (CP) may occur as a result of early and accelerated weakness, beyond that which is expected for adults in the general population. While the specific mechanisms of secondary muscle pathology and related comorbidities are not well defined, ample evidence exists to confirm that individuals with CP have lower fitness, less muscle mass, neuromuscular inefficiency, and significantly reduced functional reserve throughout the span of adulthood. This ongoing circular cause and consequence of events leads to a debilitating loss of muscle function and impaired morphology, as well as an exaggerated risk for obesity and cardiometabolic disease. Therefore, the overall purpose of this training and research is to examine the adult CP phenotype from the bedside to the bench with the explicit intent to distinguish and target the mechanisms of secondary comorbidity from those attributable to the primary neuromuscular impairment.         The candidate has a strong professional background in exercise physiology, and has worked with a variety of populations and spectrum of clinical needs. His career goal is to develop a medical rehabilitation research program for targeting muscle dysfunction and cardiometabolic health among individuals with CP. This long- term objective will require coursework and intensive bench training in integrative pathophysiology of obesity and muscle spasticity, as well as in clinical and biostatistical aspects specific to the treatment/study of CP. The Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will prepare the candidate as an independent medical rehabilitation investigator through the following short-term directives: (1) To acquire a comprehensive expertise of the pathways associated with obesity and metabolic dysregulation, as well as those associated with aberrant adaptations to chronic sedentary behavior and muscle spasticity; (2) To gain an in-depth understanding of the specific clinical aspects of CP, including issues pertaining to severity of motor impairment and quality of life, the negative influence of treatments on health and activity, and how impairment effects social participation and health disparity; and (3) To develop the technical and statistical skills to conduct specialized imaging for quantifying skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, serum and in vivo studies for markers of inflammation and insulin resistance, and immunohistochemical quantification and polymerase chain reaction studies of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Achieving these short-term directives during the award period will also build a solid foundation for each of the candidate's long-term career goals which include: (1) To conduct experiments to identify the discrete cellular etiology of fibro-adipose degeneration of skeletal muscles and metabolic dysregulation among sedentary individuals with CP; (2) To conduct a program of preventive health research through tailored physical activity and dietary interventions for children and adults with CP; and (3) To bolster public health awareness regarding chronic disease risks for specific sub-populations with disabilities.         The candidate will train with a group of internationally renowned mentors and collaborators from 6 disciplines to gain content expertise, and to learn specific data collection techniques for identifying morphological and cellular differences in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue between adults with and without CP, as well as within spastic and non-spastic muscle. The primary aim of the study was designed with a clinically-oriented purpose to compare cardiometabolic profiles among adults with CP and matched adult controls. For this aim the candidate will work with 1) Dr. Horowitz to learn and perform frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests on all subjects in this study, 2) Michigan Clinical Research Unit (MCRU) to learn dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry quantification of whole body and regional body composition, 3) Dr. Chenevert in Radiology to learn skeletal muscle and adipose tissue volume and fractional quantification, using the MRI Dixon protocol, and 4) Drs. Burant and Gordon to become familiar analyzing cardiometabolic serum and tissue biomarkers. The second aim was designed to assess the effectiveness of low-dose physical activity on cardiometabolic parameters among adults with CP, and to determine the extent to which changes are mediated by alterations in adiposity. The candidate will work with 1) Dr. Gordon and members of the PAEIR Lab to learn the necessary skills for directing a clinical intervention study and 2) Dr. Hurvitz and staff from the UM Adult C clinic to ensure patients' needs are being recognized and symptoms are handled appropriately. For the third aim, the candidate will examine within-subjects transcriptional and cellular morphological differences in spastic versus non-spastic muscle from sedentary adults with hemiplegic CP, and to contrast with non-CP controls. Successful completion of aim 3 will require the candidate to spend ample time working with Drs. Burant and Gordon, and faculty of the MNORC to learn various immunohistochemical procedures. Throughout the entirety of training, the candidate will also work with Dr. Spino for data management and biostatistical expertise."
"9321091","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ? Neuropathology Core  The overarching goal of the UCD ADC is to understand the multiple and complex determinants that explain heterogeneity of cognitive trajectories in diverse older adults. To help achieve this goal, the primary mission of our Neuropathology Core (NPC) has been to assess brain injury in the form of multiple pathologies, which provides an essential set of data that is perhaps the most precise and most relevant to an individual's cognitive abilities. In addition to providing neuropathologic diagnosis, the NPC also collects and stores brain tissue, serum, plasma, and DNA/RNA samples from subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, other neurodegenerative disorders, as well as healthy controls. Equipped with our neuropathological expertise, data, technologies, and biological samples from a heterogeneous cohort of dementia, MCI and cognitively normal subjects, the NPC is instrumental in fostering comprehensive and in-depth research to identify modifiers of cognitive trajectories and biomarkers with predictive value, and in providing education to professionals, trainees, and the general public about dementia. Over the last five years, the NPC has transformed from a traditional diagnostic unit to fully integrated participation in multiple research projects. In this renewal application, the NPC will continue to perform its core functions, support existing collaborations, cultivate new junior scientists, and seek new opportunities building on the progress achieved during the current grant cycle. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Provide neuropathological diagnoses for all longitudinal cohort participants using standardized criteria, and examine clinicopathological correlations. The NPC has placed emphasis on identifying mixed pathologies including cerebrovascular injuries, reflecting the protective/risk factors of brain aging and dementia processes in our diverse, multi-ethnic longitudinal cohort. Aim 2. Maintain a state-of-the-art biorepository of brain tissue, blood, and DNA/RNA to provide ADC projects, collaborative projects, and qualified investigators with high quality, well-characterized samples, neuropathological data, and neuropathological services. Aim 3. Participate in and facilitate dementia-related basic and translational projects using NPC resources. Currently three major interrelated themes have emerged: (1) microglia pathology and neuroinflammation; (2) vascular and white matter injury; and (3) multi-ethnic diversity and biomarkers. Aim 4. Interact with other ADC Cores to provide neuropathological education to medical staff, researchers, trainees/students, and the general public, and to cultivate junior scientists.  In summary, these studies conducted by the NPC will help refine neuropathologic diagnosis, enable precise detection of diverse brain injury pathways, identify biomarkers with value in predicting cognitive decline, and contribute to the effort to find new avenues for dementia treatment."
"9391453","PROJECT SUMMARY Bacterial cells surround themselves with a peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall, an essential structure that resists changes in osmotic pressure and other environmental insults. To a certain degree, PG is also essential to humans as antibiotics target its destruction and fragments activate immune responses. The basic building blocks of PG have been known for over fifty years; however, the higher architectural features of this polymer and complete set of immunostimulating fragments remain unknown. We hypothesize that differences in overall PG structure and fragment generation are important for sensing pathogenic bacteria. The glycan of the PG is essential for immune recognition; study of this important structure has been hampered by a lack of tools to label and track the fate of PG carbohydrate precursors and the resultant polymer in living cells. Currently, researchers are limited to few carbohydrate probes and even fewer larger fragments. Chemical synthesis is laborious and challenging to even expert carbohydrate chemists. The goal of this U01 proposal is to develop a method to label the glycan of the PG in a range of microbes to facilitate identification, tracking, manipulation and analysis of the glycans derived from PG with their biological binding partners and determine their functions. We propose to utilize a metabolic labeling approach in which the necessary functionalized PG biosynthetic building blocks are synthesized, provided to the microbe and incorporated in the backbone of the polymer. This has not been done before as the synthesis of the UDP-sugar building blocks is challenging and the uptake and processing pathways for the free sugars are not widely distributed. To overcome this challenge we propose parallel approaches which utilize either chemoenzymatic synthesis or genetic engineering. The bacterial PG recycling enzymes, AmgK and MurU have relaxed substrate specificity for N-acetyl-muramic acid lactols, allowing the production of labeled UDP-PG precursors. In Aim One, a large-scale chemoenzymatic synthesis of a variety of UDP-PG derivatives will be optimized and these molecules will be provided to a variety of pathogenic and commensal microbes for subsequent PG incorporation. Kits will be developed to distribute these essential carbohydrates. For Aim Two tagged lactol substrates will be provided to cells whose genomes have been engineered to encode for AmgK and MurU. As Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are amendable to this approach, this methodology will be extended to pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as well as commensal bacteria. Aim Three will showcase the utility of this method for immunologists and microbiologists: (1) glycan-containing immunostimulatory molecules from Mtb, and Hp will be tracked, sorted and identified; (2) Hp and Mtb's PG structural features related to pathogenesis and antibiotic susceptibility will be interrogated. This innovative carbohydrate metabolic labeling method for peptidoglycan will be an approachable yet powerful technique for biomedical researchers and a valuable addition to the Glycoscience Consortium."
"9404172","Uncontrolled bleeding remains one of the leading causes of trauma-induced death. Current treatment recommendations focus on fresh frozen plasma and blood cell transfusions which do not seem to be effective. Over the last few years, these is increasing use of prothrombin complex cencentrate to treat hemorrhage-associated coagulapathy which is effective but induces disseminated intravascular coagulation. Recent animal studies demonstarte that different from prothrombin complex cencentrate, recombinant human prothrombin (factor II) from CHO cells as monotherapy effectively reduced blood loss and improved survival without causing thromboembolism. However, CHO cell is not adequate for cost-effective and functional production. Our preliminary sudies indicate that HEK293 is a highly prefered host that enables high expression level and adequate post-translational modifications. We propose to optimize the production of human recombinant prothrombin from HEK293 cells and compare the efficacy and safety with prothrombin complex concentrate in a porcine model of dilutional coagulapthy."
"9395328","ABSTRACT Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most deadly primary malignant brain tumor. Despite the most advanced treatment with combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, GBM is associated with a median life expectancy of only ~15 months. Targeted molecular therapies are arguably one of the most promising approaches to achieving more effective future GBM therapies. A major challenge facing such an approach is the simultaneous deregulation of multiple molecules in any given single tumor, as demonstrated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other published research. Because of this co-deregulation, it is not surprising that molecular monotherapies have failed to achieve significant improvements in GBM clinical outcomes. Several lines of evidence suggest that the simultaneous targeting of multiple deregulated molecules and pathways is required to achieve better therapies. Based on preliminary evidence, we hypothesize that there exist ?master regulatory microRNAs? (miRNAs) that simultaneously regulate multiple deregulated molecules in GBM. The goal of this application is to discover, investigate, and therapeutically exploit such miRNAs. We believe that studying them will provide new information on the mechanisms of gene expression (de)regulation in GBM and that restoring or inhibiting them can be exploited for therapy. We propose three specific aims. In aim 1, we will use a novel screening approach, PAR-CLIP, in combination with smRNA-seq and TCGA gene expression data analysis to uncover global miRNA targets and identify single miRNAs (designated master regulatory miRNAs) that simultaneously target and regulate the largest number of deregulated molecules in GBM. In aim 2, we will investigate the functions and modes of action of these master regulatory miRNAs and validate their expressions and targets in human GBM specimens. In aim 3, we will test miRNAs as novel experimental therapeutic agents or targets in GBM. Thereby, we will develop and use novel potentially clinically applicable local and systemic delivery agents and approaches including brain penetrating nanoparticles (BPN), convection-enhanced delivery (CED) and focused ultrasound with microbubbles (FUS-MB). Successful completion of the proposed studies would establish the first compendium of miRNA targets in GBM, generate new knowledge on the (de)regulation of gene expression by miRNAs and their effects on GBM malignancy, and develop novel technologies for the exploitation of novel master regulatory miRNAs in GBM therapy."
"9386469","ABSTRACT Research has shown that a weight loss of >10% favorably modulates biomarkers of breast cancer risk. The most effective behavioral weight loss programs, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), yield weight losses of only 4-7%. As a result, many people resort to weight-loss surgery, which is costly, drastic, and an often irreversible choice that, when successful, results in weight losses of 25-50%, which far exceed that necessary for risk reduction. New behavioral strategies that enhance the weight-loss outcomes of existing interventions are needed. One recently introduced and innovative weight-loss strategy is `Hunger Training'. Hunger Training uses real-time blood glucose monitoring as biological feedback to help users self-regulate meal initiation to promote sustained weight loss that may have indirect and direct effects on breast cancer risk reduction. Evidence demonstrates that Hunger Training alone?without any additional dietary restrictions or increased physical activity?produces weight losses of >7% and significantly improves insulin sensitivity. In the proposed pilot study, we will combine Hunger Training with the DPP using a two-arm approach. We will randomize 50 non-diabetic, postmenopausal obese women, identified as being at high risk for breast cancer and enrolled in the MD Anderson Longitudinal High Risk Breast Cohort for ?1 year, to receive either the DPP only or the DPP-plus-Hunger Training for 16 weeks. Aim 1 is to evaluate the feasibility of adding Hunger Training to the DPP. Feasibility criteria will include accrual rates >50%, attrition rates <20%, and protocol adherence rates >75% for both study groups. Aim 2 is to estimate the magnitude of the effect sizes and variation in the outcome variables for the DPP-only and DPP-plus-Hunger Training interventions on changes in weight; metabolic and breast cancer risk biomarkers (e.g., fasting insulin and glucose levels, levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin resistance, adiponectin, interleukin-6, and c-reactive protein); and proposed behavioral mediators (e.g., reduction in total energy intake, overall eating frequency, percent of eating events occurring at or below the average fasting blood glucose concentration). This study will be the first to assess the synergistic effect of adding Hunger Training to a highly disseminated weight-loss intervention. We expect to find that the addition of Hunger Training to the DPP is feasible and that the combined intervention has an additive effect on promoting weight losses of >10% in obese women at risk for postmenopausal breast cancer. The successful completion of this pilot study will support a larger randomized controlled trial that will additionally enable us to compare the DPP's long-term impact on weight loss and weight loss maintenance to that of the DPP-plus-Hunger Training. "
"9320929","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed study is to test whether the efficacy of locomotor training will be improved through the application of constraint induced forced use of the affected leg during locomotor training. We will also identify the neural mechanisms underlying the improvements in locomotor function after training in individuals post-stroke. Locomotor training using a treadmill is a promising technique that provides a safe and convenient environment for improving walking capability in individuals post-stroke. While the improvements in walking function after treadmill training are statistically significant, the functional gains are relatively small for many patients. One of primary reasons of the less effectiveness of treadmill training may be due to the compensatory motor strategies employed by patients during locomotor training, i.e., patients with hemiparesis often rely more on the unaffected leg for performing bipedal walking during treadmill training. Repetitive practice in thi manner may actually lead to reinforcing the compensatory motor strategies, which results in limited improvement in motor control of the affected leg, resulting in limited functional gains aftr training, which suggests a need of developing new training paradigms in order to maximize functional gains. Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) has been utilized to improve motor function of the affected arm in individuals post-stroke through forced use of their affected arm and by restricting movements of the unaffected arm. Previous studies have shown promising improvements in motor skills and in the use of the affected arm and hand in daily activities after CIMT. However, such interventions have not been effectively applied to lower limb training in individuals post-stroke due to the strong coupling between the two legs during bipedal gait and the risk of falling. Thus, we propose to develop a novel strategy to test CIMT for lower limb training in individuals post-stroke. Specifically, we will apply a controlled force to te pelvis and/or unaffected leg, which will serve to overcome the compensatory motor strategies employed by patients, and induce forced use of the affected leg during locomotor training. Our central hypothesis is that the efficacy of locomotor training will be improved by applying a controlled assistance force to the pelvis and/or resistance force to the unaffected leg to reduce the compensatory movements of the unaffected leg, and induce forced use of the affected leg of individuals post-stroke during training. Results from this study will lead to an innovative clinica therapy paradigm aimed at improving locomotor function in individuals post-stroke. We expect that this study will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel robotic training strategy, i.e., applyig a controlled force to the pelvis and/or the unaffected leg to induce forced use of the affected leg during locomotor training. The successful completion of the proposed study will have a high potential to make a significant impact on the field of locomotor rehabilitation in individuals post stroke through the application of a novel treatment paradigm. This paradigm may also be applied to other patient populations, such as patients with hemiparetic cerebral palsy."
"9254553","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human visual system is organized as a parallel, hierarchical network, and successive stages of visual processing appear to represent increasingly complicated aspects of shape-related and semantic information. However, the way that shape-related and semantic information is represented across much of the visual hierarchy is still poorly understood. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how information about object shape and semantic category is represented explicitly across mid- and high-level visual areas. To address this important issue we propose to undertake a series of human functional MRI (fMRI) studies, using both synthetic and natural movies. Data will be analyzed by means of a powerful voxel-wise modeling (VM) approach that has been developed in my laboratory over the past several years. In Aim 1 we propose to measure human brain activity evoked by synthetic naturalistic movies, and to use VM to evaluate and compare several competing theories of shape representation across the entire visual cortex. In Aim 2 we propose to use VM to evaluate and compare competing theories of semantic representation. In Aim 3 we propose to use machine learning and and VM to discover new aspects of shape and semantic representation. These experiments will provide fundamental new insights about the representation of visual information across visual cortex."
"9324266","The broad goal of the Computational Biology Core (Core C) is to support each of the Program Projects by providing computational support for the high-throughput genomic methods required by the Program. Specifically, the Core will focus on 3 main areas of support: data tracking/management/distribution, high- throughput sequencing analysis, and functional characterization of genes/motifs. Importantly, all Projects will generate significant amounts of genome-scale data, including the recombination and double stranded break (DSB) maps of Project A Paigen, the PRDMS-ChlP-seq and Affinity-seq of Project B Petkov, and the RNA- seq and H3K4me3-ChlP-seq of Projects C Hibbs and D Handel. The analysis of these diverse and voluminous data requires sophisticated techniques for data processing and analysis that the individual projects cannot provide. The ability of each project and of the overall Program to achieve our goals relies on accurate and reliable data management and analyses, which the Core will provide by accomplishing 3 specific aims: 1) The Core will manage the faithful tracking of information from mouse through final genomic data point by utilizing JAX's Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). 2) The Core will provide high-quality analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data by applying cutting-edge analysis methods. 3) The Core will facilitate biological interpretation of analysis results by providing Project Leaders with functional enrichment and motif analyses of their genomic data. All of these analyses will be delivered in a timely manner by coordinating with the other Program Cores and JAX's Gene Expression Service, which provides facilities and expertise in support of high-throughput sequencing and gene expression studies.

"9382334","Project Summary/Abstract Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasite that infects one third of the world's population. It remains in a latent state, encapsulated in cysts in the brain and muscle tissue of infected hosts. Reactivation rarely occurs, and usually only when the host has become significantly immunosuppressed. However, emerging literature suggests that chronic, latent infection is not innocuous. There have been reports associating depression, schizophrenia, suicidality, unusual behaviors, and migraine headaches with T. gondii IgG titers in chronically infected individuals. In addition, a few reports suggest that T. gondii can reactivate in healthy, immunocompetent pregnant women. These relationships have not yet been studied systematically in perinatal women. This proposal will study the relationships between latent T.gondii infection and depression through pregnancy and the early postpartum in T. gondii positive Hispanic women. Hispanic women are at highest risk for the type 1 serotype and a new highly virulent strain. Studies of behavioral and mood effects of T. gondii infection in both rodent models and humans have been done, but not in perinatal women. The research team has reported a relationship between T. gondii IgG titers and depression in second trimester pregnant women. In the proposed study, the role of socioeconomics and country of origin, cytokines, and immunosuppression will be determined across pregnancy. The relationship between IgG titer and depression in the postpartum will also be studied. A T. gondii negative control group will provide comparison. The second goal is to determine the true incidence of T. gondii reactivation in pregnant women with latent T. gondii infection. Women with positive IgG titers will be followed through pregnancy for changes in titer, symptoms, and for those with retinal scars, evidence of reactivation of chorioretinitis. The third goal is to explore the possibility of live tachyzoites transiting across the placenta into the fetal blood stream in T. gondii positive women.  "
"9345755","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam is the standard of care for rapid detection of abdominal free fluid in emergency medicine and trauma critical care. It is a point-of-care ultrasound exam that incorporates four views of the abdomen. In trauma, abdominal free fluid is assumed to be blood until proven otherwise. Timely detection is critical because if untreated abdominal hemorrhage can rapidly lead to hemorrhagic shock and death. In community hospitals, the FAST exam is underutilized due to limited access to physicians who are able to perform the exam (typically an emergency physician or trauma surgeon). In addition, the low cost and portability of ultrasound make it an ideal triage tool for prehospital settings including extreme environments like mass-casualty and combat zones. In these settings, detection of abdominal free fluid would impact medical transport prioritization and aid in the distribution of limited resources. BioSensics, in collaboration with Boston University School of Medicine, proposes to develop a portable ultrasound system to enable a minimally trained operator to perform and accurately interpret a FAST exam. The system will guide the operator through the image acquisition process and automatically compute a probability for abdominal free fluid. We have previously shown that image processing algorithms can detect free fluid with 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity in perihepatic (e.g., right upper quadrant) abdominal ultrasound views (J. Ultrasound in Medicine, In Press). In this Phase I SBIR project we will improve our image processing algorithms and validate them on FAST exams recorded using a portable ultrasound system. We will also develop a beta version of the system for usability testing and further clinical evaluation in Phase II. By the completion of Phase I the system will be able to concurrently record, and display in realtime, ultrasound images and ultrasound probe position and kinematics. Recording probe position and movement is important because it will assist the software in guiding a minimally trained operator through the image acquisition process. In Phase II we will develop operator guidance software and perform a randomized clinical trial to evaluate efficacy from the perspective of usability (can a minimally trained operator record a diagnostic quality exam) and performance (how much free fluid has to be present for the developed system to reliably detect it). The proposed technology has significant commercialization potential. Our first target market is emergency medical services including civilian ambulance companies and the U.S. military. Important use cases in this market include medical transport prioritization in mass-casualty and combat settings, as well as pre-hospital free-fluid assessment, particularly during longer transports. Our second target market is emergency departments with a focus on rural and community hospitals. Broader applications include use in resource limited global health medicine, as well as in many other specialties where non-trauma assessment of abdominal free fluid is necessary, such as the medically critically ill or to assess for ascites."
"9388012","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While it is known that dopamine-2 receptor (D2R) and ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) signaling in amygdala can relieve the symptoms of stress, there is a fundamental gap to understand how their act at the molecular, cellular and circuit levels to alleviate stress-induced disorders. The long term goal is to understand how the DA-induced stress-response can be modulated by interaction of GHSR1a and D2R for preventive and therapeutic purposes. The overall objective of this proposal is to define the physiological role of DA-signaling dependent on GHSR1a and D2R interaction in amygdala to regulate stress-induced feeding disorder. Our central hypothesis is that by allosterically enhancing DA signaling through GHSR1a:D2R heteromers in the amygdala by treatment with a GHSR1a antagonist the stress response can be regulated in a very specific way. This hypothesis is based on the results of our previously published work showing that D2R-signaling is modulated by allosteric interaction between GHSR1a and D2R. According to structure, GHSR1a antagonist either inhibit or enhance DA signaling in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo by modifying allosteric interaction between GHSR1a and D2R in GHSR1a:D2R heteromers. The rationale for the proposed research is that, fine-tuning DA-signaling in the amygdala by pharmacological targeting GHSR1a:D2R heteromers will lead to new and innovative approaches for preventing and treating stress-related eating disorders. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Characterization GHSR1a:D2R heteromer formation in amygdala neurons; and 2) Examine the neuronal circuits dependent on D2R activity in amygdala modulated by GHSR1a:D2R heteromers that control stress-induced feeding behavior. Under the first aim, already proven biophysical and single-molecule approaches will be used to characterize the interactions between GHSR1a and D2R in neurons of amygdala. Under the second aim, to map the neuronal projections of amygdala dependent on GHSR1a the CRE-DOG methodology will be used in Ghsr1a-ires-GFP mice. The Cre- dependent DREADD technology will be used to determine functional connectivity of amygdala in a stress- induced feeding behavior. The proposed research is significant because by exploiting the previously unappreciated mechanism of DA-action through GHSR1a:D2R heteromers we have the opportunity to identify new therapeutic agents that act selectively on neurons coexpressing GHSR1a and D2R, without affecting neurons expressing D2R monomers or homodimers. The proposed research is innovative, because our approach to fine-tune DA transmission by allosteric targeting the protomer partner of D2R in the GHSR1a:D2R heteromeric complex represents a new and substantive departure from traditional strategies for identification of therapeutic agents in CNS. This type of approach is expected to overcome the problems that have been associated with side effects of dopaminergic drugs designed to target D2R in CNS."
"9327190","Title: The interplay between RAD51C sub-complexes during replication fork repair Abstract: Alkylating agents are an environmentally relevant class of DNA damaging compounds that can cause replication fork damage and subsequent collapse leading to double-strand breaks (DSBs). One important group of proteins used to repair DSBs includes the RAD51 paralogs. However, the role of the RAD51 paralogs in response to alkylation-induced DNA damage has been understudied in human cells. The RAD51 paralog family consists of five proteins in humans, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3. They are known to assemble into sub-complexes with themselves and with other homologous recombination (HR) factors, but how each complex functions, and the DNA substrates they act upon remains undetermined. RAD51C is a member of multiple sub-complexes, and importantly mutations in RAD51C are linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancers and to Fanconi Anemia. Recently, the RAD51 paralogs have been found to localize to replication forks, but their recruitment to damaged forks, such as those induced by alkylation damage, remains to be investigated. My work will determine the importance of RAD51C in the repair of alkylation-induced DNA damage at replication forks. Using environmentally relevant alkylating agents and the prototypical methylating agent, methylmethane sulfonate, I will measure RAD51C presence at replication forks using the new technology, isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND). Further, by depleting RAD51C complex members in conditional knockout cell lines, I will use immunofluorescence and iPOND to visualize the consequential changes in RAD51C localization to determine which RAD51C containing sub-complexes are involved in repair of alkylation-damaged forks. Using yeast-two-hybrid analysis to screen cancer-associated RAD51C mutations, I will identify mutants that disrupt individual RAD51C-associated complexes. RAD51C separation-of-function mutations selected for functional analysis will be validated for interaction changes by co- immunoprecipitation and in vitro pull-downs. Using these RAD51C mutations, I will determine at which steps of repair RAD51C-associated complexes regulate repair in response to alkylation damage. These complementary approaches will determine the contribution of RAD51C in repair of alkylation-induced DNA damage and its overall role in preserving genomic stability. Further, this work will aid in our understanding of the significance of environmental factors that contribute to the cancer predisposition of individuals with RAD51 paralog mutations.  "
"9239323","PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq ? a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands ? to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments."
"9528063","Project Summary/Abstract We have discovered that lincRNA-Cox2 can act as a critical regulator of innate immune genes. The exact mechanisms of action of this lincRNA remain unclear. Knockdown of lincRNA-Cox2 in vitro results in a decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes while basal levels of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are elevated. In Aim1 we will determine the exact mechanisms utilized by lincRNA-Cox2 to control innate immune genes. We will use biochemical in vitro pull down assays to identify the critical regions or domains within lincRNA-Cox2 that control pro-inflammatory genes or ISG levels. We will perform RNA affinity purification to identify additional factors binding lincRNA-Cox2 to mediate its regulatory functions. In order to determine if lincRNA-Cox2 is critical for controlling host defense in vivo we have generated three murine models to test. We have a lincRNA-Cox2 knockout mouse in which the lincRNA locus has been replaced with a lacZ cassette. We have generated a splicing mutant mouse in which we removed the intron of lincRNA-Cox2 using Cas9 technology and finally we used the TARGATT system to generate a lincRNA- Cox2 over-expressing mouse. Preliminary data from our knockout mice suggests that lincRNA-Cox2 can mediate its effects on innate immune genes both in cis and in trans. We will use our additional models to answer critical questions about the functions of splicing and locus specific transcription and how they can impact lincRNA-Cox2's functions. We will perform LPS and E.Coli in vivo challenge models in order to determine if lincRNA-Cox2 is critical for controlling host defense in an entire organism. This project will allow us to address the importance of lincRNA-Cox2 in host defense and set in place a new layer of complexity and control in the RNA-immune-regulation of inflammation."
"9530732","PROJECT SUMMARY Epigenetic plasticity within oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) limits the efficacy of targeting PI3K/Akt, the most mutated oncogenic pathway in this disease. We have shown that maximal Akt activation occurs in only a small subset of OSCC cells and depends on the H3K4 demethylase JARID1B. By contrast, PI3K signaling is suppressed in a quiescent cell fraction that is enriched by anti-PI3K drugs. These non-dividing G0- like cells are primed to upregulate JARID1B, which reprograms them into an Akt-hyperactive state that divides slowly and is sensitive to PI3K inhibition. The stem cell-like molecular profile and high tumorigenicity of these JARID1Bhigh cells implicate them as drivers of OSCC progression and intermediates for G0-like cells returning to rapid division. When JARID1Bhigh cells are depleted by PI3K inhibitors, the G0-like fraction expands and may sustain tumor growth by an alternate, JARID1B-independent pathway allowing their exit from quiescence. Our working hypothesis is that G0-like cells are driven by JARID1B into a PI3K-dependent, stem cell-like phenotype but also play a central role in sustaining OSCC growth under PI3K inhibition by bypassing this state. This proposal determines JARID1B's contribution to G0-like cells exiting quiescence by testing the hypothesis that JARID1B-mediated silencing of p27kip1 and PTEN allows PI3K hyper-activation to drive G0-like cells from quiescence to an aggressive phenotype (aim 1). It will also delineate the JARID1Bhigh state's mechanistic basis and direct role in OSCC progression. In this setting, JARID1B is hypothesized to enforce a slow cycling state with high invasive and metastatic potential by prolonging S/G2 and suppressing the miR-200 family (aim 2). The roles of G0-like and JARID1Bhigh cells will also be defined under PI3K inhibition, where JARID1Bhigh cells hypothetically return to a G0-like state that then sustains cancer progression via MAPK pathway compensation in a JARID1B-independent manner (aim3). Defining JARID1B's regulation of the tumor cell heterogeneity underlying PI3K/Akt activation offers a novel basis to treat PI3K-driven malignancy. Specifically, targeting JARID1B holds promise to both deplete aggressive, Akt-hyperactive states and allow combined inhibition of MAPK signals or other targets with low toxicity. This proposal thus helps realize the potential of therapies integrating current drugs with emerging tools to target epigenetic regulators."
"9335721","AP1 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT AP1 will discover therapeutic agents for Chagas, leishmaniasis and other diseases by accessing Brazil's microbial diversity. No effective treatment is available for Chagas disease, and treatment of leishmaniasis is still incomplete. Brazil is one of the world's megabiodiverse countries, incorporating 70% of the world's catalogued animal and plant species and some 15-20% of the world's biological diversity. In spite of this huge potential, not a single natural product isolated from Brazilian natural sources has been developed. Most natural products research in Brazil has prioritized plants; this ICBG will focus on the bacterial symbionts of social insects that have evolved to chemically defend their hosts. In addition to discovering new chemotypes from Brazil's microbial diversity, this proposal will expand the knowledge and appreciation of it and thereby contribute to informing biodiversity preservation policies in Brazil. Bacterial strains will be isolated from invertebrates collected in different Brazilian biomes, such as Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, Amazon and Caatinga, and preserved in AP1. Strains that showed desired potency and selectivity in AP4 primary assays will be evaluated in in vitro antiparasitic assays against Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani in AP1. Antiparasitic extracts will be fractionated in AP1 using different chromatographic methods, and active natural products will have their structures established using spectroscopic and spectrometric data analyses. This AP1 will also aim the training of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in multi-investigator interdisciplinary research with a focus on natural products from bacterial symbionts. This sort of interdisciplinary research requires training both in specific subjects as well as a broad appreciation of therapeutic development. Training Brazilian students and young researchers through short and long term internships in the US associated laboratories will enable them to meet the expectations of the Brazilian government in facing country's major challenges for scientific and technological development."
"9217572","Abstract  Live attenuated RSV vaccine candidates are grown in Vero cells because these cells support RSV replication  better than the several others approved by the WHO. However, during growth in Vero cells, the viral  attachment glycoprotein, G, is cleaved and no longer supports infection of primary well differentiated human  airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. The RSV G (attachment) glycoprotein on the virion surface is essential for  efficient infection of its target cell, the ciliated columnar cells in the HAE cultures. HAE cultures are an excellent  in vitro model for in vivo RSV infection of the nasal epithelium of a vaccinee. Inefficient infection of these cells  would necessitate that vaccine inocula contain 10-fold more virus than if the G protein were not cleaved,  greatly increasing the price of vaccine production. Project 2 will identify mutations that prevent cleavage and  insert these mutations into the G gene to prevent G protein cleavage during vaccine production in Vero cells.  Candidate `repaired G' viruses will be tested for their infectivity and ability to spread in HAE cultures, stability  during repeated passage in Vero cells, and immunogenicity in cotton rats. The best `repaired G' mutations will  be inserted into double and triple gene mutant viruses containing the best NS1 protein mutants (predicted to  enhance immunogenicity) or/and the best L protein mutants (representing a range of attenuating mutations)  that will be generated by Projects 1 and 3, respectively. These viruses will all be tested in HAE cultures (Core  C) and in cotton rats (Core B) for function and antibody production using novel ELISA and neutralization  assays developed by Core C). Finally, the overall immune response to these mutant RSV vaccines will be  assessed with a novel gene expression chip assay developed by Core C in collaboration with Project 4. This  assay identifies a `safe' immune response, as one that is similar to mild RSV infections in infants rather than  severe RSV disease. The best combination mutant viruses will be selected as ideal live attenuated RSV  vaccine candidates for future testing in non-human primates and in human trials. "

"9316633","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinal degenerative diseases, such as the orphan diseases Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Lebers congenital amaurosis (LCA), cause dysfunction and cell death of photoreceptor (PR) cells leading to blindness. Afflicting an estimated 100,000 and 3,000 people respectively, these blinding diseases are devastating for those afflicted. The NIH has recognized a need to address rare diseases through its 'Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases' (TRND) initiative. Although gene-therapy for one specific form of LCA shows promise, for other retinal degenerations there is no cure and significant gaps exist in our understanding of how PR loss occurs. To address this we will develop genetically modified human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) based retinal cell-reporter lines and RD-associated hiPSCs that will help us exploit cell-signaling pathways that promote retinal eyecup differentiation and uncover pathways potentially involved in PR cell death. A central hypothesis is that human stem cell derived retinal optic cups will recapitulate retinal development and/or degeneration. This hypothesis is supported by our recent work showing that hiPSCs can be coaxed into becoming retinal eyecup-like structures with PRs and a laminar morphology similar to the mature retina. This proposal will bridge three innovative technologies; (1) hiPSCs to generate 3D-differentiatied retinas, (2) genome-editing using CRISPR technology to generate genetically matched retinal reporters and disease-based mutant hiPSCs and (3) a small molecule chemical screen to identify pathways that increase PR generation. In the mentored phase (AIMS1- 2), the PI will carry out genome-editing work and gain further expertise in Dr. Donald Zack's lab and will acquire training at the Wilmer high-content screening (HCS) center where the PI will be able to screen small molecule chemicals to probe for signaling pathways relevant to retinal and PR development. The mentored phase will be supplemented by training with Dr. Jiang Qian, an expert in bioinformatics, who will provide training in the analyses of NextGen sequencing datasets relevant to PR development (mentored phase) and during degeneration (independent phase). This project will not only enhance the PI's technical skills through training in completely new areas, but could identify novel mechanisms for PR development and provide mechanistic insight into PR degenerations. The goal of the mentored phase of this project is thus to uncover new mechanisms that could increase the efficiency and pace of PR/eyecup generation thus lending insight into the biology of eye development and provide a practical research tool that will be exploited to develop disease models during the independent phase of this project. These goals are significant because identification of such mechanisms will help to fill a major gap in our knowledge about how human PRs develop and degenerate and could uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention."
"9316507","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Image evaluation of skeletal muscle biopsies is a procedure essential to research and clinical practice. Although widely used, several major limitations exist with respect to current muscle image morphometric measurement, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, retrieval, and mining procedures: 1) Although traditional morphometric parameters, such as cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimum Feret diameter, etc., serve as critical indicators for assessing muscle function, current measurements are still largely based on manual or semi-automated methods, leading to significant labor costs with large potential inter-observer variability. 2) The current archiving of muscle images is still mainy based on outdated tools such as Excel spreadsheets and computer file folders. Given a new muscle image, it is almost impossible to quickly cross-compare, visualize, query, search, and retrieve previous cases exhibiting similar image contents with comparable morphometric measures, for the purpose of either discovering novel biological co-correlations at benchside, or providing personalized diagnosis and prognosis at bedside. 3) Although a typical muscle image often contains millions of data points (pixels), in clinical practice, doctors often condense this rich information into one or two diagnostic labels and discard the rest. Novel image markers, which are not always apparent through visual inspections or not manually quantifiable, but potentially represent critical diagnostic and prognostic values for precision medicine, have not been rigorously examined. Similarly, in basic science research, only a very limited number of known measures (e.g., CSA) are considered. Some non-traditional measures, such as myofiber shapes that hold the potential to serve as new indicators of muscle functions, are not fully investigated. 4) Current muscle image analysis and searching functions are fairly low throughput. As a frontier research area, Cloud computing can handle big image data in a distributed manner by providing high-throughput computational power. However, its application to muscle images has never been explored. MuscleMiner will provide a complete suite of tools for automated image morphometric measurements, archiving, visualization, querying, searching, content-based image retrieval, bioinformatics image mining, and Cloud computing. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Develop the automated morphometric measurement unit, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) unit, and the image archiving and visualization unit. 2) Develop the advanced bioinformatics image mining unit to assist in the rapid discovery and validation of new image markers. 3) Develop the Cloud computing unit to enable big image data processing and searching functions.

"9358749","Abstract Primary immune deficiency diseases (PIDs), now at well over 250 different defects, have provided a remarkable resource for investigators in human immunology. The study of human PIDs has made possible some of the most exciting advances in immunology today. With the accelerated pace of work in human diseases, it is clear that many more immune defects will be discovered in the next few years, each of which can illuminate essential components of human immunity. While there have been amazing advances in the understanding of many of these conditions, the pathogenesis of the more common immune defects, those which impair B cell function, are still largely uncharted territory. These diseases include the common and heterogeneous conditions, common variable immune deficiency, selective IgA deficiency, IgG subclass and specific antibody deficiency. This application is for a competitive renewal to provide continued Program Project support for a stellar, energetic, and highly collaborative research group that focuses on these diseases. The advantageous and efficient use of these rare human resources is best accomplished by a Program Project approach, in which a medical center with an established program in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of patients, is able to coordinate and support the collective work of a group of integrated and dedicated investigators who have devoted their careers to the study of human immunology and PIDs. This group of investigators located in the NYC area has been drawn together by shared synergy, enthusiasm, and passion for this field. Our established collaborations, with a proven track record of ongoing accomplishments, attest to the advantages, even the necessity of this approach."
"9313975","Major depressive disorder is the leading cause for disability among adolescents globally, and most young people do not receive treatment. Schools provide an unparalleled opportunity to reach early adolescents and reduce the global mental health treatment gap. Situated throughout urban and rural areas, schools are often located in communities with few-to-no other social service or health infrastructure. Growing evidence indicates that mental health treatment can be effectively delivered in low-resource schools by non-mental health professionals. However, a lack of research exists on schools-based treatment interventions for depression, especially in low and middle-income countries, or how to implement them within educational systems. This K01 proposes a multi-phase research study to implement Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Adolescents (IPT-G-A) in schools in Uganda. IPT-G-A is a manualized depression intervention that has demonstrated effectiveness with adolescents in Uganda, but has not yet been implemented or scaled-up in school settings. This project aims to understand the factors relevant to implementation and effectiveness of depression treatment in Ugandan schools and pilot a strategy for implementing IPT-G-A, leveraging an existing violence prevention program called the Good School Toolkit (GST). This study has three specific aims. The first aim is to examine factors relevant to the implementation and effectiveness of school-based interventions through secondary analysis of data from the GST effectiveness trial. Next, the project aims to determining the contextual and cultural influences on the implementation of IPT-G-A in schools leveraging the GST through qualitative methods. The third aim is to examine the acceptability and feasibility of implementing IPT-G-A for early adolescents with elevated internalizing symptoms through a pilot in 2 Ugandan primary schools currently using the GST.  These research activities will be combined with a comprehensive training program that integrates didactic lectures and mentored experiences. Led by Primary Mentor, Dr. Myrna Weissman, the plan includes the following goals: (1) to expand knowledge about parameters that are relevant to effectiveness and implementation of mental health interventions for adolescents; (2); to develop expertise in how to improve adoption of evidence-based interventions in school-based settings using community engagement approaches and (3) to learn and apply principles of hybrid effectiveness- implementation designs. This training will support my long-term career goal to become an independent investigator in effectiveness and implementation science for global mental health with a focus on adolescence. The research plan will produce data for a R01 to conduct a Type 2 Hybrid Effectiveness- Implementation Study on IPT-G-A in Ugandan schools leveraging the GST."
"9319140","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells) have the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into multiple lineages in vitro. This makes these cells  powerful tool to study early embryonic developmental pathways and to generate specific cell populations for regenerative medicine and disease investigation. Supported by R01 AR055299, our research group has pioneered methods to derive skeletal myogenic cells from mouse and human pluripotent ES and iPS cells. Until our work, studies in this area were rare since skeletal myogenic differentiation is extremely inefficient during in vitro differentiation. We reasoned that because in vitro systems do not recapitulate neural tube or notochord development, and indeed do not produce structures resembling somites, that the inducing signals that properly pattern paraxial mesoderm were absent. We have overcome this roadblock by activating the myogenic program through transient induction of Pax3 or Pax7 during early mesoderm development. This approach allows for the in vitro generation of large quantities of early embryonic skeletal myogenic progenitors. Transplantation of these cells into dystrophic mice results in myofiber and satellite cell engraftment that is accompanied by improvement in muscle force generation. This renewal application builds on the advances we have brought to the field over the past 5 years and evolves from these into 3 areas: i) understanding the molecular regulation of the embryonic myogenic program by Pax3, ii) investigating the long-term regenerative capacity of human pluripotent donor-derived satellite cells as well as their transcriptional profiling in comparison to in vitro generated myogenic progenitors, and iii) using myotubes from patient-specific pluripotent cells to biochemically and functionally model DMD/BMD pathology and its reversal by therapeutic delivery of dystrophin mini-genes."
"9339440","ABSTRACT A large number of studies require sampling biological signals, stimulating the brain, or infusing test substances in freely moving mice. Although several forms of tethers are currently available for this purpose, these devices restrain the mice?s activity to some degree. The animal?s mobility is usually reduced even more when several connections are needed with the mouse (i.e., electroencephalogram (EEG)/electromyogram (EMG) wires, fiber optics, and infusion lines). Telemetric devices and miniature pumps avoid the tethers, but they still restrict the animal?s movement because they are very heavy for a mouse (i.e., smallest telemetry EEG/EMG transmitter weighs ~4 grams or ~20% of the mouse?s body weight). It is expected that restraining the mouse?s movement will negatively influence the results of the study because it would cause stress and change various physiological parameters in the mouse. We recently developed a system with optical, electrical, and fluid connections that can be used for mice or any other small animal that does not require the use of a commutator, swivel, or fiber optic rotary joint. The specific aim of this application is to modify our system for the use in studies involving connections of infusion lines with freely moving mice. Such connections are commonly used in a large number of research studies (drug infusion, microdialysis, monitoring of blood pressure, etc.). Therefore, the new modification will significantly increase the capability and commercial potential of this system. Additionally, we will adapt our system for the use in SmartCageTM, thus creating a powerful platform for drug discovery studies. It will allow for completing the research projects faster and with a lower cost."
"9321055","Diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness in adults, is recognized as a microvascular complication of the disease, with retinal microvessels characterized by microaneurysms, leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, hemorrhages, increased permeability, capillary occlusion, neovascularization, etc. We propose that an underlying contributor to the retinal pathology is the loss of the endothelial surface layer (glycocalyx). The glycocalyx is a dense layer of molecules including proteoglycans (e.g., syndecan-1) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs, e.g., heparan sulfate). The glycocalyx facilitates the interactions between plasma molecules and their endothelial receptors, inhibits thrombosis, shields against leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion, transduces shear force, and acts as a permeability barrier. Inasmuch as heparan sulfate can be cleaved by heparanase, and syndecan-1 has multiple sites on its extracellular domain susceptible to cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), we hypothesize a role for these enzymes in the loss of the glycocalyx in diabetes. With a combined attack on both syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate, the functions of the glycocalyx could be substantially lost, which has been shown in many models to enhance leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. Such adhesion is thought to promote the occlusion of capillaries in the diabetic retina, leading to the subsequent development of ?acellular? capillaries that are no longer perfused, creating ischemic zones. Ultimately, the resulting hypoxia promotes uncontrolled angiogenesis that interferes with clear vision. When a leukocyte adheres to the endothelial surface, it can eventually be coerced back into the bloodstream by shear forces, or alternatively, cross the endothelium (emigrate) into the surrounding tissue in a mechanism mediated by platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). However, loss of PECAM-1 prevents leukocyte emigration, and adherent leukocytes can be trapped within capillaries causing continued occlusion and eventual capillary death. We and others have noted a loss of PECAM-1 from the diabetic retinal microcirculation, with this loss possibly caused by mechanisms such as MMP-mediated cleavage, cytokine- mediated decrease in production, and/or proteasomal degradation. The following specific aims address the overall hypothesis that diabetes induces the loss of key endothelial surface molecules that results in leukocyte adhesion, capillary occlusion, and eventual development of acellular capillaries: (1) Investigate the hypothesis that the loss of heparan sulfate from the diabetic retinal microcirculation is mediated directly by heparanase and indirectly by MMP-facilitated cleavage of syndecan-1, (2) Determine the mechanism(s) responsible for the loss of PECAM-1 from the diabetic retinal microcirculation, by testing for decreased expression, increased proteasomal degradation, and cleavage from the endothelial cell surface, and (3) Investigate the hypothesis that capillary occlusion by leukocytes and the development of acellular capillaries can be attenuated by protection of the endothelial surface layer."
"9289190","Impaired repair of alveolar epithelium after acute lung injury (ALI) can lead to heightened inflammatory response and tissue repair do not normally resolve. Studies in this application will test the hypothesis that impaired lung repair after injury is the result of GSH/AKT signaling imbalance in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) regulated by cyto-protection and pro-survival transcription factor, Nrf2. We found that global deletion of Nrf2 impairs lung repair after sub-lethal pro-oxidant (hyperoxia)-induced ALI. Using conditional mutant Nrf2 (floxed) mouse model to determine the contribution of lung resident cellular stress to acute lung and repair, we found that deletion of Nrf2 in lung epithelium impaired the resolution of ALI in a manner similar to that observed in Nrf2-null mice, suggesting that lung epithelial-Nrf2 signaling regulates pro-resolution response and lung repair. In agreement with this result, we found that primary AEC2s lacking Nrf2 (Nrf2-/-AEC2s) proliferate poorly due to oxidative stress and G2/M (not G1/M) cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, mitigating oxidative stress in Nrf2-/-AEC2s by exogenous N-acetyl-cysteine, but it failed to rescue G2/M arrest. In contrast, exogenous GSH mitigated stress, activated AKT signaling and restored proliferation in Nrf2-/-AEC2s. Preliminary 3D cell culture experiments showed reduced size of alveolospheres formation by AEC2s isolated from Nrf2+/+ mice exposed to sub-lethal (48-h) hyperoxia compared to room air counterparts. AEC2s from Nrf2-/- mice exposed to either room air or hyperoxia formed disorganized and reduced number of alveolospheres. Nrf2-/-AEC2s supplemented with GSH exhibited improved alveolosphere formation, but not efficient AEC2/1 trans-differentiation. In this project, we test hypothesize that AEC2-specific Nrf2 regulated signaling is essential for tipping the equilibrium towards either for optimal GSH/AKT- dependent AEC2 proliferation and GSH/AKT-independent AEC2/1 trans-differentiation. We will use multiple approaches to provide a mechanistic test of this hypothesis including the use of AEC2-tissue- specific loss-of-function (Nrf2-/-AEC2) and gain-of-function (Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1-/-AEC2) mouse models and small molecule Nrf2 activators. The Specific Aims to be pursued are: 1) to determine the mechanisms and role of Nrf2 regulated GSH/AKT-mediated signaling in the mechanisms of optimal AEC2 proliferation and AEC2/1 trans-differentiation, 2) to address in vivo the role of AEC2-specific Nrf2 as a pro-survival and pro-regenerative mechanism after ALI, and 3) to test the postulate that Nrf2 activation will accelerate AEC repair post-injury. Hyperoxia is used widely in the treatment of pulmonary diseases (such as COPD and ARDS), but its effects on the repair lung alveolar epithelium in these patients are not clearly understood. Likewise, abnormal repair of lung alveolar epithelium caused by bacterial infection is a major health concern. Thus, the studies proposed are of major scientific and clinical importance to critically ill ALI/ARDS patients."
"9403770","Abstract A number of studies performed by ourselves and others have investigated the contribution of S. aureus extracellular proteases to disease causation. Until recently, these data proved inconclusive, however work by our group has definitively shown that secreted protease are key mediators of S. aureus disease. Their role appears to be biphasic as: i) Secreted protease deletion leads hypervirulence in infected animals; whilst ii) A complete protease-null strain has impaired survival in human blood, decreased resistance to phagocytosis, increased sensitivity to AMPs and impaired ability for dissemination and/or survival during infection. An explanation for these findings stems from their differing roles, and substrates, during infection. Specifically, the enhanced mortality is driven by an increased abundance of virulence factors, which exist unchecked upon secreted protease deletion. Conversely, the virulence attenuation is mediated by these enzymes attacking the host, cleaving proteins that facilitate nutrition, immune evasion, and dissemination. However, despite this, much remains unknown about how these enzymes are regulated, how they themselves regulate infection, and how they enhance the fitness of S. aureus in vivo. To fill in these gaps we will explore: 1. Regulation by Secreted Proteases During S. aureus Infection. We currently do not know which proteases cleave which virulence factors, or how this influences the progression of infection. As such, in this aim we will connect in vitro virulence factor proteolysis to the pathogenic potential of S. aureus in vivo. 2. The Regulation of Secreted Proteases During S. aureus Infection. Although secreted proteases are produced alongside virulence factors, their synthesis must be (and indeed is) tightly controlled, so as to tailor virulence factor abundance during disease causation. Accordingly, in this aim we will fill in major knowledge gaps regarding secreted protease regulation in vitro, and connect this to what happens in vivo. 3. The Role of Secreted Proteases During S. aureus Infection. The next frontier of protease biology in the context of pathogenic bacteria is an understanding of the host degradome (the complete set of host proteins cleaved by bacterial proteases). Therefore, in this aim we will use cutting edge proteomic techniques to gain insight into the infectious process, and interaction of host with pathogen. Through these studies we will define specific pathways that directly govern S. aureus disease, providing a unique and detailed insight into the molecular events that occur during infection. This will produce key findings regarding S. aureus pathogenesis that has potential to be used for the future generation of novel anti-virulence based therapeutics."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cemented Total Knee Replacement (TKR) is an established and reliable procedure that seeks to restore joint mobility and relieve pain associated with rheumatoid or osteo-arthritis. While over 600,000 knees are implanted with great success annually, a substantial portion (~15%) fail prematurely. Most long-term failures are due to a process known as aseptic loosening, where the mechanical interlock between trabecular bone and cement weakens due to the erosion (osteolysis) of bone. This allows the implant to migrate and become painful, necessitating a revision surgery. Aseptic loosening is most often attributed to osteolysis caused by the body's response to articulating surface polyethylene (PE) wear accumulation at the implant-bone interface.  Importantly, short-term failures can and do occur, and these may not be related to PE debris since the amount of debris created is proportional to time in service. Recent studies of postmortem retrieved, clinically- successful, human TKRs point to an additional, contributing factor in aseptic loosening: in the short-term, there is >50% resorption of the trabeculae that initially interlock with the bone cement, but this occurs without much wear to the PE articulating surface. This suggests early loss of fixation is caused by an alternate mechanism.  In the postmortem studies, it was observed that when joint loads are applied to the TKRs, synovial fluid and/or marrow is pumped through small gaps between the interlocked trabeculae and cement. The fluid shear stresses (FSS) generated from the fluid pumping is estimated to be supraphysiologic, and will likely have an effect on the osteoblasts and osteoclasts that line the surface of trabecular bone. The overall goal of this study is to show that these supraphysiologic fluid shear stresses are sufficient to cause resorption of the trabeculae that interlock with cement, and that this can occur without PE debris. The Specific Aims of this project are to show: 1) trabecular resorption at the interface occurs in the absence of PE debris, 2) supraphysiologic FSS can affect resorption by increasing osteoclast activity (mineral resorption) while decreasing osteoblast activity (mineral deposition), and 3) PE debris accumulation and supraphysiologic FSS act in concert to produce more resorption than either process alone.  We will first identify the location and amount of PE debris at the cement-bone in postmortem retrieved, clinically successful, human tibial components of TKA with short term (<5 years) and long term (>10 years) use. We expect short-term devices to contain little to no wear at the interface, but have extensive bone resorption. In contrast, we expect long-term devices to have both substantial PE wear and resorption. Next, we will elucidate the effects of FSS ranging from sub to supraphysiologic levels on in vitro cell lines of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, with or without PE debris. These experiments will allow us to first, quantify PE debris in direct, physical relation to the cement-trabeculae interface of retrievals, and second, differentiate the effects of high FSS from PE debris. Overall, the goal of this work is to extend the long-term success of TKRs."
"9258791","Project Summary/Abstract  Lumen formation within unicellular, seamless tubes is essential in the development and function of the cardiovascular system. Small tubes, such as terminal vascular bed capillaries within the microcirculation, often form lumens by intracellular vesicle coalescence and membrane fusion with the leading edge of an invading apical domain. My long-term goal is to determine how polarized vesicle trafficking is regulated to ensure proper cell hollowing and tube formation in vivo. I will use the unicellular C. elegans excretory canal as a simple system to study this process, as it offers powerful genetic and cell biological tools, and has proven to utilize pathways conserved during vascular development and disease. Defects in nascent vessel lumen expansion lead to numerous vascular disorders, including myocardial infarction and stroke, and a molecular understanding of how lumens expand during vascular development and disease remains elusive. I anticipate that my findings will provide important insights to better understand how seamless capillaries within the vasculature are formed, with the hope of improving cardiovascular disease intervention.  PAR proteins are conserved regulators of cell polarity that contribute to diverse cellular processes. In the excretory canal, PARs localize to the luminal membrane, where they co-localize with the vesicle tethering exocyst complex. Our lab recently showed that exocyst is required for vesicle fusion during lumen formation, and that PARs can induce asymmetry of exocyst proteins in embryos. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that PARs define where the lumen will form by recruiting exocyst and directing vesicle fusion to these sites. Using a method to acutely deplete proteins in specific cells developed in our lab, I will test this hypothesis in vivo by removing PAR and exocyst function in the canal. The specific aims of my proposal are to: 1) Test the hypothesis that PAR proteins are required for lumen formation and/or maintenance; 2) Determine if the exocyst complex functions downstream of the PAR complex to mediate luminal vesicle recruitment; 3) Identify novel genes required to distinguish luminal from non-luminal surfaces in seamless tubes. First, I will generate conditional loss-of-function alleles for PARs to deplete their function in the canal and determine their role during lumenogenesis and exocyst recruitment. I will also use a conditional loss-of-function strategy to eliminate a core exocyst component, SEC-5, from the canal to determine its epistasis with respect to PARs by evaluating PAR localization. Finally, I will test candidate genes and undertake a genetic screen to uncover new genes required for luminal PAR and exocyst localization. My findings will greatly expand our understanding of the role for polarity cues and vesicle trafficking during cell hollowing. Understanding this process directly relates to many aspects of human health, including recovery from cardiovascular injury and ischemic disease. Thus the results of my studies will provide new insights into how nascent vessel growth can be restored as a means of improving current therapies of cardiovascular disease."
"9332053","SUMMARY  We have a system in the U.S. that is designed to make sure that research involving people is held to high ethical standards. Researchers that propose to conduct studies involving people must have their studies reviewed and approved by a research ethics board before a study may begin. These boards, known as Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are usually based at universities and other research institutions, and usually look at the risks and benefits to individuals participating in research. They are not designed to look at the risks and benefits to the communities involved. As more communities and community-based organizations get involved in research ? either as partners with academic researchers or as researchers themselves ? they are establishing their own IRBs and research review committees to make sure that the research is ethical and takes into account the risks and benefits to both individuals and communities. As documented in recent studies, these community IRBs and research review committees hold great promise for promoting ethical research and ensuring that the concerns of communities are adequately addressed by research. To support this emerging field of practice and research, a community-based organization in Los Angeles that manages its own IRB and a national organization in Raleigh that builds community capacity for research are jointly proposing a conference to convene community IRBs and research review committees from across the country to learn from one another; review the research about them that does exist; and identify priorities for research, practice and policy."
"9255232","ABSTRACT  Endotoxin neutralization in human plasma is an excellent indicator of chronic immune activation, which is an accurate predictor of mortality in HIV-1 infection. Recently we developed an assay using endotoxin neutralization as an indicator of immune activation due to bacterial translocation. This assay is accurate in discriminating healthy patients from those with inflammatory bowel disease in addition to indicating disease severity. Phase I of this project expanded the assay to patients with HIV-1 infection. Those experiments showed statistically significant differences between healthy controls and HIV-1-infected patients as well as between anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-naïve patients and those actively receiving treatment. Additionally, endotoxin neutralization correlated as expected with markers of viral load, CD4+ T cell number, inflammatory response, macrophage activation, endotoxin-specific immunoglobulin sequestration and endotoxin-specific protein production. In Phase II of this SBIR project we will follow a group of HIV-1-infected, ART-naïve patients as they initiate ART and continue treatment over a 6 month time period. At specific time points we will collect blood plasma to measure the level of endotoxin neutralization (Specific Aim #2), a panel of traditional biomarkers indicating specific sequelae of the disease (Specific Aim #3) and both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of circulating 16S rDNA (Specific Aim #3). With this data, we will use Pearson correlation and Student?s t-test to determine (1) differences in endotoxin neutralization between HIV-1-infected patients and a demographically similar healthy control group, (2) the effect of ART on endotoxin neutralization, (3) the correlation of endotoxin neutralization with viral load, CD4+ T cell number, intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, immune activation, inflammatory response and coagulopathy, and (4) the relationship of endotoxin neutralization with the species composition of the microbiome. Additionally, this project will include experiments to optimize the assay and prepare it for commercialization (Specific Aim #1)."

"9327007","The Developmental Research Project Program will build on expertise developed in IDeA Network for  Biomedical Excellence (INBRE) programs 1 and 2 to take advantage of Alaska, its unique environment,  animal and human populations, and exposure to contaminants. The program will leverage our biomedical  research focus on basic leading to translational research to improve overall health in the state focusing on  One Health (interactions of environment, animals, people). We will support new and existing INBRE faculty,  expand the network of INBRE faculty, and move toward a translational research perspective. To do this, we  will make seed grants available to all INBRE affiliates. Priority for funding will go to junior and newly-hired  faculty who do not have independent funding. Priority will also go to faculty whose projects are translational  and compliant with institutional animal or human subjects research guidelines and University of Alaska  (UA)'s Responsible Conduct of Research. Faculty who have already received INBRE funding will only be  considered for additional funding if they are addressing novel areas or collaborations. These seed grants will  act as a bridge for faculty to obtain extramural funding. Grant proposals will be reviewed externally by an  expert in the field, and faculty will have a chance to re-write their proposals to improve and resubmit them for  internal review based on feedback. All INBRE faculty are strongly encouraged to have mentors. While  mentors will serve a more traditional role for junior faculty, they will act as consultants or collaborators for  senior faculty. Faculty will also be supported with research infrastructure. INBRES relies on outstanding  resources by the institution, several of which INBRE supports via staffing, maintenance, and puchase of new  equipment. Faculty will be supported in their professional development by promoting networking, scientific  ethics and skills training, and opportunities for presentations at INBRES events. To expand our network and  broaden the range of expertise in the program, we will recruit faculty from clinical domains at UA, which will  foster new collaborations.

"9325598","We propose to leverage the multicenter international BVMC HHT recruitment network and the BVMC HHT database, in the next funding cycle, to characterize the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in HHT patients with BAVMs and subgroups. To do so, we propose to expand the cohort of HHT BAVM patients, building on our established multicenter HHT BAVM database, the largest such cohort in the world. By doubling the cohort size and extending natural history follow-up, in Aim 1 we will increase precision of ICH rates in HHT BAVM patients overall, as well as subgroups of patients, and bring these estimates into a relevant range for clinical decision making. In Aim 2, we propose to investigate genetic modifiers of HHT and BAVM phenotypes, building on preliminary evidence from the first BVMC cycle. We demonstrated that the ALK1 variant IVS3-35A>G is associated with HHT disease severity (presence of any organ AVMs), particularly in patients with an ENG mutation. We therefore postulate a second-hit or trans-heterozygosity hypothesis, which states that in addition to the disease-causing mutation, further reduction of function in the TGFBeta/BMP9 signaling pathway exacerbates HHT phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we will evaluate common variants in pathway genes for their association with (1) any AVMs and (2) BAVM risk in HHT patients and explore associations with ICH risk and other HHT severity phenotypes. We will utilize the initial BVMC HHT cohort (n=800, 200 BAVM) for discovery and the new second-cycle HHT cohort of 800 for replication. Aim 3 is an exploratory aim, in which we plan to study vessel wall inflammation in BAVMs and ICH, using vessel wall imaging and tissue review for inflammatory cells and mediators. Project 3 participants will be recruited through 12 HHT Centers of Excellence, as well as the Patient Support Organization, HHT Foundation International (HHTFI). The HHT investigator group will continue to work closely with the HHTFI, as well as with the DMCC, leveraging the established DMCC web-based portal, data collection and management protocols in place. The BVMC HHT Project will continue to provide a much-needed and valuable resource for the clinical neurovascular community for the study of BAVMs in HHT."
"9534805","PROJECT SUMMARY Anxiety disorders are the most common class of mental illness in children, affecting up to 30% of individuals prior to their eighteenth birthday. Children who develop an anxiety disorder often experience significant family, social, and academic impairments and are at increased risk for developing additional psychiatric disorders as adults. Although successful treatment has been linked to benefits that extend into adulthood, many children remain highly symptomatic even with the best available treatments. New early interventions are clearly needed for this highly prevalent condition. The mission statement of the National Institute of Mental Health offers a general approach to finding new treatments: ?to understand mind, brain, and behavior, and thereby to reduce the burden of mental illness through research.? Functional brain networks are collections of brain regions with a common function. Understanding pathology at the level of functional brain networks holds enormous promise for unlocking the development, etiology, and treatment of mental illnesses such as pediatric anxiety disorders. With this framework in mind, the purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to enable the candidate to develop a research program investigating alterations in functional brain networks in childhood anxiety disorders. The applicant's long-term goal is to use functional brain networks to predict longitudinal course, treatment response, and develop new treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders. To help achieve this goal, the training plan in this application addresses the applicant's need for training in clinical developmental psychopathology research. Training and mentorship are provided in: 1) clinical assessments of children for research purposes, 2) understanding emotional and cognitive development, 3) pediatric neuroimaging, 4) longitudinal study design and analysis, and 5) treatment development. The research plan for this project is closely linked to the training plan and includes the assistance of a multidisciplinary team of mentors and consultants. The research proposal tests the hypothesis that alterations in one particular functional network, the ventral attention network (VAN), are associated the development of anxiety disorders. General alterations in the VAN are proposed to result in anxiety by increasing the orientation of attention to threatening stimuli. To test these hypotheses, children ages 8-12 years with and without anxiety disorders are assessed twice, 24 months apart, using neuroimaging and behavioral methods in a prospective design. Data from this study will be used to inform an application for a more definitive R01 project that maps developmental relations between the ventral attention network and development of anxiety in young at-risk children before the onset of anxiety disorders. Results from this application are expected to have immediate treatment implications, by determining whether treatment development should target the ventral attention network. This proposal also develops a framework for examining additional functional brain network pathophysiology associated with pediatric anxiety disorders."
"9539270","Project Summary The goals of the ENCODE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) is to support the ENCODE Consortium by defining and establishing a strategy that connects all participants to the data and by creating avenues of access that distribute these data to the greater biological research community. The ENCODE Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via experimental assays with laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover how chromosomal elements function together to define human cells and tissues. The DCC's participation enhances the data created by these laboratories through the creation of structured procedures for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created the DCC will construct a state of the art data warehouse. The DCC will design and development robust software to enhance the data submission and unified data processing pipelines, the organization and access to metadata and the data warehouse. In addition, we will develop and maintain the ENCODE Portal that will be the primary entry point to the wealth of experimentally determined information as well as results of computational analyses. The Portal will integrate these data resources and make them available via enhanced search and browsing capabilities. Tools will be implemented to aid discovery by both experienced bioinformaticians and naïve laboratory staff. The DCC will evolve into a substantial service organization allowing biomedical research to take full advance of the ENCODE results. To this end the DCC will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations. The DCC, DAC, production laboratories and AWG will be tightly woven together to create the ENCODE Consortium."
"9340112","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  The past decade has seen quantum advances in the applications of technology to biomedical sciences. Among the more remarkable achievements has been the advent of whole genome sequencing allowing complete knowledge of the genomic DNA structure of innunierable organisms and the associated molecular biologic advances enabling comprehensive manipulation of these newly discovered genomic sequences. With this has come the ability to elevate scientific investigation of kidney disease and function to refined in vivo systems in the mammalian kidney. The validation of basic scientific discoveries in kidney disease now rests with studies in genetically engineered mouse models and naturally occurring human samples. The overarching objective of the Mouse Genetics and Cell Line Core in the Yale George M. O'Brien Kidney Center is to reduce barriers and facilitate application of in vivo mouse-based technologies to the study of kidney disease and to facilitate the extension of the studies to ex vivo cell-based systems derived from engineered mutant mice. The specific aims of the Core are to perform modification of genes of interest in bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) for use in transgenic mice; to isolate of primary tubule ceNs and conditionally immortalized cell lines from specific nephron segments of mutant mouse strains; to facilitate generation of conditional knockout and knockin gene targeting strategies and constructs and to provide general resources for investigators in mouse genetic applications. This Core will Coordinate with the Renal Physiology and Phenotyping Core to assist investigators couple mouse genetic services with physiological studies. It will coordinate with the Human Genetics and Clinical Research to integrate new human disease gene discoveries with animal and cell line models. There is inherent synergy in the mouse model and cell line components of this Core as it allowing investigators access to the spectrum from defined in vivo models to ex vivo cell line models with identical genetic makeup. The Core now adds a novel mechanism for cell line generation based on technology developed by Core faculty, an improved BAC recombineering methodology and a new service in conditional knockout or knockin allele generation based the BAC technology."
"9325519","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Motor adaptation is an important factor in the recovery of function following motor deficits associated with neural damage due to stroke, injury or aging. Such motor recovery or adaptation, is instructed by an error signal that is calculated by the brain from the mismatch between the desired movement and the actual movement produced. However, the brain circuits that process specific error signal(s) are not understood. The long-term goal of my research is to identify the neural mechanisms that process error signals to optimize sensory-motor behavior. Understanding these mechanisms and the circuitry underlying them will assist in devising rehabilitation therapies for motor deficits.  We have approached our goal by using monkey saccadic eye movements, which provide an ideal model because saccades are precise, use only a few muscles, the associated brainstem neural circuit has been well documented and they can be made to undergo motor adaptation by means of well-established behavioral paradigms. Thus far, we know that complex spike firing in the oculomotor vermis (OMV) encodes motor error and that the OMV is required for adaptation of targeting saccades. Complex spikes in the OMV originate in a part of the inferior olive that receives a projection from the superior colliculus (SC). Previously, we have shown that electrical micro-stimulation of the SC, timed to mimic visual error signals, induces saccade adaptation. Thus, the SC appears to be an important part of the error signal pathway.  In this study, we propose three projects to test the involvement of the SC in coding an error signal for saccade adaptation. The first project is directed at determining whether the SC is required for adaptation of targeting saccades. We will inactivate the SC reversibly during which time we predict that the monkey will be unable to adapt its saccades when subjected to a behavioral adaptation paradigm. The second project is directed at identifying correlates in SC visual activity with the visual error signal that drives adaptation. We will look for correlations of SC visual activity wit error size (small errors drive adaptation better than large ones) and with adaptation rate, which decreases as adaptation progresses. The third project will determine whether the SC is also used for adaptation of other types of saccade, including memory-guided, delayed, scanning and express. We will electrically stimulate the SC after one of these different types to mimic an error signal and determine whether, as for targeting saccades, this artificial error causes adaptation. I it does, we will test whether the adaptation transfers to the other types. We anticipate that together the results of these three projects will help establish a previously unsuspected role for the SC in saccade adaptation."

However, in order for the UDN to realize it's the full potential it is essential that the metabolomics core doesn't simply function as a high tec referral lab. We propose the formation of a partnership that will combine the state of the art analytical capabilities of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), with clinical, genetic and bioinformatics expertise from Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), to create a metabolomics core that functions as a fully integrated component of the network. The integration of this combined expertise will facilitate the linkage of novel metabolites or patterns of metabolites identified by the metabolomics core to the underlying metabolic and genetic derangements, as well as clinical signs and symptoms, and to translate this knowledge into specific clues regarding the genetic etiology of the patient's disorder. The major goal of this metabolomics core is to provide metabolomics assays and computational resources that will address the enormous challenges in developing a modern approach to the use of metabolomics in the diagnosis of disease. To achieve these objectives, we will interact with the UDN Centers to provide guidance on all aspects of metabolomics experimental design, sample collection and storage, sample analysis, and data processing and analysis. We will perform comprehensive, quantitative untargeted and targeted measurements to identify changes in molecular profiles that are associated with rare and undiagnosed diseases, while providing structural determination of novel metabolites associated with undiagnosed diseases. Working closely with the UDN Centers, including the treating physicians, we will integrate metabolomics and genomics data with patient clinical phenotypes to both aid diagnosis and provide mechanistic insight for rare and undiagnosed diseases. This work is significant because it applies state-of-the- art and advanced metabolomics, lipidomics, and glycomics measurements in the study of rare and undiagnosed diseases. This work is innovative because it combines the collective expertise in mass spectrometry and omics measurements of the PNNL team with the expertise in inherited metabolic disease and deep semantic phenotyping of the OHSU team and applies it to the challenge of diagnosis of disease."
"9282481","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A major problem for transfusion therapy for chronic anemia is the high degree of genetic diversity in blood group antigens in people of Asian and African backgrounds compared to white Europeans, who are the majority of blood donors. These polymorphic antigens on RBCs contribute to the high incidence of allo-immunization and presence of multiple antibodies in the serum of these patients. Identifying the specificity of thes antibodies and determining if they are auto- or allo- antibodies is critical for providing compatibe blood. The major goal of this application is to take advantage of the progress that has been made in the in vitro production of cultured red blood cells (cRBCs) by expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells, coincident with the progress made in the genetic characterization of rare blood groups, to develop reagent cRBCs to identify the presence of clinically significant antibodies to high prevalence donor antigens. Reagent cRBCs will facilitate antibody identification in highly allo-immunized multiply transfused patients, and streamline and standardize testing.  We have designed a panel of 6 donors with rare blood group phenotypes that are sufficient to resolve most antibody identification problems seen in patients who have auto- and allo-antibodies, and that could be used to transfuse patients who currently cannot be transfused because of shortage of appropriate rare blood. In Aim 1, we propose to develop new culture methods to expand hematopoietic cells collected from peripheral blood or differentiated from iPSCs by sequential amplification of the HSC, HPC and erythroblast compartments. We also propose to generate induce-pluripotent stem cells from these 6 donors and to engineer a group O, Rh null line of iPSCs that are useful as reagent red cells and that could be used as universal cells for transfusion.  Expression of surface antigens on cRBCs produced from peripheral blood or from iPSCs has not been extensively characterized. In Aim 2, we propose to compare cRBCs to native red blood cells from the same donor to determine if they would be suitable as reagent cells and for transfusion. We will focus on the antigenic profiles, the genotypes, the storage stability, and the performance of cRBCs in traditional blood bank assays.  Importantly, the reagent cRBCs that we will produce are the same cells that are in short supply for transfusion of allo-immunized patients. The method development and the quality testing that we propose to perform will therefore pave the way to the production of sufficient amounts of rare cRBCs for life saving transfusion therapies and define the first specific application, production of reagent red cells, and the first human indication, transfusion support for SCD patients without other options."
"9371651","Project Summary This phased innovation application in response to RFA-MH-16-406 seeks support for an initial (R61) 2-year phase for milestone-driven testing of a specific neural target of intervention by a novel modification of a treatment targeting organizational skills in children in 3rd to 5th grades of elementary school who have deficient organizational skills in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders. Attaining our proposed milestones would trigger support for three additional years (R33 phase) to confirm target engagement in a larger sample with random assignment to intervention vs. wait-list control conditions, to assess the relationships between target engagement and changes in functional outcomes. Organizational skills impairments contribute to school failure and to poor long-term outcomes and occur across multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. They are insufficiently addressed by medications or most existing behavioral treatments. Organizational skills training (OST) has resulted in robust, enduring improvements in a prior controlled trial. To further develop this intervention, we seek to identify the neural targets engaged by effective intervention. Our pilot data and theoretical considerations support the overarching hypothesis that intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) between dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior ventral striatum (aVS) represents a treatable target. Accordingly, in the initial R61 phase we propose to estimate the effect size of intervention-related decreases in dACC-aVS iFC in at least 22 children with high-quality imaging and clinical data obtained both before and after modified OST (OST-m). If we meet our proposed milestones that the decrease in dACC-aVS iFC will exceed a specific effect size and account for an appreciable proportion of the variance in the improvement in organizational skills, we would proceed to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we would expand the study to obtain at least 86 more children randomized to the OST-m intervention or to wait-list who will provide complete high quality pre- and post-intervention/waitlist imaging and clinical data. For both phases, we will obtain state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data with a primary focus on resting-state functional MRI. Our specific aims in the R33 phase are to confirm target engagement in the group randomized to OST-m vs. the waitlist group; to examine the relationship between changes in the neuronal target and clinical improvements in organizational skills and academic proficiency; and to identify moderators of improvement in organizational skills by examining baseline clinical measures alone and in combination with whole-brain voxel-wise resting-state indices. Evidence supporting the validity of dACC-aVS iFC as a modifiable neural target would then support future studies to further enhance the effectiveness of cognitive/behavioral interventions in children. Importantly, even negative results will be informative regarding the OST ?dosage? required to attain substantial effects. Inconclusive results from brain imaging would still inform Bayesian priors for future studies of the neural substrates of organizational skills impairments and their amelioration."

"9256994","Project Summary/Abstract The Duke University Superfund Research Center (DUSRC) examines the problem of early life exposure to hazardous chemicals and later life consequences. The overall function of the Analytical Chemistry Core (ACC, Core B) is to provide routine sample analysis and monitoring of Superfund-relevant contaminants for Research Projects within the DUSRC. Furthermore the ACC provides analytical expertise in identifying transformation products and/or metabolites of these Superfund contaminants using high-resolution mass spectrometry techniques. The ACC has been an essential component of DUSRC over the past funding period, and has generated a large quantity of data in support of the research activities of all DUSRC Projects (Over 2,500 samples analyzed as of January, 2015). Quantitative analyses have centered on determining brominated and alternative flame retardants, organophosphate pesticides (and their transformation products), and PAHs in a variety of biological and environmental samples at trace (ppb or lower) levels. In addition to the routine quantitative analysis work performed in support of the DUSRC Projects, ACC staff have been actively involved in method development activities as new analytes and sample types have been introduced into the Projects. Examples include analysis of tetrabromobisphenol A and its debromination products in biosolids and 1,2- bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane in cell culture media. Progress has been made in applying high-resolution mass spectrometry and other methods for non-targeted and effects-directed analysis of novel contaminants and transformation products of Superfund-relevant chemicals in environmental and biological media. Here, we propose to continue and extend the activities of the ACC, with an expanded focus on targeted analysis of developmental toxicants including organic (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organophosphate pesticides and aryl organophosphate esters, halogenated aromatics and phenolics, and alternative flame retardants) and inorganic (e.g. mercury, arsenic, and selenium) contaminants in biological and environmental samples, in support of all DUSRC projects. This will be accomplished using established protocols and existing instrumentation (e.g. GC-MS and LC-MS/MS) with experienced operators. In addition, we propose an increased role for non-targeted and transformation product analysis using high resolution mass spectrometry instrumentation coupled to novel data analysis strategies. The ACC will continue to act as a training and consulting service for analytical chemistry within DUSRC. Finally, our expertise in analytical method development will be brought to bear on new and emerging contaminants identified as important for investigation within the SRC Projects. These activities will draw on our considerable success to date in developing, validating, and applying methods for contaminant analysis in environmental and biological samples."
"9385674","Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a severe condition that often results in life-threatening multiorgan dysfunction. This proposal describes a 5-year research and training program that will permit Dr. Stephen Standage to develop as an independent investigator conducting clinically relevant, basic and translational research in sepsis pathogenesis. Having completed fellowship training in pediatric critical care medicine and building on a background of basic research training in sepsis immunology, the applicant seeks to develop new knowledge and skills to investigate how regulation of metabolic pathways influences organ dysfunction in sepsis with an objective to identify key mechanisms and therapeutic interventions that may improve patient outcomes. This research project specifically focuses on elucidating how PPAR? influences cardiac energy production and heart function in sepsis. PPAR? is a nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor that regulates many inflammatory and metabolic processes. Previous research has demonstrated that children with septic shock have significant downregulation of PPAR? in peripheral blood leukocytes. The applicant's preliminary studies demonstrated that mice lacking PPAR? (Ppara-/-) have much higher mortality in experimental sepsis, but reconstitution with bone marrow from wild type mice did not rescue the mortality phenotype, indicating a critical role for tissue PPAR? in regulating organ injury and mortality in sepsis. Septic Ppara-/- mice have elevated plasma and tissue markers of severe cardiac injury and show decreased heart function compared to wild type mice, findings that are associated with lower fatty acid oxidation in the Ppara-/- group. Collectively, these data support the overall hypothesis that PPAR? preserves cardiac function in sepsis by activating fatty acid oxidation and that augmenting cardiac PPAR? signaling will improve survival. The specific aims of the proposed investigations are to: 1) Define the role of PPAR? expression in heart function and survival in sepsis using a novel transgenic, cardiac-specific PPAR? knock-out mouse and a mouse strain that over-expresses PPAR? in the heart; 2) Identify the metabolic pathways that influence PPAR? dependent cardiac function in the heart by measuring cardiac ATP production and substrate utilization, tissue gene expression and metabolite levels, and by evaluating mitochondrial structure and function; and 3) Determine whether pharmacologic PPAR? activation ameliorates septic cardiac dysfunction and improves survival. This work is significant and has high translational potential because PPAR? signaling is a targetable mechanism with FDA approved agonists already on the market. The hypotheses evaluated here challenge the prevailing paradigm that sepsis morbidity and mortality result from immune dysregulation and findings will have the potential to reframe the approach to treating this significant public health problem."
"9408688","Project Summary NIH SBIR Phase-II, Jan 5, 2017 Application Title: ?A disposable assay for the monitoring of heart failure at the point-of-care? Accel Diagnostics, LLC Contact PI: Alberto Gandini, Ph.D., MBA The objective of this proposed SBIR Phase II is to complete the development and optimization of the pScreen-BNP? platform for the monitoring of Heart Failure, HF, in home patients. The proposed activities include integration of a smart phone app, scale up manufacturing capability that adhere to the FDA Quality Control guidelines, reduce production cost, and complete a clinical validation study in collaboration with The University of California San Francisco. The pScreen-BNP has several unique features. It is fully disposable (single use) and does not requires bench-top or hand-held devices, hence it is easy to use and very affordable; it is also a quantitative and sensitive assay, hence it provides an accurate and precise quantification of the level of Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in HF patients' blood. BNP is a cardiac biomarker elaborated by heart tissue when stressed due to the onset of heart failure. It is widely known for its specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of HF. Heart Failure remains a leading cause of death and disability in elderly Americans, and places a significant burden on the healthcare systems with a cost exceeding $40 billion/year. Early diagnosis is a critical necessity to achieve meaningful change in outcome. pScreen-BNP? marks in this respect, a paradigm shift in HF management. It allows, for the first time, HF patients to frequently monitor their level of heart distress outside of the clinical setting, e.g. in the comfort of their homes, similar to the more familiar glucose test. Our solution would enables patients and their physicians to respond before physical symptoms occur, preventing otherwise frequent life threatening events and costly re- hospitalizations. pScreen-BNP? is based on a patent-protected technology initially developed at Carnegie Mellon University, and licensed exclusively Worldwide to Accel Diagnostics."
"9407939","P1. Abstract Virus maturation is critical for HIV-1 replication and occurs through an orchestrated series of Gag and Gag-Pol cleavages that result in formation of the conical viral capsid enclosing the viral genomic ribonucleoprotein complex. HIV-1 maturation represents an attractive target for antiviral drug development as evidenced by studies of the small molecule inhibitor bevirimat. In this project, we will employ structural, biochemical, and virological methods to generate new insights into the structure and dynamics of the immature Gag lattice and the effects of maturation inhibitors. We will also define the mechanism by which Integrase-RNA interactions localize the RNP within the viral capsid. Finally, we will dissect the mechanism by which uncleaved matrix-capsid interferes with HIV-1 maturation. These studies will reveal new fundamental aspects of HIV-1 maturation and its inhibition."
"9319312","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emergency departments (ED) save lives, but some modifiable ED factors may cause patients harm in the long term. The goal of the proposed research is to benefit millions of patients by identifying those ED factors that are associated wit poor long-term psychiatric and medical prognosis after ED treatment. Most medical contexts are calm and predictable, but EDs frequently are not. Overcrowding and associated factors vary substantially through the course of a single day in almost every ED in the US, with some hours characterized by calm and quiet and others by overcrowding and chaos. We have found that patients treated for acute cardiac events when the ED is crowded are at increased risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and that PTSD symptoms after a cardiac event are associated with a doubling of risk for a subsequent cardiac event or mortality. Further, research conducted in the past two years has shown that acute cardiac patients treated in crowded EDs are at increased risk for in-hospital and one-year mortality. It is possible that ED factors increase the risk of PTSD, which in turn may lead to worse cardiac outcomes. Although many of the hypothesized iatrogenic aspects of EDs are modifiable, clinical guidelines ignore them and very few EDs have taken the steps necessary to address them. In fact, while ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] patients are treated in accordance with well-defined clinical pathways that ensure they are moved quickly through the ED, no such guidelines govern the ED treatment of over one million patients hospitalized annually in the United States with non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) or unstable angina (UA). Thus, these patients are often exposed to potentially harmful ED factors for 12 hours or longer while they wonder whether they are having a life-threatening heart attack. Whether ED factors increase risk for PTSD and subsequent cardiac events/mortality in NSTEMI/UA patients have not been tested comprehensively. We propose observing a cohort of patients with NSTEMI/UA from presentation in the ED through inpatient care. We will measure three potentially harmful ED factors: (1) crowding (census, wait time, and exposure to others' critical care); (2) interpersonal factors (doctor-patient communication, presence and effectiveness of social support); and (3) patient reactions (physiological arousal and psychological arousal). Research coordinators will first capture real-time crowding data and patients' psychological reactions briefly in the ED then assess patient reactions and interpersonal factors comprehensively during inpatient stay. A clinician will interview participants by telephone to determine PTSD status one month after baseline, and we will ascertain cardiac event recurrence and all-cause mortality (ACM) one year after baseline. Potentially harmful ED factors are modifiable. This research will determine whether ED factors increase risk of cardiac recurrence, mortality, and PTSD in the more than one million NSTEMI/UA patients treated in US EDs every year, identify those factors that are most important to target, and point to interventions to offset that risk."
"9360101","Abstract We are developing a novel embedded-ensemble encoding (EEE) theory for mammalian neocortex to unify data from cell and network experiments, and to infer general principles of how information is processed in the brain. Our combination of investigators includes a theorist/modeler, an experimentalist/modeler and a modeler/ neuroinformatician. Our theory is based on the observation that cortical pyramidal neurons produce synaptically-induced dendritic plateau potentials that place an individual neuron into an activated state. This brings that neuron near to threshold, and also reduces membrane time constant, so that the activated cell PNact can readily and rapidly follow synaptic inputs. We hypothesize that ensembles of these activated cells provide the activated ensemble Eact, embedded in the overall cells of the column. There is then a second embedding of an ensemble based on synchronized spiking among the cells of Eact. This twice-embedded ensemble is denoted as Esync, with Esync Eact. Synchronized spike coding within area then provides the substrate for a broad distributed ensemble across areas that would allow the binding of multimodal features into coherent object perception (based on binding-by-synchrony theory). EEE theory has direct implications for interpretation of both binding-by-synchrony theory, and for theories of Bayesian predictive coding. Developed tools will be used to facilitate other projects through our end-users: 1. developing further reduced models for more detailed analysis (Mihalas); 2. develop models for place cell theory (Kubie); 3. develop new data analysis and stimulation protocols in macaque for use in brain-machine interface development (Francis). We propose to work primarily in a multiscale model both to develop further details of EEE theory, and to make speci?c predictions. In neuroscience, unlike in physics, detailed predictions for measures in the brain must be obtained by instantiating the theory in simulation, which allows the experimentalist to identify a particular scale and aspect of the theory that is accessible through their experimental measures. Our Speci?c Aims are: 1. Develop a set of single cell models of Layer 5 pyramidal cells based on available experimental data and morphologies, and test input/output activity patterns for inputs on basilar and apical oblique dendrites. Generate model predictions that can be tested in in vitro or in vivo experiments with dendritic imaging. 2. Build networks and test with ?ring variability, coding density, information-theoretic signal ?ow-through, graph-theoretic measures. Veri?cation will be performed across multiple model instantiations. Speci?c experimental predictions will be made for future model validation. 3. Disseminate theory, models and experimental predictions through model sharing, workshops, tutorials, and courses. Tools to be developed and shared include genetic algorithms for model parameter ?tting, background-driving and activation-input data-suites, and speci?c cell and network models."
"9356500","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) results from excessive accumulation of fat in the liver (steatosis). A subset of NAFLD patients will also develop steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, which is associated with a heightened risk for liver cirrhosis and increased liver-related morbidity and mortality. Clinical outcomes for NAFLD patients with coincident hepatocyte injury and liver inflammation are substantially worse compared to individuals with simple steatosis, yet to date, clinical characteristics and laboratory values have not been useful for predicting disease severity in NAFLD. Further, the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneous outcomes of NAFLD remain poorly understood, which limits accurate diagnosis and treatment of the disease. An important clinical challenge, therefore, is to distinguish those patients with NAFLD who are more likely to develop clinically severe forms of fatty liver disease from those who will not. Emerging evidence supports a role for epigenetic factors, particularly DNA methylation, in the development of NAFLD, which may link environmental exposures with pathophysiological mechanisms. The overall goal for this project is to characterize the role of DNA methylation in the development of NAFLD fibrosis. The specific aims of this study are to first perform DNA methylation profiling to identify CpG sites that are differentially methylated between NAFLD without fibrosis and NAFLD with fibrosis using linear mixed effects regression. We will follow up on the most differentially methylated CpG loci in an independent sample of individuals from the same cohort as well as participants from the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN) using the same design as the discovery cohort matched for age, sex, and ethnicity. We will then integrate data from high throughput RNA sequencing of liver biopsies from the discovery cohort with DNA methylation results to identify genes that are coordinately affected by methylation status and associated with the presence of fibrosis. Finally, we will combine already acquired data from genome-wide genotyping and results from the DNA methylation analyses to identify cis methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs). Characterization of the key sites regulated by DNA methylation and the associated effects on gene expression will improve our understanding of the biology underlying NAFLD-related fibrosis. Such information may lead to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention and/or improved methods for identifying NAFLD patients who will likely develop coincident fibrosis and/or cirrhosis. Given the substantial public health burden of NAFLD, which is increasing at alarming rates due to the rising prevalence of obesity, novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed to facilitate the development of improved pharmacological therapies for the treatment and prevention of the disease."
"9365708","Project Summary Increasing lines of evidence in mammals have shown that certain acquired traits during paternal environmental exposure could be ?memorized? in sperm and transmitted to the future generations, implicating epigenetic inheritance via the sperm. Particularly, diet-induced metabolic disorders in the father are heritable in mammals, suggesting this type of epigenetic inheritance has a long-term impact in many metabolic-related human diseases. To date, the exact sperm ?epigenetic carrier? that responds to paternal dietary changes and transmits the intergenerational phenotype has remained elusive, but presumably involves DNA methylation, chromatin status or non-coding RNAs. Recently, in a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model, we showed that highly enriched, tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) from sperm are altered in both expression profiles and RNA modification after paternal HFD exposure. We also showed that sperm tsRNAs, along with their RNA modifications, are required for intergenerational transmission of paternally acquired metabolic disorders (Chen et.al. Science, 2016). This discovery raises the open question of how sperm tsRNAs, along with their RNA modifications, mediate the embryonic developmental programming that affects the offspring phenotype (Chen et.al. Nat Rev Genet, 2016). To understand the underlying mechanisms, we propose to (1) identify the target of sperm tsRNAs by injecting sperm tsRNAs (from HFD and control males) into zygotes, followed by comparative single-cell embryo RNA-seq of 2- to 4-cell embryos and bioinformatics analysis. (2) Because significant alterations of m5C (5-methylcytidine) in sperm tsRNAs from HFD males have been found, we will determine whether the m5C cytosine RNA methyltransferase, DNMT2, is essential for sperm tsRNAs to transmit acquired metabolic disorder to offspring, by utilizing HFD model in Dnmt2-/- and Dnmt2+/+ male mice, and injecting their sperm tsRNAs into normal zygote followed by examining the metabolic phenotype of F1 offspring. (3) Moreover, in the Dnmt2-/- versus Dnmt2+/+ HFD model, we will examine the changes of RNA expression profiles by RNA-seq, and the RNA modification profiles in sperm tsRNAs by a high-throughput approach (based on Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, LC-MS/MS) to quantify multiple RNA modifications, which not only will detect the changes of m5C, but also discover novel RNA modification changes in the presence or absence of DNMT2. Data from the proposed study will provide insights into the mechanism by which sperm tsRNAs mediate intergenerational inheritance of acquired metabolic disorders and facilitate our understanding of the etiology of human diseases originated from diet-based transgenerational effect."

"9407582","Project Summary  Myocardial infarction (MI) occurs in ~900,000 Americans annually accounting for a mortality of 7-18%. While percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is invariably successful in restoring epicardial patency, significant microvascular obstruction (MVO) resulting in the ?no-reflow phenomenon? (NRF) occurs frequently which significantly impacts mortality and the development of CHF. Current devices are only partially effective in mitigating MVO and NRF following PCI for MI.  Adenosine attenuates many of the mechanisms responsible for MVO and NRF. Seminal studies in our laboratory demonstrated that intravenous adenosine resulted in striking vascular and myocardial protection and this was subsequently confirmed in large clinical trials. Adenosine?s full potential is compromised due to its ultra-short half-life. Since the guidewire is the first PCI device deployed into the coronary vascular bed, we developed a simple, two-step procedure to make a pentameric form of adenosine (PA) that can be coated onto guidewires (Adenowire) and allows for continuous and sustained elution of adenosine into the coronary circulation during PCI. We validated the structure of PA with NMR, its stability by calorimetry and confirmed its safety with biocompatibility tests. We also demonstrated that PA released adenosine in vitro over 60 mins. Porcine studies demonstrated that pharmacologically active amounts of adenosine are released as verified by a significant and sustained increase in coronary blood flow following wire insertion. Since our initial submission of this grant proposal we have developed strong relationships with industry leading guidewire and coating companies resulting in the production of a viable commercial product.  The goal of this Phase II application is to advance this novel technology to the clinical arena. We will utilize a LDLR knockout swine model which manifests hypercholesterolemia and human-like atherosclerotic lesions. Two important mechanisms of MVO will be tested: 1) efficacy of Adenowire to reverse potent smooth muscle vasoconstrictors; and 2) effect of Adenowire to ameliorate cellular obstruction by endothelial cells and formed elements thereby attenuating NRF following regional ischemia and reperfusion.  The data obtained from these studies will be invaluable in advancing this highly novel guidewire device to clinical trials. The concept is transformative and has a high likelihood of success since it will deliver high concentrations of adenosine directly at the target site throughout the PCI procedure. If clinical trials confirm that Adenowire is effective in preventing MVO and NRF it would represent a major advance in treatment of MI patients. This would have important societal and economic benefits for MI patients treated with PCI in the US each year."
"9335247","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Pulmonary hypertension (PH), a progressive disorder causing significant morbidity and mortality, is associated with a variety of diseases commonly afflicting veteran patients. While new PH therapies have improved PH morbidity, the costs of these therapies and the residual PH-associated mortality remain unacceptably high. These observations indicate that new insights into PH pathogenesis and the identification of new therapeutic targets in this disorder are urgently needed. Evolving evidence indicates that activation of the ligand-activated nuclear hormone transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR), provides a new potential therapeutic target in PH management. Loss of PPAR expression or function is associated with PH in experimental animal and human studies. In contrast, stimulating PPAR attenuated PH in several experimental animal models. The mechanisms by which PPAR exerts its effects in PH remain to be defined and constitute the focus of this proposal. PH is characterized by enhanced proliferation of pulmonary vascular wall cells. Published observations from the mentor's lab demonstrated that PPAR activation attenuates hypoxia-induced alterations in the antiproliferative mediator, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), whose reduced expression may participate in PH pathogenesis. To further examine the mechanisms by which PPAR regulates this antiproliferative mediator, this proposal will focus on the role of microRNAs (miRNA) in PH. miRNAs are small, non-coding (20-22 nucleotide) RNAs that contribute to fine tuning of transcriptional control. Based on preliminary data and in silico analysis, the PI hypothesizes that hypoxic increases in miRNA-21 induce PH and the proliferation of pulmonary vascular wall cells and that PPAR activation attenuates hypoxia-induced alterations in miRNA-21 expression to reduce PH. To explore this hypothesis, the following specific aims will examine the role of miRNAs in hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular wall cell proliferation in vitro and in PH pathogenesis in vivo and determine the ability of PPAR ligands to attenuate PH by modulating miRNA expression. Aim 1 will examine the role of miRNA-21 in proliferative signaling in hypoxia-exposed pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and in PH in vivo. Following exposure to hypoxic conditions that stimulate human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (HPASMC) proliferation, qRT-PCR will be employed to determine miRNA-21 levels. The role of miRNA-21 in HPASMC proliferation will be confirmed with miRNA knockdown or overexpression approaches coupled with functional assays of hypoxic HPASMC proliferation. Corresponding alterations in levels of the putative miRNA- 21 target, PTEN, will be determined. These in vitro findings will be confirmed in an in vivo mouse model of hypoxia-induced PH. Collectively, these studies will determine the role of hypoxia-induced alterations in miRNA-21 expression on the regulation of pulmonary vascular wall cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Aim 2 will therapeutically target miRNA-21 with PPAR ligands to attenuate hypoxia-induced cell proliferation and PH. This aim will employ the in vitro and in vivo models used in Aim 1, except experiments will include treatments with a range of doses and durations of pharmacological PPAR ligands previously established by the mentor's lab. Selected studies will confirm PPAR -regulated miRNA expression and function in models with cell- targeted PPAR overexpression or knockout. The successful execution of these innovative studies will not only provide critical new insights into the role of miRNA regulation in PH pathogenesis and therapy but will provide the applicant broad-based training in pulmonary vascular biology that will facilitate his long-term career goals of becoming a successful physician-scientist in the VA system."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research is to study the normal development of inferotemporal cortex in infant macaques and to compare normally reared animals to animals who have had drastically altered early visual experience. In adult humans and monkeys discrete regions of the temporal lobe are specialized for processing particular object categories, such as faces, text, bodies, or places. It is unknown how this specialization emerges, and it is not known what the functional significance is of having such specialized domains. To determine and map the earliest organizing principles of inferotemporal cortex, infant monkeys will be scanned, starting at birth, then repeatedly during development, using functional MRI. Our laboratory has developed techniques for scanning alert infant monkeys that are entirely non-invasive, and not harmful to the monkeys; we have demonstrated success in scanning animals young enough that the entire cortical visual pathway is still immature. It will be of fundamental importance to discover what kind aspects of the organization are innate and which are driven by experience."
"9322198","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Clonal evolution in cancer - the selection for and emergence of increasingly malignant clones during progression and therapy, resulting in cancer metastasis and relapse - has been highlighted as an important phenomenon in the biology of leukemia and other cancers. While the role of clonal evolution during leukemia development and therapy has been a focus for a number of avenues of research, our abilities to deduce the clonal composition of individual samples have been limited by the use of bulk leukemia samples and mainly mutation data (limiting our analyses to only a fraction of all leukemias). In part, because of this caveat, deconvolution of the clonal structure from bulk sequencing data requires a model of the cancer, specifically regarding the heterozygosity of mutations in single cells, the order of acquisition of mutations, and the requirement for unique mutational events. Our work at the single cell level in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) suggests an underlying tumor heterogeneity beyond what is currently understood in the disease and precludes us from using bulk techniques to assess diversity accurately. The ability to describe and track clonal diversity over the course of therapy would allow us determine what impact diversity has on outcomes and would be a useful tool in designing therapies informed by the possibility of cancer cell evolution. This proposal seeks to expand our preliminary work in single cell genetics to create a defined approach for generating single cell and population sampling data that can refine our model of tumor heterogeneity, allowing for accurate reconstruction of clonal diversity for all types of AML. The work will address a number of challenges in the detection of clonal diversity and the possibility of evolution impacting therapy, as well as provide additional experience in bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, high?performance computing, statistics and clinical research. An excellent mentoring and collaborative team has assembled at Fred Hutch to support both the training and scientific efforts proposed including Dr. Jerald Radich (clinical research), Dr. Justin Guinney (bioinformatics), Dr. Brent Wood (clinical flow cytometry), and Dr. Ted Gooley (clinical statistics. With this team, along with the extensive resources available at Fred Hutch such as clinical access/repositories, genomics facilities, as well as high performance computing infrastructure, we are uniquely poised to move the lessons learned at the single cell level from select research settings to the clinic. The resulting approaches for describing clonal diversity and its role in therapeutic responses will be informative not only in the setting of leukemia, but for other heterogeneous cancer types as well. With a better understanding of how clonal evolution can be described and monitored, the potential to design therapeutic strategies meant to manage it provides a valuable opportunity to refine cancer treatments."
"9530004","PROJECT SUMMARY Zika virus (ZIKV), like dengue and West Nile viruses (DENV, WNV), is a flavivirus, but among these, only ZIKV regularly causes microcephaly and other birth defects, despite the fact that WNV, for example, is also highly neurotrophic. The reason for this unique pathology of ZIKV is unknown. This application proposes to study the mechanisms by which ZIKV, but not other flaviviruses, infects placental barrier cells, and validate our results in vivo in a murine pregnancy model. To access fetal tissues, a virus must be transported into the fetal circulation, which necessitates crossing of a placental barrier composed of syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts and fetal endothelial cells. Of these, only fetal endothelial cells are in direct contact with the fetal bloodstream. Our preliminary studies make four key points. First, ZIKV infects fetal endothelial cells with dramatically higher efficiency than does DENV or WNV. Second, the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is the predominant flavivirus entry cofactor present on these cells. Third, ZIKV utilizes AXL much more efficiently than does DENV or WNV. Fourth, AXL promotes ZIKV infection at attachment and post-attachment steps in the viral lifecycle. Together, these observations suggest the hypothesis that ZIKV crosses the placental barrier by infecting fetal endothelial cells in an AXL- dependent manner. Therefore, in the studies proposed here, we will define the molecular determinants of the differential use of AXL by ZIKV and WNV (Aim 1). We will also investigate the post-attachment events resulted from the AXL engagement by ZIKV (Aim 2). Finally, we will seek to demonstrate in a mouse pregnancy model that efficient use of AXL allows ZIKV to breach the placental barrier, whereas WNV is prevented from entering fetal circulation because, due to its inefficient use of AXL, it cannot infect fetal endothelial cells (Aim 3). Collectively, the results of these studies will provide important insights into the properties of ZIKV that allow it to access the fetal circulation and cause microcephaly."
"9233910","The concept of Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMPs) engaging Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRR) to initiate innate immunity has revolutionized immunology. We first reported the 22- member NLR (Nucleotide-binding and Leucine Rich repeat or NOD-like receptors) family. Most NLRs activate innate immunity, prime examples being NODI and N0D2 which recognize bacterial peptidoglycan and inflammasome NLRs that trigger caspase-1 activation leading to IL-1B and ILI8 maturation. Recently, we and several other groups documented a new NLR subfamily that reduces inflammatory and immune activation which is comprised of NLRP4, NLRP6, NLRP12, NLRC3, NLRC5 and NLRXI. These proteins largely operate by interacting with adaptors and signaling pathways in the innate immune system. In this proposal we will examine the intersection of some of these novel NLRs in regulating host response to a number of NIAID Priority RNA and DNA viruses. We will apply several cutting edge proteomic approaches to assess specific proteomes that are dependent on NLRs during infection with NIAID Priority viral pathogens. These directions are in precise concordance with the RFA which states that emphasis of research proposed in response to this FOA should be in defining novel cellular and molecular immune mechanisms involved in immunity to virus infection. Additionally, the mechanisms by which these NLRs regulate host response are broadly applicable to many viruses of relevance on the Priority Pathogens' list. It supports the overall goal of the Program by (a) investigating the role of novel PRRs as sensors or receptors of viral nucleic acid which affect subsequent innate immune responses to NIAID high priority viral pathogens in human; (b) applying cutting edge quantitative proteomic approaches for the identification of novel paradigm-shifting pathways of pathogen sensing; (c) assessing cross-talk between multiple PRRs; (d) using unique biochemical capabilities that are technically challenging to study the ligand-binding functions of PRRs, and (e) performing experiments with primary human materials. This project will involve extensive collaboration with Projects 2 and 3, as well as Cores A-C."

"9375217","PROJECT SUMMARY Men are found to contribute to infertility in >40% of the cases and are solely the cause in 30% of the cases. Semen analysis is considered critical and in many instances is the first recourse in male infertility evaluation. Seminal quality is evaluated by determining the sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. Manual microscope-based testing and computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) systems are the current standard methods to measure semen quality; however, they are labor-intensive, expensive, and laboratory-based. A majority of fertility clinics and small hospitals cannot afford the expensive CASA platforms available in the market and so use a less accurate and subjective manual method for semen analysis. CASA technique requires highly trained technicians for producing reliable and repeatable results. Also, manual test results are subjective making it difficult to compare results from different clinics. Infertility in resource-limited settings is also a global issue and being able to provide routine, point-of-care testing is needed. Global health experts have made infertility a major issue and have expressed interest in low-cost and simple point-of-care testing. Further, the majority of men don't go for follow up semen analysis tests after vasectomy procedure. Male experience in giving a semen sample at fertility clinics is poor. Men have to provide semen samples in the special rooms at a hospital, a situation in which they often experience stress, embarrassment, pessimism, and disappointment. A point-of-care diagnostic assay for home-based male infertility detection through sperm count and motility measurement is of paramount importance and can shift the paradigm in infertility diagnosis and management in both developed and developing countries. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no point-of-care assay in the market or development pipeline that can efficiently, reliably, and rapidly measure (i) sperm linear and curvilinear velocities, (ii) sperm motility and progressive motility, and (iii) sperm concentration in a real-time fashion. Here, we propose to develop the first automated, rapid, sensitive, and inexpensive smartphone-based diagnostic assay with the potential to make men fertility testing as accessible, easy, fast, and private as pregnancy tests for women. To address all of the technical challenges in developing a true point-of-care, home-based semen analysis tool, we have invented a microchip technology (International utility patent# PHC 025685) that uniquely integrates (i) hardware optics using a unique combination of two aspheric lenses for image magnification, (ii) a novel microfluidic design for easy-to-use semen sample handling based on WHO guidelines for semen analysis done by a non-expert user, and (iii) a novel image processing algorithm that enables rapid (~5 seconds), on-phone image processing utilizing videos recorded from undiluted, unwashed human semen samples."
"9307871","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career Goal: I am committed to a career as a research scientist working at the intersection of psychology and public health. My goal is to contribute to both basic social science and prevention programs that improve adolescent sexual health and reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV/AIDS. Career Development: This Pathway to Independence Award will enhance my methodological and statistical skills and provide the specific training that I need to transition from conducting research on the predictors of risky sexual behaviors that lead to HIV/STD transmission to designing and implementing effective HIV/STD prevention programs for adolescents. During the mentored training phase, my goals are to: 1) master methodological strategies for conducting school-based sexual health research; 2) gain proficiency in the advanced statistics needed to analyze multi-wave longitudinal data; 3) gain the skills necessary to design and implement an effective sexual health intervention; and 4) develop the skills, expertise, and pilot data to facilitate my successful transition from a mentored postdoctoral fellow into a fully independent research scientist. Research Project: In the U.S., youth between the ages of 15-24 years represent 25% of the sexually experienced population, yet they acquire a full 50% of all STDs. This results in over 9 million STDs and 8,300 newly diagnosed cases of HIV each year in this group, with teen girls at greater risk of infection than boys. The goal of the current project is t gain a more comprehensive understanding of the way that sexual communication, defined as the ability to discuss sexual health topics, such as condom use, HIV/STDs, and abstinence, may reduce acts of unprotected sex among teens. Then, using this updated understanding, I will incorporate sexual communication skills training into an innovative, computer-based HIV/STD prevention program for adolescent girls. The project objectives will be achieved through the following three Specific Aims: 1) examine adolescent sexual communication and condom use over time; 2) develop an interactive, computer-based intervention to increase adolescent girls' sexual communication skills; and 3) assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the sexual communication intervention in a randomized controlled trial. Mentorship: A highly accomplished, multidisciplinary team of experts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will mentor me in the initial two years of this award and provide ongoing guidance and support as I launch my independent career. This mentoring team includes two primary mentors: Dr. Mitch Prinstein (Department of Psychology) and Dr. Carol Golin (School of Public Health, Center for AIDS Research), and an outstanding scientific advisory committee: Dr. Daniel Bauer (Department of Psychology), Dr. Seth Noar (School of Journalism and Mass Communication), and Dr. Jane Brown (School of Journalism and Mass Communication). Future Directions: The skills achieved and the rich preliminary data from this proposal will directly support a future R01 application to conduct a full clinical trial of the sexual communication intervention."
"9284513","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA-Seq has revolutionized transcriptomics and is one of the most important high-throughput sequencing assays invented in recent years. The key computational problem is that of de novo assembly: the reconstruction of the transcripts and their abundances from tens to hundreds of millions of short reads. The problem is challenging due to a confluence of several factors: large number of different transcripts (tens of thousands), long repeat across transcripts due to alternative splicing, widely varying abundances across transcripts, and the presence of read errors. Existing assemblers are mostly designed based on heuristic considerations and implement ad hoc methods that lead to unreliable transcriptome reconstructions. An accurate RNA-Seq assembler would enable more accurate identification of fusions in cancer transcriptomes, better gene annotations in model and non-model organisms, and more complete analyses of the dynamics of alternative splicing driving developmental and regulatory programs. In this proposal, we offer a systematic approach to the design of RNA-Seq assemblers based on information theoretic principles. We start by determining conditions data that guarantee that there enough information to reconstruct the transcriptome, and then propose an assembly algorithm that can reconstruct with the minimal information. This algorithm optimally uses the available read information to resolve repeats and disambiguate isoforms. A key insight derived from the information theoretic approach is that widely varying abundances across transcripts, rather than a complication, can actually be exploited as signatures of different transcripts to disambiguate among them. Based on our initial ideas, we have built, evaluated and compared an initial prototype with several existing software, on both real and simulated data. The encouraging results provide evidence that our approach, which we will fully develop, implement and evaluated during the funded period, can significantly outperform existing software. Additional functionalities such as mixed short/long read assembly, genome-assisted assembly and joint processing of multiple RNA samples, will be designed and incorporated into the software as part of the proposed project."
"9250110","DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) An epidemic of addiction to prescription pain medications now causes deaths due to overdose that outnumber automobile-related deaths, rising admissions to hospitals, and disrupted lives for both the patient and family. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) report, Epidemic: Responding to America's Prescription Drug Abuse Crisis, highlights the crisis and calls for health care professional education in the proper use of opioids; required education related to opioid pain medications appears inevitable. Intended Impact: This project responds to this call by: 1) creating a continuing health professional development (CHPD) program using an On-Line Interactive Virtual Environment (OLIVE) with virtual patient scenarios, and 2) evaluating the products' ability to alter provider behavior relevant to decreasing the prescription opioid epidemic. The new product will be a part of the existing, successful OpioidRisk.com, which was developed with support from a NIDA contract, and is produced via a partnership between the Association for Medical Education on Substance Abuse (AMERSA) and Clinical Tools. We expect: Providers will enhance their clinical skills and test practice change through deliberate practice via OLIVE's simulated (i.e., computer-generated) patients. The planned program will test their skills and provide automated feedback, guidance and direction. Clinic leaders and health care organizations can implement a comprehensive CHPD program.The health professional education community will gain important data regarding the potential of novel virtual environment technology to instill new behaviors and effect practice change. Phase I demonstrates product feasibility and the acceptability of proceeding with Phase II by: 1) completing target audience needs analysis surveys and semi-structured interviews; 2) creating a training framework for OLIVE-based CHPD training on the proper use of opioids; 3) outlining assessments to be used in the Phase II evaluative study of OLIVE vs. web-based training; 4) developing a prototype OLIVE training experience; and, 5) demonstrating acceptability and feasibility and recruiting clinic locations for the Phase II study. Phase II completes the program based on content already found in our previously developed product's (OpiodRisk.com) interactive case-based instruction, clinical questions, resources and implementation guides. After finalizing clinic participation for the summative study, the project evaluates the CHPD program using a randomized, active control design of OLIVE-based training vs. OpioidRisk.com that compares change in competency, performance, clinical, and communication skills and improved treatment behavior related to opioid prescribing and pain patient assessment for addiction risk."
"9334184","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Clinical and translational research in acute kidney injury (AKI) requires well designed prospective studies as well as access to well characterized patients with longitudinal follow up coupled with biological samples enabling investigators to probe the underlying mechanisms and pathways contributing to outcomes. The specific aims of the Resource for Clinical Studies of AKI (Core A) are to 1) provide core resources to support the design and conduct of clinical research In AKI, 2) provide a genomics resource to perform systematic genomic analyses and allow correlation with clinical phenotypic information, and 3) provide a biological sample repository linked to the clinical and genomics database for the characterization of patients for our investigator base. This core will specifically provide investigators access to patients with AKI through an established international network of collaborating investigators who are contributing to an ongoing registry of AKI in the ICU setting currently with over 1000 patients, access to biological samples including DNA from patients and healthy controls and protocols and tools for quantitative assessment of changes in kidney function. Since its inception the Core has been successful in supporting investigators for clinical and translational research. The Core has established a robust data management system and database of patients with AKI that Is flexible In accommodating the research objectives of individual investigators and collaborating centers; currently supporting 5 large multicenter projects including the AKI registry and an international prospective study for the genomics of drug-induced kidney injury. The genomics resource has facilitated the investigation of genetic determinants (both risk and outcome) of AKI, and identified novel genomic predictors of the longitudinal course in AKI. Over 14,000 biomarker assays incorporating more than 20 analytes have been performed to support both pediatric and adult AKI research. A biological sample repository has been established and has >2000 sequential samples from well-characterized patients with and without AKI. The Core has supported 143 projects for 52 investigators (including 4 pilot recipients and 45 non-core personnel), resulting in 57 publications. These rich resources will continue to enable interdisciplinary clinical investigation in AKI to advance our understanding of the natural history, pathophysiology and treatment of human AKI. Core A in conjunction with existing resources at UAB and UCSD and other cores within the O'Brien center will accelerate the translation of new investigative insights towards improving outcomes for patients with AKI."
"9411326","Abstract  Persistent HIV infection of long lived resting memory CD4+ T-cells, unresponsive to current anti- retroviral therapy (ART) and unaffected by immune surveillance remains a formidable barrier to efforts to achieve HIV eradication. The latent state of the virus is established within days of infection, and decays very slowly with a half-life of 40-44 months, necessitating life-long antiviral therapy to suppress recrudescence of infection. Modalities to disrupt persistent HIV infection have become a priority in the quest to cure HIV infection. Such an undertaking requires broad knowledge of the nature of the reservoir in all populations of people. However, our knowledge of the reservoir in women is greatly limited as this group is traditionally under- represented in HIV cure related studies. Several characteristics associated with HIV infection in women, such as low viremia during early infection and preserved CD4 T cell count could impact the HIV reservoir. Factors specific to women, including differences in innate and adaptive immunity, genetics and cyclical hormonal changes may affect HIV pathogenesis, immune function, and thereby ultimately affect the character of the latent reservoir, and influence therapeutic approaches to clear persistent infection. In this project, we seek to a) characterize the frequency of infection of replication competent latent HIV in subpopulations of resting CD4 T- cells in both the periphery and anatomical tissues in women; b) determine the stability of the HIV reservoir in subpopulations of resting T-cells over time; c) investigate potential sex hormone-influenced differences in responsiveness to agents that disrupt HIV latency; d) investigate the ability of effector cells to clear reactivated infection in the presence of physiological levels of sex hormones; and e) examine the role of the Type I interferon, IFN-? in modulating establishment of the latent reservoir in women. Knowledge gained from this project will advance the field towards developing successful therapeutics for HIV eradication in all populations of people."
"9246046","Abstract  In parts of Africa, there is a heavy burden of parasitic diseases, including intestinal worms of several genera,  collectively called helminths, and malaria. Some recent studies have implicated the worms in particular, in  biasing the immune response towards a Th2 phenotype resulting in alteration of T cell and B cell responses. In  fact recent work in mice has shown that pre-existing infection with Schistosoma mansoni down-regulates anti-  HepB antibody levels and reduces response to vaccine, and multiple reports have indicated that helminthic  infections may be a contributing cause for weak responsiveness to the vaccines. However, very little  information is available on the influence of parasites in general or helminth in particular on host  immune response to vaccines in humans. Thus an objective and comprehensive survey of the impact  of parasitic infection on vaccine induced immunity may point to potential interventional immunologic  targets that may target a critical unmet need, enabling the development of vaccines for the developing  world. Our major hypothesis is that single or multiple parasites will modify the differentiation and  priming of T cells following HepB vaccination leading to diminished antigen-specific memory and  effector T cell responses. We will perform experiments in aim 1 to assess the phenotype and function of  antigen-specific T cells. In aim 2 we will determine whether infection with single or multiple parasites will affect  the priming of CD4+ T cells and aim 3 we will determine whether infection with helminth will influence CD4+ T  cell differentiation programs and programing of follicular helper T cells (Tfh) cells. The ultimate objective is to  develop digital and molecular signatures of immune response to HepB vaccine in the context of co-infection  with endemic parasitic infections including Schistosoma, soil-transmitted helminths and malaria."

"9162454","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this proposal is to provide the applicant with additional mentored research experience and critical career development training. The additional experimental training proposed in this plan, wholly funded by NHBLI Division of Intramural Research, will provide him with the ability to perform cutting-edge cell biology research, while the career development training and instruction from mentors and advisors will provide him with the tools necessary to excel as an independent investigator. The candidate is an expert in non-muscle myosin 2, the major force-producing mechano-enzyme in non- muscle cells. Through his graduate and postdoctoral work, he has published 5 first-author, 5 middle-author and 1 review on myosin 2. By proposing to investigate the key kinases that regulate myosin 2, for which we are clearly lacking critical cellular information, the candidate will build upon his current expertise while establishing projects that unmistakably separate him from the work of his Ph.D. and postdoctoral advisors. This proposal seeks to investigate how these kinases are simultaneously regulating myosin 2 at steady-state (Aim 1) and during two dynamic morphology-altering processes: epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Aim 2) and nuclear translocation (squeezing) during cell invasion (Aim 3). As both myosin 2 and the kinases that regulate myosin 2 are known to be involved in a wide-array of pathologies (e.g. cancer, diabetes, hypertension), and EMT and cell invasion are critical components of cancer cell metastasis, this research has clear clinical relevance. The additional technical training in this grant will enable the candidate to establish a lab performing state-of- the-art cell biology research. This includes training in super-resolution imaging with Dr. Eric Betzig (JRC), cell invasion using microfluidics with Dr. Jan Lammerding (Cornell), surface micropatterning with Dr. Ken Yamada (NIDCR/NIH), and in vitro characterization of myosin phosphorylation with Dr. James Sellers (NHLBI/NIH). In addition to the experimental training, the advisory committee assembled includes leading intramural and extramural scientists that were selected for their expertise in placing candidates in faculty positions, career development familiarity, relevant research expertise, and experience obtaining extramural funding. Furthermore, through the Office of Intramural Training at NIH, the training plan includes mechanisms to prepare the candidate for obtaining a position and excelling as an independent researcher. This includes counseling, coursework, workshops, and seminars that will provide mock interviews, practice job and chalk talks, grant writing experience, and effective teaching, mentoring, and lab management skills. Collectively, this tailored proposal will enable the candidate to build on his current expertise with new research and career skills to propel him to a successful career as an independent investigator."
"9330561","Microbial Pathogenesis and Host Response  September 12 - 16, 2017 The eleventh international conference on Microbial Pathogenesis and Host Response will focus on interdisciplinary approaches to study infectious disease, integrating the disciplines of molecular microbiology, eukaryotic cell biology, immunology, and genomics. Microbial diseases have once again taken an important central role in health care worldwide, due to the emergence of new pathogens and the re-ascent of common pathogens and extensive drug resistance. Outside of human health, devastating pandemics are destabilizing ecosystems, with brown bats and amphibians currently under extreme threat. The meeting will provide an in depth focus on the approaches that are being used to elucidate the mechanisms of bacterial and fungal pathogenesis, and promote the application of these concepts to novel strategies for the control and intervention of infectious diseases. Oral and poster sessions will focus on major themes of microbial pathogenesis and the host response, including: genetic approaches to pathogenesis; regulation of commensalism/pathogenesis, host cell/pathogen interactions, and host immunity. The sessions will integrate studies on bacterial and fungal pathogens. The oral sessions will begin with 2-3 invited talks by established leaders in the field, followed by several shorter talks chosen from submitted abstracts. Broad themes for individual sessions include: 1) Evolution at the host/pathogen interface; 2) Visualizing host-pathogen interactions; 3) Host responses and defense; 4) Nutrition matters - metabolism and pathogenesis; 5) Surfaces and pathogenesis; and 6) Pathogens and host behavior. The inclusion of two poster sessions as well as the allotment of ample time for questions following each talk will encourage extensive discussion between the participants. The meeting will be small enough (300 - 400 scientists) to facilitate these interactions, yet large enough to allow for oral presentations not only from established investigators, but also from younger investigators and those with novel perspectives. The integration of a wide variety of aspects of bacterial and fungal pathogenesis with the host response to pathogens should promote new interdisciplinary interactions that are seldom achieved at other meetings on microbial pathogenesis that are either more narrowly focused or so diverse that the topics are difficult to integrate; the resulting interdisciplinary interactions will yield conceptual and experimental approaches that might not otherwise be possible."
"9326288","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study is designed to characterize the mechanism that allows flavonoids to regulate the translation of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) - an important molecular target for the treatment or prevention of chronic diseases of the liver. Oxidative stress is a process involved in the genesis and perpetuation of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most prevalent liver disease affecting up to 30% of the American population. Nrf2 is the master regulator of the cell's owns defense system against oxidative conditions, and an extensive body of research indicates that increasing the activity of Nrf2 with phytochemicals could be a viable strategy to ameliorate the progression of NAFLD. We recently discovered a novel mechanism regulating the translation of Nrf2 under physiological conditions in human cells. The mechanism, which is not fully understood, is dependent on a portion of the mRNA sequence located in the open reading frame, and its inhibitory effect is alleviated if the sequence is mutated with synonym codon substitutions. More importantly, this portion of the sequence is able to prevent the translation of the reporter gene Firefly Luciferase. Subsequently, we were able to use this luciferase construct as a reporter to validate the hypothesis that some known natural antioxidants that increase the Nrf2 activity might work by promoting its translation. We identified the flavonoid Apigenin as a potent inducer of the translation of Nrf2 and we confirmed this via multiple techniques. We also found a similar property for other flavonoids such as Quercetin and Luteolin. The challenge now is to identify the protein targets that allow these flavonoids to activate the translation of Nrf2 and also see if other flavonoids present in the human diet share this property. To execute this, we propose performing RNA-protein interaction studies based on cutting edge proteomics techniques and also using the Luciferase reporter to screen a library of 500 flavonoids."
"9398434","This proposed R13 application covers the 14th meeting in a long standing series of the International Workshop on Opportunistic Protists (i.e. IWOP-14). These meeting are devoted to protists that cause serious problems in patients with defective immune systems, such as those receiving immunosuppressive therapies or with immune system debilitating diseases, such as AIDS. Many of these poorly understood pathogens were initially recognized due to their increased frequency in opportunistic settings, such as in HIV/AIDS and transplantation; however, it is now appreciated that these are also pathogens of immune competent hosts. Several of these organisms, due to their transmission by food and water, are also biodefense category B pathogens and environmental protection agency (EPA) pathogens of interest. The IWOP meeting was initiated in 1988 to serve the small, but growing international scientific community interested in working with the unusual, non-cultivatable organism Pneumocystis. At the time, Pneumocystis was relatively unknown and was ignored by many in the microbiological community. There was a need for a small meeting where scientists could exchange new techniques and experiences gained from working with these fastidious organisms. A basic tenet of the IWOP Workshops is a free exchange of information facilitated by open admission to the meeting. It has and is focused on students, trainees, young investigators and under-represented scientists. The 2nd through 11th IWOP meetings grew to include other OP-based community groups that experienced many of the research challenges facing the Pneumocystis community. The IWOP meetings now include research presentations on Cryptosporidia; Microsporidia; Toxoplasma gondii; and free-living amebae that are pathogenic. In recent years, IWOP has also begun serving as a forum for researchers of other eukaryotic microbial parasites that present pathologies in immune deficient individuals distinct from that observed in immune competent patients. Today, the IWOP meetings are regarded as critical meetings for most researchers investigating the basic science of Pneumocystis, Cryptosporidia, and Microsporidia. It is the meeting at which community based projects (e.g. genome sequencing, animal models, culture techniques, etc) and consensus papers (i.e. taxonomic status, research priorities, nomenclature standards) have been developed. Because many of these organisms are not well represented in larger fungal or parasitology meetings, research progress would clearly be severely hampered if this singular forum was no longer held. In comparison to other larger meetings these Workshops provide current updates that have not yet reached the literature."
"9313304","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):We recently completed the BMI2 study, which tested the efficacy of two increasingly intensive interventions among overweight/obese youth ages 2-8 recruited from 39 practices in the American Academy of Pediatrics PROS network (Pediatric Research in Office Settings). Group 1 (Usual Care) was compared with treatment Groups 2 and 3 on BMI percentile at 2-year follow up. Group 2 comprised trained primary care practitioners (PCPs) who delivered 4 motivational interviewing (MI) sessions and Group 3, in addition to the 4 PCP MI sessions, had 6 MI sessions delivered by trained Registered Dietitians (RDs) linked with each practice. At two- year follow-up, the adjusted BMI percentile was 90.3, 88.1, and 87.1 for Usual Care, PCP only, and PCP + RD groups, respectively. The PCP + RD group mean was significantly lower than the UC group. A next logical step in our research is to test the populatio effect of the BMI intervention among all patients, when the intervention is delivered under more real world conditions. The proposed study will test the effectiveness of an enhanced version of the BMI2 intervention disseminated through 18 PROS practices (not participating in the BMI2 study). The primary aim will be to determine the impact of the intervention (change in BMI percentile) on the entire population of overweight and obese youth ages 3-10 in these 18 sites, based on shared Electronic Health Record data. We will pair-match and randomize all clinics to the either Usual Care or BMI2. For clinics assigned to BMI2, all PCPs will be trained in MI and the BMI2 intervention. To bring the intervention to scale, some key changes will be made to the intervention. First, despite the promising effects of BMI2, only 27% (37/141) of Group 3 participants were exposed to >=75% of the planned MI dose. This was due primarily to low completion of the RD counseling, only 2.7 out of 6 sessions were delivered. We will increase dose in several ways. First, we will add two-way tailored text messaging. Parents will receive 1-2 SMS per week, tailored to their family behaviors. In addition they will receive reminders for upcoming MI calls and reminders to schedule their child's assessments. We will implement the RD counseling through a centralized disease management system at our Center for Health Communications (CHCR). By centralizing the RD counseling at the U of M, we will be able to substantially increase the dose and quality of the RD intervention, and therefore increase intervention impact. Reach will be maximized by using trained office managers to approach all eligible families (child >85th percentile). The primary outcome is change in BMI z-score at two year followup. Secondary Hypothesis will explore BMI change among the subsample of youth exposed to the intervention. Exploratory Aims include quantifying revenue generated from obesity-related counseling at these clinics and compare revenue between the BMI2 and usual care clinics. The RE-AIM framework will guide analysis of reach, dissemination, and implementation in both the intervention and UC groups."
"9318507","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Periodontal disease represents a group of inflammatory diseases, which lead to the destruction of the gingiva and the supporting structures of the teeth. The loss of tissue results from an imbalance of the host immune response induced by the colonization of specific sub-gingival bacteria. This microflora is also considered the source for extra-oral diseases. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a Gram-negative periodontal pathogen associated with both the chronic and localized aggressive forms of the disease. Multiple disseminated extra-oral diseases are attributed to this pathogen including infective endocarditis and the potentiation of cardiovascular disease. However, the tropism used by A. actinomycetemcomitans to colonize the oral cavity or infiltrate and disseminate to distant tissues has remained elusive. These tissues share common extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins including collagen. Our group has identified a novel protein, extracellular matrix protein adhesin A (EmaA), which is critical for the interaction of the bacterium with collagens and is a proven virulence determinant for the initiation of infective endocarditis. In summary, A. actinomycetemcomitans expresses a cell surface adhesin that binds collagen, the most abundant ECM protein, for establishing infectious foci. Therefore, we posit that ECM colonization acts as a reservoir for re-infection of the gingival sulcus and dissemination to extra oral sites.  The EmaA adhesin is composed of three identical monomers unique to A. actinomycetemcomitans that intercalate in the outer membrane to assemble unique antenna-like surface appendages essential for collagen binding. However, the protein size and sequence of the monomers is serotype specific. Furthermore, EmaA is posttranslationally modified with O-polysaccharide (O-PS) sugars that are crucial for binding to collagen. Interestingly, this EmaA modification shares the same enzymes required for O-PS biosynthesis. The specific role of the glycan moieties in the interaction with collagen remains undefined. The goal of this application is to elucidate the mechanism(s) utilized by this pathogen for colonizing the oral cavity and disseminating to other tissues. To achieve this goal we propose the following specific aims: 1) determine the localization and composition of the glycan moiety of EmaA from serotype b bacteria; 2) determine the role of EmaA genotype and bacterial serotype in collagen binding; and 3) biochemical and biophysical determination of the EmaA/collagen interaction. Defining the nature of the active binding moiety of EmaA will aid in understanding the role of this protein in the pathogenesis of A. actinomycetemcomitans. The new insights gained from this study into the molecular mechanism of this adhesin will lead to the development of molecules to disrupt and/or diminish tissue colonization by this pathogen."
"9526157","This proposal responds to RFA?DC-16-002, in which the NIDCD is seeking to support the development of acoustic signal processing tools that have the potential to accelerate research studies and to facilitate the translation of novel algorithms for hearing aids. Approximately 15% of American adults report some degree of hearing trouble, and 12.7% of Americans aged 12 and over experience bilateral hearing loss (HL). The 2008 hearing aid industry survey MarkeTrack VIII reports that less than 1 in 10 people with mild hearing loss uses amplification, while only 4 in 10 people with moderate-to-severe hearing loss use amplification, leaving still a large swath of the hearing impaired population without rehabilitation. While the reasons for poor hearing aid adoption are diverse and complex, out-of-pocket costs rank high as an issue to be addressed. And in fact, the Senate Report Language for FY2013 appropriations ?strongly urges NIDCD to support research grants that could lead to less expensive hearing aids, so such aids could become accessible and affordable to more people. As the lead federal agency promoting the nation?s hearing healthcare, NIDCD is actively seeking to address accessibility from the public health perspective. Aside from cost, one of the primary barriers to hearing aid adoption remains sound quality, and the sense that hearing aids are still not quite able to meet all the needs of hearing impaired consumers. Creare and its collaborators at Boys Town National Research Hospital (BTNRH) plan to develop and disseminate an open-source audio processing platform to spur innovation in Hearing Aid (HA) research. The result of this effort will be a user-friendly, portable, upgradable and wearable ?master hearing aid? (MHA) that will allow collaborative development and the open exchange of new processing algorithms within the broader hearing research community, including both academia and industry. The hardware used in the MHA has an open, published design architecture, using components currently available on the electronics market. We envision three levels of users: (1) ?expert? users implement and test new algorithms directly in firmware through an interface that gives them access to the basic features of the hardware (audio input and output, power management, housekeeping, etc.); (2) ?developers? users interact at the software application programming interface (API) level to modify parameters of the algorithms already implemented in firmware and evaluate their performance in a variety of conditions; and (3) ?professional? users have access to ?pre-programmed? algorithms with some degree of parameter control through a simple user interface, to test the relative benefits of amplification variants available with the wearable master hearing aid."
"9367396","ABSTRACT Compromised placental function is highly associated with abnormal fetal development, especially of the brain. Abnormal brain development or fetal brain injury leads to life-long neurological impairments, including cerebral palsy, seizures and mental disabilities. Placental dysfunction may place many thousands of fetuses at risk of life-long impairments each year. The vast majority of research connecting placental compromise to fetal brain injury has focused on gas exchange or nutritional programming, neglecting the placenta's essential neuroendocrine role. Using new molecular models, we are testing our overall hypothesis that key placental hormones contribute to normal brain development and that their loss contributes to injury. One such critical placental hormone is allopregnanolone (ALLO), the most potent GABAergic neurosteroid derived from progesterone. In both rodent and human gestation, ALLO is made predominantly by the placenta. Our preliminary experiments have shown that pharmacological ALLO reduction during gestation disrupts cortico-hippocampal circuit maturation and alters GABAergic subunit expression. Additionally, endogenous and exogenous ALLO provides neuroprotection in multiple preclinical injury models. To use ALLO as a perinatal therapeutic agent, however, it is critical to understand the specific source, physiological levels and actions of ALLO in gestation. Until now, these investigations have been limited by lack of tools designed to precisely alter and measure placental neurosteroids, barriers we have overcome through generation of new mouse models and use of advanced mass spectroscopy. We have generated mouse models in which ALLO production is suppressed only in placenta. These models allow direct placental steroid manipulation for the first time. We have shown that suppression of placental ALLO production results in a specific reduction of proliferating intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) in the cortical subventricular zone during gestation and that there are long-lasting functional neurological alterations after placental ALLO is suppressed. Using our new floxed mouse model (AKR1c14fl/fl) in which the gene for 3?HSD can be deleted in a tissue-specific manner, we will determine the extent to which placental ALLO is critical to: 1) corticogenesis; 2) long-term behavior and circuit function; and 3) injury that may be amenable to perinatal treatment. Elucidation of the mechanisms by which placental hormones, including ALLO, shape normal and abnormal cortical development would fundamentally change our understanding of developmental brain disorders and the placenta's role in shaping long-term neurological outcomes. These experiments also provide the possibility to prevent or ameliorate developmental brain injury through novel therapies based on placental hormones."
"9320803","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fibrosis is a common denominator and an important determinant of outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Extracellular matrix deposition is a specific and potentially useful biomarker to identify scarred kidneys. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) is a powerful noninvasive technique based on molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is capable of detecting excessive collagen deposition. Therefore, MTI could be invaluable to assess individual kidneys, yet its potential to detect renal fibrosis has no been fully explored.  Renal vascular disease (RVD), which is becoming increasingly common in the aging population of the Western world, may induce kidney ischemia and fibrosis. As a result of permanent injury, revascularization of the stenotic renal artery by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) often fails to restore kidney function and arrest progression of CKD. We have shown that failure to restore renal function after PTRA in RVD is directly linked with the extent of intra-renal injury. Alas, specific tools to detect renal fibrosis and adequately predct renal outcomes in RVD are yet to be identified and remain in dire need.  We have characterized novel experimental models of RVD that closely mimic human pathophysiology and allow translational studies relevant to clinical medicine. We have also developed and refined unique imaging techniques ideally suited for probing renal adaptive processes. These tools now provide an opportunity to assess renal function and structure associated with development of fibrosis and outcomes in RVD. The working hypothesis underlying this proposal is that MTI can detect in the post-stenotic murine and swine kidneys development of fibrosis, which correlates with subsequent kidney recovery capacity. To test this hypothesis, we will study development and progression of stenotic kidney fibrosis, dysfunction, and hypoxia using cutting-edge noninvasive imaging. Furthermore, the ability of MTI-derived indices of collagen deposition to predict renal recovery will be tested in RVD pigs undergoing PTRA and stenting. Three specific aims will be pursued: Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that MTI can detect development of kidney fibrosis in RAS mice using high-field MRI. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that MTI can detect development of renal fibrosis using a clinical MRI in RVD pigs. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that MTI would predict renal recovery potential in response to PTRA. Noninvasive assessment of extracellular matrix deposition using MTI is a promising, cutting edge technique, which will likely contribute significantly towards management of kidney disease. The proposed studies may have broad ramifications and establish this novel, clinically feasible diagnostic strategy for RVD and CKD."
"9256988","Project Summary Research conducted within the Duke University?s Superfund Research Center (DUSRC) focuses on a central research question: How does early life exposure to hazardous substances elicit developmental toxicity, and what are the later-life consequences? As such the theme of our center is ?Developmental Exposures: Mechanisms, Consequences and Remediation?, and we remain committed to investigating the vulnerability of the developing organism to hazardous chemical exposures. Within the DUSRC we emphasize research on both ATSDR priority chemicals (e.g. PAHs, metals, organophosphate chemicals) and emerging chemicals of concern (e.g. halogenated flame retardants) that are known to, or have potential to, adversely effect development. Mechanisms of action that are central to the mission and research conducted within the DUSRC include mechanisms underlying molecular and physiological effects from developmental exposures, mechanisms underlying ameliorations of and adaptations to these effects, and mechanisms and approaches to engineering solutions for the ultimate removal of these chemicals from the environment. A unifying theme across the DUSRC projects is effects on neurobehavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes from these exposures. DUSRC researchers are conducting research using in vitro (e.g. cell culture) and in vivo (e.g. zebrafish, rats) models to determine effects of these hazardous chemicals on neurodevelopmental across projects, but several individual projects are also exploring effects on skeletal and fat development, cardiovascular development and bioenergetics. Of key interest is the ability of some contaminants to converge on similar phenotypes through multiple mechanisms of action. With the heightened interest in developing Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) within regulatory agencies, the DUSRC is well poised to support these endeavors. Our interdisciplinary team of biomedical/environmental scientists and engineers provide the DUSRC with a unique opportunity to address and examine ?holistic? consequences of developmental exposures. This integration is central to evaluating the true risk from exposure to hazardous substances. The DUSRC directly addresses the program mandates by investigating health effects and risks and remediation of hazardous substances in an interdisciplinary fashion. In addition to responding to SRP mandates, the DUSRC?s research, research translation, and community engagement activities are also highly relevant to numerous stakeholders, including the Environmental Protection Agency."
"9348751","Sexual contact is a major mode of HIV-1 transmission, with an increasing number of transmissions occurring via heterosexual contact from males to females. Consequently, about 16 million women worldwide are infected with HIV-1. Heterosexual transmission includes both anal and vaginal sex; the estimated risk of infection from vaginal sex with an HIV-1 positive male ranges from 0.08% to 0.30% per sexual act (not including commercial sex workers). This is in contrast with the pooled risk estimate for anal intercourse, which at 1.7% is at least 5?6 times higher than the risk estimate for vaginal sex. These statistics indicate that HIV-1 transmission during vaginal sex faces unique vaginal defenses that prevent the transmission and/or early steps of HIV-1 infection. We have identified vaginal fluid exosomes (VFE) and shown that VFE can significantly reduce HIV-1 transmission in vitro. We hypothesize that VFE can constitute a barrier to HIV-1 transmission during heterosexual contact. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: (1) Analyze VFE and determine their composition and their source; (3) Identify the step(s) of the HIV-1 life cycle that are targeted by VFE; and (3) Determine how VFE block HIV-1 transmission.  Specific points of innovation include (1) identification of female-produced defenses against HIV-1 infection, (2) characterization of the newly discovered VFE, and (3) identification of the mechanism by which VFE inhibit HIV-1 transmission. Our research environment enables close collaboration between clinical and basic researchers, which is crucial for the successful outcome of this project."
"9319756","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genes and mutations causing at least 25% of cases of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) remain unknown. This is a major barrier to diagnosis and treatment. The aims of this application are to identify the remaining adRP genes and to use this information to impact clinical care for patients and families. This is a Program Goal of the NEI. AdRP and related diseases affect more than 30,000 Americans and are a leading cause of loss of vision in young adults. Symptoms include progressive retinal degeneration and characteristic retinal abnormalities leading to legal or complete blindness. Although these are single-gene disorders in individuals, as a group of diseases they are highly heterogeneous with many genes, mutations and clinical phenotypes. In prior research we enrolled and tested more than 800 adRP families and identified six new adRP genes. The enrolled families include a well-defined AdRP Cohort of 266 families with extensive sequencing, linkage and molecular testing. Specific Aim 1. We have identified mutations in 76% of Cohort families, leaving 62 without mutations in known genes. The first Aim is to find the disease-causing gene and mutation in these families. This will identify new adRP genes. Specific Aim 2. Among the adRP families not in the Cohort, conventional testing has failed to detect the mutation in over 300. The second Aim is to apply advanced DNA testing methods to these families. This will identify novel mutations and establish a replication sample for new genes detected in Aim 1. This will also contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between mutations and clinical outcome (genotype/phenotype). Specific Aim 3. During the project we will continue to enroll new adRP families through our clinical collaborators, roughly 75 per year. Although the majority of these families will have known mutations, a fraction will have novel genes. The third aim is to add the families with potential novel genes to the families in Aims 1 and 2. Methods for Specific Aims include retinal-capture next-generation sequencing (NGS), Sanger confirmation of mutations in our CLIA-certified DNA Diagnostic Laboratory, whole-genome and fine-structure linkage mapping, whole-exome and whole-genome NGS, and extensive bioinformatic analysis. The most difficult problem in medical genetics today is determining which of the many potentially-pathogenic variants in each of us is actually pathogenic in a patient. We will address this problem with segregation analysis, replication in other patients, data sharing with collaborating laboratories, development of an extensive retinal-gene variant database, and biochemical assays. For patients, the immediate impact of this project is improved diagnosis and counselling for retinitis pigmentosa. Further, knowing the underlying cause of disease, the genotype, is an essential requirement for enrolling in most clinical trials. More broadly, identification of novel genes and mutations will contribute to a beter understanding of pathogenesis and may reveal new targets for treatment."
"9329087","Project Summary This proposal aims to determine mechanisms by which the neuroprotective hormone 17?-estradiol (E2) improves and maintains hippocampal synaptic signaling during presymtomatic Alzheimer?s disease (AD) pathology using the novel comprehensive TgF344-AD rat model. The earliest and most insidious stages of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) are characterized by altered brain function at the level of the synapse. Patholgoy begins in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and spreads via functionally connected synapse to the hippocampus. Both brain regions are critical to learning and memory. As soluble toxic species of amyloid beta oligomers and hyper-phosphorylated tau rise, EC-to- hippocampal synaptic weakening results and occurs decades prior to clinical presentation of cognitive symptoms. Ovarian hormones play a delicate role in modulating synaptic circuits and cognitive function. Rapid loss of ovarian hormones as a natural part aging in women is now recognized as a risk factor for the development of AD. 17?-estradiol (E2) and its replacement post-menopause benefits neuron function, amyloid and tau pathology, and cognition, yet how E2 improves or maintains synaptic processes underlying cognitive function throughout early asymptomatic and symptomatic disease progression are unknown. Our lab has established that E2-enhanced hippocampal synaptic strength and cognitive performance, in non- diseased rodents, is due to its ability to increase synaptic current mediated by glutamate receptor subunit epsilon- 2 (GluN2B) ?containing N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Current evidence in presymptomatic transgenic rodent models show early hippocampal synaptic deficits result from loss of beneficial synaptic GluN2B-NMDARs transmission, while extrasynaptically located GluN2B-NMDARs are pathologically stimulated due to excessive extracellular glutamate. The current proposal will test the hypothesis that E2 is beneficial to synaptic function in early AD by enhancing synaptic GluN2B-NMDAR current and synaptic strength in the dentate gyrus, the primary target region of synaptic projections from EC. Data obtained in this proposal will bolster previous evidence of E2?s neuroprotective actions against Alzheimer?s disease pathology as well as establish novel therapeutic avenues."
"9381834","Skeletal muscle exemplifies structure-function relationships in biology. The organization of sarcomeres follow hierarchical ordering to form long contractile cells, bundled in extra-cellular matrix, to form larger fascicles and ultimately whole muscles. The tight relationship between structure and function allows muscle performance (and disease) to be inferred from its microstructure. For example, fiber area is directly related to isometric force production in muscle. With injury, microstructural changes in muscle fiber area (size), fibrosis (accumulation of extracellular matrix), membrane damage (permeability), and inflammation (edema) are observed, and impair muscle function. Muscle biopsy, followed by microscopic examination of the tissue (histology), is the gold standard to diagnose and monitor muscle health and disease. This tool is invasive, requiring a large bore needle and tissue removal under sterile conditions, which makes it painful and costly. Therefore, biopsy is not conducive to serial monitoring of muscle health. It is also semi-quantitative, and often difficult to extrapolate to the entire muscle, limiting its scientific and clinical value. For these reasons, there is a need for noninvasive assessment of muscle microstructure, which would facilitate the quantitative examination of muscle injury over time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to noninvasively quantify changes in volume, fat distribution, and water content in muscle. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a version of MRI that measures anisotropic diffusion of water, which is related to tissue microstructure, but tends to yield non-specific changes regardless of the injury or disease state. The key reason for this lack of specificity is that the explicit relationships between microstructure and diffusion have not been rigorously studied, nor carefully calibrated. To address this gap in knowledge, the purpose of this proposal is to compare muscle microstructure and MRI diffusion properties of muscle in novel and tightly controlled computer simulations, precision engineered phantoms, and animal models of muscle injury and disease. Our central hypothesis is that DT-MRI can be directly related to muscle microstructural changes, when appropriate pulse sequences are used to uncouple complex pathology. Aim #1 will use computer-based simulations of muscle structure and biochemistry to carefully understand how diffusion is related to multiple muscle microstructural changes. Aim #2 will utilize 3D precision-engineered models to relate diffusion to muscle structure in real-world DT-MRI experiments. These experiments will be integrated into a final in vivo set of experiments (Aim #3), which are designed to test the accuracy of DT-MRI to uncouple complex microstructural changes in the presence of muscle atrophy, inflammation, and degeneration. These experiments will elucidate the understudied relationships between microstructure and diffusion in muscle. The long-term goal is to serially quantify muscle microstructure non- invasively. This approach is innovative in that it combines state-of-the art imaging, simulation, nanofabrication, and morphology methods to generate a clinically meaningful measurement tool."
"9473400","Project Summary / Abstract  The two most common types of chronic wounds are venous ulcers (VUs) and diabetic ulcers (DUs). We will conduct the first double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect of low-frequency, low- intensity (LFLI) ultrasound (US) on chronic wound healing and health related quality of life (HRQOL) with high statistical confidence (? < 0.05, power > 0.90, n=60 VUs, n=60 DUs). Our approach combines this active therapy with non-invasive diagnostic monitoring of wound hemodynamics throughout the treatment cycle, and includes analysis of the impact of nutritional status and inflammation on wound closure. There are several innovative aspects of this work. Specifically, (1) Our lightweight, battery-powered applicator is the first potentially wearable ultrasound wound therapy device that is safe to apply for extended periods of time. (2) The applicator actively promotes healing, which is fundamentally different from commercial ultrasonic systems that remove necrotic tissue only. (3) Our approach will link LFLI US exposure to changes in wound hemodynamics and HRQOL, which has the potential to enable personalized medicine. (4) Our analysis of patient nutritional and systemic inflammatory status may enable further treatment customization by identifying those patients most likely to benefit from LFLI US therapy. (5) Our approach incorporates both disease-specific and generic measures of HRQOL, which is unique for a therapeutic ultrasound RCT.  Our low-frequency, low-intensity (20 kHz, <100 mW/cm2 spatial peak-temporal peak), portable ultrasound applicator is safe and clinically pragmatic wound treatment. The field lightweight (<25g) and permits parameters of our US device were previously optimized for venous ulcers, and our three recent pilot clinical human studies (VUs: n=20, n=25; DUs: n=10) demonstrated that our treatment improved healing by 15% per week compared to sham treatment. We therefore anticipate that our treatment will accelerate closure of chronic wounds, and we hypothesize that (1) LFLI US will improve generic and disease-specific HRQOL scores, (2) LFLI US will activate beneficial changes in the microvasculature of the wound and surrounding tissue, and (3) individuals with poor nutrition and high levels of inflammation will have delayed wound healing.  Our specific aims are to: (1) Assess the effect of LFLI US on VUs and DUs by measuring wound closure as a primary endpoint and generic and disease-specific HRQOL as secondary endpoints. (2) Monitor the effects of LFLI US on wound perfusion and oxygenation using non-invasive optical methods, and (3) Determine the impact of nutritional status and inflammation on closure of DUs and VUs. Overall, this work will validate LFLI US as a safe, portable, and cost-effective therapy for chronic wounds. This is important because new therapies and improved clinical paradigms for wound management are urgently needed. Over the long-term, our findings may enable the development of personalized wound treatment regimens across care settings."
"9360103","Project Summary/Abstract Understanding how the human brain produces cognition ultimately depends on precise quantitative characterization of context-dependent dynamic functional networks (DFN) that transiently link distributed brain regions. Progress in achieving this goal has been limited due to a lack of theoretical frameworks for characterizing DFNs and appropriate computational methods to test them. Devising and validating computational methods for investigating DFNs in the human brain is thus of great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in human brain research by developing novel algorithms for identifying DFNs and characterizing dynamic network interactions between distributed brain regions. To achieve this goal, we will develop and validate novel computational methods within the framework of Bayesian switching linear dynamical systems (BSDS) with vector autoregressive models (VAR) and factor analysis (FA) that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic interactions in the human brain. The second major goal of this proposal is to use BSDS to investigate DFNs underlying cognitive function in healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Severe cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating behavioral outcomes in patients with PD, yet little is known about the temporal properties of dysfunctional neurocognitive systems in this debilitating disorder. The computational algorithms we propose to develop, validate, and apply will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics that support critical cognitive functions and significantly advance our understanding of dynamic processes underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, investigate DFNs in simulated, rodent in vivo optogenetic fMRI, as well as human data using state-of-the-art (sub- second) high-temporal resolution fMRI data generated by the NIH-funded Stanford Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), highlighting critical translational applications of our proposed methods. Our proposed studies will provide novel tools for investigating dynamic functional networks in the human brain, with innovative applications to the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the study of neurological disorders and clinical neuroscience more broadly. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the BRAIN Initiative (RFA-EB-15-006), which calls for the development and dissemination of innovative computational tools for probing human brain function and dysfunction. Our computational tools will be widely disseminated to facilitate research into the dynamical aspects of human brain function."
"9241964","Viral respiratory tract infections commonly cause hospitalizations, economic losses, morbidity and mortality in the US and worldwide. Influenza A virus (lAV), paramyxoviruses, rhinoviruses, human coronaviruses (HCoV), and other emerging, highly pathogenic respiratory viruses are a major global public health threat. Importantly, viral lung disease severity can range from mild self-limited infections to pneumonia followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. This spectrum complicates treatment algorithms and underlies a critical need for rapid-response etiologic and prognostic indicators that readily inform treatment options in an outbreak setting. The overall goal of this program is to develop new platform technologies to rapidly recover and characterize new and emerging viruses in vitro and in vivo. Secondary objectives are to use functional genomics as diagnostic and prognostic indicators of virulence and disease severity following virus infection of the lung. Using a highly interactive team, we will test the hypothesis that -omics and other physiologic signatures will: i) predict etiology; ii) provide early prognostic indicators of virulence, and iii) inform public health measures and therapeutic responses. The program uses highly pathogenic HCoV strains (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and HCoV EMC/2012) and lAV strains (H1N1 Ca/04/2009 and H1N1 1918) and various clinical isolates as models. In Aim 1, we will develop platforms to recover novel respiratory viruses and identify diagnostic and prognostic indicators of severe lung disease by infecting primary human lung cells. In aim 2, we use the Collaborative Cross Mice to develop new animal models of human disease and to define conserved genomic signatures that correlate with etiology and disease severity and then validate the role of these biomarkers in models of outbred human populations infected with different high and low path respiratory viruses. In Aim 3, the goal is to use functional genomics and computational biology to not only diagnose virus etiology and forecast disease severity in the lung, but in parallel, develop a highly portable screening platform that rapidly identifies and then validates the lead compounds that attenuate disease severity in robust models of outbred human populations."

"9344983","Project Summary/Abstract: The overall goal of this project is to develop novel bone-targeted conjugates of clinically relevant antibiotics for the treatment of osteomyelitis. These compounds are new chemical entities built from known and approved antibiotics and bisphosphonates, which are connected via biodegradable phosphate linker. The design of these drugs exploits the high bone affinity of bisphosphonates to target the conjugate directly to the site of bone infection where both drugs are released. Proof-of-concept of this drug design as applied to cancer induced bone disease has been demonstrated in humans. We hypothesize that this design will enable the concentration of antibiotic in bone to currently unachievable levels while also reducing systemic exposure. Such conjugates may have a wider therapeutic range than currently available therapies, and as an added benefit, the drugs also strengthen the bones and may reverse the deterioration of bone, associated with infection. The proposed studies will enable the preparation of a four novel conjugates that will be characterized in vitro and assessed for efficacy in a mouse model of osteomyelitis. The specific aims of this project are: (1) Develop synthetic methods and make sufficient amounts of four conjugates composed of one of two bisphosphonates classes (etidronate or ibandronate) and two antibiotics (ciprofloxacin or clindamycin); (2) Demonstrate efficacy in a luciferase based mouse model of osteomyelitis, reduction or elimination of bone localized staphylococcus aureus and (in a parallel model) psuedomonous aeruginosa and assess the microarchitecture of bone with histology, imaging and markers of bone turnover. The successful completion of this Phase I project will guide the further development of this promising concept, identify a lead compound to be carried into FDA required studies for investigational new drug approval, and lead to eventual clinical application. It is anticipated that this technology will ultimately result in therapeutic agents that will significantly improve osteomyelitis patient care resulting in decreased morbidity and reduced amputations and reduced antibiotic related toxicities as well as reduce the risk of infection for routine surgery and bone-exposed trauma patients."
"9350357","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microtubule and actin cytoskeletons are essential for the movement, polarization, sorting, and morphogenesis of intracellular membrane compartments. Molecular motors, scaffolding proteins, and associated filaments are recruited to membranes to power diverse trafficking events that have different force, power, kinetic, and transport requirements. Defining the mechanisms of trafficking requires understanding how different motor isoforms and families work alone and in teams, and how motors and filaments work with the scaffolding proteins and adapters that link them to membranes. Determining these mechanisms requires a detailed understanding of: the cellular organization and dynamics of the cytoskeleton and membranes; the spatial, kinetic, and mechanical relationship of different motors and filaments; the structural and biophysical properties of cytoskeletal-membrane assemblies; and the biophysical parameters that define the capabilities and mechanisms of motors and scaffolds when operating under working conditions. To this end, we assembled an extraordinarily strong scientific team with expertise in cell biology, biochemistry, structural biology, structural dynamics, and technology-development to define the role of the cytoskeleton and molecular motors in trafficking. Our team includes pioneers in the use of state-of-the-art imaging, single-molecule, and structural techniques to discover how cytoskeletal proteins function in complex cellular events. High-resolution live-cell microscopy, reconstituted cytoskeletal geometries using microfabrication and dielectrophoresis, X-ray crystallography, nanometer-resolved fluorescence tracking, single-molecule fluorescence polarization, optical trapping, and advanced biochemical techniques will be applied in highly collaborative studies to understand how motors, scaffolds, and filaments work together to power membrane dynamics. The projects and investigators are interdependent and are closely linked through research goals and common technologies, and the Aims were formulated to capitalize on the unique strengths of the team members while taking advantage of extensive synergies between the groups. We will focus on the following four Aims: (1) Investigate the Dynamics of Molecular Motors in Organelle Transport and Membrane Remodeling; (2) Investigate the Structural, Biochemical, and Cellular Properties of Cytoskeleton-Membrane Scaffolds in Organelle Morphogenesis and Motility; (3) Discover the Mechanical and Biochemical Adaptations of Membrane- Associated Motors and Scaffolds; (4) Investigate the Structural Dynamics of Myosin, Dynein and Motor Collections."
"9337240","Project Summary/Abstract Musculoskeletal pain is a highly prevalent clinical problem, but males and females have been shown to experience marked differences in pain sensitivity/threshold, discrete expression patterns of pain related genes, differing susceptibility to chronic pain conditions, and dissonant post-injury analgesic responses. In both sexes, group III and IV muscle afferents serve as the chief input for muscle pain. However, these same afferents also are integral to the generation of the exercise pressor reflex (EPR), which stimulates exercise-induced increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Interestingly, males and females also show discrete response patterns in the EPR. Our preliminary data has shown distinct gene expression patterns between males and females in a preclinical model of ischemic myalgia, a widespread muscle pain state seen in disorders such as peripheral vascular disease and complex regional pain syndrome, among others. Specifically, we found a distinct pattern of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) gene expression between males and females for acid sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) and the proton-sensing heat transducer, TRPV1, after peripheral ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R). Thus, we hypothesize that the group III and IV primary muscle afferents, serving as the peripheral regulator of both nociception and EPR, may be responsible for the complex interactions between pain, cardiovascular reflexes, and sex via differential upregulation of ASIC3 and TRPV1 in the DRGs. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying these sex differences, we will utilize our animal model of I/R injury which is known to dually generate pain-related responses in the affected limb and induce systemic EPR dysfunction, and couple it with an afferent-specific siRNA knockdown strategy of ASIC3 or TRPV1 in animals of both sexes. We will analyze muscle afferent function using a novel ex vivo forepaw muscle, median & ulnar nerves, DRG, and spinal cord recording preparation, which enables us to comprehensively phenotype these afferents in mice. Behavioral analyses of nociception and cardiovascular responses to exercise will also be performed in I/R or sham injured mice with or without siRNA knockdown. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine if upregulation of ASIC3 in the DRGs regulates I/R-induced alterations in muscle afferents leading to pain behaviors and altered EPRs in males but not females. In Specific Aim 2, we will perform similar assays but determine if upregulation of TRPV1 is responsible for observed molecular, electrophysiological and behavioral effects in females but not males. We predict that group III and IV primary muscle afferents mediate these processes in a sex-dependent manner, which may underlie the differential prevalence of pain conditions in men and women, and thus have implications for developing specific preventative care strategies and/or therapeutics."

"9390357","Abstract Messenger RNA (mRNA) decay is a critical step in the regulation of gene expression. mRNA decay in eukaryotes proceeds by removal of the 3' poly(A) tail (deadenylation) followed by removal of the 5' cap (decapping) then destruction of mRNA by 5' - 3' exonuclease digestion. This process of decay is intimately connected to mRNA translation, and a major goal of the ?eld is to understand how translation interacts with decay to set decay rates. Our lab has made the important discovery that codon optimality is a critical determinant of decay rates transcriptome- wide. Further, we have identi?ed the DEAD-box protein DHH1 as the sensor that detects slowed translation elongation associated with non-optimal codons and directs these messages to decapping and degradation. In light of this novel function for DHH1, this proposal seeks to understand the mechanism by which DHH1 senses slowed translation elongation and transmits this information to the decapping complex. The ?rst aim is designed to understand how DHH1 interacts with the ribosome to sense slowed elongation. The second aim focuses on how DHH1 transmits a slowed elongation signal to the decapping complex. The third aim is to determine how deadenylation sensitizes mRNA to DHH1. Together, these aims will inform how DHH1 functions, thus providing insight into a wide range of gene expression events."
"9371238","Summary In cardiomyocytes the high metabolic demand of contractility emphasizes the need for an efficient and tightly controlled energy producing system. Oxidative Phosphorylation (OxPhos) serves the need of myocardium and as such the site of OxPhos is the mitochondria that represents a central control dogma to ensure that energy demands are met. In mitochondria, Ca2+ is proposed to be the link between EC coupling (ECC) and OxPhos and has been shown to modulate mitochondrial metabolism through the activation of Ca2+-dependent dehydrogenases. It is a long standing mystery on how mitochondrial calcium ([Ca ]m) uptake is tightly regulated during physiology and 2+ pathology. The [Ca ]m uptake is facilitated by the large electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial 2+ membrane and mediated by the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU). MCU is a hetero-oligomeric complex and known to be regulated by several of its interacting partners MICUs, MCUR1, EMRE and MCUb. But there is a lack of knowledge on the exact molecular mechanism of MCU regulation. Our recent structural insight of the MCU channel revealed an acidic patch where cations can bind and regulate MCU activity. Consistent with this, other Ca2+ channels including L-type, ryanodine receptors (RyRs), Inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), and Ca release activated 2+ Ca2+ channels are known to be regulated by a negative feedback mechanism. Our discovery of this long-sought regulatory mechanism, uniquely positions us to study the divalent cation based regulation of MCU during pathophysiological condition. Thus I hypothesize that under physiological conditions mitochondrial matrix Mg2+- binding-induced inactivation of MCU may be a protective buffering mechanism for [Ca ]m overload mediated cell 2+ death that is pertinent to cardiomyocyte energy metabolism. Mg2+ being the most abundant divalent cation is known to play important roles in regulating Ca2+ and K+ channels of plasma membrane. In mitochondria, matrix Mg2+ homeostasis is maintained by a selective CorA transport family protein, Mrs2p. Thus, the current proposal aims to delineate the mechanism by which mitochondrial matrix magnesium ([Mg ]m) contributes to the regulation of MCU 2+ activity, mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and bioenergetics. To uncover the molecular link between and MCU and Mrs2p channels, I will generate knockout, and functional domain (loss/gain of function) knock-in mutant model systems using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene targeting to study the regulation of MCU-mediated [Ca ]m 2+ uptake by matrix Mg2+. We hypothesize that mitochondrial matrix will be overloaded with Ca2+ in cells that lack Mrs2p and its functional domain (GMN). Conversely, we also hypothesize that the knock-in mutant corresponding to the acidic patch of Mrs2p will serve as a gain-of- function mutant and will alleviate MCU- mediated Ca2+ overload during pathological conditions including I/R injury and protect cardiomyocytes from necrotic cell death. The proposed study will reveal how MCU regulation by divalent cations provide a therapeutic strategy for I/R injury."

Given the aging population and increased likelihood of arrhythmia as a person ages, the number of implants is expected to increase in the future. There are two main limitations associated with the majority of currently marketed pacemakers, both of which are tied to the battery: usable lifetime and device volume. Typical pacemakers need to be replaced every 5 to 7 years due to the specified lifetime of their electro-chemical batteries, meaning 20% of pacemaker implantations are replacement devices and 76% of those replacements are battery related. This constraint results in significant cost, up to $80,000/per implant in the U.S., as well as health risks and inconvenience for the patient. Pacemaker volume is also an important issue for patients and physicians. Current batteries constitute over 50% of the volume of a conventional model. While pacemaker size has reduced over time, the current footprint remains visible under the skin, and hence, less than ideal from a quality of life perspective. The goal of this research project is to develop a next generation battery for pacemakers and other medical implants through the development of novel textured silicon carbide (SiC) betavoltaics that will provide a more compact and long-lived power source for next-generation implants. Betavoltaics are micro power sources that produce continuous voltage and current by harvesting betas, electrons produced from isotope decay, and converting their energy to electrical power with a semiconductor device. Widetronix's innovation is embedding an isotope layer around the textured features of a wide bandgap semiconductor. Because of the extremely high energy density of the isotope fuel, this technology has the potential to achieve power densities ten-fold greater than existing pacemaker batteries with projected operational lifetimes exceeding 15 years. These features will result in definite improvements to the quality of patient care and, in the long term, reduce the cost of the implantable device over its useful lifetime. Over the course of the NIH Phase I SBIR, Widetronix was able to develop a process for securing an isotope layer (metal tritide) on the surface of our textured SiC device, thereby achieving a consistent beta flux over the active area. The process led to a 3x improvement in the energy density of our betavoltaics. The development under the Phase II will focus on pushing the texturing of the SiC device toward its material limit, etching deeper into the SiC while narrowing the features, thereby allowing the betavoltaic to take full advantage of the extra surface area gained through the texturing process. The goal is to increase the active area density by 6x (from 2.43 cm2/cm2 to 14.58 cm2/cm2), resulting in an energy density that surpasses existing pacemaker batteries (5.8 kJ/cc) and moves us closer to our medical implant partners desired goal. The Phase II aims will involve the investigation and development of process conditions that maximize the exposed betavoltaic surface area while minimizing the device footprint; effectively increasing the devices textured area and thereby maximizing energy density"
"9463013","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suicidal behavior is a significant concern on college campuses, and suicide is the second leading cause of death in college student populations. Consistent with recommendations in the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and spearheaded by organizations such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, many universities have initiated voluntary web-based screening to identify students at elevated risk for suicide and in need of mental health services. This is a promising direction; however, research is needed to determine the efficacy of such an approach and how to most effectively link students with positive screens to professional services. With NIMH funding for an R34 intervention development grant, we developed, pilot tested and iteratively refined a theoretically-driven intervention, Students' eBridge to Mental Health (eBridge), which identifies students at elevated suicide risk and facilitates their linkage to mental health (MH) services. eBridge incorporates motivational interviewing (MI) principles and draws from health behavior promotion models that emphasize autonomy and self-determination. Following a web-based screen using standardized instruments to identify students at elevated risk (positive screens on any two or more of: lifetime suicide attempt, current suicidal ideation, alcohol abuse, depression), eBridge offers students the options of receiving personalized feedback (provided online in a conversational MI-adherent format) and corresponding online with professionals trained in MI and knowledgeable about local resources. In our R34 pilot randomized trial, students in the control condition received personalized feedback only, which was provided automatically and in graphic format. At 2-month follow-up, students assigned to eBridge reported (a) significantly higher levels of readiness to seek MH services; (b) significantly lower levels of stigma related to MH services; and (c) a higher likelihood of linking to MH services. In this application, we propose to conduct a large-scale, well-powered randomized controlled intervention trial across multiple universities to address the following specific aims: (1) determine the impact of eBridge on linkage to MH services, MH outcomes (suicidal thoughts and behaviors, depression, alcohol/substance misuse), and academic outcomes (grade point average, retention) at 6-month follow-up; and (2) examine possible moderators (gender, baseline levels of functioning, baseline recognition of problem) and mediators (engagement in online counseling, linkage to MH services) of eBridge effectiveness. Secondary aims include determining the costs associated with, and cost effectiveness of, the intervention. If the intervention is shown to be effective in his large-scale trial, it could be disseminated broadly to address suicide risk and associated mental health conditions and adverse consequences among college adults nationwide."
"9364349","Project Abstract  In the United States (U.S.), demand for red blood cells (RBCs) for use in transfusion medicine is steadily growing and will exceed the supply with a projected shortage of 4 million units of RBCs by the year 2030. In addition, frequent seasonal blood shortages, decreasing donation rates, risks of disease transmission, the RBC storage lesion and other side-effects threaten the existing supply of RBCs. Therefore, a viable short-term alternative to donated human RBCs must be developed which is safe, available in large quantities at low cost, and free of the risks of disease transmission and immune suppression, as well as address concerns over religious objections to receiving transfused blood. RBC substitutes should be used to treat conditions in which the use of banked blood is unreasonable or for which there is no therapy. Despite decades of research and clinical trials, mammalian hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen (O2) carriers (HBOCs) are still plagued by severe side-effects, such as vasoconstriction at the microcirculatory level, systemic hypertension, myocardial infarction and increased mortality rates.  It has been hypothesized that the side-effects associated with previous generations of HBOCs were caused by HBOC extravasation through the blood vessel wall into the tissue space, which led to scavenging of nitric oxide (NO). NO is also known as endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), and the endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels uses NO to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, resulting in vasodilation and increased blood flow. Previous generations of HBOCs were also easily oxidized in vivo, creating a significant amount of oxidative stress and tissue damage. All of these problems are a direct consequence of removing Hb from the protective environment of the RBC.  We propose that many of these side-effects may be prevented or reduced by using naturally occurring acellular Earthworm Hb (erythrocruorin, LtEc), which has evolved to exist outside of RBCs. Unlike other Hbs (64 kDa), LtEc is naturally large (3.6 MDa) and should not extravasate through the pores lining the blood vessel wall. This feature should prevent/limit its vasoactivity and the extent of systemic hypertension. LtEc is also extremely stable and resistant to oxidation. Therefore, it should elicit limited oxidative stress and tissue toxicity compared to acellular HBOCs synthesized from mammalian Hbs. In addition, LtEc appears to have a much slower or non-existent NO scavenging rate compared to mammalian Hbs, which is the hypothesized root cause of vasoconstriction and hypertension observed in previous generations of acellular HBOCs. Interestingly, the O2 transport characteristics of LtEc are similar to human RBCs, which suggests it will effectively transport O2 to tissues and organs in vivo. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugation to the surface of purified LtEc camouflages the molecule against recognition by the immune system and increases LtEc circulation half-life. Therefore, we hypothesize that PEG-LtEc will serve as an effective alternative to RBCs and will not cause the severe adverse reactions associated with previous generations of HBOCs formulated using acellular mammalian Hbs. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Purification, synthesis and biophysical characterization of LtEc/PEG-LtEc and individual globin subunits. Specific Aim 2: Assess and characterize the potential immunogenicity of LtEc, PEG-LtEc and denatured LtEc in rabbits. Specific Aim 3: Assess the ability of LtEc and PEG-LtEc to reestablish homeostasis after hemorrhagic shock."
"9526805","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholic hepatitis is a leading cause of liver disease and death worldwide; thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic interventions. Key events for the onset and progression of alcoholic hepatitis result from the gut-to-liver interaction. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. VitaminD supplementation regulates the expression of tight junction proteins, enhances antimicrobial defenses and reduces proinflammatory cytokines in the gut. Vitamin D targets osteopontin via a vitamin D-responsive element in the osteopontin promoter. Milk osteopontin protects the gut by maintaining the epithelial barrier function, providing mucosal defense, preventing sepsis and the inflammatory response. So far, a link between vitamin D and osteopontin in protecting from alcoholic hepatitis has not been established. We believe that nutritional therapy using vitamin D and milk osteopontin could protect from alcohol-induced liver injury. In this Application we will focus on testing the Central Hypothesis Dietary supplementation with vitamin D or milk osteopontin could prevent alcoholic hepatitis due to the gut protective and antisteatotic actions of osteopontin. In particular, we hypothesize that vitamin D and milk osteopontin will: 1) Target the gut-liver axis protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier and blocking the translocation of Gram-negative bacteria from the gut into the portal circulation thus lowering lipopolysaccharide levels; 2) Prevent steatosis and liver injury by targeting fatty acid metabolism and decreasing lipopolysaccharide-mediated Kupffer cell activation and TNF? production; and 3) Avert hepatic steatosis, inflammation and liver injury by increasing autophagy, a recently identified pathway regulating steatosis. We will develop new in vivo models of alcoholic hepatitis to further our understanding of the mechanisms of liver injury. Using these models, mice will be treated with vitamin D or milk osteopontin to assess their therapeutic potential. To prove our hypothesis we plan three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will analyze if vitamin D and milk osteopontin block the ethanol-mediated increase in gut permeability, bacterial translocation and lipopolysaccharide availability. The chronic Lieber-DeCarli model along with dextran sodium sulfate treatment will be used. In Aim 2, first, we will determine whether vitamin D and milk osteopontin blunt steatosis by targeting fatty acid metabolism; and second, we will dissect if the ability of osteopontin to bind lipopolysaccharide lowers Kupffer cell activation, TNF? production as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines. The chronic Lieber-DeCarli model along with dextran sodium sulfate or lipopolysaccharide treatment will be used. In Aim 3, a new model of alcoholic hepatitis based on autophagy blockade will be developed. Next, we will identify if vitamin D and milk osteopontin reduce steatosis by activating the autophagy pathway independent of targeting bacterial translocation or binding lipopolysaccharide. Thus, the Overall Goal of this Application is to investigate whether dietary administration of vitamin D and milk osteopontin could be an efficient low-cost therapeutic strategy for slowing down or preventing the progression of alcoholic hepatitis."
"9360049","ABSTRACT The Pilot program has proven to be an important mechanism for the evolution of CSORDA by incorporating new and innovative project areas, new faculty participation, and new technical approaches. The program also has introduced talented UCLA faculty to addiction-related research. The Pilot Core will fund 4 Pilot Projects/year. Pilots have full access to CSORDA resources including the Animal Breeding Core (AB-Core) and the Technical Advancement Core (TA-Core). The TA-Core includes consultation with the Semel Biostatistics Core (SiStat) and Dr. Arthur Arnold for expertise and reagents for the study of sex differences. Logistical management, as well as budgetary and scientific oversight of the Pilot Core, will be the responsibility of the Administrative Core. The Pilot selection process involves a call for proposals and evaluation of the rationale, approach, and rigor of proposals by the Pilot Project Selection Committee, chaired and chosen by Dr. Edythe London. This committee selects project finalists, which are subsequently presented at a biweekly CSORDA meeting. The presentation provides the opportunity for initiating collaborations, as well as critiquing, and optimization of Pilot Projects. Funding is discussed at the Steering Committee leadership meetings, with the Directors making final decisions in consultation with Dr. London and the Advisory Board. Pilots will be funded according to their innovation, research excellence and rigor, as well as impact on substance abuse research. Given equivalent merit, priority will be given to projects most closely related to the theme of the Center or that offer new technologies or research for future CSORDA directions. Pilot progress will be monitored by presentations at a biweekly CSORDA meeting between 6 to 9 months after funding begins. Annual NIH Progress Reports provide documentation of progress. If a second year of funding is requested, a competitive application will be required. The Projects selected for funding during Year 1 of the renewal (with possibility of funding in Year 2) are: I) Pamela Kennedy, Assistant Professor in Psychology, will investigate a switch from goal-directed to habit learning following opioid drug withdrawal and a role for kappa opioid receptors; II) Sotiris Masmanidis, Assistant Professor in Neurobiology, will use silicon microprobe recording technology developed by his group to investigate the perturbation of striatal physiology following withdrawal following chronic opioid administration; III) Kate Wassum, Assistant Professor in Psychology, will explore neural circuits underlying maladaptive reward-seeking decisions in opiate withdrawal; and IV) Carlos Cepeda, Research Professor in Psychiatry, will use miniaturized microscopes from the TA-Core to image calcium activity in the striata of freely-behaving mice following opioid administration. Sex differences will be considered in every Pilot. These 4 Projects all have potential to generate NIDA-related independent research programs or to be incorporated into future renewals of CSORDA. For Years 3-5, we will fund one or two translational (T1 or T2) Pilots, applying for cost sharing with the UCLA CTSI for more substantive funding."
"9392989","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 40,000 babies in the US and over 1 million babies worldwide each year are born with congenital heart defect (CHD). It is estimated that 20% of CHD children have specific heart defects that involve the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and pulmonary valve. These pediatric patients are typically subjected to multiple invasive open-heart surgeries throughout their lifetime in order to reestablish normal blood flow from the heart to the lungs.  Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) is emerging as a safe, less invasive alternative to surgical procedure. However, the only available TPVR device in the market, the Melody valve from Medtronic, has several limitations: it can only be used for patients who have a pulmonary diameter less than 24.5 mm and does not have a larger size valve; the device is a bulky device with a 22 Fr delivery system, which cannot be used for small pediatric patients; and its stent fracture has been extensively reported. Thus, there is a clear unmet market need for a TPVR device with smaller crimped profile, larger size and good durability. Building upon extensive academic, clinical and industrial experiences on heart valve biomechanics and medical device designs, the team at Dura Biotech has invented Dura Valve Leaflet Technology (DVLT) for developing low profile TPVRs that could fit within the various anatomic configurations across a range of pulmonic diameters that extended from young child to full adult size. The novel DVLT design-adding the reinforcement suspension structures on the valve leaflets-can elegantly reduce leaflet thickness without increasing leaflet peak stress concentration, which is a key factor influencing mechanical damage leading to valve leaflet failure. With the DVLT design, TPVR device can be smaller with thinner leaflets while maintaining durability.  The goal of this SBIR Fast-Track project is to develop and commercialize this paradigm- changing Dura TPVR device. In phase 1 of the project, we proposed to finalize the valve and stent designs of the TPVR device through a series of computational and experimental tests to meet customer requirements as well as all criteria specified by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA). In phase 2, the entire finalized TPVR system will be subjected to verification-and-validation tests and then evaluated for feasibility and safety through an animal study. Lastly, Dura Biotech will develop a strategy for quality system initiation and prepare for regulatory submission to FDA. Successful completion of this project will yield an innovative TPVR device to treat an untapped population of patients with RVOT and PV diseases and improve patient outcomes."
"9323312","ABSTRACT Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a potentially fatal autoimmune disease. Although current therapies afford clinical improvement, they are not curative and are associated with significant side-effects. We previously discovered that a natural antioxidant, glutathione (GSH), is depleted in lymphocytes of SLE patients. We also found that the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a sensor of oxidative stress, contributes to abnormal T-cell lineage specification and dysfunction in SLE. In lupus-prone mice, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which acts a precursor of GSH and an antioxidant by itself, abrogated the disease. While intravenous NAC has been safely used in humans for other indications, it is unavailable as an oral medication by prescription. Therefore, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the safety, tolerance, as well as immunological and therapeutic impact of NAC in 36 SLE patients. In this study, NAC was found to be safe, and it improved disease activity, reversed GSH depletion and blocked pro-inflammatory mTOR activation over 3 months. These results clearly warrant confirmation in a trial with longer treatment duration. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we propose a U34 planning grant for a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of NAC in SLE patients. The aims for this U34 application include: 1) Bringing together lupus clinical trial experts in a multi-center study with a coherent management structure and a clear communication strategy; 2) Refining the Clinical Protocol for determining the safety and efficacy of NAC; the trial conception has been, in response to reviews and NIAMS input, re-designed to ensure a clinically meaningful premise and efficient and affordable trial size using a novel approach and the recently validated SLE Responder Index (SRI) to evaluate primary clinical efficacy outcome; 3) Standardizing clinical assessment techniques to ensure reliability of the primary and secondary outcome measures across the collaborating centers; 4) Designing and implementing a 21 CRF part 11 compliant electronic data capture system (eDC), which will be based on the existing case report forms (CRFs); 5) Establishing centralized monitoring procedures for data collection and management; 6) Finalizing the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, Standard Operating Procedures, Manual of Operating Procedures, and Investigators Brochure to meet FDA, OHRP and NIAMS requirements for a U01 (multi-site) Clinical Trial Implementation Cooperative Agreement. The preliminary specific aims for the future clinical trial will be to: 1) Confirm safety and determine efficacy of NAC relative to placebo in 210 SLE patients, (105 patients per arm, with up to 20 additional subjects proposed to enroll for titration of NAC to tolerance within a dosage range of 2.4 g/day to 4.8 g/day through an initial 3-month open label period) during a 12-month intervention followed by a 1-month washout; 2) Determine whether the reversal of GSH depletion and blockade of mTOR are sustained over 12 months and predict responsiveness to NAC. This study will establish the role of NAC as a novel, safe, effective, and biomarker-driven approach in the treatment of SLE."
"9256991","For almost 15 years in total, the DUSRC Research Translation Core (RTC) has worked to accelerate the application of Center?s research in order to prevent or reduce early life, developmental exposures through strategic networks, partnerships, and other activities. The RTC will continue our work with Investigators from each Project to identify key stakeholders with the capacity to influence early life exposures or their outcomes. At least three times per year, the RTC will organize practical trainings in research translation and science communication for all Center members. These communication trainings may include RTC-led workshops in monthly Center meetings and sessions led by outside experts. The RTC will collaborate with the Training Core, the CEC, and the Administrative Core to implement a structured program of trainee involvement with research translation and community engagement activities each year of their SRP funding, named the Trainee Communication and Engagement Program (TCEP). The RTC will also work in coordination with the CEC to create and mentor Trainee Response Teams (TRT) to respond to short-term requests by community-based organizations, industry, or policy makers for information related to one of the Center?s areas of expertise. Duke?s new student electronic portfolio (ePortfolio) system, PebblePad?, will be used by each trainee to store, document, publish, and distribute artifacts developed during their TCEP. To most effectively engage SRP?s key stakeholders, ATSDR and EPA, around Center findings, the RTC will expand an existing collaboration with the University of Kentucky and University of North Carolina Superfund Research Centers to form a partnership at renewal with all SRCs in EPA Regions 3 and 4. The DUSRC has a long-standing partnership with the Elizabeth River Project (ERP) in conjunction with Project 3; at renewal, we propose a deeper research translation partnership with ERP and other area stakeholders. To communicate and contextualize the implications of the DUSRC?s findings to health professionals who work with women, infants, and children, as well as to broad audiences, the RTC will strategically employ online communication efforts to disseminate timely environmental health resources to existing stakeholders and other identified partners. In particular, RTC will engage both broad audiences and targeted professional leaders who are focused on developmental exposures through their existing communities. The RTC will work with DUSRC PIs to develop summaries, review articles, and editorial pieces about managing risks from environmental exposures for OB/GYN periodicals or other appropriate resource centers. RTC staff and interns will manage the DUSRC website (sites.nicholas.duke.edu/superfund) and will work with the Admin Core, PIs, and trainees to ensure that each project and core webpage concisely shares our latest findings, research direction, and news/media publicity."
"9341216","ENERGY BALANCE ASSESSMENT CORE ? ABSTRACT The Energy Balance Assessment Core (EBAC) has been an integral component of the University of Colorado NORC since 1997. The EBAC provides support for the measurement of components of energy balance (e.g., energy expenditure and intake) and for assessing consequences of alterations in energy balance (e.g., body composition, substrate oxidation). The Overarching Aim of the EBAC is to provide expertise and support for obesity- and nutrition-related basic, clinical, translational, and transdisciplinary research for NORC investigators at CU-AMC and its affiliates. Services of the EBAC have been and will continue to be essential for many NORC investigators. Over the past 5 years, the EBAC supported a total 113 research protocols from 66 principal investigators; 52 protocols were active at the time the competing renewal application was prepared. The consolidation of the instruments and techniques used by multiple investigators in the EBAC enhances a) cost effectiveness, by reducing the need to duplicate expensive instrumentation and specialized staffing, b) safety for both staff and research participants, by overseeing the training required to safely operate instruments and conduct procedures, and c) data quality, by conducting regular maintenance and standardized calibration and quality assurance procedures. Specific Aims of the EBAC that will be ongoing over the next period of award are to: 1) provide consultation on experimental design, procedures, and data interpretation for NORC-related research and access to and assistance with the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation and approaches for measuring various aspects of energy balance; 2) oversee the maintenance, calibration, quality assurance, and scheduling of instrumentation and the training of personnel who utilize the instrumentation; 3) leverage resources and coordinate activities with other institutional programs that provide services that support energy balance research; and 4) expand services based on the needs of NORC investigators. In addition, the following Specific Aims will be completed during the next award period: 5) implement a new Core Facility Management System (iLab Solutions; Chicago, IL) that will improve the efficiency of core management and simplify access for investigators; and 6) develop a Resource Manual for the Objective Measurement of Physical Activity, which will include descriptions of technologies (e.g., accelerometry) and advantages and disadvantages of each. Since 1997, the EBAC has enhanced nutrition- and obesity-related research by overseeing the measurement of components of energy balance and body composition with a degree of accuracy and quality control that would have been difficult and more expensive for individual investigators to achieve on their own."
"9352827","PROJECT SUMMARY ? Quantitative Analysis Core Quantitative analysis methods are essential for almost all forms of diabetes translational research. Along with traditional biostatistics, it has become essential to include methods from the social sciences (e.g., economics, sociology, decision sciences) in order to evaluate observational data and quasi-experimental studies, to assess outcomes such as health care costs and health care utilization, and to fully understand the long-term population level impact of novel interventions and policies. At the Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research (CDTR), our close proximity and active collaboration with investigators based in social science departments as well as research institutes and laboratories of the University of Chicago helps to ensure that we have a solid theoretical foundation for our research methods and also provides a close link to methodological innovations. The Quantitative Analysis Core has a strong history of accomplishments that have helped to advance quantitative methods in diabetes translation research particularly in the areas of cost- effectiveness analysis, decision analysis, quality of life assessment, and personalized medicine. The methodological expertise of the Quantitative Analysis Core provides support to numerous new and established investigators affiliated with the CCDTR and also provides support to external diabetes investigators across the U.S. Many of our ongoing studies are the byproduct of cross-fertilization of investigators from different disciplines that leads to innovative studies of diabetes prevention and care. For the renewal of the CCDTR, the Quantitative Analysis Core will continue to provide cutting-edge analytic support for a wide range of projects in diabetes translation research ranging from program evaluation to cost-effectiveness analysis to policy analysis. This support is available in terms of technical expertise and material resources for analysis such as data storage and computational processing capacity, software, and simulation models. Ongoing methodological areas of support include Biostatistical Analysis, Economic Analysis (Diabetes Simulation Modeling and Business Case Analysis). New methodological areas of support will include Health Care Claims Analysis, Social Network Analysis, and Agent-Based Modeling. The aims of the quantitative analysis core are: 1) To provide cutting edge quantitative analysis support for a wide range of diabetes translation research focused on improving the care and outcomes of vulnerable populations in resource-constrained settings; 2) To advance methods in quantitative analysis of diabetes translation research by leveraging advances in methods emerging from the social sciences; 3) To strengthen and forge new partnerships, connections, and collaborations with leading methodologists and investigators of the CCDTR. The innovations and support of the quantitative analysis core will help the CCDTR expand its role as one of the pioneering national leaders investigating how to translate diabetes research findings into real- world practice, with an emphasis on improving the quality of care and outcomes for vulnerable populations."

However, the precise roles of each of these interactions in the trafficking of the viral RTC/PIC toward the nucleus and from the microtubule organizing center into the nucleus are poorly understood. We will utilize advanced imaging technology and specifically labeled viral and cellular proteins to track CA and RTC/PIC movements and interactions in real time, which will reveal hitherto unknown details of the early events of HIV- 1 biology that underlie viral trafficking, uncoating, nuclear import, and integration. We also will solve novel structures of viral-host protein complexes that are involved in the nuclear transport process, including CA in complex with NUP358, NUP153, and CPSF6 proteins, the latter also in complex with its ?-karyopherin binding partner TNPO3.

"9325597","Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare, congenital but sporadic disease characterized by a facial port-wine birthmark, choroidal and leptomeningeal vascular malformations, epilepsy, stroke-like episodes, headache, and cognitive impairment. The disease is characterized by ongoing vascular overgrowth; histopathological studies of SWS lesion tissue show abnormal expression of vascular phenotypes and angiogenic factors. Angiogenic factors correlate with clinical severity suggesting that vascular remodeling is important in SWS. We hypothesize that vascular remodeling is ongoing in SWS, is central to the clinical progression, and is related to the recently discovered pathogenic somatic mutation in GNAQ. The causative somatic mutation for SWS is an activating mutation in the GNAQ gene, a guanine nucleotide binding protein essential in transmitting signals from G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), many of which are essential to vascular development and function. With this new knowledge, we will investigate our central hypotheses and prepare for treatment trials with clinical, biochemical, and molecular analyses.    In Project 2, our database will continue to capture SWS patients across the nation as they are seen at Sturge-Weber Foundation (SWF) Centers of Excellence. This database is the first national SWS database with longitudinal clinical data and this effort has integrated seven clinical research centers. We now propose to take the next steps in multi-centered clinical research and engage in longitudinal multi-centered clinical research that will quantify vascular remodeling in subjects with SWS, develop new biomarkers, and propose a safety drug study as a pilot project. We will also build upon the remarkable success of our first round of funding, the discovery of the somatic mosaic mutation in GNAQ that causes SWS, and determine the impact of this genetic defect upon downstream proteins and pathways in SWS skin and brain tissue. The illumination of the molecular genetic pathways of SWS will suggest new avenues for future development of therapy."
"9323320","Michigan Integrative Musculoskeletal Health Core Center ? Core D  Project Summary  Functional assessment of musculoskeletal phenotypes in animal models is critical to identifying  mechanisms of how diseases affect the integrative health and function of patients suffering from  various musculoskeletal conditions. The ability to study musculoskeletal phenotypes across a  wide-ranging scale requires considerable expertise and highly specialized training in physiology,  biophysics, and engineering, as well as access to costly, high-resolution, state-of-the-art  equipment. While occasionally the expertise and equipment for single approaches can be  developed in a single laboratory, developing these approaches can be cost prohibitive,  redundant, and can lead to proliferation of non-uniform techniques across the field. The  Functional Assessment Core (Core D) will bring together the animal, organ, tissue, and in  some cases cellular level phenotyping capabilities currently used within individual laboratories at  the University of Michigan into a cohesive and easily accessible core service that can be used  by the entire musculoskeletal research community. Core D will integrate individual laboratory  approaches to musculoskeletal biology and engineering by including state-of-the-art  measurements in bone mechanics, muscle function and mechanics, and tendon mechanics.  This will be implemented through prioritization of experiments for hypothesis-based testing,  coordination of cross-core experiments, execution of high precision phenotyping studies, and  collaboration among investigators within and external to the institution. Core D will also focus  on expanding its offerings to both enhance the capabilities of the current Research Community  and to further expand the breadth and depth of the Core Center. Four Aims are proposed: the  Core will provide expertise and guidance on the design of experiments in Aim 1, and access in  Aim 2 to state-of-the-art technologies and experts to allow quantification of animal, organ, and  tissue function and to provide training in these methodologies. Further, in Aim 3, the Core will  provide guidance with interpretation of results and make recommendations for future studies.  Lastly, the overall goal of Aim 4 is to enable the research community through ongoing  technology development and education.

Most infections are initiated from a restricted mucosal tissue, such as the intestine. To fight intestinal infections, gut-resident immune cells are superior to circulating ones. There is a surge of recent interest in tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells that have been shown to be a critical adaptive immune component of mucosal immunity. These cells have been flagged as an ideal cell population to be generated in T cell-based vaccines. However, the factors involved in the differentiation and maintenance of gut TRM cells remain poorly defined. Distinct from other T cell populations in the periphery, gut TRM cells harbor a unique transcription network. We propose that simultaneously suppressing the transcription factor Eomes and inducing the transcription factor Runx3 are required for the proper differentiation and maintenance of gut TRM cells following acute infections. Based on our previous findings, we hypothesize that TGF-? mediates TRM cell differentiation and maintenance in the gut through controlling Eomes- and Runx3-dependent transcription programs. Eomes and Runx3 are relatively independent nodules downstream of TGF-? signaling in gut TRM cells. Using different genetic models (conditional and inducible knockout mice that specifically delete TGF-? receptor on T cells, and TGF-? receptor/Eomes double conditional knockout mice in T cells), three major questions will be addressed:  1) When do gut TRM precursor or gut TRM cells receive TGF-? signaling? Whether continuous TGF-?  signaling is required for the maintenance of gut TRM cells? What is the transcription program maintained  by TGF-? signaling in gut TRM cells?  2) What is the function of TGF-?-dependent down-regulation of transcription factor Eomes in the  differentiation and maintenance of gut TRM cells? What is the TGF-?-dependent transcription program  that is prevented by Eomes in gut TRM cells?  3) What are the functions of TGF-? dependent induction of transcription factor Runx3? Whether Eomes  and Runx3 together control the majority of TGF-?-dependent transcription program in gut TRM cells? The results from these studies will elucidate the transcription program underlying TGF-?-controlled differentiation and maintenance of gut TRM cells. These studies will substantially further our understanding of gut TRM cell biology and lay the basis for future translational works."
"9332324","The principal significance of Core B is that it will provide a centralized source for the receipt, tracking, storage, and distribution of valuable biological specimens generated by all three projects in addition to providing standardized research reagents to the projects. This will be accomplished using established standard operating procedures that are in place from our ongoing multi-project programs funded by grants from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This strategy strengthens the quality of data across the projects and provides a high-degree of accountability for quality assurance. In addition, Core B will archive both biological specimens and test articles such as immunogens and mAbs used for passive immunization. These will be used as needed by the three projects and they will be shared with the larger research community upon request by other investigators. The three projects will have priority for receiving the specimens and test articles required to accomplish their specific aims. The Principal Investigator and Project Leaders will determine additional use of the specimens and test articles during regularly scheduled conference calls as specified in Core A. In the case of acute need, the decision will be made by an ad hoc conference call. The same team will establish priorities for external requests on an ad hoc basis for limited specimens or test articles. If the request is not for a limited material, it will be honored pro forma. Core B will also work closely with Core A where data will be archived to ensure that it can be readily tracked back to the specimens and test articles. The goals of Core B will be achieved by two specific aims. Aim 1: Provide specimens from immunized and challenged rhesus macaques. Aim 2: Provide antibody and protein reagents to the Program."
"9319158","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current methods for assessing skeletal maturity in US children are inadequate both in terms of racial/ethnic representation and outdated samples. The United States is a multi-racial nation, yet skeletal maturity standards are based on white children from many generations ago. The primary goal of the proposed study is to rectify this disparity, and provide up-to-date race-specific modules in the FELS method for skeletal maturity assessment. Children of diverse racial/ethnic groups will be included via multiple existing radiographic collections nationwide. The updated method for skeletal maturity assessment will be accomplished through three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine differences between races in both the timing and tempo of skeletal maturity and its individual components. Aim 2 will re-calibrate the FELS method using data from contemporary children. This aim will also provide a new program for assessment of skeletal maturity with sex- and race- specific modules. The program will be user-friendly and open source, with both stand-alone and web-based capability. Aim 3 will integrate two new interpretive parameters into the FELS assessment program output: relative contribution of five maturation categories to skeletal age, and prediction of future catch up or slow- down in skeletal maturation for a given child. The combination of these three aims will serve to benefit the treatment and clinical management of children nationwide."

"9246045","Project Abstract  Despite our growing tool kit of clinically approved vaccines that prevent millions of lives  annually, vaccine effectiveness is not equivalent across the globe, with particularly low  coverage rates in the developing world. Among the potential contributors to vaccine  failures in the developing world, accessibility, cold chain breaks, and education have  been implicated as structural barriers to vaccine effectiveness. However, emerging  evidence both in humans and animal models point to a critical role of parasitic infections  as immunological confounders of vaccine induced immunity. Specifically, parasites infect  more than a third of the world and have evolved over millennia to co-exist with their  hosts. To achieve co-existence, parasites have evolved immunosuppressive strategies  that dramatically alter the host?s immune system. These alterations include enhanced  anti-inflammatory cytokine expression profiles and skewed T-helper (Th) immunity that  collectively have been implicated in impaired response to both de novo infections and  vaccination. However, the impact of parasitic infections on altered antibody immunity has  been more controversial, where parasitic infection has been linked to reduced overall  antibody titers in some vaccines but not others. However, given the critical role of Th  immunity in programming the humoral response, it is plausible that while parasitic  infection may only alter the overall magnitude of the humoral immune response variably,  that these immunologic changes may have a dramatic impact on shaping the quality of  the humoral immune response. Thus under this project we aim to comprehensively  dissect the impact of parasitic co-infection on altering and shaping both the state of the  vaccine induced memory B cell response as well as the functional character of the  vaccine induced antibodies."

"9358753","Project 1 Summary Blocks to B cell memory: Dr. Charlotte Cunningham-Rundles: Common variable immune deficiency (CVID) is a primary antibody deficiency disease in which B cell development, including isotype switch, somatic hypermutation, differentiation into plasma cells and secretion of immunoglobulins is impaired. Due to prevalence, complications, and need for lifelong immunoglobulin therapy, CVID is one of the most clinically important primary immune defects. While the genetic causes of B cell dysfunction in CVID are unknown for most subjects, a growing number of autosomal recessive and more recently, dominant genes have been identified. About 8-10% of CVID subjects have mutations in the B cell receptor transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI). In addition to hypogammaglobulinemia, these subjects have striking lymphoid hyperplasia, splenomegaly and autoimmunity. TACI is highly expressed on marginal zone and CD27+ (memory) B cells, which secrete T cell independent (TI) Ab to carbohydrate antigens, essential in defense against bacterial disease. Unlike mice, human B cells have two TACI isoforms, a long and a short version; our data suggest that only the latter drives plasma cell differentiation, revealing additional complexity in this receptor system. Our group showed that TACI requires the cytoplasmic adaptor MyD88, and more recently that cytoplasmic TACI co-localizes with TLR9, MyD88, and the TNF receptor associated (TRAF) TRAF2 and TRAF6 in the endocytic compartment, suggesting intimate cytoplasmic cooperation between the TACI receptor and innate endosomal TLR pathways. Project 1 uses naturally occurring mutations in TACI, MyD88 and IRAK4, newly described defects in TRAF-interacting protein (TIFA) and members of the linear ubiquitination chain assembly complex, HOIL, HOIP, to explore how TACI isoforms are involved in the control of B cell growth, differentiation and the production of biologically important antibodies in humans. This project is closely linked to the study of tolerance in Project 2, marginal zone biology, bacterial defense, and the production of IgA in mucosal immunity in Project 3, and our progress in identifying new genetic defects leading to loss of B cell function and impaired antibody production to carbohydrate antigens, the topic of Project 4. These projects use naturally-occurring genetic immune defects to probe how normal human B cells are activated and controlled, knowledge essential for understanding how humans are efficiently immunized to produce protective antibodies and how the immune system achieves antibody memory while avoiding autoimmunity."

"9335863","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The corneal epithelium is one of the most sensitive and critical structures of the eye. It is affected in nearly every disease of the ocular surface, ranging from corneal abrasions and dry eyes to severe corneal melts and infections. Currently, there are very limited treatments that can specifically enhance the corneal epithelial function. In particular, there are no pharmacologic approaches to promote epithelial repair in patients with a compromised corneal epithelial barrier. The long term objective of this research application is to contribute to the development of novel and innovative treatments for patients with visually disabling ocular surface diseases by defining the mechanisms of epithelial barrier disease and repair. Our preliminary studies provide strong evidence that Notch1 plays a key role in regulating the corneal epithelial barrier repair and thus Notch1-/- mice provide a unique model for studying corneal epithelial barrier disease. To accomplish the research objectives of this application, the following two specific aims will be pursued: (1) Characterize the epithelial barrir function and the cell-cell adhesion defect using mice with conditional loss of Notch1 as a model, (2) Elucidate the inflammatory signaling pathways that are activated during epithelial injury/repair and determine their role in the development of inflammation and metaplasia using Notch1-/- mice as a model. These results will provide critical information for the development of therapies for patients with visually disabling ocular surface disorders. We will identify a number of candidate pathways and drugs for clinically enhancing the function of the corneal epithelium and suppressing corneal inflammation."

"9341399","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the most common dementia among people younger than 60. Presently, there is no therapy that blocks the neurodegeneration or progression of the disease. While a number of proteins contribute to FTLD neurodegeneration, progranulin (GRN) has emerged as one of the most important. Haploinsufficiency of GRN has been linked to familial forms of FTLD and transgenic mice with GRN deficiency show neurodegeneration reminiscent of FTLD. Because loss of GRN leads to pathophysiology, our hypothesis is that approaches to increase GRN in the CNS will be beneficial in treating FTLD.  From a genome-wide siRNA screen, we identified TRAP1(HSP90L) and FoxO1 as regulators of GRN expression. Inhibition of these proteins either with siRNA to block their synthesis or small molecule drugs to block their actions increases GRN levels in primary cortical neurons from mice. In studies proposed in this grant, we will further validate these two proteins as molecular targets to develop novel therapeutics to reverse GRN haploinsufficiency to treat FTLD. To do this, we will first test whether genetic and pharmacological inhibition of TRAP1 and FoxO1 can increase GRN expression in neurons from mice with GRN (+/-, +/R493X) haploinsufficiency, a rodent model of familial FTLD. We will use small molecule inhibitors of TRAP1 and FoxO1 to test if these proteins also contribute to the regulation of expression of GRN in vivo in brains of wild type (WT) and GRN (+/-, +/R493X) mice. Next, we will test whether inhibitors of these proteins can increase GRN levels in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons (i-neurons) from healthy volunteers and patients with FTD (+/R493X) resulting in GRN haploinsufficiency. These studies will test whether TRAP1 and FoxO1 regulate GRN expression in the neurons most relevant to FTLD and determine whether their inhibition can bring GRN levels in brain to levels seen in normal animals or humans. Next, we will investigate mechanisms by which TRAP1 and FoxO1 control GRN expression. We will test whether inhibitors of TRAP1 and FoxO1 stimulate GRN transcriptional activity, affect the turnover of the protein, or influence the subcellular targeting of GRN in vitr in primary neuron models of GRN haploinsufficiency (+/- and +/R493X). Finally, we will investigate the mechanisms by which TRAP1 and FoxO1 regulate GRN expression in vivo. This will be done by testing the efficacy of small molecule TRAP1 and FOXO1 inhibitors to increase GRN expression in the CNS of a unique animal model in which luciferase expression is regulated by the GRN promoter. In these mice, we will be able to test whether TRAP1 and FOXO1 inhibitors increase GRN transcriptional activity as well as GRN levels. If the small molecule inhibitors are able to reverse GRN deficiency in these disease models, the results would support further testing of TRAP1 and FOXO1 inhibitors as potential therapeutics to treat FTLD in future studies."

Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.

"9395969","ABSTRACT The reduction of risky college student drinking remains a national public health priority. Recent estimates suggest 2 in 5 college students frequently binge drink. Reports also indicate risky student drinking results in approximately 600,000 unintentional injuries, 700,000 physical assaults, and 97,000 sexual assaults annually. As alarming as these statistics may seem, they pale by comparison to mortality figures showing that every week another 50 families suffer the loss of a loved one due to student alcohol poisonings and accidents. Numerous studies have revealed protective behavioral strategies (PBS) show promise in helping reduce high- risk drinking and consequences in college students. Despite the benefits, there remains a sizeable gap in the literature detailing how consistently and how well drinkers use specific PBS. The proposed research will aid in the development of efforts to reduce risky drinking and consequences by employing a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to systematically examine the effects of PBS consistency and quality. The research will be conducted in two phases. In phase I, the research will collect qualitative data on 60-80 students (18-23) via 6-8 focus groups to assist in the development of a theoretical model and a quantitative measure of consistency and quality of PBS implementation. This phase will also conduct psychometric testing for the quantitative measure of PBS implementation (n=100) (Aim 1). In phase II, the research will collect daily diary data on 216 students and an additional subsample of 100 non-college-attending adults (same ages as Phase I) across six weekends to examine between- and within-person differences in the consistency and quality of PBS implementation (Aim 2) and sex and college/non-college status as moderators of the relationship between PBS implementation (i.e., consistency, quality) and consequences (Aim 3). The research will: (1) add to the understanding of the dimensions of quality and consistency with which PBS are utilized, (2) provide more precise information about their efficacy in reducing consequences, (3) provide insights about areas where students are at an increased risk of experiencing harm, and (4) increase the public health impact of using PBS."
"9335718","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (ICBG) with an interdisciplinary leadership team of physicians, pharmacologists, evolutionary biologists, and chemists will discover and develop therapeutic agents produced by Brazilian symbiotic bacteria. The team will target three therapeutic areas: 1) infectious fungal pathogens, 2) Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, and 3), cancers of the blood-all three of which represent major threats to human health that need to be addressed with new therapeutic agents. Internationally, invasive fungal diseases kill more people than malaria or TB, while Chagas disease imposes a special burden on Brazil, killing as many Brazilians as TB. Leishmaniasis has now passed Chagas disease in the Brazilian population. In spite of major improvements in cancer chemotherapy, cancer is projected to result in 8 million deaths internationally this year (13% of all deaths, WHO) and an estimated 13 million per year by 2030. This ICBG has focused screening platforms for all three diseases that will perform all the required steps from primary screens through in vivo mouse model studies. The ICBG will focus on identifying useful natural products from bacterial symbionts of social insects in Brazil, such as fungus-growing ants. Fungus-growing ants have specialized bacterial symbionts that provide chemical defenses against pathogenic fungi that threaten their communities. The ecological role of the bacterially produced chemical defenses - killing pathogenic fungi but sparing the fungal gardens and the insect host - matches the therapeutic requirements for antifungal, anticancer, and antiprotozoal agents. The population level diversity of the bacterial producers also provides the opportunity to identify multiple variants of a structural family, facilitating identification of active compounds ith better drug potential (e.g., lower mammalian toxicity, improved pharmacokinetics). Our discovery efforts will make extensive use of cutting-edge technology and genomic approaches. Bacteria will be micro-cultured for high-throughput primary phenotypic screens, and priority strains will be re-cultured for secondary screens and dereplication. All bacterial strains will be genotyped (16S), and strains advancing along pipelines will have their genomes sequenced and subjected to bioinformatic analysis. The data generated from our intensive sampling, phenotypic assays, chemical characterization, and genome sequencing will provide important insights into Brazilian microbial diversity and the ecological context and evolutionary selection of the natural products they produce. In addition, the ICBG will undertake major efforts to train Brazilian scientists, and support the development of drug discovery in the country."

Abstract: Vitamin D has anti-cancer properties in vitro in normal prostate epithelial cells, in prostate cancer cell lines, and in animal models. Activated vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, is known to reduce proliferation and promote apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines. In several epidemiologic studies, vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of prostate cancer and in some studies, aggressive disease. However serum vitamin D levels may not accurately reflect the vitamin D levels in the prostate as the normal prostate has the hydroxylases to activate and metabolize vitamin D. Prostate cancer cell lines have been shown to commonly lose 1-alpha hydroxylase activity with tumor progression. Therefore we seek to 1) validate serum vitamin D as a proxy for intra-prostatic vitamin D levels using the expressed prostatic secretion from 260 prostatectomy specimen; 2) estimate the effect of vitamin D on rates of proliferation and apoptosis in 240 prostate tumors by evaluating percentage of cancer cells undergoing proliferation and apoptosis as a function of vitamin D tertile using a Ki-67 and a direct TUNEL assay on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue; 3) evaluate for changes in relative gene expression in the vitamin D metabolic pathway with tumor progression in fifty low grade tumors (Gleason < 6) versus fifty high grade tumors (Gleason 8-10)."
"9240226","The secretion of progesterone is a primary function of the corpus luteum (CL) and a prerequisite for normal maintenance of pregnancy in all mammals. The coordinated differentiation of granulosa cells (GC) and theca cells (TC) into a functional CL is required for fertility. The single most important factor involved in regulating the secretion of progesterone in the CL, irrespective of species, is luteinizing hormone (LH). This pituitary gonadotropin induces luteinization of GC and TC, formation of the CL, and is capable of extending the functional life span of the CL. Secretion of progesterone is absolutely required for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and inadequate progesterone secretion contributes to early pregnancy loss in women and cattle, the two model systems employed in this project. Despite substantial scientific progress achieved in understanding the initial events leading to the differentiation of granulosa cells, little is known about the differentiation of theca cells into functional luteal cells. This incomplete knowledge interferes with the development of novel therapeutic interventions to enhance CL function (steroidogenesis), provide contraception, and ultimately to control fertility. Recent developments in other fields of research have shed light on the composition and role of intracellular lipid droplets as dynamic contributors to metabolic events and disease states. These understudied organelles are prominent components of steroidogenic cells but almost nothing is known about their role in the ovary. Despite their differences, both GC and TC accumulate lipid droplets (LD) during CL formation, presumptively for storage of the steroid precursor, cholesterol, and cellular energy in the form of fatty acids. The composition and precise function of LDs likely differs between these two cells because of their unique origins and functions. There is a gap in our knowledge of the formation, composition, and function of LDs in ovarian steroidogenic cells. This proposal will test the hypothesis that LDs provide a metabolic or hormone-sensitive organelle which can provide cellular energy and/or store and mobilize substrate for progesterone synthesis. We will employ state-of-the-art lipidomic, metabolomics and proteomic analysis to examine LDs and metabolic events driven by LH in differentiating bovine granulosa cells and theca cells and human granulosa-luteal cells. Experiments will determine the role of protein kinase A (PKA) and adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) in controlling cellular metabolic activities that either enhance or inhibit progesterone synthesis. Our long-term objectives are to fully understand the cellular mechanisms of action of gonadotropins and the regulation of steroidogenesis. The short-term goals of this research are to discover new signaling events initiated by LH and to determine how these novel mechanisms contribute to innovative strategies for enhancing progesterone synthesis, fertility, and contraception."
"9317507","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The estrogen receptor alpha (ER) is a member of a large nuclear hormone receptor family that regulates a network of genes to control cell homeostasis. Aberrant expression or point mutations of ER have been associated with several types of cancers, but a mechanistic understanding of ER function at the molecular level is still missing. Such knowledge will help to suggest novel therapeutic interventions. The ER mediates steroid control of transcription through the two domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the ligand-binding domain (LBD). The goal of our project is to eventually understand the allosteric cross-talk between these domains. Compelling evidence from several well-studied NRs indicates that interactions are formed between the two domains. However, it remains completely unknown how the two ER domains communicate with each other and identify protein regions that are involved in allosteric signaling. The ER is a homodimer with multiple domains, and structural flexibility, making it a challenging protein for high-resolution structural studies. To date, high-resolution structures of individual domains, but not of the ER complex containing both domains, have been determined. To understand how the DBD and the LBD interact with each other, we have been developing a multifaceted modeling method that combines information from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and synchrotron footprinting with the high-resolution structures of the individual domains. We have extensively tested and validated this methodology on a variety of systems with known protein complexes. We demonstrate that the combination of these complementary data yields derived complex structures that are close to the known crystal structures. Using these approaches, we have made significant progress in obtaining structural information for the estrogen receptor (ER) from experimental SAXS and footprinting measurements, and chemical cross-linking. These data will reveal information about the ER that has been unattainable through other methods and will identify interactions between the DBD and the LBD as well as previously uncharacterized DBD-LBD interfaces. We will also attempt to explain how several disease-associated ER mutations influence transcriptional potency of ER, and will provide a molecular characterization of the mutant ER complexes."
"9318572","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Center for Reproductive Health (CRN) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) is uniquely positioned to participate in the Cooperative Multicenter Reproductive Medicine Network (RMN). The CRN takes a multi-disciplinary approach to patient care and will benefit from community involvement of Kaiser-Permanente San Francisco and San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). This partnership allows a robust practice volume that will facilitate subject enrollment, and the diverse racial, ethnic, and socio-demographic characteristics of our patients will increase the generalizability of treatment protocols. Equally important, we have the leadership and experience in clinical trials to ensure success. Clinical research is a key step in translating basic science to the bedside, and the application of this research directly affects patient care. Over the last four decades, women in the developed world have delayed childbirth. Fertility decreases with age, and live birth rates are lower in women over 35 than in younger women. The decline in live birth rate reflects an increase in oocyte aneuploidy, leading to failure of implantation and increased risk for miscarriages and birth defects. Older infertility patients appear to have abnormal mitochondrial activity in oocytes and reduced production of ATP, which limits normal oocyte chromosomal disjunction and embryo development. Without sufficient ATP, the meiotic spindle, which is crucial for normal chromosome segregation, may not form properly, and altered spindles result in aneuploid embryos. In older women, the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) in primordial follicles is exposed to low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by mitochondrial respiration over decades. The resultant cumulative damage to mtDNA and enzymes involved in coQ10 synthesis would reduce the substrate for ATP production by the mitochondria. We hypothesize that altered mitochondrial function in oocytes reflects diminished availability of coQ10 with age. If our hypothesis is correct, we may be able to partially reverse oocyte aging by giving coQ10 to increase ATP production and increase anti-oxidant activity, thereby reducing damage to the COC. To test this hypothesis, we propose a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with the following aims: 1) Determine if coQ10 supplementation reduces time to delivery after ovarian stimulation and intrauterine insemination followed by in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI); 2) Determine if coQ10 supplementation affects oocyte developmental competence, intrafollicular oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function; and 3) Determine if oxidative stress in the follicle is relatedto ovarian/chronological aging and to the developmental competence of oocytes. Our study is innovative in its approach - which combines a large multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of coQ10, with laboratory evaluation of ovarian follicles, to characterize the role of oxidatve stress (OS) and coQ10 in ovarian aging. Additionally, a positive result would offer women the first treatment to overcome the impact of aging on the oocyte and the resultant lowered pregnancy potential."

We have recently uncovered a new symbiotic relationship between tumors subpopulations that promotes a transition from be- nign to malignant growth by inducing the collective invasion of cohesive groups of cells. Through analysis of the intrinsic heterogeneity within cell communities, we discovered an epigenetically distinct subpopulation of breast cancer ?trailblazer? cells that has an enhanced ability to initiate collective invasion. Importantly, sibling ?opportunist? cells can invade through paths in the ECM created by a minority subpopulation of trailblazer cells. This democratization of invasive behavior through subpopulation cooperation eliminates a bottleneck in tumor evolution, thus unleashing the metastatic potential of a more diverse tumor cell population. We have begun uncovering components of a unique multi-gene regulatory program that is specifically required for trail- blazer cell induced collective invasion and found evidence that it is active in patients with shorter survival times. Thus, we have revealed that the activation of a new signaling network in a subpopulation of cells can induce the formation of a novel cooperative relationship that yields widespread collective invasion and has the potential to negatively impact patient survival. Defining factors that control this new ?trailblazer? regulatory program and determining precisely how the interaction between trailblazer and opportunist cells contributes to cancer progression is necessary to explain how cooperative invasive behavior influences patient prognosis and reveal treatment options. Our overall objective in this proposal is to define how trailblazer and opportunist subpopulations influence tumor development. Our central hypothesis is that slow-cycling trailblazer cells in- duce metastasis by promoting the opportunistic invasion of a distinct subpopulation of metastasis initiating cells that lacks autonomous invasive ability. We will test our hypothesis and accomplish our objectives by: (1) defining factors that control the conversion between opportunist and trailblazer states; (2) determining how induction of the trailblazer state influences cell autonomous fitness and (3) determining how the cooperative relationship established between trailblazer and opportunist subpopulations contributes to metastasis. From our investigation, we expect to determine a new way in which heterogeneity promotes tumor development by revealing how the cancer hallmarks of proliferation and autonomous invasion can be distributed across distinct populations and shared in a synergistic relationship that promotes disease progression. These findings will support the development of a new mode of prognostic analysis directed towards identifying the presence and close spatial proximity of unique tumor cell subtypes. Deconstruction of processes that confer invasive ability through intercellular interactions may also uncover novel ways to thwart invasion."

"9408574","PROJECT SUMMARY Lung transplantation is increasingly used to treat patients with end-stage lung diseases. Complications frequently occur with chronic allograft rejection causing most of late morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients. Pathological manifestations of chronic rejection mostly affect small airways or bronchioles in the lung, often progressing undetected until the patient presents with an irreversible decline in pulmonary function. There is an unmet need for safe and accurate methods to detect and classify earlier, sub-clinical lesions associated with subsequent development of chronic rejection in asymptomatic patients, to maximize preservation of lung function in these patients.  The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a clinical instrument that is capable of 3D imaging of bronchioles and surrounding parenchyma to address this unmet need. With this instrument, clinicians will be able to identify, minimally-invasively, dimensional and structural changes of small airways and alveoli, and to detect vascular and fibrotic abnormalities in the airways. The instrument will rapidly scan many branches of sub-segmental bronchioles for reliable and accurate classification of early pathologies leading to chronic rejection to indicate earlier and more targeted therapeutic interventions.  Our proposed instrument is based on a miniaturized flexible endobronchial imaging probe that combines multi-modality optical coherence tomography with autofluorescence imaging. This high resolution and high-capability imaging, recently developed by our academic collaborators, has been shown to accurately and rapidly visualize fine anatomical structures of small airways and alveoli, also identifying pulmonary vasculature and lung fibrosis.  Towards the objective of developing and evaluating such a clinical instrument, we will first improve the existing prototypes (Aim 1) to enhance image features associated with relevant pathologies in the lung graft. We will validate the improved performance using test fixtures and live animals. Aim 2 is to evaluate the readiness of the improved instrument for human trials by conducting appropriate safety and performance tests for the device. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the multi-modality endobronchial imaging probe in clinical trials aimed at collecting a library of images of lung transplant patients and identifying diagnostic criteria in the image data for detection of abnormalities associated with chronic rejection of lung allograft. We will image asymptomatic patients during their regular post-transplant exams and patients with established lung transplant dysfunction. We will correlate relevant image features with lung function, histology and bronchoalveolar lavage findings, and other clinical parameters and clinical history in these two groups of patients."

"9396046","Large-scale genetic data has become increasingly available, providing many clues about the genetic basis of human traits and diseases. However, ~90% of genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals are from common, noncoding variants. Such variants are difficult to interpret and connect to biological insight because (1) there are generally multiple possible causal genes at each locus and (2) linking noncoding variants to the genes they regulate is challenging, which obscures the biological processes involved. Many strategies for mitigating this problem have been proposed. One such strategy is applying algorithms that look for commonalities across loci, which can implicate biological processes through gene set enrichment analysis, pinpoint important epigenetic marks, and/or prioritize likely causal genes. A second strategy is assaying rare and low-frequency coding variants, which have less linkage disequilibrium and therefore more directly pinpoint causal genes. To facilitate progress from genetic association to biological hypotheses, I propose extending and combining these strategies to develop several different methods. Specifically, I will take DEPICT, a gene set enrichment analysis method developed by our lab for GWAS data, and adapt it for use with the ExomeChip (which genotypes coding rare- and low-frequency variants). DEPICT has the particular advantage of using gene sets that have been extended via coexpression data to make predictions about the function of uncharacterized genes, so it is especially powerful as a tool for biological interpretation. DEPICT also prioritizes causal genes for GWAS based on the similarity of their gene set memberships. However, many other methods for prioritization have been developed and it is difficult to know which are the most accurate. I will therefore develop a method for rigorous comparison of existing prioritization strategies and use it to determine which are the most effective. Finally, interpretation of whole-genome sequencing data is hampered by the challenge of linking noncoding variants to genes and the large sample sizes needed to achieve sufficient power to detect associations. I will develop a gene-set-based approach that incorporates epigenetic information and will use it to improve power for detection of rare and low-frequency noncoding variation in anthropometric traits. Completion of this project will result in a number of useful tools for extracting biological insight from genetic association data that draw on the advantages of gene set enrichment analysis and the power of focusing on rare- and low-frequency variation."
"9397073","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the discovery of ABO(H) blood group antigens and corresponding anti-ABO(H) antibodies over a century ago, anti-ABO(H) antibodies remain one of the most significant immunological barriers to transfusion and transplantation. Moreover, the mechanisms responsible for anti-blood group antibody formation and its regulation remain relatively unknown. Previous studies suggest that exposure to microbes expressing membrane carbohydrate structures resembling ABO(H) antigens may be a driving force in the formation of naturally occurring anti-ABO(H) blood group antibodies. In order to examine the role of blood group expressing microbe exposure in the development of anti-blood group antibody formation, we generated a novel animal model that lacks the mouse blood group B disaccharide (Bdis), generating a recipient that is analogous to human blood group O individuals. Preliminary studies indicate that Bdis negative recipients housed in standard conditions readily produce anti-Bdis antibodies at high titers, while those housed in specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions are unable to produce anti-Bdis antibodies until exposed to Bdis positive microbes in adulthood. Taken together, these findings suggest that microbial exposure may be required for naturally occurring anti-Bdis antibody development. Additional preliminary data demonstrate that exposure to microbes at a younger age results in a greater magnitude of antibody production. However, these high antibody titers fail to persist at constant levels among recipients, which may mirror alterations in sustained colonization of Bdis positive bacteria. These results parallel clinical observations regarding significant differences in anti-ABO(H) antibodies between individuals. Given this variability in antibody levels across age groups and housing conditions of the Bdis negative model, we hypothesize that the timing and duration of microbial exposure impacts the magnitude and persistence of anti-blood group antibody production. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define the impact of recipient age on the development of anti-Bdis antibodies relevant in anti-ABO(H) hemolytic transfusion reactions. Aim 2. Define the requirement of continued microbial exposure for the persistent production of anti-Bdis antibody relevant to hemolytic transfusion reactions. These studies will provide novel insight into the role blood group expressing microbes play in the production and persistence of anti-ABO(H) antibodies, the most common immunological barrier to transplantation and transfusion therapy."

"9305136","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital or neonatal lung diseases cause considerable morbidity and mortality in infants and lead to life-long lung dysfunction and dyspnea in survivors. The emerging field of systems biology has great potential to illuminate the complex gene regulatory networks and interacting mechanisms that control normal lung development and go awry during abnormal development leading to disease. This approach first requires access to databases that define the genetic programs of lung development, yet to date no databases required by systems scientists have been prepared from pure human lung lineages during normal or diseased lung development. This proposal prepares the databases and initiates the analytical and computational approaches required to found a developmental systems biology study of lung child birth defects. We seek to understand normal and diseased human lung development by preparing the first dynamic human lung developmental databases of gene expression and global histone modifications using differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in culture In this proposal, we bring together lung developmental biologists, stem cell biologists, clinicians, physicists, and computational researchers to apply this new in vitro model system to map the epigenome and transcriptome of normal human lung development and to construct gene regulatory networks of development using naturally occurring or engineered perturbations in NKX2.1 that are known to lead to lung birth defects. In aim 1, we define the global epigenomic and transcriptomic programs emerging during normal human lung development using a novel human embryonic stem cell (ESC)/iPSC in vitro model system able to recapitulate the developmental sequence of lung epithelial lineage specification and differentiation. In Aim 2 we identify dynamic candidate gene regulatory networks, histone-DNA interactions, and enhancer/promoter elements using time-series data obtained during the establishment of normal lung epithelial cell fate. In aim 3 we develop systems developmental biology approaches for understanding the pathogenesis of lung child birth defects using disease-specific iPSCs generated from children with lung birth defects."
"9312133","Birth asphyxia, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), accounts for an estimated 900 000 deaths each year and is one of the primary causes of early neonatal morbidity and mortality. Ventilation constitutes the critical step in resuscitation of asphyxiated newborns. Current neonatal resuscitation guidelines recommend initiating ventilation if required after 30 sec of initial steps. Early onset of ventilation may have beneficial effects. A sustained inflation breath may help in establishing adequate functional residual capacity and may improve physiological parameters quickly during resuscitation. Delaying cord clamping is now recommended for all preterm infants. WHO also supports delayed cord clamping in normal term infants, however its role in birth asphyxia has not been well studied. The need for resuscitation often prevents the practitioner from delaying cord clamping in this population. Establishing ventilation with an intact cord, prior to clamping, helps to stabilize cerebral and pulmonary blood flows in preterm lambs. Improving cerebral blood flow may be critical in asphyxia. In this proposal, we plan to study initiation of ventilation with an intact cord and delayed cord clamping together, in near term lambs asphyxiated by cord occlusion. It would theoretically combine the advantages of placental transfusion and prompt resuscitation. A randomized controlled trial evaluating SI or PPV prior to delayed cord clamping in asphyxiated human infants is ideal. However, ethical concerns about proper consent, and feasibility of real time measurements of cerebral oximetry, flow and pressure limit the ability to perform such a study. Relevance to current practice in neonatal resuscitation: Sustained Inflation and Positive Pressure Ventilation prior to delayed cord clamping is a simple intervention that does not require sophisticated equipment or training and could be performed by personnel in low resource settings as well. This study will provide critical insight into the optimal approach to cord management and ventilation and influence future recommendations for management of the asphyxiated human neonate at delivery."

"9310673","PROJECT SUMMARY  Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer among men. Although androgen deprivation has been a major therapy for advance PCa patients, it inevitably becomes ineffective once the cancer transforms to hormone resistant. In order to design better therapeutic strategies, intensive research effort has focused on the identification of novel molecular targets. It is known that the enhanced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is correlated with the progression, androgen independence and poor prognosis of PCa and thus, the signaling molecules involved in the regulation of this pathway have been thought to be suitable targets for therapeutic intervention. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the hyper-activation of Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in PCa remain poorly defined. Despite the fact that multiple genetic mutations have been identified in receptor tyrosine kinases, Ras, Raf and MEK which largely contribute to the elevated activation of the MAPK pathway in many types of malignancies, these mutations are infrequent in PCa patients. The goal of this application is to reveal oncogenic actions of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) via activating the MAPK pathway in PCa cells and explore ARF1-mediated signaling as a novel therapeutic target for prostate tumorigenesis. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated for the first time that ARF1 is a potent oncogene which significantly contributes to the elevated activation of the MAPK pathway and the progression of PCa. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that ARF1-mediated Golgi-associated activation of the MAPK pathway plays a crucial role in prostate tumorigenesis and targeting it will prevent PCa progression. There are three Specific Aims in the proposal. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that oncogenic G protein-coupled receptors activate ARF1 via the translocation of G?? subunits to the Golgi in PCa cells. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the Golgi apparatus spatially provides a platform upon which ARF1 activates the MAPK pathway via a direct interaction with Raf1 in PCa cells. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that ARF1 inhibitors effectively suppress prostate cancer progression. Overall, this project will reveal previously unrecognized functions of ARF1 in PCa biology and explore a novel means to inhibit the tumorigenesis of PCa by targeting ARF1-mediated Golgi-associated oncogenic signaling. These studies will directly impact the future development of effective therapy for PCa patients."
"9323464","The work proposed in Project 1 is based on the first observation that one can design short Catalytic AMyloid-forming Peptides (CAMPs) to catalyze chemical reactions with high efficiency in addition to their own self-assembly. The goals of the proposed work are: 1. to understand the mechanism of peptide self-assembly and how the resulting amyloid fibril tunes the properties of the metal ion for catalysis; 2. using 2D-IR, to establish structural models for the CAMPs to set important structural and functional reference points for the broad community of scientists interested in the role of amyloids in protein folding, catalysis and health. 3. to examine the ability of CAMPs to effectively utilize different metals to catalyze redox reactions. 4. to develop complex multidomain CAMPs with tunable structural features and degree of assembly. Development and characterization of catalytic amyloids will advance several fields of biomedical importance. The structure- activity relationships and structural insights generated in the proposed work will help us better understand the mechanisms of amyloid toxicity and will improve our knowledge of the structures adopted by more complex amyloid-forming proteins. In addition to its practical value this research program will have a profound impact on our understanding of the fundamental aspects of catalysis.  Project 2. The ability of pathogens to neutralize drugs via a newly developed catalytic activity is one of the mechanisms of drug resistance. Therefore, deeper understanding of the factors that determine the ability of proteins to catalyze new chemical transformations is of paramount importance. We aim to determine the factors that guide evolution of protein function at a molecular level and use these principles to create catalysts for chemical transformations not found in nature. Specifically, we will: 1. combine minimalist computational approach with sophisticated protein engineering tools to test the limits of protein evolvability; 2. create new protein catalysts for a number of different chemical transformations; 3. establish a new method to efficiently guide directed evolution.  Project 3 aims to develop a new environmentally insensitive fluorescent probe to study the mechanism of pore formation by antimicrobial peptides and to elucidate the mechanism of proton conductance by influenza A M2 and hepatitis C p7 ion channels. Specifically we will: 1. gain a thorough understanding of the fluorescence characteristics of AzAla, an unnatural amino acid that contains azulene; 2. develop efficient protocols for in vivo incorporation of AzAla into proteins; 3. use AzAla to determine the pKa values of the key proton-conducting histidine residues in M2 and p7.  "
"9323754","ABSTRACT The striking identification of select patients who were able to durably control HIV rebound after ART discontinuation in the ANRS Visconti cohort, or in cases such as the Mississippi baby, have highlighted the possibility of sustained HIV remission and provided the first proof of concept that HIV remission may be clinically achievable. In several of these cases, post-treatment control is characterized by the very low, but detectable presence of HIV infected cells implying that in at least some cases of viral remission, a balance may have been struck between HIV-1 and the host. The mechanism(s) by which these reservoirs are subject to sustained virologic remission or ultimately rebound, upon ART interruption is not understood. Moreover, there is no validated biomarker that can predict clinical outcome during a treatment interruption. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the factors that dictate HIV suppression or relapse, in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, is critical to develop approaches to therapeutically foster HIV-1 remission in ART-treated patients. Thus, we propose detailed studies to define the impact of early antiretroviral therapy on virologic and immunologic outcomes that are relevant to achieving HIV remission and durable virus control after the cessation of ART. These studies encompass multi-disciplinary collaborations, to have the greatest breadth of investigation, and ultimately the greatest scientific impact. Our proposed investigations include analytic studies in both HIV-infected adult and pediatric patients. We will also conduct parallel studies in non- human primates, including the pre-clinical evaluation of novel eradication therapeutics."
"9322616","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 10% of pregnancies now end in preterm birth. Many survivors face a lifetime of severe disabilities, and even those born only moderately early are at increased risk of consequences ranging from behavioral problems to chronic disease. Reducing both short- and long-term consequences of prematurity is thus critical to public health. However, too little is currently known about the etiology of disabling neonatal consequences of prematurity and about how preterm birth leads to lifelong behavioral and physical health problems. Our proposal addresses this barrier through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use computational methods to identify gene sets linking neonatal prematurity complications to later-onset disease. Significant and unexpected connections identified in this way generate testable hypotheses about the underlying causes of increased disease risks in individuals born preterm. For Aim 2, we will identify the molecular pathways leading to several neonatal prematurity complications, and we will assess previously-published theories about common causative pathways. In particular, we will determine whether there is a common inflammatory pathway or developmental deficiency leading to multiple complications. This will include developing a temporal profile of gene expression in preterm infants without complications and identifying any pathways where disrupted developmental profiles correlate with complications. Such patterns serve as further hypotheses whose causative role we can investigate. Finally, in Aim 3, we will experimentally test our new hypotheses by evaluating their ability to predict both short- and long-term outcomes. We will collect cord blood expression data from infants born at Tufts Medical Center, and we will assess the degree to which using the genes and pathways identified in Aims 1 and 2 improves our ability to predict outcomes for these infants during their hospital stays. To evaluate the connections with long-term outcomes proposed in Aim 1, we will assess the frequency of these consequences in children and adults born prematurely. The successful completion of this project will lead to better management of prematurity complications, to better understanding their long-term consequences, and potentially to new therapeutic approaches to prevent lifelong disabilities resulting from preterm birth."
"9521929","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this proposal is to identify potentially causal DNA methylation markers that driver breast cancer development. Aberrant DNA methylation plays an important role in breast cancer initiation and progression via inactivation of tumor suppressor genes and activation of oncogenes. Identifying causal epigenetic markers that drive breast cancer development remains a major challenge. Conventional approaches comparing DNA methylation profiles in tumor and adjacent non-tumorous tissue have shown that changes in DNA methylation contribute to deregulation of gene expression in breast cancer. However, such approaches are unable to distinguish causal DNA methylation alterations, which drive tumorigenesis, from reactive ones that are influenced by the tumor. In addition, important cancer-related methylation changes may have been missed when a suboptimal baseline control (adjacent non-tumorous tissue) was used in previous studies. We hypothesize that an individual's genetic susceptibility and environmental risk factors (e.g. diet, lifestyle) contribut to alterations in causal DNA methylation for breast cancer development, and that such causal changes have already taken place in normal breast tissue before tumor occurrence. To test this hypothesis, normal breast tissue from healthy women is required to prospectively assess the effects of these risk factors on DNA methylation. We propose an integrative genomic and epidemiological approach that combines the regulation of DNA methylation in normal breast tissue and differential DNA methylation profiling in tumor and normal breast tissue. Specifically, we will generate and integrate multiple layers of data on environmental exposures and genome-wide genomic variations (germline and tissue-specific DNA methylation variations). We will examine the impact of genetic and environmental regulation on DNA methylation in normal breast tissue, and determine the association of these epigenetic changes with breast cancer development and occurrence. Normal breast tissue from healthy women will be used as the most desirable baseline control in comparison with tumor, as well as the most desirable target tissue to identify changes in potentially causal DNA methylation markers before tumor occurrence. We are uniquely positioned to conduct the proposed research as we have ready access to unique normal breast tissue through the Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank at Indiana University Simon Cancer Center. This resource represents the only biorepository in the world for large numbers of epidemiologically annotated, optimally prepared normal breast tissue specimens (>3200) from healthy women in a wide range of ages and environmental exposures. This project will contribute significantly to our understanding of the key, early biological processes during breast cancer development, in particular the complex mechanisms among genetic variation, environmental and lifestyle risk factors, and epigenetic changes. It will lead t breakthroughs for breast cancer management in developing novel, more effective prevention and treatment strategies that specifically target causal DNA methylation markers."
"9310283","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes to continue study the immune factors that are important for the pathogenesis of newly characterized Th17 autoreactive T cells. In the previous funding period, we have made significant progress in investigating the mechanisms by which pathogenic Th17 (IL-17+) and Th1 (IFN-y+) autoreactive T cells cause autoimmune disease, and in studying whether the regulation of the pathogenic Th17 response differs from that of the Th1 response. Our studies demonstrated that increased Th17 responses rely on an enhanced d T cell response, raising the question whether manipulation of ?? T cell activation can prevent undesired Th17 responses. In studying factors that lead to ?? T cell activation, we found that adenosine is an important factor in tipping Th1 and Th17 autoreactive T cell generation in autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Adenosine significantly enhances Th17 responses via a pathway in which it enhances ?? T cell activation. Our preliminary results also showed that ?? T cells express greatly increased numbers of type A2 adenosine receptors (A2ARs) after activation and that this allows them to bind large amounts of adenosine; moreover, activated ?? T cells express decreased amounts of ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73), an enzyme critically involved in the generation of extracellular adenosine. The hypothesis of this application is that the dual effects of removal of adenosine by activated ?? T cells and the decreased ability of activated ?? T cells to express CD73, which decreases their ability to convert immunostimulatory ATP/AMP to immunosuppressive adenosine, lead to enhanced Th17 responses and autoimmune disease. We will exploit available knockout mice lacking A2ARs and determine whether the proinflammatory effect of ?? T cells on the Th17 response is limited if their ability to bind adenosine is reduced, whether selective A2AR agonists/antagonists can effectively manipulate Th17 responses, whether manipulation of the enzymatic function of CD73 is effective in controlling the Th17 response, and whether adenosine degradation enzyme (ADA) and ADA inhibitors are effective in manipulation of the regulatory activity of ?? T cells and thus Th17 response. The proposed studies will elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanism by which adenosine regulated autoimmune Th1 and Th17 responses. The continuation of this study and the clarification of the pathogenic role of, and relationship between, IFN-y+ and IL-17+ autoreactive T cells in EAU should contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of autoimmune disease pathogenesis."
"9311695","Project Summary The gastric electrical slow wave mediates neuromuscular interactions in the gastrointestinal syncytium that determine the functional status of peristalsis and digestion. Millions of patients present to gastroenterologists each year with functional GI disorders which are associated with gastric slow wave dysrhythmia. However, noninvasive methods for assessing this activity quantitatively remain elusive. Structural imaging provided by CT and ultrasound can be useful when functional disorders are associated with anatomical changes, but frequently, gastric disorders occur with no concomitant structural abnormality. Functional nausea (FN) is a GI disorder that affects millions of Americans, particularly adolescents, but diagnoses remain largely exclusionary relying on symptomology with an otherwise normal diagnostic workup. FN is important to study in adolescents because it is ubiquitous, chronic, tracks into adulthood and adversely affects the quality of life in patients, yet understanding the pathophysiology might allow interventions at a time of therapeutic plasticity. The ability to study FN is limited by the lack of an objective clinical test to characterize or measure nausea or to predict its response to treatment or exacerbating factors. Electrogastrography (EGG) is as a possible approach, but signal quality and limitations of volume conduction in the abdomen have previously limited its utility to the characterization of temporal dynamics. Our preliminary data show that blind source separation applied to the multichannel electrogastrogram (EGG) can characterize propagation of the gastric slow wave, and that the magnetogastrogram (MGG), which measures spatiotemporal properties of magnetic fields from the gastric slow wave, also allows characterization of the propagation of the gastric slow wave in addition to evaluation of its frequency and power distribution. Furthermore, these spatiotemporal characteristics change during hyperglycemia and functional disorders like gastroparesis. We propose to study how functional nausea in adolescents may be characterized noninvasively by the use of multichannel EGG and MGG recordings. Our main aims in this proposal are to develop a mathematical model of FN, correlate functional differences in slow waves with nausea in patients with FN using modeling and experimental approaches, and to characterize biophysical, clinical and psychosocial phenotypes of FN using EGG/MGG. We will investigate differences between standard four-channel EGG and multichannel EGG/MGG, assess changes in slow wave rhythm and propagation pattern from EGG and MGG with disease in FN patients, examine differences between EGG and MGG signatures of severe nausea in FN patients, and will determine how MGG/EGG slow wave rhythm and pattern abnormalities relate to psychological functioning and pharmacological intervention. The analysis of slow wave activity represents the first physiologically-quantifiable noninvasive assessment method for pathological processes associated with functional nausea in adolescents."
"9353892","Project Summary/Abstract Gene and cell therapies, especially for rare diseases, require complex product-specific development of pre- clinical studies, costly GMP manufacturing, unique laboratory assays for monitoring, and extraordinary regulatory management to initiate, perform and oversee clinical trials that provide initial assessments of safety and efficacy. Due to the rarity of many serious and life-threatening genetic diseases in the pediatric population, an increasing number of which may be curable using emerging gene and cell therapy approaches, a significant barrier to translation of these innovative therapies and future gene editing approaches is the limited number of institutions with infrastructure to carry out these developmental steps and the complex regulatory environment involving biologicals and early phase human studies in children. This is particularly true in pediatric rare genetic diseases where no one center cares for sufficient numbers of patients to successfully carry out robust prospective trials. This set of circumstances leads to significant problems: 1) families displaced from their jobs and support structures due to lengthy relocation to participate in trials centered at sites at significant distances from their homes; 2) decisions not to participate in trials due to the lack of financial and social structures created by these displacements; 3) slow accrual to trials in spite of eligible patients. Given the recent early successes of gene transfer methods and the expanding knowledge of the genetic basis of diseases, these novel therapeutic approaches may increasingly be sought by disease experts who lack detailed knowledge of the complex translational pathway involved. Many of these experts are in research/medical centers that have not developed the costly infrastructure to efficiently move the gene transfer research to the clinic, much less to develop a multi-site clinical trial likely to recruit adequate numbers of subjects. A second impediment to efficient translation of these highly regulated trials is the time required to navigate multiple regulatory structures, in particular, reviews by multiple Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) with little experience in the complexities of gene therapy trials. We propose to develop a network of pediatric centers with unique expertise and experience in translation of gene therapies. Our overall goal is to support investigators across multiple CTSAs to more rapidly translate complex gene therapies to early phase investigator-initiated pediatric clinical trials suitable for transfer to industry. The centers participating in this U01 would then be well positioned to apply for clinical trial funding and to enter into agreements with industry sponsors. The Disseminating Curative Biological Therapies for Rare Pediatric Diseases Collaborative Consortium will offer key services and expert advice in order to enhance enrollment on gene therapy clinical trials nationally."
"9273524","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses an important gap in our knowledge and understanding of the role of dendritic cells and innate immunity in immuno-metabolic dysfunction. Increasing evidence indicates that obesity and obesity-induced type 2 diabetes (T2D) is, in large part an inflammatory disorder mediated by both innate and adaptive immunity. At the cellular level, it is well recognized that inflammatory macrophages, designated as M1, play an important role in the low-grade inflammation in adipose tissue during the course of obesity and related metabolic complications including T2D. T lymphocytes, (CD4+, CD8+ and Foxp3+ Treg) and B cells are also found in the adipose tissue and the level of infiltration is correlated with the severity of obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Dendritic cells are central to linking innate and adaptive immune responses, responding through receptors that signal through MyD88, amongst others, to stimulate adaptive immune responses. These cells play a key role upstream of the adaptive immune T and B cells as well as interact with macrophages in early phases of the immune response. However, not much is known about the role of dendritic cells (DCs) in the immunopathogenesis of obesity and its complication T2D and the role of MyD88, an important adaptor protein that controls innate immunity in these metabolic disorders. The current application is designed to address this issue in both animal models of obesity and related T2D as well as patients with these disorders. This will be achieved by using a unique mouse model system of both gain-of-function and loss-of-function of MyD88 in DCs and the studies in patients with obesity and/or T2D who undergo gastric bypass surgery. Our study will be achieved by a close collaboration between the principal investigator, the co-PI and the collaborator, who are experienced investigators with the unique capacity to bridge basic and clinical science as well as the fields of immunobiology and diabetes/metabolism."
"9324711","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R01 project has investigated the adhesion mechanisms mediating progenitor homing to bone marrow (BM) and uncovered the role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in regulating homeostatic circadian and enforced release of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) from BM. We have identified Nestin+ cells as candidate niche cell that are regulated by SNS nerve fibers. In preliminary studies for this renewal application, we have developed a novel approach combining whole-mount imaging confocal immunofluorescence with computational analyses to assess significant associations between stromal BM structures and HSCs. We have uncovered distinct subsets of Nestin+ cells: the pericytic Nes-GFPbright NG2+ LepR- cells are exclusively associated with arterioles, whereas reticular Nes-GFPdim NG2- LepR+ cells are found near sinusoids. We have found that the most quiescent HSCs are significantly associated with arterioles whereas less quiescent HSCs are found away from arterioles. Further preliminary studies suggest that an HSC progeny, the megakaryocyte (Mk) can feed back to the HSC and regulate quiescence. In Aim 1, we will assess the differential functions of arteriolar and sinusoidal niches in HSC maintenance using conditional deletion of CXCL12 or SCF. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of the Mk niche in HSC maintenance, focusing on the chemokine CXCL4 as putative contributor, and explore the hypothesis that the Mk niche may represent a reserve for Mk-biased HSCs. Finally, we propose in Aim 3 to dissect further how neural signals link the brain and BM by addressing two different aspects of communication between neural signals and BM. In the first subaim, we will investigate using transgenic and optogenetic tools how the signals from SNS nerves which are tightly associated with arteriolar niche, can reach the sinusoidal niche which is not innervated. I the second subaim, we will explore how the brain communicates with BM to release HSCs based on our preliminary data implicating M1R signals originating from the brain. We will test the idea that a hormonal factor links the brain to the BM using parabiosis and candidate hormone analyses. These innovative studies will shed new insight into HSC regulation by the microenvironment."
"9234484","PROJECT SUMMARY  Rotavirus (RV) is the leading cause of life-threatening diarrheal disease in children under the age of 5, and  results in nearly half a million deaths annually, despite the use of two licensed RV vaccines. Although RV  vaccines are available, they do not work optimally in countries where they are needed most. Human  rotaviruses (HRVs) grow poorly in cultured cells and do not infect mice, which are only susceptible to animal  rotavirus infection. We do not understand how HRV infections cause life-threatening disease and question if  knowledge from existing animal models is fully applicable to HRVs. We pioneered establishing human  intestinal enteroids (HIEs) as novel ex vivo model ?mini-gut? systems to examine host-pathogen interactions  and pathophysiology. HIEs are self-organizing, 3-dimensional physiologically active, multicellular cultures that  mimic the ordered structure of the intestine. We have found that HRV strains replicate extremely well in HIEs  mimicking the host permissiveness observed in people, thus establishing a new model to study HRV infections  and pathogenesis. We propose studies to directly examine mechanisms of pathophysiology and genetic  control of HRV infection and growth. The recent discovery that cellular receptors used by HRV strains are  histoblood group antigens (HBGAs) resulted in a paradigm shift in thinking about the host's genetic influence  on RV infection and provides a new perspective on zoonotic transmission of rotaviruses. Unique differences in  HBGA expression may explain the higher prevalence of unusual HRV strains in Africa and lower vaccine  efficacy seen in distinct ethnic populations. We hypothesize that HRV infection of enteroids is genetically  restricted and permissive infection leads to novel intracellular and extracellular innate signaling and response  pathways that underlie HRV pathogenesis and pathophysiology. In addition, the outcome of HRV infection or  vaccination can be modulated by beneficial microbes. We propose studies in Aim 1 to determine whether  genetically-controlled modulators of susceptibility (HBGAs) and distinct innate responses in HIEs regulate HRV  infection and pathophysiology (with Cores B and C). Studies in Aim 2 will establish the effect of commensal or  pathogenic organisms on HRV or vaccine infection. These studies will elucidate the molecular basis for strain-  specific host range restriction observed in children of different ethnic groups and be relevant to understanding  vaccine properties. Furthermore, evaluation of modified HIE cultures that house human commensals,  probiotics or other pathogens (with Cores B, C and Project 2) in new tailored biomaterial platforms (with  Project 3) will lead to a better understanding of how epithelial responses to a viral infection are modulated.  Collectively, this work will provide a new understanding of rotavirus pathophysiology and the subsequent  critical adaptive responses in humans that trigger immunity and disease."
"9383491","Endothelial cells play an important role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by phenotypic and hemodynamic changes in blood vessels, is an early predictor of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. Chronic oxidant injury to the endothelium during aging leads to endothelial senescence and development of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, increasing the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Therefore, better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate vascular aging and inflammation, is essential for the control of cardiovascular disease. The endothelium plays a critical role in inflammation by controlling the expression of cytokines and adhesion molecules involved in attraction, adhesion and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Consistent with the systemic distribution of the vascular network, endothelial cells are a potential source of inflammatory mediators in aging and chronic-inflammatory diseases. Although the identity of pro-inflammatory molecules is well known, the mechanisms that control their expression are complex and multifactorial. Therefore, more studies are needed to identify cellular mediators as well as central molecules and pathways that regulate senescence pro-inflammatory response under normal aging and pathological conditions. Our long-term goal is to develop interventions to preserve endothelial homeostasis, thus preventing vascular inflammation and associated cardiovascular disease. Our goal with the proposed study is to understand how endothelial cMyc regulates vascular aging and inflammation. Recent work from our group have identified a novel role for the transcription factor cMyc as a potential regulator of vascular senescence and inflammation. Our preliminary studies indicate that cMyc expression declines in human endothelial cells undergoing replicative senescence, and that this phenomenon is associated with increased expression of inflammation markers. We performed gene expression profiling studies in mice overexpressing cMyc specifically in endothelial cell lineage and observed a reduction in the expression of the senescence marker p21 and pro-inflammatory mediators with aging in different organs. These findings support the central hypothesis that cMyc is an essential regulator of senescence-associated vascular inflammation. In Aim 1, we will determine how cMyc regulates vascular aging using wild-type and genetically engineered adult mice with conditional deletion of c-Myc specifically in endothelial lineage. In Aim 2, we will investigate the contribution of cMyc to vascular inflammation using the mouse model described in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will identify cMyc downstream target genes that play a role in vascular aging and inflammation. For the 3 aims proposed, results will be compared to commercially available endothelial cells from young and aged donors. Completion of these aims will define novel mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets that control vascular aging and inflammation."
"9321558","The Berlin patient who received allogeneic transplantation of bone marrow cells from an allogeneic donor who carried a mutation that rendered progeny cells resistant to HIV infection has shown that eradication of HIV is a realistic though difficult goal to reach. This strategy highlighted the positive impact of replacing the immune system of the infected host by cells that cannot be infected by HIV. Our group and others have used strategies less invasive than bone marrow transplantation to achieve the goal of replacing CD4 T cells that are susceptible to HIV infection by cells that are resistant to HIV infection. We have shown in single-arm studies that infusion of CCR5 modified autologous CD4 T cells leads to increased CD4 T cell numbers, down regulation of pro-inflammatory responses in cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems, and enhancement of HIV-specific T cell function; we showed in all subjects who received the modified cells a half log to 3 log10 decrease in total and integrated HIV DNA. This decline in HIV reservoir was associated with the expansion and long term persistence of a novel T cell subset (TSCM) that has features of stemness as these cells persisted for over 3 years and gave rise to progeny in all memory T cell subsets. Herein we propose a two arm double blinded controlled clinical trial designed to understand the role of ex vivo induced CCR5 modification (By Zn-finger nuclease) on the restoration of T cell homeostasis and function and the decay of HIV persistence in blood and lymphoid tissues . We will test the hypothesis that immune reconstitution with cells that are resistant to HIV infection results in a global improvement of immune homeostasis by downregulating the inflammation that drives immune senescence and triggers immune dysfunction and leads to the restoration of adaptive immunity that can control and eliminate residual HIV infected cells. One group of subjects (n=20) will be infused with CCR5 modified cells that are resistant to HIV infection while the other (n=10) will receive unmodified cells; both unmodified and modified cells will be expanded ex vivo using the same manufacturing procedures. In Aim 1 we will first test the hypothesis that subjects infused with CCR5-deleted cells will show dramatic decay of the replication competent HIV reservoir and then mechanistically confirm that this is related to CCR5 modification and not to ex vivo expansion alone by comparing this decay to changes in this reservoir seen in subjects infused with non-modified CD4 T cells. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that this decay in HIV reservoir will be a consequence of expansion and persistence of an HIV resistant stem-cell-like subset of T cells (TSCM). In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that CD4 TSCM will restore immune homeostasis by reducing the pro-inflammatory milieu that prevails in cART-treated HIV-infected subjects which will result (Aim 4) in the restoration of an immune function capable of eliminating the residual pool of cells infected with replication competent virus. State of the art molecular, virological and immunological assays will provide quantitative and qualitative assessment of the magnitude of the replication competent HIV reservoir and will also allow the identification of molecular mechanisms associated to restoration of innate and adaptive immune function. This clinical trial will show that restoration of T cell homeostasis and the ensuing replacement of latently infected cells by immune competent uninfected T cells will result in a significant decay in the HIV reservoir.  "
"9411413","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and depression present significant public health challenges for South Africa, a country with the largest HIV epidemic globally and where structural factors including vio- lence and poverty increase susceptibility for poor mental health. In families already experiencing psychological distress, adolescents face elevated risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and depres- sion. Preventive interventions are urgently needed during adolescence when risks for HIV, STIs, and depres- sion in-crease exponentially. Preventive intervention strategies for adolescents should substantively involve families who can tailor prevention content to meet the unique needs of individual adolescents and reinforce formation and habituation of prevention behaviors. Moreover, evidence indicates common family risk and pro- tective factors for adolescent HIV/STI risk behaviors and depression, underscoring the need for a family pre- vention approach. However, key gaps exist in family prevention science. In South Africa, few empirically sup- ported family interventions integrate prevention of HIV/STI with depression for adolescents. Our resilience-ori- ented approach engages families in adolescent prevention from low-resource settings facing high adversity. We focus on adolescents (14-16 years of age) who are at an ideal developmental transition for family engage- ment in prevention. Our age- and developmentally-tailored intervention ? called Our Family Our Future ? is based off of two empirically supported interventions that have been integrated and adapted to South Africa. In a pilot randomized trial, Our Family Our Future exhibited outstanding acceptability, feasibility and promising direction of effects including reductions of depressive symptoms; lower rates of sex; decreased unprotected sex; increased HIV testing; increased knowledge, motivation, intentions and self-efficacy for protective HIV/STI behaviors; improved family interactions; and increased resilience. Now we propose the next phase of this re- search program, an efficacy study of Our Family Our Future with three aims: (1) test the efficacy of the Our Family Our Future intervention in preventing HIV/STI acquisition among adolescents (14-16 years of age) with depressive symptoms by reducing HIV/STI risk behavior, and reducing depressive symptoms. The project will randomize N=880 adolescents to Our Family Our Future intervention or usual care with 6- and 12-month out- come assessments; (2) examine the extent to which the impact of the Our Family Our Future intervention is a) mediated by changes in resilience; behavioral skills; norms and attitudes relating to sex, condom use, gender; and family communication and functioning and b) moderated by the effect of sociodemographics, family HIV, and social protections; (3) identify barriers and facilitators to implementing Our Family Our Future within a large community-based organization setting with wide reach to provide data for future dissemination and scale-up. The study fills a significant gap in family prevention science in a priority population and setting and is aligned with the Trans-NIH Plan for HIV, NIMH, NIAID, and NICHD strategic research priorities. "
"9364958","Project Summary Although childhood obesity is a national health problem reaching epidemic proportions, Hispanic children are nearly twice as likely as non-Hispanic white children to be obese, and Mexican Americans have higher risk of obesity than other Hispanic subgroups. Weight-associated health problems are also increasing at alarming rates. If contemporary obesity prevalence rates persist, ?the current generation of children will be the first generation in US history to be sicker and die earlier than their parents? (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2012). Because the challenges of intervention are multiplied after a child has already reached obesity status, it is imperative to understand the processes of developing risk in the earliest years of life. The identification of risk and resiliency predictors of the development of obesity during critical formative years of childhood will provide specific targets amenable to preventive public health interventions. We propose to capitalize on longitudinal data collected by an NIMH and NICHD-funded study of very low income Mexican American mothers and infants (Las Madres Nuevas) that assesses a multitude of cultural and environmental risk and protective factors from the prenatal period through six years of age. We propose to leverage this existing longitudinal dataset, and collect physical health and markers of cardiometabolic risk at ages 7.5 and 9. In combination, we will: 1) Use advanced statistical procedures to chart trajectories of weight gain using objective measures of weight and growth measured at 13 time points from birth through age 9; 2) Identify critical periods from birth to age 9 at which children diverge from healthy weight gain trajectories; 3) Evaluate early life biological susceptibility as a moderator of the impact of environmental influences on child weight gain trajectories and obesity; 4) Evaluate the consequences of cultural, economic, maternal and child factors, and weight gain trajectories for emerging physical health and cardiometabolic risk. The proposed longitudinal study, with data drawn from biological measures, anthropometric measures, parent report, medical records, and observational sessions, is ideally situated to answer key questions related to weight disparities among low- income MA children, and delineate mechanistic pathways in the emergence of MA child obesity. Our scientific approach emphasizes the cultural embeddedness of obesity development, with the view that the reduction of child obesity disparities can best be accomplished by understanding sociocultural and economic forces that shape eating behavior and weight gain. This project holds great potential to address central questions about early life contributors to weight gain and obesity risk in a high risk ethnic group, and enhance opportunities for prevention of obesity and associated health problems."
"9333399","Summary Regular aerobic exercise with sufficient intensity can improve overall health, however daily energy expenditure is low in those with SCI, especially in those with high level lesions. We have developed Functional Electrical Stimulation Row Training (FESRT) that couples volitional arm and electrically controlled leg exercise, increasing the active muscle and resulting in benefits of large muscle mass exercise. Despite the potential for enhancing aerobic capacity, those with high level lesions (C4 to T2) have a remaining obstacle to attaining higher work capacities they have the greatest pulmonary muscle denervation and our preliminary work suggests this limits the aerobic capacity that can be achieved with FESRT. External ventilatory support could improve the ability to exercise train and hence enhance the adaptations to chronic exercise in high level SCI. Non invasive ventilation (NIV) during exercise training has been shown to improve gains in exercise capacity in those with similarly restrictive breathing. Therefore, we hypothesize that the use of NIV during FESRT will reduce ventilatory limits to exercise, leading to increased aerobic capacity in high level SCI. Our aims are to determine the magnitude of improvement in aerobic capacity and its relationship to increases in maximal cardiac output and arterio venous oxygen difference after 4 months of FESRT+NIV compared to FESRT+shamNIV. We have access to a large (N>70) and unique population of individuals with SCI who have been enrolled in FESRT for at least 6 months. Roughly half have SCI between C4 and T2. 30 individuals with high level SCI who have FES row trained for at least 6 months will be randomized to (continued) FESRT for 4 months with either NIV or sham NIV. Before and after training, we will assess maximal aerobic capacity, ventilation, cardiac output, and arterio venous oxygen difference. Based on our current data, we hypothesize that only those randomized to NIV will experience further increases in aerobic capacity and that these increases will relate to increased cardiac output and arterio venous oxygen difference. This Exploratory/Developmental Research project will determine feasibility and effectiveness of this approach to exercise and will lay the groundwork for a larger, controlled trial."
"9310378","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project attempts to develop novel molecules as allosteric anticoagulants of coagulation proteases, especially thrombin and factor XIa. The hypothesis is that targeting these proteases through allosteric disruption of their catalytic triad results in controlled inhibition, which is likely to not suffer from bleeding consequences. All current anticoagulants including the heparins, warfarin, dabigatran and rivaroxaban suffer from enhanced risk of bleeding. The past grant period resulted in two groups of highly promising inhibitors of thrombin and factor XIa. The thrombin inhibitors displayed regulatory features (maximal inhibition in the region of 50 - 75%), which is likely to maintain hemostasis, especially under prophylactic application. Likewise, factor XIa inhibitors are likely to be devoid of bleeding because of the inherent mechanism of action of factor XIa, which is its action on the thrombotic process while leaving hemostatic process intact. In addition, the allosteric inhibitors are predicted to possess a higher specificity of action, which would reduce off target effects. Thus, the two groups of inhibitors are predicted to lead to a safer anticoagulant therapy. In fact, we have found that one of our designed molecules showed marked anticoagulant activities in FeCl3-induced thrombosis in the carotid artery mouse model without affecting bleeding time supporting the hypothesis. In this grant period, we intend to I) design more potent, selective regulators of human thrombin; II) develop more potent, selective inhibitors of human factor XIa and III) perform pre-clinical studies on promising advanced thrombin regulators and FXIa inhibitors."
"9334622","Abstract In vertebrates neural tube closure transforms the initially flat neuroepithelium into a closed, hollow tube that will give rise to the brain and spinal cord. Defects in this process are among the most common human birth defects, occurring in ~1:2000 pregnancies, and approximately half of these closure defects occur in the presumptive cranial region. However, we know very little about the cellular mechanisms that drive cranial closure, or how they are perturbed in mutants that fail at this process. Therefore, I propose to use a combination of imaging approaches coupled to quantitative cell wise computational analysis to characterize the cell behaviors, including apical constriction and cell proliferation, that drive cranial neural tube closure in the mouse model. Subsequently, I will examine how the cell behavioral profile is altered upon loss of cilia-mediated signaling thorough the Hedgehog pathway, which has been shown to lead to cranial closure defects. Finally, I will use transcriptomic approaches to parse the signaling pathways leading from cilia to cell behavior. Together, these experiments represent a significant advance in our understanding of the control of cell behaviors in cranial neural tube closure, a key concern in human development."
"9381160","The bacterium Vibrio cholerae causes cholera, a devastating diarrhea disease that affects millions of people worldwide each year. Cholera is endemic in many areas that suffer from poor sanitation, and imposes an immense burden in terms of mortality and illness, often on those countries least able to afford it. Despite advances in understanding how V. cholerae causes disease, there is still a lack of mechanisms to prevent the spread of cholera. Our previous studies have found that specific configurations of the gut microbiome, or the community of resident bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of all humans, mediate susceptibility to V. cholerae infection. We hypothesize that individual differences in commensal microbes may be a risk factor for cholera. This proposal aims to determine the relationship between the structure of the gut microbiome and the ability of V. cholerae to colonize and cause disease. Studies of pathogen-microbiome interactions are limited by a lack of suitable animal models, a problem that is particularly acute for cholera research, as the behavior of the pathogen differs between many animal models and humans, while other models are limited by cost and availability. We have begun to adapt a popular and readily accessible animal model of V. cholerae pathogenesis, the suckling mouse model, to allow for the establishment of human microbiomes prior to infection. Using these and gnotobiotic adult colonization models, we will determine how human gut microbiomes drive the biochemical milieu of the gut into pathogen-resistant or susceptible states. These mechanisms may determine the establishment and composition of the adult gut microbial community, and thus determine personalized infectious disease risk. These studies will improve the accessibility of models for studying how gut microbiomes influence bacterial infections of the gut, and identify new targets for prophylactic and therapeutic manipulations of the gut microbiome to combat V. cholerae."
"9347208","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a devastating illness that has substantial costs to Veterans, their families, and society. Although effective individual treatments for PTSD exist, high rates of treatment dropout and generally sub-optimal response rates remain common. Incorporating family members in treatment represents one potential avenue for improving outcomes, but existing family-inclusive treatments for PTSD are lengthy and burdensome to families and clinicians. To address this critical limitation, the applicant proposes a pilot effectiveness trial of a brief family intervention (BFI), to be delivered as an adjunct to Veterans? individual PTSD treatment. The two-session BFI protocol, which has been previously tested and found to be efficacious with family members of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, focuses on two primary family behaviors: increasing active support for treatment and reducing PTSD symptom accommodation, or family members? attempts to modify their own behavior or the environment in order to reduce Veterans? distress. Although often well-intentioned, accommodation directly conflicts with the goal of emotional exposure, a core target of current gold-standard PTSD treatments; effectively reducing accommodation therefore holds the potential to increase the ?dose? of treatment.  In the proposed study, the BFI will be modified to increase its relevance to PTSD and will then be tested via a randomized controlled trial among family members of Veterans who are beginning a course of either PE or CPT. We propose that the BFI will exert its effects by reducing family member accommodation and increasing family members? active support for treatment (e.g., assisting with transportation to appointments or providing verbal encouragement); we further propose that these changes in family members will result in increased treatment engagement by patients and increased levels of ?exposure opportunities? (experiences of tolerating strong emotions in daily life).  Our primary measures of the BFI?s effectiveness will be PTSD symptoms and treatment engagement among those Veterans whose family members receive it, compared to Veterans whose family members do not receive the BFI. PTSD symptoms will be assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), and treatment engagement will be assessed using an existing measure of homework completion and a report of sessions attended, both to be completed by the treating clinician. We will use ecological momentary assessment, an advanced assessment strategy that allows for real-time data capture via smartphones, to explore the hypothesized mechanisms of the BFI?s effects in both family members and Veterans. We will also collect qualitative and quantitative pre-implementation data to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the BFI in a routine-care setting when delivered by trained usual care clinicians. These clinicians will be trained by the PI, who is the developer of the BFI, to deliver the intervention, and their feedback (along with that of the Veteran and family member participants) will allow for iterative revisions to the protocol in order to enhance its fit within this novel system and population.  This study addresses an important public health concern by examining the effectiveness of a brief family intervention for the treatment of PTSD in a typical VA clinical setting. No such brief family-inclusive treatment for PTSD currently exists, either within or outside of the VA. Furthermore, the proposed research aims will complement a comprehensive training plan to prepare the applicant to become an independent investigator with expertise in mechanisms-based research design, along with advanced assessment and analytic approaches for future family-focused PTSD research. Results from the study will provide important information about whether or not this efficacious treatment can be effective and ready for further implementation efforts in routine-care settings."
"9365602","Project Summary. Most neuropsychiatric disorders have developmental origins. Such developmental vulnerability is often restricted to sensitive periods, but affected behaviors, modulating factors, and underlying mechanisms are scarcely understood. We have identified an early postnatal 5-HT-sensitive period in mice that affects adult anxiety/depression-related behaviors and cognitive function. Altered adult behaviors are associated with reduced 5-HTergic activity in this mouse model, but it remains unknown if a causal relationship exists. In wildtype mice, it is well established that 5-HT signaling modulates anxiety and depression-related behaviors and cognitive function. But also here, mechanistic insight at the level of 5-HTergic circuitry remains superficial. Hence, in the context of understanding normal brain function as well as developmental vulnerability, we view it as critical to understand the role of 5-HT input into postsynaptic circuits and its relationship with behavior. We furthermore believe that such insight into circuit function is needed to improve diagnosis and treatment strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders. Our proposal focuses on studying 5-HTergic input into the hippocampus. We study the hippocampus, because it receives dense 5-HTergic innervation from raphé nuclei, and it mediates and modulates emotional behaviors and cognitive function. Through optogenetics and in vivo calcium-photometry, we will directly investigate the relationship between 5-HTergic neurotransmission in CA1 and spatial memory and anxiety. We focus on CA1, because it is the converging point and the output region of the direct and indirect pathway within the hippocampus. We study the dorsal and ventral CA1 separately, because of their hypothesized differential role in cognitive and emotional function.  Our research will impact the understanding of the pathophysiology in depression/anxiety and cognitive impairment. Importantly our research will likewise impact our understanding of how to treat these same conditions. Our preliminary data suggest that increased 5-HTergic signaling during development leads to reduced 5-HTergic neuronal activity in adulthood, which in turn causes behavioral inhibition/anxiety and cognitive impairment. Conversely, increasing 5-HTergic activity through optogenetic means reverses at least some cognitive impairment. These findings already indicate that the firing rate of 5-HTergic neurons might be a promising biological target for the treatment of anxiety and depression related symptomatology. We already identified the 5-HT receptor within the hippocampus that relays the 5-HTergic signal to the postsynaptic circuitry to improve learning and memory. This receptor might be an interesting molecular target for drug development. Clearly, more research is needed to increase confidence in such ideas. However, we believe these examples provide strong evidence that the novel insight our studies will provide could in fact lead to improved diagnosis, prevention and treatment strategies in psychiatry."
"9332317","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The quest for a prophylactic AIDS vaccine is ongoing and it is probable that the successful vaccine must elicit protective antibody responses. Regardless of the mechanism of antibody-mediated protection, antibody persistence and appropriate T cell help are emerging as significant problems in AIDS vaccine development. The problem of antibody persistence is seen clearly in the RV144 trial. Protection was as highest in the first year but waned rapidly to background in parallel with anti-V2 antibodies that were associated with reduced risk of infection. Poor antibody persistence is not unique to RV144. It occurred in the VAX003/VAX004 efficacy trials, also using gp120 immunogens, and it has been observed repeatedly in gp120 vaccine trials in humans and non-human primates. Poor antibody persistence to gp120 is entwined with a second major problem. How to elicit necessary CD4+ T cell help without establishing fertile fields for increased HIV replication at sites of exposure, blunting protection, or increasing acquisition. It appears that vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cell and innate immune responses are associated with increased acquisition in the Step/Phambili trials that used an Ad5Hu- HIV T-cell vaccine as the immunogen. There are reports of vaccine-associated increased acquisition in non- human primate (NHP) models using other vectors and immunogens in addition to AdHu5. Taken together, the conjoint problems of antibody persistence and T cell balance must be solved for any antibody-based HIV vaccine to be effective. This requirement introduces a new concept for HIV vaccine development based on achieving balanced T cell and humoral responses, contrasting sharply with current approaches that focus on one arm or the other, or that seek to maximize both arms in parallel. Exploration of this concept forms the foundation of the proposed program that will test the central hypothesis that an HIV vaccine candidate can elicit durable antibody responses supported by a balanced CD4+ T cell profile that favors protection. This hypothesis is based on published work from the investigators and on solid preliminary data in RM models. This hypothesis will be tested via three highly interactive projects. Dr. Robert C. Gallo (IHV) will lead the program. Dr. Anthony L. DeVico (IHV) will lead Project 1 that exploits DNA/Protein co-immunization protocols to test hypotheses regarding the disposition of plasma cell subsets and how they determine the unusually poor durability of anti-gp120 antibody responses. Dr. George K. Lewis (IHV) will lead Project 2 to determine how vaccine elicited CD4+ T cells attenuate antibody-mediated protection. Dr. Guido Silvestri (Emory) will lead Project 3 to determine the phenotypes of vaccine-elicited CD4+ T cells and innate immune signatures that favor durable protection. In terms of major outcomes, this work is expected to fully identify the mechanism of poor anti-Env antibody persistence and to overcome this problem while maintaining safe levels of CD4+ T cells that don't blunt protection. These results are expected to fundamentally advance AIDS vaccine development for which broad durable protection is the Holy Grail."
"9329302","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) emerged as a significant public health threat in the 1990s and has now reached epidemic proportions. Despite advances in the medical treatment of HF, patients with HF face frequent hospitalizations for acute exacerbations. Inadequate self-care strategies, in particular non-adherence to a sodium restricted diet (SRD), are a main cause of these hospitalizations. Prior interventions to increase adherence have focused on increasing knowledge about restricting sodium in the diet have met with limited success. Unaddressed by these interventions are the major barriers of measuring and tracking daily sodium intake, family members who continue to eat high sodium diets, and a preference for salty foods-particularly in the elderly who have a decreased sense of taste. It is possible to retrain the taste buds to enjoy low salt foods by gradually reducing the amount of sodium in foods over the course of 16 weeks. This retraining works best with direct involvement and support from family members. The Family Sodium Watcher Program (Family Swap) proposed in this study incorporates the use of a unique electronic salt monitoring device that easily measures salt content in food-the major source of sodium. The intervention is designed to improve adherence to a SRDby both patients and family caregivers through education and strategies for gradual taste adaptation to low salt foods. The purpose of this 2-group randomized, controlled, repeated measures (baseline, 4-month, and 12-month) study is to examine effects of Family Swap on adherence (24-hour urine sodium excretion) to a SRD; knowledge, attitudes, and barriers about SRD; perceived control and perceived social support (in patient- caregiver dyads); caregiving burden (in caregivers only); and symptom distress and hospitalizations (in patients only). We will enroll a total of 220 patient-caregiver dyads. Dyads will be stratified as adherent and non-adherent using baseline patients' 24-hour urine sodium excretion (cut point = 3000 mg) and then randomly assigned to Family Swap intervention group or a usual care control group. The Family Swap intervention (6 weekly 45-minute sessions followed by 5 bi-weekly booster sessions) will be delivered remotely using a video- conferencing program on an iPad tablet. Patient-caregiver dyads will complete questionnaires (knowledge, attitudes, and barriers about diet; symptoms distress; perceived control; perceived social support; caregiving burden; and quality of life) and collect a 24-hour urine for sodium excretion at each assessment. Data will be analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA, Cox regression, and an innovative actor-partner interdependence model dyadic analysis for longitudinal data. This dyadic intervention study will provide rich data on the complex, interpersonal relationships within patient-caregiver dyads that affect adherence and health outcomes in patients with HF and family caregivers. Given the recommendation that all individuals should consume a sodium restricted diet, the intervention has the potential for expanded application beyond patients who need to follow a sodium restricted diet for cardiovascular reasons to everyone consuming a diet high in sodium."
"9357708","Project Summary/Abstract Cancer affects not only those with the disease, but also their family members. Family caregivers are known to have compromised health, as the detrimental impact of patients' cancer on their caregivers is substantial. Studies have documented the patient's distress relates to the caregiver's poorer health and vice versa, suggesting that cancer caregivers' health is an interpersonal, dyadic problem. Unknown are when and how the dyadic, cross-over effects occur. Stress regulation among cancer caregivers and their patients is interdependent, as is the caregiver-patient relationship itself. This dyadic stress regulation occurs when members of a dyad mutually calm each other's stress reactions and dampen negative affect and physiological arousal (coregulation) or mutually increasing those outcomes (coagitation). We propose that greater stress coregulation protects against adverse health outcomes, whereas greater stress coagitation exacerbates them. This project will examine dyadic stress regulation between cancer caregivers and their patients, and test coregulation and coagitation as predictors of health outcomes. Coregulation/coagitation will be quantified by cardiovascular (heart rate variability: HRV), neuroendocrine (salivary cortisol), and self-reported affective reactivity and regulation, in response to a standardized stress situation that is relevant both to health and to close relationships. We will then examine prospectively the extent to which the indicators of coregulation for this discrete stressor relate to daily outcomes (mood, diurnal cortisol, and sleep) and interim health outcomes (depressive symptoms, resting HRV, and healthcare visits), and the degree to which gender moderates such effects. A total of 120 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (60 male and 60 female) and their heterosexual caregiver (120 dyads) will participate. Understanding underlying biological and psycholgoical mechanisms is critical for identifying cancer caregivers and their patients who are at most risk for poor health due to their mutual stress regulation patterns. Findings of this project will be readily translated to development of novel interventions pertaining to effective and mutual management of stress in daily life and dyadic influences on health promotion. Those interventions will aim helping one another to better modulate and manage stress and optimizing beneficial effects of coregulation of cancer-related stress on better health. These tailored-and-targeted interventions will help caregivers identify when and how they should engage in stress self-management in the context of illness trajectory of their relative with cancer. They will also aim at reducing premature morbidity and mortality, particularly related to dysregulated cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and immunologic systems, and psychological distress, among persons touched by cancer and other chronic illness, thereby improving public health."
"9382509","We will determine how the lipid bilayer organizes around membrane proteins to regulate vital biological functions, including signal transduction and molecular transport. Many lipids and membrane proteins associate to form platforms called lipid rafts, which are phase-separated from the surrounding membrane. The dynamic structure and functional importance of these intermediate-sized (5-200 nm), non-crystalline assemblies are difficult to characterize. Many pathogenic bacteria organize lipid rafts which can increase virulence and antibiotic resistance. In humans, rafts form to facilitate multiple signaling processes. These processes are, in turn, involved in the pathogenesis of diseases, including Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s, and heart disease. Atomic- resolution dynamic structural details of these assemblies will broaden our understanding of signaling processes and inform disease etiology. We will confront this problem using solid-state NMR (SSNMR) and functional assays in proteoliposomes and biological membranes. Our research program is built around three thematic thrusts: (1) To understand how the lipid environment regulates membrane proteins site-specifically. (2) To determine how membrane proteins, in turn, order their environment. (3) To determine the degree of long-range order and dynamic timescales of these membrane assemblies. Our first target is the KirBac1.1 prokaryotic inward-rectifier K+ (Kir) channel and an array of functional lipids, including synthetic lipids and biological lipid extracts, known to associate with rafts. KirBac1.1 shares many behaviors with eukaryotic Kir channels. It is activated by anionic lipids (especially cardiolipin) and has a high affinity for saturated lipids, cholesterol, and other lipid microdomain-forming components (including hopanoids from the native organism Burkholderia Pseudomallei). The shared regulatory and structural features between KirBac1.1 and eukaryotic Kir channels have inspired several topics of interest: (a) How does the lipid cardiolipin maximally activate KirBac1.1 and trigger transmembrane allostery? Cardiolipin is an essential functional lipid throughout nature, and understanding membrane allostery will inform not only the mechanism of K+ conductance, but the means of transmembrane communications. (b) What is the locus and mechanism of cholesterol/hopanoid induced channel activation? Understanding this is key to determining both how sterols regulate proteins and how they contribute to bilayer organization. (c) How do functional lipid binding sites nucleate rafts? Cardiolipin, cholesterol, and hopanoids are all associated with modulating protein activity and membrane organization; our aim is to understand how they create protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions in this process. (d) How does the organization of the annular/nonannular lipid shell act as a secondary regulator of membrane proteins? Kir channels are inactivated by cholesterol, but have a high affinity for rafts. How do cellular membranes organize such that Kir channels can be in rafts, yet retain activity? (e) What is the long-range order and lifetime of these assemblies? It is still unknown if these assemblies persist on the timescale of signaling processes."
"9384887","Project Summary A wealth of data over the past few years, from our lab and others, has demonstrated that the mitochondrial morphology of tumor cells is distinct from normal cells. Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the machinery that regulates mitochondrial morphology can impact a variety of tumorigenic processes. Indeed, in work performed for the parent grant of this proposal, we have shown that genetic inhibition of the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1 can block pancreatic tumor growth and increase survival in a genetically engineered mouse model. This work has led to the deeper question of how changes in mitochondrial shape, which ultimately result from a combination of both genetic and environmental influences, contribute to the physiological processes that drive tumor growth. This question has been difficult to ask using traditional genetic and pharmacological approaches due to the complexity of the signaling pathways that converge on the mitochondria and the inherent heterogeneity present within the tumor and its surrounding stroma. To that end, we have developed a new software package designed to catalogue the morphological features of mitochondria within cells in culture or in fixed tissue. By using this software to analyze the tumor cells developed in our mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we propose to determine the relationship between specific mitochondrial features and key physiological attributes of these tumors. To do this, we have developed a machine learning technique, validated against a panel of tumor derived pancreatic cell lines with genetically-induced mitochondrial heterogeneity, capable of identifying relationships between mitochondrial features, or combinations of mitochondrial features, and other attributes of those cells. This approach will allow us to leverage the wealth of phenotypic data we have collected from our tumors with the data we are now able to collect on the mitochondrial heterogeneity, either between or within those tumors, in order to identify the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in tumor growth, regardless of whether that heterogeneity arises from manipulation of the mitochondrial dynamics machinery or whether it arises from the myriad influences within the tumor environment. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical insights into the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in pancreatic tumor growth and also pave the way for future analysis of mitochondrial heterogeneity in other tumor types."
"9222052","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies by others, our published and ongoing studies in human and MS tissue and mouse models have characterized the importance of growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) signaling and members of the Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) during inflammatory demyelinating disease and recovery (1-21,41). The maintenance of a Gas6 reservoir in multiple cell types and organs is dependent on the simultaneous expression on the cell surface of receptor tyrosine kinase Axl demonstrated to aid in the resolution of inflammation in tissue (12,18). Immunohistochemical detection of Gas6 in multiple tissues sections including spleen, small intestine, liver and lung from wild-type (WT), Mertk?/? and Tyro3?/? mice was positive. By contrast, Gas6 was lost in these same tissues from Axl-/? mice, and Gas6 did not accumulate in serum. As Gas6 is the sole ligand for Axl, the data suggest that Axl and Gas6 are co-dependent (18). This is a unique role for a ligand/receptor interaction, and thus is integral for understanding Gas6/Axl downstream signaling. Shown in Figure 1 is a model proposed by Zagorska et al. (18) in which following proinflammatory stimuli, Axl is increased resulting in Axl-dependent phagocytosis and resolution of inflammation that results in shedding of Axl from the cell surface (soluble Axl). They further suggest that Mertk is more involved in homeostatic phagocytosis of circadian tolerogenic macrophages during the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. In vivo intravenous (IV) injection of activating anti-Axl to mice found spleen Axl kinase activity was activated 15 min later, with Axl activity back to baseline 24h later; no change in Mertk was detected. IgG had no effect activating Axl or Mertk. Similar results were observed with a Mertk activating antibody (R&D) with activated Mertk detected after 1h in vivo; however, Mertk remained at the membrane and no soluble Mertk was detected (18). Our findings (7,11,12) support and validate the proposed Model. The rationale for studying the beneficial effect of Axl and Mertk antibodies administered during myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)- induced experimental autoimmune encephalopathy (EAE) is due to their longer half-life in vivo versus the short half-life of Gas6. Even with its short half-life we observe beneficial effects of icv administration of Gas6 during cuprizone toxicity and MOG-induced (11, 41, see enclosed manuscript). Whether in vivo treatment with activating Axl antibody or Mertk antibody can be anti-inflammatory and beneficial during EAE aiding in the clearance of apoptotic debris and protective to the CNS will be a focus of this study. There is evidence for antibodies crossing the BBB in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (22-26). Figure 1: Model for proposed differences in regulation and action of Axl and Mertk (Mer in figure) in inflammatory and homeostatic environments respectively (18). Specific Aim 1 will determine the best route of antibody administration using IP and icv injections to administer either IgG or activating anti-Axl antibody during MOG-induced EAE and PLP-induced EAE to WT mice. We predict that WT mice (n=5/group) receiving anti-Axl antibody will have a less severe disease course with reduced proinflammatory cytokines and fewer axonal spheroids than IgG. We will demonstrate specificity using Axl-/- mice and predict the clinical course will be worse than WT mice treated with IgG and thus not be beneficial. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether prior to the onset clinical scores a single IP injection of activating or inhibiting Mertk antibody can beneficially ater the EAE clinical course relative to IgG and PBS, and maintain the reduced clinical scores and preserve axonal integrity that is lost during chronic EAE. These studies will further characterize the role of Axl and Mertk during EAE using activating antibodies as a possible therapeutic approach to target proinflammatory signaling molecules. This more refined approach will target two of the TAMs since Gas6 activates all three TAMs with a relative affinity of Gas6 for its receptors Axl>Tyro3>Mertk. We will not study Tyro3 as there is no evidence Tyro3 changes during inflammation, EAE or in MS lesions. This more focused approach may provide neuroprotection against axonal damage and loss found in chronic MS CNS tissue, and perhaps is beneficial as a therapy for individuals with progressive MS."

"9399623","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis affects more than 200 million people worldwide. Therapeutic approaches to osteoporotic bone loss have focused on either anabolic or antiresorptive agents. However, there is a pressing need to develop new agents that target both bone formation and resorption. NELL-1 is a potent pro-osteogenic protein most studied for its local bone forming effects. Preliminary studies have suggested that NELL-1 also exerts a systemic, protective function against osteoporotic bone loss via modulating both osteoblast and osteoclast activity. These cellular effects of NELL-1 appear to occur in large part via activation of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Excitingly, we have recently identified the presence of two NELL-1 isoforms (NELL-1570 and NELL-1810) - of which the former demonstrates significantly greater bone forming effects. This has led to our central hypothesis that NELL-1 is a promising systemic therapeutic agent for osteoporosis with ability to (1) effectively reverse osteoporotic bone loss, and (2) regulate bone homeostasis by regulating osteoblast (OB) and osteoclast (OC) differentiation and activity via Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Furthermore, we anticipate that the shor isoform of NELL-1 (NELL-1570) will demonstrate more potent in vivo anabolic effects. We will test these hypotheses in two specific aims: AIM 1: Compare NELL-1570 and NELL-1810 for the systemic treatment of OVX-induced osteoporosis in mice. Our preliminary data show that systemic rNELL-1 (NELL-1810) reverses OVX-induced bone loss in mice. However, accumulating evidence suggests that NELL-1570 has significantly more potent effects on osteoprogenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. AIM 1 will directly compare systemic administration of NELL-1810 and NELL-1570. Through radiologic, histologic, histomorphometric and biomechanical analyses, we will examine bone density, formation, turnover and strength.  AIM 2: Compare the isolated cellular effects of NELL-1570 and NELL-1810 on OB/OC progenitor cells and OB/OC activity. In parallel, AIM 2 will evaluate systemic rNELL-1 effects on the number and activity of stem cells, OB and OC cells, as well as Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Cells will be isolated from animals after systemic treatment with NELL-1570 or NELL-1810, and examined by flow cytometry, proliferation and differentiation assays.  Novel rNELL-1 based therapies can improve the current standard of care for the treatment of osteoporosis, and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures that cost $25 billion annually. As well, improved basic biological understanding of rNELL-1 regulation of Wnt signaling may lead to future therapies for other disease entities characterized by deregulated Wnt signaling."

"9337239","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principal aim of this proposed pre-doctoral National Research Service Award (NRSA) application is to support the applicant's career goal of becoming an independent investigator leading a program of research to understand the genetic and environmental etiology of alcohol misuse and its intersection with internalizing (mood, anxiety disorders) and externalizing (antisocial behavior, illicit drug use) psychopathology. This aim will be achieved through the applicant's three-fold training goals: 1) obtaining phenotypic expertise in alcohol misuse (and related outcomes); 2) developing methodological skills to elucidate the complex nature of alcohol misuse and the internalizing and externalizing pathways leading to it; and 3) cultivating career and professional development skills. The proposed training plan centers on developing the applicant's scientific abilities through individualized mentorship, coursework, advanced statistical training, dissemination activities, and, principally, a statistical and molecular genetic study of alcohol misuse. Alcohol misuse, including binge drinking and pathological use, is widespread among college students, and it is associated with many negative public health outcomes. Despite substantial efforts, researchers have not been able to unequivocally elucidate the genetic and environmental factors underlying alcohol misuse. One explanation for this difficulty is that the phenotypic and underlying genetic architecture of alcohol misuse is heterogeneous - that is, alcohol misuse is not driven by a single set of genetic or environmental causes, but there may be many distinct sets of risk factors contributing to alcohol misuse that differ greatly between individuals. Motives for drinking (e.g. drinking to relieve negative emotions versus drinking to enhance positive emotions) have strong empirical associations with alcohol use behaviors and present a clear mechanism by which divergent genetic and environmental pathways may influence alcohol misuse. Negative and positive reinforcement drinking motives are related, respectively, to neuroticism and impulsivity, and mirror the schema of a prominent typology that categorizes internalizing versus externalizing alcoholics. The primary aim of this proposal is to utilize drinking motives to reduce phenotypic complexity and thereby investigate genetic and environmental factors contributing to diverging pathways to alcohol misuse, which we hypothesize correspond to internalizing and externalizing subtypes. To do this, we take advantage of data from a large (N = 9,890), longitudinal, prospective study of college students involving collection of both DNA samples and self-reported phenotypic data. This study design allows for investigation of biological, psychological, and social aspects of alcohol misuse across an important developmental period. There is a critical need to understand the diverse pathways that can lead individuals to risky or pathological alcohol use in order to alleviate the associated costly and harmful consequences."
"9383519","PROJECT SUMMARY Increasing the use of formal care around the time of birth is seen as a key strategy for improving maternal and child health. Yet, worldwide, about 60 million births annually take place outside of health institutions. The majority of these births take place at home, assisted by informal birth attendants, relatives, and in some cases no one. In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the two regions that account for 86% and 75% of maternal and newborn deaths, only 43 percent and 42 percent of women, respectively, deliver in a health facility compared to 99% in Europe and North America. It has been estimated that increasing the use of skilled care during childbirth could prevent up to 1.5 million maternal and newborn deaths and stillbirths by 2025. Conditional cash transfer programs, in which women receive cash payments conditioned on the use of maternal health services, are increasingly being used as a mechanism to increase deliveries in health facilities in low and middle-income countries. In this randomized controlled trial, we study the effectiveness of a cash transfer scheme that targets higher-risk women. Though CCT (and other demand-side) programs are popular, there is growing recognition that investments will need to be made on the supply-side in order to realize the full potential of programs that incentivize households to use services. Many studies document the existence of supply-side constraints and there is evidence that these may constitute important barriers to use of delivery care and improvement in health outcomes. In this study, we randomly assign selected primary health care clinics to receive discretionary cash grants and study the impact on service delivery, utilization, and health outcomes."
"9224486","Summary/Abstract The proposed research seeks to examine differences in children?s aggressive behavior problems (ABP) following a change in family composition (e.g., divorce), what explains these differences, and whether these explanations differ by marital status. ABP in children, such as picking fights, are of increasing concern to practitioners and researchers because when ABP persist past the toddler years, children have more difficulty learning in school, forming long- lasting friendships, and maintaining employment later in life. There is correlational research that suggests that family composition is associated with children?s aggressive behaviors; nonmarital and unstable families (e.g., who have had a change in family composition) tend to have children with more aggressive behavior problems than married, stable families. However, questions remain about the mechanisms behind this association that might account for variability in children?s outcomes and across studies. To address this gap, we propose a study with the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing data. Using a structural equation model framework, we will test whether changes in family functioning (co-parenting support, father involvement) and economic stress (income, perceptions of economic hardship) explain why changes in family composition are associated with changes in aggressive behavior, and whether there are group differences by marital status. Understanding the consequences of changes in family composition and possible points of intervention will improve program efforts and child wellbeing. One ultimate goal of healthy marriage/relationship and responsible fatherhood programming is to help couples become more stable ? both financially and in terms of their relationships ? to ultimately improve child wellbeing. Thus, studies that seek to understand the healthy relationship and responsible fatherhood associations with economic stability, family functioning, and child wellbeing help address these important public health concerns."
"9234576","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) is a rare genetic disorder caused by heterozygous inactivating mutations in GNAS, the gene encoding the ? chain of Gs (G?s), and is associated with short stature, brachydactyly, subcutaneous ossifications, and cognitive deficits. AHO patients with GNAS mutations on maternally inherited alleles manifest resistance to multiple hormones (e.g. PTH, TSH, LH, FSH, GHRH) as well as obesity, a variant termed pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP1a), due to paternal imprinting of G?s transcripts in specific tissues. AHO patients with GNAS mutations on paternally inherited alleles have the same phenotype but without hormonal resistance and marked obesity, a variant termed pseudopseudo- hypoparathyroidism (PPHP). Although both PHP1a and PPHP have been described as displaying cognitive deficits, we have found that patients with PHP1a lead compromised lives academically and socially, whereas those with PPHP do not. Based on preliminary data in a large cohort of patients with AHO as well as a mouse model, we hypothesize that the neurocognitive and psychosocial impairments observed in AHO are specific to PHP1a and may be secondary to imprinting in the brain. The aims of this study are four-fold and will be examined by forming a new collaboration between Dr. Germain-Lee, who has expertise in AHO (and established the Albright Clinic at Kennedy Krieger Institute), and Drs. Mahone and Ramos (married name, Scarborough), who have expertise in neurocognitive and psychosocial assessments. First, we plan to examine children and adults with PHP1a systematically for neurocognitive and psychosocial dysfunction. Second, we will compare PHP1a patients with PPHP patients in order to define the differences in these populations which have previously been assumed as similar in terms of these parameters. Third, because the patients being examined in this study have had or will have DNA and transformed lymphocytes banked and mutation analyses performed, we can begin to correlate the neurocognitive and psychosocial phenotypes with genotypes as well as with levels of G?s protein/message levels and G?s activity. Finally, we will correlate these phenotypes/genotypes with hormonal and metabolic parameters, providing a unique opportunity to link cognition and behavior to endocrine function as well as examine potential sexual dimorphisms. The overall goals of this study are to define the neurocognitive and psychosocial phenotypes in PHP1a versus PPHP and to establish the role of imprinting and G protein-coupled signaling, as well as genotype, sex, and endocrine function, in the etiology of the differences that are found. This study may reveal disorders unique to PHP1a and therefore target management more specifically, leading to improvements in the treatment and quality of life of these patients. In addition, the specific cognitive and behavioral phenotypes found in PHP1a are likely to be significant problems in the general population, and their mechanisms may be further elucidated through investigations of the role of imprinting of GNAS and G protein-coupled signaling."
"9302328","Abstract: For individuals with apraxia, damage to cortical areas involved in prehension, or the connections between these areas, results in an inability to perform a specific action associated with a particular object or instruction. Neuroprosthetic technology could bypass the damaged neural connections by delivering artificial instructions to specific cortical areas. One method of delivering artificial instructions is intracortical microstimulation (ICMS). Previous studies have demonstrated ICMS in primary somatosensory cortex can deliver instructions about how to perform behavioral tasks. Stimulating primary somatosensory cortex elicits sensations at different parts of the body. These different sensations are then associated with specific motor responses in order to perform the task. The proposed studies will examine the ability to use ICMS to deliver instructions in cortical areas associated with prehension. Prehension is the act of reaching and grasping, elaborated through two parallel neural pathways whereby visual information propagates from parietal cortex to motor cortex by way of premotor cortex. To our knowledge, no one has studied how ICMS could deliver instructions in other cortical areas. It is important to understand if other cortical areas can be instructed with ICMS equally well in order to develop methods for restoring damaged cortico-cortical connections. Preliminary data from this application suggest ICMS instructions can be successfully delivered to ventral premotor cortex, an area involved in planning grasps. Based on these successful preliminary results, other frontal and parietal areas involved in prehension will be tested to determine how well ICMS instructions can be delivered. Understanding which cortical areas can most readily be stimulated to deliver instructions, and how the underlying cortico-cortical connectivity affects the neural processing of these artificial instructions, will enable neuroprosthetic technology to bypass damaged cortico-cortical connections and become a clinically viable method for restoring lost cognitive motor function."
"9329416","Instrumentation Core 7. Project Summary/Abstract The Instrumentation Core is a new configuration of two long-standing service modules: the Machine Shop Module and the Electronics Module. Services previously provided by each module are all still available and represent some of the main goals and strengths of this Core. In addition, by bringing these two previously independent modules together under a single directorship, we have instituted greater coordination between services to facilitate the complex fabrication that is increasingly among the goals of Instrumentation Core users. For example, this reconfiguration allows for the coordinated design of devices with integrated electro- mechanical components, which streamlines production by considering structural and electronic features simultaneously in the initial design phase. Such added goals ensure that the Instrumentation Core is a focal point where investigators can work with the Core staff as a team to design and improve electro-mechanical devices that are central to data acquisition for new as well as ongoing experiments. Both the machine shop and the electronics components of this Core are staffed by highly skilled technicians. Because the machinist is experienced with on-going scientific projects by Core users, he routinely offers design and materials recommendations that help to improve and expedite project outcomes. This design process is further facilitated by the tool and ide maker?s recently acquired Associate degree in computer-aided drafting and design. The electrical engineer, newly hired during the past year, is completing a Bachelor?s degree in Electrical Engineering at UAB, and consequently will be providing fresh insight into the latest technologies for device control and signal acquisition. Like his predecessor in this engineering position, his efforts will be additionally motivated by occasional co-authorship in publications, as warranted. The improved coordination of the Core staff under a one Director/one Associate Director team is expected to increase effective communication between Core staff and scientists, leading to increased productivity. At present, the re-configured Core is used extensively or moderately by 14 of the 23 Core grant participants, of which 8 are NEI R01-funded."
"9325596","Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM) are leaky vascular lesions that cause hemorrhagic strokes, seizures, and neurological deficits. Familial CCM type 1 (fCCM1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the KRIT1 gene, and is typically characterized by multiple lesions on MRI that increase in number and size over time. Patients present with marked variability of disease burden, even among carriers of the same gene mutation, family or age. Currently only neurosurgical options are available to patients, although recent data from CCM animal models show promising benefits of drugs that target RhoA (statins and fasudil) for stabilizing endothelial junctions and reducing vascular leakage. In this project, we will leverage our considerable efforts over the past 5 years to recruit, phenotype, and identify modifiers of CCM disease severity in fCCM1 patients with the same founder mutation (Q455X), known as the Common Hispanic Mutation (CHM). Our long-term goal is to identify biomarkers for disease severity, which could aid in identifying patients at high risk for hemorrhage who would benefit most from pharmacologic therapy, and sets the stage for future clinical treatment trials.    In the next funding period, we will continue longitudinal follow-up of 300 CCM1-CHM cases to ascertain outcomes and better understand the natural history of the disease, build on our existing genome wide association data to investigate the role of inflammation in CCM, and expand our focus on biomarker development for clinical trials, including gene expression and neuroimaging biomarkers. We will recruit a replication cohort of 300 fCCM1 cases caused by CHM and other CCM1 gene mutations to assess generalizability of findings in the CCM1-CHM cohort, and collect new data for follow-up studies (including plasma and serum samples, and surgically resected tissue specimens). We propose the following aims: Aim 1: To longitudinally characterize the phenotypic expression and natural history of CCM1-CHM patients. Aim 2: To investigate the role of inflammation in CCM1 disease progression. Aim 3: To develop biomarkers predictive of disease severity and progression for medical treatment of CCM."

The services and facilities of the Core will  be available to investigators on a first-come, first-served basis, although the general guidelines  will be flexible to accommodate high priority deadlines, such as meetings, publications and grant  application deadlines. Four Aims are proposed: the Core will provide expertise and guidance on  the design of experiments in Aim 1, and expertise and training on the generation of high quality  histological sections and the use of state-of-art histologic techniques in Aim 2. Further, in Aim 3,  the Core will provide guidance with interpretation of results and make recommendations for  future studies. Lastly, the overall goal of Aim 4 is to enable the research community through  ongoing technology development and education. Centralizing the histological assessments of  musculoskeletal tissues in a Core facility will leverage the expertise in this area of the Core staff  and ensure high quality, efficient use of resources and equipment, proper training, and  intellectual engagement with experts to advance understanding of musculoskeletal biology,  health, and disease.   "
"9326345","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder with clinicopathologic heterogeneity and without any therapies. Genetic studies can be instrumental in the identification of the molecular pathophysiology underlying PSP risk and its heterogeneity, which may enable discovery of therapeutic targets. Until recently, H1 haplotype of MAPT, encoding tau, was the strongest genetic risk factor for PSP. A new PSP genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified six additional loci. The effective translation of these findings to therapy requires identification of he disease gene, the functional variants and their mechanism of action. These goals cannot be achieved by the disease GWAS alone and require alternative, powerful and mechanistic approaches. The current proposal aims to close this knowledge gap by joint analysis of the whole transcriptome and quantitative neuropathology measures in a well- characterized autopsied PSP cohort with existing GWAS data. Our long-term goal is to uncover the pathophysiology of PSP and the molecular substrates of its subtypes that will ultimately lead to drug discoveries. Given the clinicopathological overlap between PSP and other tauopathies, our proposal is expected to impact a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders and generate novel therapeutic avenues. Our central hypothesis, is that many PSP variants confer risk by regulating brain gene expression. Further, differential transcriptional regulation may underlie the heterogeneity in PSP. Our preliminary data identified brain transcript associations for some of the top PSP GWAS variants supporting our hypothesis. In our Brain Bank, we have access to nearly 500 brain samples from autopsied PSP subjects with existing GWAS, ~400 of which have typical and ~100 with atypical clinicopathology. All subjects have clinical data and detailed quantitative neuropathology measures. Our objective is to obtain brain transcriptome measurements in this unique cohort, which will be analyzed jointly with quantitative neuropathology measures to identify functional variants underlying PSP risk, its clinicopathological heterogeneity and to discover the mechanism of action of these variants. The expected outcomes of our specific aims are: 1) To identify a) genetic variants that influence gene expression in PSP brains, b) transcript level differences between subtypes of PSP that are not simply due to aging; 2) To discover a) genetic factors that influence both neuropathology and gene expression in PSP; b) transcripts that correlate with neuropathology; 3) To uncover the mechanism of transcriptional regulation in PSP by a) next-generation RNA sequencing of 200 select PSP brain samples; b) translational in- vitro studies. Results from all aims will be compared with the PSP disease GWAS. The overall knowledge will nominate genes and their transcriptional changes as novel disease mechanisms in PSP. These molecular mechanisms will constitute modifiable drug targets, which will impact PSP and other related neurodegenerative diseases."
"9320583","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite its prominent position in bedside care, there is little evidence to judge the benefits or associated risks of nurse-administered tooth brushing for mechanically ventilated adults, and the optimal frequency of tooth brushing in the critically il has never been experimentally determined. This project will complete the examination of oral care interventions in mechanically ventilated adults with a randomized clinical trial of tooth brushing frequency (once, twice, or three times daily) focused on conclusively defining the benefit and risk of varied frequencies, and identification of moderating patient-level factors for risk and benefit. The project's overall goal is to determine optimal tooth brushing frequency for mechanically ventilated adults. Optimal tooth brushing frequency is important for control of dental plaque and reduction of oral inflammation; it is likely to improve patient comfort, improve efficiency of nursing care, and may reduce systemic sequellae related to oral inflammation. The primary aims of the proposed project are: 1) Evaluate the clinical equivalence (non- inferiority) o three tooth brushing frequencies on oral health (dental plaque and mucosal inflammation) in critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation; and 2) Quantify and compare the safety of three tooth brushing frequencies on serious adverse outcomes, including ventilator associated complications and clinically relevant HAIs. A secondary aim is to investigate patient factors that influence tooth brushing frequency benefit and risk in critically ill adults. These objectives willbe accomplished using a prospective, randomized, experimental design. Subjects (n=345) will be randomly assigned within 24 hours of intubation to one of three intervention groups which differ in frequency of tooth brushing delivered by study personnel (once, twice, or three times daily). Dental plaque (UM-OHI score, with observations documented and augmented by use of a digital intraoral camera), mucosal inflammation (gingival crevicular fluid IL-1?), and HAIs will be assessed daily during the intervention period. The data analysis will focus on providing definitive clinical practice guidance through joint evaluation of non-inferiority (comparison of dental plaque between groups by analysis of covariance) and quantification of number needed to harm. Repeated measures linear mixed models (treating dental plaque and mucosal inflammation as separate outcome variables) will provide insight as to specific patient-level factors that may modify the clinical effectiveness and safety profile associated with frequency of tooth brushing. Information about efficacy and safety of each frequency of tooth brushing will provide a clear recommendation for optimal tooth brushing frequency with direct translation to clinical practice."
"9246042","Abstract:  The microbiome is a key contributor to many physiologic parameters and diseases in mammals, but the effects  on vaccine responses are less well defined. The microbiome has co-evolved with mammals over millions of  years to include an estimated 100 trillion bacteria and perhaps 10-fold more viruses. We have recently found  that anaerobic bacteria have profound effects on the generation of IL10-expressing CD4 Treg cells through  autophagy gene-dependent mechanisms in both mice and humans. Importantly, it has been shown that  preexisting antibodies to enteric bacteria can skew vaccine responses to cross-reacting HIV-1 antigen,  arguably rendering a vaccine less protective and that enteric bacterial components regulate the vaccine  response to influenza in mice through activation of Toll-like receptors. Helminth infections also have  profound effects on host immune response. Limited study in human suggests that helminth infection  may alter bacterial microbiome61. Helminths are documented to lower the efficacy of vaccination.  The role of Core C is to provide centralized computational and technologic expertise, sequencing, and  algorithms to generate an in depth analysis of the microbiome in subjects within the study cohorts that  will be critical to understand both difference in the microbiome between subjects with and without  helminth infection and the relationship between these descriptors and vaccine responses. Integrated  analysis linking variations in the microbiome to study cohort metadata including measures of immune  responses and other '-omic' signatures may lead to identification of digital and molecular signatures within the  microbiome and host baseline immune characteristics that may be predictive of vaccine efficacy. Should the  hypothesis of the U19 grant be validated (that the microbiome correlates with changes in basal immune  parameters and vaccine responses), we will identify computational models that can be used as a component of  analyses of new vaccines; these will be made accessible to the broader research community."
"9457008","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The bacteria that inhabit the human intestinal tract are essential for immune and gastrointestinal development, pathogen protection, and complex carbohydrate digestion. Their ability to thrive in this niche is dependent upon their ability to extract carbohydrate nutrition from this highly competitive ecosystem. Bacteroidetes are numerically dominant Gram-negative members of the human gut microbiota that all rely upon similarly patterned outermembrane protein systems termed starch utilization (Sus)-like systems to capture carbohydrate nutrition. Every Sus-like system targets a unique glycan, and some species devote nearly 20% of their genomes towards encoding these proteins. Sus-like systems are only found in the Bacteroidetes, making these proteins attractive targets for manipulating the metabolism of these organisms to support human health. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular events that support glycan utilization via Sus-like systems. In this proposal we will focus on the molecular interactions among the outermembrane proteins SusCDEFG in the prototypical starch utilization system (Sus) of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt). We have determined the molecular structures of the starch-binding lipoproteins SusDEFG, but how these proteins interact with the TonB-dependent transporter SusC to facilitate glycan import is unknown. All Sus-like systems have homologs of SusC, and of SusD, and so understanding how SusCD interact with each other and with SusEFG will inform a general model of how Sus-like systems facilitate glycan uptake. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine the nature and stoichiometry of the SusCD interaction, as well as how SusEFG affect this assembly. Our working hypothesis is that SusD facilitates interactions between SusC and the SusEFG proteins. We will identify interacting Sus proteins via co-immunoprecipitation and proteomics. In parallel, we will examine the co- localization and stoichiometry of the Sus proteins in live cells y single molecule imaging. In Specific Aim 2 we will create a functional map of the SusC structure. Our working hypothesis is that the extracellular loops of SusC bind SusD. Although recombinant SusD has weak affinity for starch, the SusCD interaction may create a higher affinity site for maltooligosaccharides that enhances import. We will test targeted mutants of susC and susD in Bt and E. coli for their ability to interact with each other and starch. We will incorporate unnatual amino acids into SusC to introduce fluorescent tags and photo-crosslinkable residues that can map the interaction between SusC and SusD. Finally, we will determine the x-ray crystal structure of SusC with or without SusD to understand its topology and function. Together, these data will reveal the molecular details of the Sus complex assembly, and allow us to generate a working model of a conserved glycan acquisition paradigm that is unique to the Bacteroidetes. With these details we can design new and selective strategies to manipulate microbial metabolism in the human gut."
"9353874","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much has been learned about the efficacy and effectiveness of comprehensive healthy lifestyle interventions to reduce obesity, but few studies have been translated into rural settings or among Latinos. Y Living is an evidence-based family-focused intervention (FI) designed for urban Latino families by PI Dr. Deborah Parra-Medina and her South Texas-based research team. The FI is a 12-week behavioral modification program grounded in the social cognitive theory of behavior change designed to engage the whole family in lifestyle changes by developing knowledge and skills in physical activity and healthy eating, building skills in goal-setting and self- monitoring, and creating a supportive environment at home. Researchers will engage community partners in formative research to adapt the current FI for rural Latino families. Two parallel delivery methods of the FI will be developed and tested: 1) in-person group setting at a community center (FI-IP) and 2) home-based delivered remotely with technology (FI-RT). While both will be designed to address the unique social, cultural and environmental factors facing rural Latino families, the latter takes advantage of innovative modern technology and e-Learning to increase program availability, accessibility and program participation in rural settings. We will conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of the two delivery approaches on weight loss (primary outcome) and energy balance behaviors (secondary outcomes) among obese Latino parent-child pairs versus control. We will recruit 270 obese (BMI 30-39.9kg/m2) Latino adults (ages 21-65) with a child (ages 8-17) from three primary care practices in rural South Texas. These 270 parent-child pairs will be randomized to one of three arms stratified by clinic: 1) FI-IP (n=90); 2) FI- RT (n=90); or 3) control group (n=90). The primary specific aims of the study are to: 1) Conduct community-engaged formative studies to transform the existing family-focused intervention (FI) into two unique delivery methods (FI-IP and FI-RT) for use in a subsequent randomized controlled trial in a rural Latino community; and 2) Conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of two parallel delivery methods of family-focused intervention (FI-IP and FI-RT) to address weight loss (primary outcome) and energy balance behaviors (secondary outcomes) among obese rural Latino adults compared with adult participants in control group at immediate post intervention (3 months), again after a 3-month maintenance program (6 months post randomization) and a 6-month follow-up (12 months post randomization). A secondary aim is to examine the impact of FI-IP and FI-RT children's weight and energy balance behaviors."
"9356562","Summary The overall goal of this proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is for the candidate, Dr. Reshma Shah, to become an independent clinical investigator with a focus on primary care- based strategies to improve early child development in low-income families. Recognized by the NICHD as a target for research to improve early child development and school readiness among at-risk families, the primary care setting offers an ideal opportunity to reach the millions of children who live in poverty. To develop, implement, and evaluate preventive primary care delivered strategies that support early child development the candidate requires additional formal training in the following important areas: 1) the design, execution, and analysis of clinical trials in the primary care setting, 2) qualitative methods and longitudinal data analysis for intervention development, 3) childhood development and its social determinants, and 4) professional development through scientific publications and presentations. The proposed research plan will integrate these training objectives and be implemented with the support of the candidate's mentorship team, which includes experts in each of these areas. The overall objective of the proposed research plan is to develop and pilot test a brief, theory-based intervention delivered in the primary care setting. Grounded in social cognitive theory and modeled after the widely disseminated literacy program Reach Out and Read, the intervention aims to enrich positive parenting behaviors and promote early child development in low-income families. By pursuing the following specific aims, the candidate will gather data essential to test its efficacy on parental and child outcomes (to be proposed in a subsequent R01). In Aim 1, the candidate will utilize qualitative methods and conduct focus groups and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (i.e., parents, clinicians, clinical staff and administrators of the proposed intervention) to inform intervention development and identify barriers to implementation. In Aim 2, the developed intervention will be tested via a pilot longitudinal randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility of protocol implementation and to investigate the potential impact on parental outcomes. The training and research plan will complement the candidate's strong clinical background in developmental-behavioral pediatrics, serve as a framework to develop accessible and sustainable clinical interventions that seek to enhance early child development, and prepare the candidate for long-term independence as a clinical researcher."
"9402029","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile pathogen that causes a broad spectrum of acute and chronic infections. An important determinant of the chronic infections is the ability of S. aureus to develop a biofilm on host tissue or medical implant material. Biofilms are problematic for treatment due to their inherent resistance to antimicrobial therapies and host immune defenses, and these problems are compounded by the growing levels of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The long-term goal of my research program is to understand S. aureus biofilm development pathways in order to improve treatment approaches. Our studies have demonstrated that the quorum-sensing system, also called the accessory gene regulator or agr, is a key mediator of the biofilm lifestyle. For S. aureus to leave a biofilm and seed new sites, the agr system has to be reactivated to disassemble the biofilm structure, and once cells have dispersed, they regain susceptibility to antibiotic treatment. Recent studies in our group have identified a prominent role for agr-regulated extracellular proteases in this mechanism. Our central hypothesis is that S. aureus has an agr-regulated biofilm dispersal pathway that is mediated by cysteine proteases (called Staphopains). Our preliminary findings also demonstrate that biofilm inhibitory factors are produced by human neutrophils, leading us to hypothesize that host defenses can tap into the dispersal pathway and destroy biofilms. For Specific Aim 1, we hypothesize that agr and Rot regulation of Staphopain production controls biofilm dispersal. To evaluate this hypothesis and further define the dispersal mechanism, we will (i) investigate the contribution of Rot repressor to the agr-protease regulatory link through molecular approaches and biofilm assays; (ii) assess the role of Staphopains in biofilm maturation and dispersal; and (iii) test the conservation of the regulatory cascade in vivo using infection imaging in a murine catheter biofilm model. We developed a surface shaving proteomic method to identify Staphopain A cleavage targets. Using this method, we discovered that the Serine-Aspartate-Repeat (Sdr) proteins are removed by Staphopain A from the S. aureus surface in a biofilm state. We hypothesize that the Staphopains cleave the Sdr surface proteins to promote biofilm dispersal. To test this hypothesis, in Specific Aim 2 we will (i) perform an in-depth characterization of the function of Sdr proteins in biofilm development; (ii) biochemically define the mode of action of Staphopain A and B on the Sdr's; and (iii) determine the impact of glycosylation on Sdr protein processing and biofilm function. Finally, we discovered that S. aureus biofilms are hypersensitive to neutrophil granules (in collaboration with Dr. William Nauseef). Through purification, we identified the protease Cathepsin G as the primary anti-biofilm agent, and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) also showed activity. We hypothesize that neutrophil granule proteases inhibit biofilms by cleaving the Sdr proteins. To test this hypothesis, in Specific Aim 3 we will (i) perform neutrophil protease processing studies on the Sdr proteins; (ii) assess the impact of neutrophil pathway inhibition on anti-biofilm activities; ad (iii) identify and characterize Cathepsin G and HNE released proteins from the surface of biofilms. An improved understanding of biofilm dispersal mechanisms, and host modulation of these mechanisms, will aid the development of therapeutics that can provide innovative treatments for S. aureus chronic infections."
"9353843","Project Summary/Abstract Culling the human genome of disease variants using ultraconserved elements Objectives: The immediate goal of the proposed studies is to explore the process by which a very curious set of sequences, called ultraconserved elements (UCEs), appear to recognize deleterious ge- nome rearrangements and then induce cells that carry such rearrangements to cull themselves away. As such, UCEs may embody an activity that could ultimately enable strategies for clearing bodies of diseased cells. Given that genome rearrangements lie at the heart of many diseases, including cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders, the proposed studies have the potential to contribute to the treat- ment of such diseases. Finally, as UCEs remain one of the least understood sequences of the genome, the studies proposed here may also contribute to elucidating the structural and functional aspects of these very enigmatic elements.  Health relatedness: The proposed studies will pertain to cancer biology, neurodevelopmental dis- orders, and potentially any disease associated with genome instability, as they stem from a stunningly nonrandom change in the positional relationship between UCEs and the breakpoints of structural vari- ants representing healthy individuals and those representing individuals bearing deleterious genome re- arrangements.  Innovation: The proposed studies offer two levels of innovation. First, they suggest that UCEs may constitute a new kind of genetic element, whose function is simply to resist change. This would be in contrast promoters, enhancers, and transcription units, whose functions are to produce an activity or a product. The long-term innovation of the proposed studies lies with the notion that UCEs may embody an endogenous activity which permits cells to assess their genome for deleterious rearrangements and, thus, may ultimately be harnessed as an exquisitely sensitive surveillance system for protecting our bodies against disease.  Specific Aims: The goal of the proposed studies is to explore the potential of using UCEs to clear cell populations and, thus, bodies of deleterious rearrangements. As such, the proposed aims will use computational, genetic, molecular genetic, and imaging technologies to: A. Determine whether UCEs represent a new kind of genetic element. B. Clarify why UCEs appear so responsive to structural variation. C. Screen the genome for genes that underlie the responsiveness of UCEs to structural variation."
"9410363","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Impact: Over 40 million Americans suffer from hypertension. Timely diagnosis and control of high arterial blood pressure (AP) are crucial for preventing life-threatening complications and end-organ damage but have been hampered by the lack of nondisruptive monitors for 24-hour (including essential nighttime) AP tracking. Due to the epidemic proportions of AP abnormalities, an unobtrusive, cuff-free AP monitor will have a significant, lasting impact on the lives of millions of Americans, particularly those with cardiovascular risk factors and chronic cardiovascular diseases. Background: In Phase 1, we developed a working prototype of the AP Expert (APEX), a system for nonobtrusive (cuff-free) tracking of the AP waves in central arteries using a multisensor array and personalized calibration. The system was tested alongside a clinical oscillometric system in 30 human subjects and met the requirements of the AAMI standards, surpassing the accuracy of several commercial systems. In addition, the signal quality was tested in overnight studies in a real-life setting (at home) and found acceptable for AP tracking. Goal: The goal of Phase 2 of this project is to refine the prototype system for nonobtrusive AP tracking and to test it in larger human studies. In Aim 1, the system?s overnight performance in the course of sleep studies will be tested. In Aim 2, the system?s performance will be tested alongside a standard intra-arterial line in cardiac ICU (CICU) patients to determine optimal number of calibration points and to refine the signal-processing algorithm based on these data. In Aim 3, the prototype will be further refined to improve the sensors? durability, performance and form factor. The expected outcome of Phase 2 is a clinical-grade, mobile system for nighttime AP tracking."
"9315864","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of stroke survivors have residual gait deficits. Restoration of walking ability is a major goal of rehabilitation. Gait retraining can improve walking speed and activity even in stroke survivors who are discharged from rehabilitation and assumed to have reached a plateau in recovery. However, while there is agreement that gait rehabilitation improves post-stroke walking function, consensus is lacking on which specific interventions, strategies, or dosing regimens are most efficacious. One factor contributing to the lack of consensus in rehabilitation literature is that the dose-response time courses and neuroplasticity mechanisms underlying gait rehabilitation have not been systematically studied. The goal of this proposal is to address the gaps in our understanding of neural correlates of clinical post-stroke gait rehabilitation, the knowledge of which would inform the development of more effective rehabilitation protocols. To meet this goal, we propose to assess time courses of cortical and spinal neurophysiologic correlates underlying a novel and effective post- stroke gait rehabilitation paradigm combining fast treadmill training and functiona electrical stimulation (FastFES). The innovation of the proposed research is the concurrent evaluation of biomechanical (gait kinetics and kinematics), neuroplasticity (cortical and spinal), and functional (gait speed and endurance) processes during 18 sessions of FastFES gait retraining. These multi-modal evaluations will be performed in 2 groups of stroke survivors (FastFES versus dose-matched control). The aims of the research plan for this proposal are to (1) determine whether 18 sessions of the FastFES gait treatment produce greater changes in cortical and spinal excitability versus a control treatment in individuals post-stroke, (2) compare the time course of changes in corticospinal excitability, gait biomechanics, and walking function during FastFES gait retraining in individuals post-stroke, and (3) determine relationships among changes in corticospinal excitability and gait biomechanics after gait retraining. Insights into tie courses and neural correlates underlying clinical post- stroke gait rehabilitation will impact clinical practice by aiding with the development of effective, individualized strategies based on neuro-biological principles to maximize the benefits of gait rehabilitation. The Principal Investigator's doctoral and post-doctoral training has imparted her expertise in gait biomechanics and gait rehabilitation. The Principal Investigator's long-term goal is to conduct high-impact research at the juncture of biomechanics, neuroscience, and gait rehabilitation that profoundly impacts walking function and quality of life of individuals with neurological disability This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will enable the candidate to gain additional training and proficiency in the use of TMS as a tool for evaluating corticomotor control of ankle muscles, and in the electrophysiological evaluation of spinal circuitry controlling the ankle muscles. The mentoring team comprises established scientists with expertise in neuroplasticity mechanisms underlying post-stroke recovery and rehabilitation."
"9294854","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The objective of this proposal is to translate dualMRI, a new noninvasive method of measuring intervertebral disc (IVD) biomechanics, to humans. IVD degeneration is a common orthopaedic problem, afflicting millions of people in the United States. The IVD pathophysiology involves a degenerative cascade that disrupts normal extracellular matrix protein synthesis and increases the expression of inflammatory cytokines and enzymes. IVD biomechanical function is sensitive to degeneration, with altered internal patterns of three dimensional (3D) strains related to the loss of water content and proteoglycan breakdown in the nucleus pulposus (NP), and loss of structural integrity of the annulus fibrosus (AF). Fortunately, the degenerative cascade gives rise to many potential therapeutic targets. Prior to end-stage treatment (e.g. spinal fusion), numerous possible biological therapies and management strategies for IVD degeneration include stem and autologous cell implantation, gene therapy, prophylactic injection, and IVD denervation. An ideal therapy would ultimately restore the biomechanical function of the IVD, characterized by internal strain fields that reveal local repair and healing following damage. There are currently no in vivo methods available to measure 3D biomechanical function throughout the interior of the IVD. In an effort to develop an imaging biomarker that noninvasively tracks the biomechanical functional of musculoskeletal tissues following therapy, we developed dualMRI (displacements under applied loading by MRI) for the measurement of mechanical strain in the interior of articular cartilage and IVDs. We are now poised to implement dualMRI for the in vivo measurement of biomechanics in volunteers with healthy and degenerated lumbar IVDs. We will establish a working protocol for in vivo dualMRI in human volunteers, including custom mechanical loading methods and MRI pulse sequences, which will readily expand to larger scale pathologic and clinical studies in future applications. We will pursue two Aims. In Aim 1, we will implement dualMRI to measure 3D patterns of human intervertebral disc strain. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate strain differences between healthy and abnormal IVDs in vivo. If successful, we will provide a new tool for the noninvasive and in vivo functional assessment of the IVD. This work will provide musculoskeletal, pharmaceutical, and othopaedic surgery communities with (a) a clinical diagnostic tool to evaluate efficacy of therapeutic agents to target early degeneration in animal and human trials, (b) the ability to functionally evaluate IVD healing and repair with emerging biological therapies, (c) baseline data describing the healthy function of human IVDs in vivo, and (d) a platform technology to more broadly study mechanical function of load-bearing tissues (e.g. meniscus, ligament) in vivo."

We will  familiarize students with INBRE by collaborating with UA programs that serve diversity students and  facilitating informational sessions and presentations at parents' orientation, open houses, and other  activities. The PI and Core lead will be integral to the recruitment process, as both represent diverse  populations and serve as role models to students with similar backgrounds. To appeal to a variety of  students, we will communicate the breadth of career options (from public health counselor to doctorate to  health degrees (nursing, pharmacy, veterinarian, physicians and their assistants) to lab technician) for which  early science training is an important preparatory step. Our curriculum will reflect evifence based training, as  a meas to prepare students for evidence based research and medical practices. To retain students in the  INBRE program, we will support funded training opportunities including individualized training plans and  workshops for professional development. Additionally, we will enhance the state-wide biomedical curriculum  by proposing three new degrees utilizing existing curricula, including a minor and graduate certificate in  biomedical research, as well as a five-year BS/MS program in biomedical sciences. By accomplishing these  goals, we will provide hands-on research experiences to, and establish training and career development  activities for, participating students at primarily undergraduate institutions, community colleges, and diversityserving  institutions; Alaska INBRE will serve as a pipeline to health research careers. As a long-term  outcome, increasing the number of well-trained and well-educated students into the biomedical workforce will  reduce the risk to people living in rural Alaska by improving knowledge and health care in the population."
"9321533","PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 3) The reservoir of latently HIV-1-infected cells that persist during antiretroviral therapy is a critical barrier to curing an infected person. Strategies to purge this reservoir and prevent or control viral rebound include approaches to drive these cells into an activated state that causes viral replication, thereby rendering them susceptible to drugs and immune responses, which act by interrupting replication mechanisms and recognizing viral proteins respectively. It is likely that driving resting cellular immune responses or creating new ones via vaccination will be important to clear the resulting productively infected cells before they release enough virions to reseed the latent reservoir. Vaccines to generate such immunity are a key strategy in this overall ?kick and kill? approach. In addition to driving anti-HIV-1 immunity, however, vaccines also cause immune activation of helper T lymphocytes, therefore potentially creating new targets for HIV-1 infection to add to the latent reservoir, and/or activating already latently-infected cells to become productive for HIV-1 replication. In this project, we investigate these component mechanisms with the specific aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the effect of vaccinations on reactivating the HIV-1 latent reservoir in CD4+ T lymphocytes. This will be explored using non-HIV-1 vaccines in humanized mice to generate pre-existing resting memory CD4+ T cell responses, followed by HIV-1 infection of the mice and treatment to generate a latent reservoir, and re-challenge with the same vaccines to drive activation of the resting memory cells. Aim 2: To evaluate the capacity of vaccinations to generate CD8+ T lymphocyte responses for clearing the reactivated HIV-1 latent reservoir. This will be explored using a novel protein nanoparticle HIV-1 vaccine that drives both CD4+ and CD8+ cellular immunity at high levels."
"9334288","Project Summary Perinatal hypoxia ischemia (H/I) remains a leading global cause of infant mortality and lifelong disability. An emerging literature in rodents suggests that both the magnitude of injury and its response to therapeutic intervention is shaped by precipitating events such as inflammation. The need for preventative and protective therapies is paramount, as complex and unknown factors limit the efficacy of current treatments. Eyeblink conditioning is a Pavlovian learning task in which a discrete stimulus (e.g., a tone) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus, such as an air puff to the eye to elicit a blink. The unconditioned stimulus alone elicits the blink reflex. As repeated pairings of the tone and unconditioned stimulus progress, the organism begins to blink in response to the tone, which is now the conditioned stimulus. Successful acquisition and expression of the conditioned eyeblink requires plasticity within the cerebellum, manifesting as a well-timed blink just prior to the unconditioned stimulus. Associative modulation of the eyeblink reflex is an extremely flexible model system of learning and memory; the neural circuits necessary for the acquisition are known, and highly conserved across species. Eyeblink conditioning yields measurements of rate of learning, memory retention, reflex latency and magnitude. These measures are sensitive indices of learning ability and interval timing that can detect learning disability and rapid stimulus processing deficits. The eyeblink reflex is an extremely sensitive measure of early cerebellar pathology with high prognostic validity, readily measured in infants as early as five months of age. The second postnatal week is a critical period of cerebellum development in the rat. At this time the synaptic connections critical for associative and motor learning are maturing within the cerebellum, and are linking with cortical and limbic circuits that support higher order cognitive function. Simple changes in stimulus parameters increase task difficulty, and recruit limbic and cortical circuits for acquisition. Delay eyeblink conditioning, in which the conditioned stimulus overlaps and co-terminates with the unconditioned stimulus, relies on circuitry within the cerebellum, whereas trace conditioning, in which a brief gap between the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus is present, requires the cerebellum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortices for consistent, adaptive conditioned responses. The experiments proposed here will use eyeblink conditioning to test cerebellar integrity following hypoxia ischemia with or without prior inflammation. The dichotomy in the necessary and sufficient circuitry involved in delay versus trace conditioning permits assessment of cerebellar and cortico-cerebellar circuits with the same Pavlovian preparation. The comparisons across tasks will provide insight into the severity of damage to intra-cerebellar circuitry as well as cortical circuitry."
"9318582","Project Summary/Abstract Drug discovery efforts targeting dementing illnesses of the elderly have been hampered by a series of failed clinical trials. The negative results could reflect misunderstanding of disease mechanisms, but they also may stem from study of heterogeneous patient populations with disease that had advanced too far to benefit from therapy. According to the latter hypothesis, better stratification of patient populations and identification of early stage disease could greatly improve clinical trial performance. This application seeks to develop small- molecule probes of ?-synuclein aggregates that are found in a range of neurodegenerative disorders including Lewy Body Disease (LBD), the second leading cause of dementia in the U.S. Radiotracers based on such compounds could serve to detect pre-mortem disease early in its course, to distinguish forms of synucleinopathy from pure Alzheimer's disease, and to establish disease stage on the basis of pathology spatial distribution. To address this need, an iterative discovery approach involving structure activity relationship analysis is proposed, followed by lead optimization studies. Over the long-term, when combined with emerging therapies for neurodegenerative disorders, direct pre-mortem detection of protein aggregates has the potential to improve drug discovery efforts for dementia."

Mornings and afternoons are devoted to mostly laboratory exercises punctuated with relevant round-table discussions, while the evenings are spent in data evaluation, lectures by leading figures in the zebrafish international community, and discussions.  During the first part of the course the students learn techniques that are standard to any zebrafish laboratory: microscopy, sperm cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization, injection of RNA, CRISPR/Cas9, and antisense morpholinos, whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, and specimen mounting and imaging. A second focus of the first week is zebrafish genetics, with interactive round-table discussions on genome editing, disease modeling, and web-based genomics resources.  The second week of the course focuses on zebrafish nervous system development and function, although many of the techniques employed are also applicable to studying the development and function of other organ systems. Participants are introduced to general anatomy through adult dissection and to neuro- anatomy; they then learn a variety of techniques for labeling and transplanting cells that are used to assess cell fate and cell behavior. One emphasis is on high-resolution live imaging using various types of microscopes and fluorescent markers. The final days of the course teach techniques for studying visual, motor and social behaviors, at the level of both genes and neural circuits.  Throughout the two week course, interspersed with the laboratory sessions are round-table sessions that teach the practical side of zebrafish research (e.g., husbandry, constructing and maintaining a zebrafish facility) and discuss latest developments in the field (e.g. disease modeling and genome editing). Finally, each of the ~20 course faculty presents a 1-hour evening seminar centered on their current research oriented towards the laboratory sessions. These highly interactive seminars are considered by participants to be a highlight of the course, as they frequently nucleate hour-long scientific discussions into the evening about outstanding biological questions.  The MBL Zebrafish Course is carefully crafted to provide to excellent scientists who are newcomers to the field training in key zebrafish techniques and interactions with leading figures in zebrafish research. In addition, as most faculty stay for the full durationof the course, it also creates a fruitful ground for networking and developing outstanding collaborations."

"9353444","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An adverse intrauterine environment, seen in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, obesity or intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), programs the offspring for disease in later life. Placental function regulates fetal growth and development, transducing the maternal and uterine environment to the fetus, and mediating fetal programming. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression through translational repression or mRNA degradation. We found significantly increased expression of miR- 210 in placentas from pregnancies complicated by severe preeclampsia or with increased maternal adiposity but the latter only in the presence of a female fetus. This suggests that miR-210 plays a pivotal role in the placental response to an adverse intrauterine environment, but with a sexually dimorphic influence in the obese environment. Using novel technology for measuring mitochondrial energetics, we described significant mitochondrial dysfunction in placentas of preeclamptic or obese women and that gain- and loss-of-function of miR-210 in primary trophoblast resulted in loss or preservation of mitochondrial activity respectively. We have recently shown that the transcription factor NFkB, which mediates many inflammatory responses, is increased in the placenta with maternal adiposity and binds to the mir-210 promoter but again only in the placenta of a female fetus. NFkB action has previously shown to be sexually dimorophic.  The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the molecular basis by which miR-210 regulates mitochondrial and in turn, placental function in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, maternal obesity or IUGR. The central hypothesis is that hypoxia, inflammation or oxidative stress seen in such pregnancies increase miR-210 expression, which represses mitochondrial respiration causing placental dysfunction. This hypothesis will be tested through three Specific Aims: 1. Determine the role of miR-210 in mitochondrial and placental function. 2. Determine the role of NFkB in mediating the effect of trophoblast miR-210 under adverse conditions, and 3. Identify novel miR-210 target genes in trophoblast and define their role in mitochondrial and placental function. In all cases we will study the sexual dimorphism of effect.  This proposal is innovative in studying the role of miR-210 in mitochondrial and placental function in normal and adverse conditions. We will determine if hypoxia, inflammation and oxidative stress act via the transcription factor NFkB governing miR-210 expression, identify novel miR-210 target genes controlling trophoblast mitochondrial function and if manipulation of mitochondrial function alters placental function."
"9363592","PROJECT SUMMARY Our general strategy is to take advantage of novel tools and methodologies that we have developed during our first CTD^2 funding period- more specifically pioneering and applying CRISPR based technologies to aid the discovery and characterization of novel cancer targets and their modulators? using innovative high throughput screening methods. Our end goal is to uncover optimal combinations of perturbagens with the potential to eliminate all cancer cells, despite their clonal heterogeneity and environmental context. One goal is to elucidate new molecular targets with the goal to overcome acquired drug resistance. We build upon an exciting system allowing us to quantitate genotypic and phenotypic cell heterogeneity for hundreds of thousands of single cancer cells. We propose a battery of therapeutic small molecule screens to identify candidate driver genes associated with drug resistance and with recurrent mutations from TCGA, TARGET, CGCI, ICGC and related initiatives. The overall goal is to identify synthetic gene combinations necessary for clinical resistance and related to inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity. We will develop and apply methodologies for the identification of genes influencing heterotypic cell-cell interactions in tumors. Tumor evolution is a challenging area of research, largely due to the complexity of cell types and behaviors. In this aim, high-throughput screens will be performed to identify non-cell autonomous synthetic lethal and synthetic viable interactions relevant to tumor microenvironment interactions. These studies will include primary T-effector/cancer cell interactions to identify new therapeutic targets and cancer associated macrophage and fibroblast/cancer cell screens to identify genes mediating therapeutic resistance. These systems are made possible by using a currently unpublished screening platform that may help to identify genes important for cancer initiation, maintenance, and possibly metastasis. Since we will use primary and cancer tissue, our unique platform will recapitulate as much as possible the characteristics of tumors in patients and address an important challenge in cancer research. We have developed a novel means to establish genetic epistatic interactions in mammalian cells and will expand upon our efforts to generate specific libraries to map the subset of targets identified in the above screens. In this aim, we will address targets and mechanisms by delineating where targets act in the pathway by probing cancer-defining molecular interdependencies, using the novel targets and screening systems described above. The end goal is to uncover the optimal combination of perturbagens with the potential to eliminate all cancer cells, despite their clonal heterogeneity."
"9335479","AP2. Symbiosis  Summary  PMS-ICBG focuses on microbes associated with mollusks as sources of novel bioactive  molecules. In many cases, bacterial symbionts are highly adapted to their host, and have  complex interactions with their hosts and other organisms in the habitat. Molecules that are  employed in these interactions have been selected through evolution for useful activities, and  low toxicity to the host, and thus are ideal candidates for drug development. In our past  research we have made a series of discoveries about mollusk symbiosis that inform our search  for drugs, and give us insight into the biodiversity of mollusks. In this project we will investigate  the microbial communities of mollusks, study the interactions among microbes associated with  mollusks, and discover the spatial distribution of mollusk symbiont bioactive molecules to  understand their roles in the symbiosis. Insights from these studies will be used to guide the  drug discovery efforts in designing bacterial isolation methods, selecting strains likely to produce  valuable compounds, and eliciting metabolite production. This AP is led by Margo Haygood,  with participation from Daniel Distel, Eric Schmidt, Hiroaki Naka and Roberta O'Connor."
"9331046","Abstract Loss of skeletal muscle mass is a devastating complication of a wide range of diseases and conditions. However, there is still no approved therapy to prevent muscle wasting partly because the mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle mass remain enigmatic. Accumulating evidence suggests that an array of signaling pathways regulates skeletal muscle mass mainly through modulating the rate of protein synthesis and degradation. However, upstream signaling mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of muscle mass remain poorly understood. During the current funding of this project, we showed TRAF6 mediates muscle atrophy and inhibits muscle regeneration in a variety of catabolic conditions. We also demonstrated that TRAF6 and TAK1 are important regulators of satellite cell homeostasis in adult skeletal muscle. In contrast to TRAF6, of which activation, causes muscle wasting, we have discovered that TAK1 is essential for skeletal muscle growth and maintenance of muscle mass in adults. Inducible myofiber-specific inactivation of TAK1 in mice (henceforth TAK1mko) leads to severe muscle wasting and development of kyphosis. The positive role of TAK1 in muscle growth is also supported by our findings that the activation of TAK1 is dramatically increased in skeletal muscle undergoing hypertrophy. Our experiments also suggest that TAK1 is required for the activation of specific intracellular pathways which promote skeletal muscle growth. Moreover, our studies indicate that TAK1 may be required for the activation of autophagy/mitophagy, regulation of mitochondrial structure and function, and maintenance of redox balance in skeletal muscle of adults. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that (I) TAK1 promotes skeletal muscle growth and inhibits atrophy through augmenting protein synthesis and preventing oxidative stress; (II) TAK1 induces the activation of specific intracellular signaling pathways to augment skeletal muscle mass; and (III) TAK1 is required for the activation of autophagy/mitophagy and regulation of mitochondrial dynamics (i.e. biogenesis, fusion, and fission) and respiratory function in adult skeletal muscle. To test these hypotheses, in the next phase of the project, we propose to address the following three specific aims: (1) Establish the role and investigate the molecular mechanisms by which TAK1 promotes skeletal muscle growth and prevents atrophy; (2) Investigate the signaling mechanisms by which TAK1 regulates skeletal muscle mass; and (3) Investigate the role of TAK1 in regulation of autophagy and mitochondrial content and function in adult skeletal muscle."
"9346080","Project Summary Clinical trials demonstrate that significant, sustained intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction in people with glaucoma is neuroprotective, slowing or halting vision loss, even in patients with normal-tension glaucoma. While the etiology of ocular hypertension in glaucoma is known to reside in the conventional outflow pathway, the cellular mechanisms responsible for generation of extra outflow resistance remain unknown. Yet, it seems likely that the homeostatic mechanisms regulating IOP, which presumably become defective in ocular hypertension, are similar to those involved in regulating blood pressure, including those affecting vascular tone. A key molecule is nitric oxide (NO), a free radical that is produced by vascular endothelia and acts as a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of contractility. Importantly, NO production by endothelia is regulated by shear stress. We demonstrated in our first funding period that IOP strongly influences the magnitude of shear stress within Schlemm's canal (SC), triggering release of NO from SC cells. We also showed that NO relaxes trabecular meshwork cells to decrease outflow resistance. Thus, shear-induced NO release acts within a dynamic ?feedback loop? that regulates conventional outflow resistance and IOP and appears compromised in some glaucomatous individuals. Our central hypothesis is that NO released from SC cells provides a mechanosensitive feedback signal that maintains IOP homeostasis, thereby functioning as an intraocular ?barostat?; and that directed therapeutic modulation of NO signaling in the glaucomatous outflow pathway significantly lowers IOP. During the first funding period, we discovered that additional factors, including oscillatory shear stress and trabecular meshwork (TM) stiffness, modulate the shear stress acting on SC cells, and hence influence their NO production. We also identified an additional NO target (distal vascular tone) in the conventional tract that lowers total outflow resistance. As a result, we extend our examination of NO signaling in the conventional outflow tract to test effects of oscillatory shear stress and TM stiffness on NO production and outflow resistance (Aim 1). Moreover, since 25-50% of total outflow resistance resides downstream of SC in distal vessels that are partly surrounded by NO-sensitive smooth muscle cells, we will determine the role of NO in regulating outflow resistance in the collector channels and intrascleral venous vessels in Aim 2. Knowing that NO is labile and needs close access to resistance generating regions in the conventional outflow tract, Aim 3 is designed to develop targeted NO- based therapeutics that increase conventional outflow at the level of the juxtacanalicular tissue, SC and/or distal vessels. This is critical because non-targeted NO delivery to the anterior segment is likely counter- productive by increasing episcleral venous pressure or relaxing ciliary muscle, both of which increase IOP. Our results will define the mechanisms of NO-mediated homeostasis in outflow regulation, uncover therapeutic targets for glaucoma therapy and generate novel technologies to modulate NO signaling and IOP."

"9334213","Project Summary Background: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common inherited disorder that leads to end-stage renal failure in the majority of affected patients. Despite decades of clinical and basic research no specific treatment is available. Compounds tested in animal models have either not been effective in humans or associated with too much toxicity. Therefore there is an urgent need for a well-tolerated drug that can be given over a long period of time. Metformin has a track record of tolerability and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes as well as in non-diabetic subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome. Potential benefits of metformin in ADPKD are related to its ability to stimulate AMP-kinase, an important enzyme involved in regulation of cell metabolism. Decreased AMP-kinase activity in cystic epithelia results in increased cell proliferation and fluid secretion, prerequisites for cyst enlargement. When used in two mouse models of severe ADPKD, metformin treatment significantly reduced cyst burden and preserved renal parenchyma. Metformin also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties which are important for reducing kidney fibrosis and loss of renal function, as shown in several animal models of acute kidney injury and progressive chronic kidney disease. In humans, a large retrospective cohort study among 13,238 veterans who initiated either metformin or sulfonylurea therapy for type 2 diabetes revealed that over 5 years follow-up metformin users had significantly lower risk for renal function decline, ESRD or death, even after adjustments for multiple time- varying covariates. Therefore, there is ample evidence for metformin potentially being a very useful drug for the treatment of ADPKD, by reducing cyst enlargement and preserving renal function. We propose a pilot clinical trial to determine the feasibility, in terms of safety and tolerability of metformin in non-diabetic ADPKD patients. To achieve this we will conduct a 12-month parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 50 ADPKD patients with an eGFR of 50-75 mL/min/1.73m2. A secondary, exploratory goal is to determine the effect of metformin on kidney volume growth and on kidney function decline. Working Hypotheses: Hypothesis 1. Metformin is safe and well tolerated in non-diabetic ADPKD patients with estimated GFR 50-75 mL/min/1.73 m2. Hypothesis 2. Metformin will slow cyst growth and kidney function decline in non-diabetic ADPKD patients with estimated GFR 50-75 ml/min/1.73 m2. Impact on the Field: If successful, data obtained in this pilot study will be used to plan a larger interventional outcomes trial in ADPKD. Metformin has the potential to be useful for early (inhibition of cyst enlargement) and later stages (preservation of renal function) of the disease. This could be a major step forward towards alleviating the burdens of ADPKD patients."
"9360615","Optimal calcium imaging with shaped excitation Understanding information flow in the brain is dependent on simultaneously recording the activity of large neuronal populations. It seems impossible to interrogate neurons serially, and still image large populations of neurons with high temporal resolution and high signal to noise. This is linked to the inverse relationship between volume scanned, and the signal collected per voxel, at fixed spatial and temporal resolution. However, this is not a hard limit. The goal of most functional imaging is to recover and assign activity signals from neurons; here we demonstrate that nearly all past approaches have dramatically oversampled spatially to create human-interpretable images. This is not necessary ? once the spatial footprints of the observed neurons are known, constrained non-negative matrix factorization methods can extract highly accurate temporal activity signals from very low spatial resolution movies. Reducing the number of samples required in imaging allows us to significantly speed up acquisition. In this proposal we introduce a new fast computational imaging method, leveraging modern computational demixing methods with simple optical hardware to increase imaging speeds by an order of magnitude. We proposed to use modern spatial light modulator systems to provide a flexible and powerful tool for optically implementing our proposed spatial downsampling approach, while taking better advantage of laser power and avoiding standard problems with diffraction- limited imaging caused by limited dwell times on the sample. The resulting combined hardware- software solution will be inexpensive, easy to implement and maintain, and widely applicable in the hundreds of labs currently using multi-photon imaging methods. Thus, the proposed approach will enable a critical leap towards achieving the goals of the BRAIN initiative."
"9328145","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Approximately 70% of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are obese or overweight. Tobacco smoking that causes COPD also is associated with other poor health habits that can lead to obesity and cardiovascular disease. Symptoms of COPD are often non-specific and include dyspnea and exercise intolerance. COPD treatment guidelines recommend stepped escalation of inhaled medications to improve these symptoms, but make little mention of the effect of co-existing obesity or weight loss interventions because of insufficient evidence. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality among patients with COPD, and obesity is associated with important risk factors for cardiovascular disease including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Comprehensive lifestyle interventions that include calorie-controlled healthy eating, increased physical activity, and behavioral self-management strategies consistently result in modest, clinically significant weight loss and associated reductions in cardiovascular risk factors. That overweight and obese patients with COPD would not only reap similar clinical benefits from modest weight loss is an intuitive - but untested - concept. Therefore, we propose to conduct a highly valid, multicenter, patient-level randomized, pragmatic clinical trial to produce first-ever data on the effectiveness of a self-directed 12-month evidence-based lifestyle intervention targeting modest weight loss and increased physical activity among overweight and obese patients with COPD. We aim to serve as a Protocol Leadership Group (PLG) for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Multi-Site Clinical Trials for the Pulmonary Trials Cooperative (PTC) in order to test if intervention participants have better outcomes through 24 months of follow-up compared to usual care control patients in terms of weight loss, exercise tolerance using the 6-Minute Walk Test, and dyspnea using the Borg dyspnea score. Secondary outcomes include, generic health-related quality of life using the SF-12, and major cardiovascular risk factors using Framingham risk score (including lipids), central obesity by waist circumference and blood pressure. We will oversee enrollment of 1000 patients at multiple clinical sites eventually chosen and contracted by the PTC's Network Management Core (NEMO). As the PLG for our proposed HOPE trial, we will cooperate with NEMO and will provide trial oversight, data management and reporting, and safety monitoring."
"9398260","Proposal Summary Melioidosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Mostly confined to the tropics the bacterium's established habitat reaches around the globe. The global at risk population is estimated at >3 billion people. Although case numbers are significantly lower than those of well-known diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, leptospirosis and dengue, the global fatality of human melioidosis is substantially higher than that of e.g. dengue and leptospirosis. Hence, in terms of mortality melioidosis could potentially be one of the main ?killer? diseases of the tropics. There is an increasing interest in melioidosis worldwide, and a growing realization that awareness, diagnosis, treatment and prevention are a matter of great public health importance. Perhaps nowhere is the interest higher than in South Asia. This is a region estimated to bear 44% of the global melioidosis burden, yet awareness of the disease and its bacterial cause remains very low. There is therefore an urgent and continuing need to bring together subject matter experts, clinicians, academicians, health care workers, and students to disseminate knowledge, to educate, and to put into clinical practice our evolving knowledge of melioidosis and its bacterial cause B. pseudomallei. The specific aim of this application is to secure funds for travel, accommodation and registration to enable at least 10-12 individuals ? mostly trainee level clinical researchers, postdoctoral researchers, and students - to attend the 2nd South Asian Melioidosis Conference (SAMC2017) that will be held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, from August 29-30, 2017. The main objectives of SAMC2017 are to bring together 75-100 subject matter experts, clinicians, academicians, students, and health care workers to: 1) communicate and discuss new findings from academic laboratories and clinical settings; 2) discuss strategies to put into clinical practice proper diagnostics and therapeutics to control and prevent melioidosis; and 3) aim to sustain such efforts beyond the conference by developing and/or maintaining strong collaborations and ways to readily disseminate information in South Asia and beyond. The lessons learned from the 1st South Asian Melioidosis Conference that was held in 2015 in Manipal, India, clearly showed that the current needs in South Asia are special and that they cannot be met by any of the other regularly scheduled melioidosis meetings."
"9259055","Project Summary This application seeks funding support for the 2017 Molecular and Cellular Biology of Helminth Parasites Meeting that brings together principal investigators, students and postdoctoral fellows from around the world to present important new findings, interact, develop new collaborations, and promote the importance of research on parasitic helminths. The 2017 (11th) meeting will be held during the first week of September, 2017. This meeting was established in 1997 with the intent to provide a collegial meeting for scientists to exchange ideas, develop new strategies for basic and applied research on these neglected diseases of poverty, and to bring to the field new concepts and technologies emerging from studies on C. elegans and other free-living helminths. The meeting consists of 100 participants and due to increased demand is now held every year. The conference represents the key and currently the only venue that unites researchers in the field, provides an important mechanism for dissemination of new and key studies, and provides a critical opportunity for recruiting new researchers and retaining existing researchers in the field. While helminth parasites are a major health problem, enticing and keeping scientist working on these often difficult to work with pathogens is an ongoing and critical battle. The meeting has played a significant role in fostering this community, playing an important and integral part in the development, growth, and continued advancements of the field. Because of the way it is structured, the meeting provides a unique opportunity to highlight student, postdoctoral and new junior faculty in the field. The meeting provides a valuable opportunity for participation of scientists from countries endemic for helminthic diseases and for the participation of under-represented minority trainees and scientists from the USA. The conference covers all major areas of helminth research in 12 thematic sessions with almost all participants contributing oral or poster presentations. The research areas include genomics, immunology, molecular biology, cell biology, drug development and tropical medicine. The location in Hydra, Greece was chosen for equal travel access for the international community and proximity to endemic countries. The meeting size and the small and quiet, traffic-free town provides ample facilities for interactions between delegates, fosters community development, and a special atmosphere of concentrated science, interactive discussions and generous opportunities for informal follow-ups. Importantly, the conference organizers request feedback following each meeting and continuously implement new formats and approaches to improve the meeting."

"9358754","Patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) often develop autoimmune complications and therefore provide rare opportunities to study the impact of specific gene mutations on the regulation of B-cell tolerance defective in patients with autoimmune diseases. The C104R and A181E mutations in the TNFRSF13B gene encoding TACI are associated with the development of common variable immunodeficiency disease (CVID) with autoimmune complications. We previously reported that mutations in TNFRSF13B gene impact B cell tolerance at 2 distinct steps during B cell development; they interfere with the removal of developing autoreactive B cells in the bone marrow and TACI mutations also induce the secretion of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs). Our latest investigation revealed that TNFRSF13B hemizygosity does not affect B cell tolerance, suggesting that the common C104R and A181 TACI mutations may encode dominant negative products. However, it remains unclear why TACI is required for B cell tolerance and how this molecule may contribute to self-antigen sensing during the central counterselection of developing autoreactive B cells or to ANA secretion in the periphery. The goal of the proposed research is to determine the mechanisms that regulate B cell tolerance in healthy subjects but may be defective in patients with autoimmune diseases. The working hypothesis is that TACI is required for B cell tolerance because it mediates in B cells the tolerogenic function of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which control the removal of developing autoreactive B cells in the marrow and the periphery when co- triggered with B-cell receptors (BCRs). We will also further characterize the pathways integrating BCR and TLR/TACI signaling required for B cell tolerance by analyzing additional PID patients with novel gene mutations."
"9321531","ABSTRACT (Project 1) Treatment of HIV-infected individuals with antiretroviral therapy (ART) can often suppress plasma viral loads to undetectable levels. However HIV persists during therapy and if ART is stopped then viral loads rapidly rebound allowing disease progression to continue. While it is clear that reservoirs of latently-infected CD4+ T cells and potentially other rare infected cells can serve as a source of replication-competent virus to rekindle infection, many questions remain about how and why rebound occurs if ART is discontinued. Particular areas where more study is needed include determining what can initiate the rebound process, how the timing and magnitude of rebound relates to the size and characteristics of the underlying latent reservoir, and defining what the consequences of allowing rebound to occur are.  The overall goal of this PO1 application is to develop a more complete understanding of HIV rebound by using the bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) mouse, a highly relevant humanized mouse model for studying HIV in vivo. This model supports multi-lineage human immune reconstitution in many tissues within the mouse and represents one of the most advanced small animal models available for investigating HIV persistence and pathogenesis. We and others have shown that the BLT mouse model can be efficiently infected with HIV and forms authentic post-integration latency in resting CD4+ T cells. Viral loads can be suppressed using clinically relevant ART drugs, and if ART is stopped then viral loads quickly rebound. We have further advanced this model by utilizing a phenotypically neutral, genetically diverse barcoded HIV swarm to perform the infections. This allows a latent reservoir to be formed with diverse genetically tagged viruses. Rebound can then be tracked both through monitoring of viral loads to test the timing and magnitude of virus re-emergence in the plasma or tissues, and deep-sequencing of the rebounding virus to quantify the number of individual barcoded variants contributing to the rebound. This combined approach will provide an unprecedented view of HIV reservoir formation and viral rebound. In project 1 we will use this model to determine the contribution of Pre- ART infection time to spontaneous viral rebound (Aim 1), test whether common physiologic/pharmacologic stimuli alter the frequency of rebound (Aim 2), and quantify the effects of structured treatment interruption (STI) on the size and diversity of the latent HIV reservoir (Aim 3). Together, these studies will test key, clinically relevant parameters to determine how they affect rebound of HIV upon stopping ART, and will assess the consequences of allowing rebound to occur. This will provide new insights into the mechanisms contributing to HIV rebound."
"9332327","Project Summary/Abstract Recent clinical trials and a host of nonhuman primate studies have pushed the HIV vaccine field further toward the development of concepts based on humoral anti-HIV envelope immunity. However, such efforts face a major hurdle in that the routinely short-lived humoral responses to HIV envelope antigens will severely compromise HIV vaccine efficacy. An additional caveat is that any solution to the humoral persistence problem must include balanced immune responses that do not engender forms of CD4+ T cell activation that might increase HIV infection risk. The recent RV144 clinical trial of a poxvirus/ envelope protein regimen underscores the issue in humans. In this trial, anti-gp120 antibody responses, including those linked with partial efficacy, decayed to undetectable levels within 12 months. Based on the available literature, we hypothesize that anti-gp120 titers rapidly fade in this manner because 1) HIV gp120-specific plasma cells are extensively killed during the germinal center reaction or 2) HIV gp120-specific plasma cells survive the germinal center reaction but cannot move into the bone marrow to become long-lived cells. Theoretically, these questions can be addressed by comparative analyses of vaccine regimens that yield persistent antibody titers versus ones that do not. This strategy has been hampered by a paucity of regimens that reliably yield persistent anti-gp120 humoral responses. Our group has tested the same gp120-based antigen in a wide variety of adjuvant formulations and vaccination regimens in macaques. Recently we determined that one of these regimens, which involves coimmunizing with envelope protein in adjuvant along with electroporation of DNA encoding IL-12 (herein termed DNA/protein coimmunization), generates significantly more persistent antibody titers compared to any other approach we tested. These findings now provide the necessary means to conduct comparative studies that elucidate the determinants for persistent anti-gp120 antibody responses. Accordingly, this Project will juxtapose the DNA/protein coimmunization regimen with a matched protein/adjuvant regimen that yields non-persistent responses. Our proposed comparative analyses will be driven by the two hypotheses listed above. In two specific aims, we will address whether persistent anti-HIV antibody responses are distinguished by 1) the preservation of short-term anti-gp120 plasmablasts without the enhancement of long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow or 2) the establishment of long-lived anti-gp120 plasma cells in the bone marrow. We will also exploit the multifaceted nature of DNA/protein coimmunization to Identify vaccine components and associated immunological pathways that afford persistent humoral anti-gp120 responses, desirable CD4+ T cell profiles and protective efficacy against heterologous SHIV challenge. Information from this project should have significant impact, providing broadly applicable, immune-based underpinnings for the development of vaccine regimens that provide persistent anti-envelope antibody responses."

In addition, the Core will offer an extensive list of quality controlled assays of metabolic substrates, endocrine hormones, and indices of renal function, assessments of insulin signaling pathways, inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress in metabolically important tissues such as liver, muscle, adipose, pancreas, as well as state-of-the-art metabolomic analysis and interpretation. Metabolomic assays including complex lipids, phospholipids, bile acids, and biogenic amines. The Core will also cooperate and coordinate with other Centers in the MMPC Consortium, such as the Bariatric Surgery Working Group. In addition, the Core will develop and refine new technologies that can be applied to the study of endocrine function and metabolism in mouse models of obesity and diabetes. For the upcoming project period, these include continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and the miniaturization of metabolomic analyses for the small samples from mice. The team, made up of Drs'. Havel, Haj, Fiehn and Huising, includes interdisciplinary expertise in the physiology and pathophysiology of obesity and diabetes, animal models of metabolic diseases, nutrition, biochemistry and molecular biology, immunohistochemistry and imaging, and in performing and interpreting advanced targeted metabolomics and lipidomic analyses. This team, along with James Graham, Staff Research Associate in Dr. Havel's laboratory with over 15 years of experience managing animal studies and assay services, will ensure smooth functioning of the Core, its interactions with other Cores in our Center and with the MMPC Consortium, Thus, the Endocrinology and Metabolism Core will provide valuable services to the users of the MMPC-UCD as well as advancing research and providing new tools for characterizing endocrine and metabolic pathways in mouse models of diabetes and obesity and related metabolic diseases."
"9334287","In the term newborn (equivalent to the postnatal day (PN) 10 rat), the cerebellum is vulnerable to the effects of hypoxia-ischemia. During this period of time, rapid change in the cerebellum is taking place: the cerebellar Purkinje neurons, the deep cerebellar nuclear neurons and the cerebellar granule cells are rapidly proliferating, and extending their axons and the numbers of cerebellar microglia are increasing. Our lab is focused on lipid raft function and dysfunction in the cerebellum and in other neurodevelopmental disorders with a primary focus on ethanol, the causative agent of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Lipid rafts are dynamic microdomains of the plasma membrane which regulate signal transduction and protein trafficking. Hypoxia/ischemia (H/I) may cause alterations in signaling or generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS may cause oxidation of lipids and therefore lipid raft dysfunction. These changes can lead to altered cerebellar development with long term consequences for cerebellar function. L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1), a molecule critical for brain development, and the toll like receptor, TLR4, can be used as reporters for lipid raft function in cerebellar granule neurons (CGN), Purkinje neurons (PN), deep cerebellar nuclear neurons (DCN) and cerebellar microglia. Choline, an essential nutrient and precursor to phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and sphingomyelin (SM), both important in lipid raft regulation, improves lipid raft function and behavior following alcohol exposure. Our preliminary data using PN7 rats shows that lipid rafts are dysfunctional in the cortex following H/I and that choline/GM1 ganglioside partially prevents this effect. In addition, choline supplementation protects L1 signaling, lipid raft distribution and cerebellar mediated behavior from the effects of other neurotoxicants. Our hypothesis is that H/I at PN10 causes lipid raft dysfunction in CGN, PN, DCN and microglia leading to poor cerebellar function. Inflammation caused by LPS synergistically increases this dysfunction, and hypothermia, choline, and/or ceftriaxone will partially ameliorate these effects. We will use PN10 rat pups (term equivalent) and the modified Rice-Vanucci model of H/I. Our three specific aims are: 1) Determine lipid raft function and composition in whole cerebellum and CGN, PN and DCN following H/I with or without prior LPS induced inflammation; 2) Determine lipid raft function and composition in cerebellar microglia following H/I with or without prior LPS induced inflammation; 3) Determine if hypothermia, choline, and/or ceftriaxone ameliorates 1) the acute alterations in function and composition of lipid rafts after H/I and H/I with prior inflammation in cerebellum, CGN, PN, DCN and microglia; 2) effects of H/I with or without inflammation on cerebellar related behaviors. Our overarching goal is to reduce the morbidity associated with H/I in neonates."
"9526641","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, maintains itself in nature via a complex life cycle involving an arthropod (tick) vector and small mammals. During its cycle between ticks and mammals, B. burgdorferi alters its outer surface protein profiles to interact with and adapt to these two dramatically diverse niches. For a complete understanding of Lyme disease transmission and pathogenesis, it is of major importance to discern the molecular mechanisms of borrelial host adaptation. In this regard, we recently discovered that a putative bacterial enhancer binding protein (bEBP), Rrp2, is essential for B. burgdorferi to establish infection in mammalian hosts. More importantly, our preliminary data indicate that Rrp2, distinct from other classical bEBPs, is essential for borrelial growth in vitro. These data strongly implicate Rrp2 as an atypical bEBP. This proposal seeks to elucidate the molecular bases underlying Rrp2's surprising essentiality and its unconventional activity. In Specific Aim 1, we will assess the contributions of potential key amino acids to Rrp2's essentiality to gain initial insights into the structural basis of Rrp2's novel activity. In Specifc Aim 2, we shall identify new ?54/RpoS-independent factors influenced by Rrp2 by using global transcriptome analyses. These combined structural and functional studies will not only advance our understanding of regulatory control over borrelial virulence expression, but also account for a major paradigm-shift in our mechanistic understanding of bacterial ?54 biology."
"9217555","The Screening Core (SC) is a key component of the Antiviral Drug Discovery and Development Center, contributing to the goals of each ofthe individual projects. Through prior NIH funded programs the SC has a legacy set of hits from chemically diverse compound libraries that have not proceeded beyond the screening stage for each Research Team to asses immediately for their mechanism of action. Secondly, the SC will conduct high throughput screening campaigns of -160,000 never before screened compounds for each research project to provide novel hits as reasonable starting points for the Research Teams and Medicinal Chemistry and Lead development Core (MCLDC). These hits will be analyzed to define their mechanism of action by the Research Teams. Replication inhibitors from either the current or previous screening efforts will funnel into a MCLDC chemistry program designed to optimize their efficacy and selectivity. The SC will also assist the Research Teams and the MCLDC by providing screening data to support the structure activity relationship (SAR) projects to further the CETR's goal of developing new replication inhibitor therapeutics for the treatment of emerging pathogens. Having a core with medium throughput capacity is essential to meet the goal of having leads with the appropriate characteristics to enter animal studies within five years. The resulting data about these compounds, generated by the SC and Research Projects, will be maintained in a centralized database with easy access by the members of the project teams. The SC will incorporate key members ofthe MCLDC and Research Project teams into the screening and decision making procedures. The end result of this process will be the identification of novel compounds appropriate for IND enabling studies."
"9318428","Project Summary  Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) recognize conserved epitopes on the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of  the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Atomic structures of the BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer  have provided a rational framework for Env-based HIV-1 vaccine design. The Wyatt group recently developed  a cleavage-independent, native flexibly linked (NFL) trimer, which offers a promising alternative for Env-based  vaccine design. Vaccine delivery is a critical issue yet to be addressed in developing well-folded trimers toward  vaccine products. In a recent review, Schiller et al. promoted a virus-like particle (VLP) approach for HIV-1  vaccine delivery. Other delivery systems include mRNA and virus vectors. For the NFL trimer, it remains  unclear which delivery system will produce the most robust immune response to enable protection against HIV-  1 infection. We hypothesize that a quantitative readout of B-cell response will facilitate rational evaluation of  vaccine candidates since a robust cross-neutralizing antibody response is expected for an effective HIV-1  vaccine. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been widely used to study the diversity and maturation of  bnAbs. We have developed a series of novel NGS technologies for the analysis of dynamic B-cell responses in  natural infection, animal immunization, and human vaccine trials. In Project 3 of this HIVRAD application, we  will investigate the Env-specific B-cell response to four vaccines based on the NFL trimer and different delivery  systems in various animal models ? inbred mice, VelocImmune mice, rabbits and non-human primates (NHPs).  In Aim 1, we will deep sequence the B-cell response of inbred mice, VelocImmune mice, and rabbits immunized  with four vaccines. We will characterize the basic repertoire properties such as germline gene usage, degree of  SHM, and CDR3 length and identify distinctive repertoire patterns associated with each vaccine. For each  animal model, we will compare the B-cell responses to four vaccines. We will compare the B-cell responses in  hu-mice and human vaccine trials. In Aim 2, we will deep sequence the B-cell response in NHPs immunized  with four vaccines. Similarly, we will characterize the basic repertoire properties and identify distinctive patterns  associated with four vaccines in the NHP model. We will compare the B-cell responses to four vaccines and  compare the B-cell responses in NHPs and human vaccine trials. In Aim 3, we will study the developmental  pathways of Env-specific B-cell lineages elicited by four vaccines. We will trace the lineages of monoclonal  antibodies (mAbs) identified by single B-cell sorting (Project 2, Wyatt) and microfluidics-based single-cell  analysis (Project 3, Zhu) in NGS repertoires. We will investigate whether the vaccine-elicited neutralizing mAbs  resemble known bnAbs and their developmental pathways. Project 3, together with Project 1 (RNA and VSV  vector), Project 2 (NFL trimer, VLP, and serum Ab analysis), and two Cores on in-vivo study and gene  expression profiling, will constitute a comprehensive HIVRAD program towards an effective HIV-1 vaccine."
"9342972","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Surgery, Division of Pediatric Surgery, at the University of Minnesota. Although I manage a broad spectrum of pediatric disorders as a pediatric surgeon, I have developed a primary focus of interest in the role of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in intestinal inflammation and disease. My doctoral thesis during my combined medical training characterized the role of sphingolipid signaling in enteric glia, with particular emphasis on sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). My long- term career goal is to become an established independent investigator and to develop improved treatment options for children with debilitating intestinal diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Environment: My primary mentor, Dr. Sabita Roy, and I work together in an enthusiastic and highly productive academic environment in conjunction with my other advisory committee members across the university. Our interdisciplinary approach involves state-of-the-art resources within the medical school and veterinary schools and beyond to allow us to unravel some the mysteries of the role of the ENS in intestinal inflammation and disease. Research: Necrotizing enterocolitis is a devastating and rising dilemma for premature infants. Recent evidence suggests that enteric glia may serve as gatekeepers in the intestine where they may help modulate inflammatory disorders in adults and children alike. This proposal seeks to gain further insight into sphingolipid signaling enteric glia in the context of NEC. Our studies demonstrate that enteric glia bear receptors for S1P and these receptors couple to downstream cellular events which may prove integral to the maintenance of gut barrier integrity in children with a developmentally mature enteric nervous system. Aim 1: Demonstrate enteric glial cell signaling contributes to normal gut barrier function in children. Aim 2: Establih that enteric glial signaling is undeveloped in children with necrotizing enterocolitis, contributin to disrupted gut barrier function. Summary: This K08 proposal serves as logical progression from my previous research experience in signaling events of glial cells the enteric nervous system, integrating the development of other essential skills though the guidance of my advisors. This application is designed to facilitate progression as a mentored scientist to that of an independent surgeon scientist with the chief aim of further characterizing the role of bioactive lipid signaling in glial cells of the enteric nervous system in childhood intestinal disorders of inflammation such as necrotizing enterocolitis."
"9316623","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proper formation of sensory systems, such as the visual system, requires experience-dependent refinement. Traditionally, it was believed that sensory-dependent plasticity was limited to cortex and began only after subcortical pathways had stabilized. However recent studies from many laboratories, including ours, have demonstrated that experience-dependent plasticity also occurs outside of cortical circuits. Studies from the Chen laboratory have revealed that refinement of the retinogeniculate synapse, the connection between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and thalamic relay neurons, continues far beyond early development and includes a critical period during which pre- and post-synaptic partners can change in a vision-dependent manner. The discovery of late-stage functional plasticity in the thalamus represents a significant shift in our understanding of sensor system development, as it implies that subcortical circuits rewire with experience concurrently with cortex. Furthermore, the presence of extensive feedback projections from cortex that innervate thalamus just prior to the onset of this critical period suggests that, in contrast to th model of sequential, feedforward development of sensory pathways, subcortical structures may actually incorporate feedback from cortex to mature properly. Indeed, here we present strong preliminary data supporting this hypothesis. In this proposal, we outline experiments to further explore the purpose and mechanisms of experience-dependent thalamic plasticity, as well as the cortical contributions to this process. We will take advantage of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic tools to manipulate and characterize specific circuit components throughout development."

"9377070","This project will exploit a recently discovered oncogenic mechanism of cell cycle control exerted on cyclin D- cdk4 (DK4) by p27Kip1 and its activator, the Breast tumor Related Kinase (Brk), to target vulnerabilities in cancer cells. Although historically known as a DK4 assembly factor and cdk2 inhibitor, p27 also acts as a cdk4 ON/OFF ?switch.? Tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation of p27 (pY88) gatekeeps both ATP binding and CAK phosphorylation of cdk4's T loop, essential for DK4 activation. We demonstrated that Brk is the physiological kinase that phosphorylates p27, and by doing so, increases cdk4 activity, cell cycle progression, and resistance to cdk4-specific inhibition by the chemical inhibitor Palbociclib, currently in clinical trials for breast cancer. Cyclin D and cdk4 are overexpressed in tumors, but their levels are not reliable biomarkers of oncogenic tumor potential because of the activating role p27 has on their complex. Our data predict that the Brk-p27-DK4 axis is important for transformation in DK4-dependent tumors and can explain tumor resistance to cdk4-specific inhibition. We determined that p27 interacts with Brk through a SH3:PxxP contact, specific for Brk's SH3 domain. The importance of this interaction is validated by characterization of a natural ALTernatively spliced Brk variant Brk (ALT), which contains only Brk's SH3 domain, and functions as a competitive inhibitor in vivo. Thus, blocking the Brk:p27 interaction is a viable strategy to inhibit cdk4 activity, which should be explored therapeutically. Our specific aims: 1) To examine pY as a marker of Palbociclib response in tissue culture and patient material. We will characterize cultured cell lines to statistically establish whether pY, as a measure of cdk4, correlates with Palbociclib sensitivity and could be used to predict response. In conjunction with our Dept. of Pathology, we will analyze archival breast cancer samples and primary patient material, including ER/PR+, Her- breast tumors, to correlate Palbociclib responsiveness and pY directly. 2) To demonstrate that ALT and pY blockage therapy can prevent proliferation in tissue culture models. Using breast cancer tissue culture models, we will show that ALT and Palbociclib-mediated arrest is different in terms of outcome and at the molecular and cell biological level. Our data will show that blocking pY using ALT is a powerful approach to block cancer cell proliferation, because it inhibits both cdk4 and cdk2, induces cellular senescence and prevents drug resistance. 3) To demonstrate that ALT and pY blockage therapy can prevent tumor progression in animal models. We will show that blocking p27 pY in mouse xenografts breast cancer models can prevent cancer progression and drug resistance.  "
"9540201","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Allergic reactions to house dust mite are an important health problem worldwide, affecting up to 85% of asthmatic children, and are a risk factor for emergency room admission with asthma. Group 1 and 2 mite allergens account for more than 50% of total house dust mite specific IgE reactivity in mite allergic patients. Mite allergens Der p 1 and Der f 1 are cysteine proteases produced by the dust mites Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and D. farinae, respectively. Proteolytic activity of Der p 1 may enhance IgE antibody production and contribute to lung inflammation in asthma. In contrast, group 2 mite allergens are lipopolysaccharide binding proteins. Der p 2 has been reported to mimic a human structural-homolog that activates the innate immune system through toll like receptors. Despite these important molecular differences between proteolytic group 1 and non-proteolytic group 2, a high IgE prevalence of 83% to allergens from both groups has been observed in mite allergic patients in the US. The main goal of this project is to investigate the antigenic structure of both groups of mite allergens, for the design of immunotherapy. Allergens will be co-crystallized with IgE antibody constructs selected by phage display technology. The key amino acids involved in IgE antibody binding will be identified and modified. The specific aims are: 1) selection of IgE antibody constructs (scFv) from combinatorial libraries made from blood of mite allergic patients using phage display technology; 2) mapping of antigenic determinants on groups 1 and 2 dust mite allergens by X-ray crystallography and analysis of IgE antibody binding epitopes; and 3) site-directed mutagenesis of IgE antibody epitopes for expression of hypoallergenic mutants with T cell reactivity as candidates for immunotherapy. An analysis of the association between mite allergen-specific IgE antibodies from the human repertoire and the epitopes recognized by these IgE antibodies will be performed with the information obtained in the first two aims. Aim #2 will generate experimental data sets of three-dimensional structures of B-cell epitopes that are missing in current databases used for developing tools for B cell epitope prediction. Most importantly, this project will define IgE antibody responses to mite allergens and will provide the structural basis for rational design of hypoallergens. In Aim #3, IgE antibody binding to the epitope mutants will be analyzed by ELISA, multiplex array technology and cell mediator release assays, and T cell reactivity will be evaluated. Mutants will be compared and hypoallergenic forms will be selected for the design of vaccines for immunotherapy of mite allergy."
"9358425","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic pain is a common problem in primary care, particularly among vulnerable, medically underserved populations. Estimates suggest that 27 to 37% of the population have chronic pain, and the costs of pain have been estimated at $635 billion each year in medical treatment and lost productivity. The increase in opioid prescriptions for chronic pain --despite limited evidence for their long-term effectiveness?has contributed to marked increase in opioid misuse and related morbidity and mortality. Evidence-based guidelines for chronic pain call for a stepped approach to care, minimizing reliance on opioid medications, and emphasizing interdisciplinary treatments, but primary care clinicians do not consistently adhere to these prescribing practices. The National Pain Strategy calls for comprehensive and standardized assessments of patients with chronic pain and person-centered care planning, along with efforts to reduce unsafe opioid prescribing in primary care. More actively engaging patients in their own treatment may reduce mistrust, improve adherence to more effective care plans. Assessing functioning and conducting standardized care planning in the context of busy primary care settings requires overcoming challenges. Our ongoing work has shown that the use of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are valued by patients and can bring new insights about patient needs to the care team; however, the burden of data collection is great and using this information in developing care plans is a new process for patients and care teams. Sufficient data are needed to provide patients, clinicians and other members of the care team information on PROM results and to assess how they interpret the results both for the individual and for groups of patients. As a first step in an overall plan for improving outcomes for patients with chronic pain, this project will:  1) Demonstrate the feasibility of using patient portal and ?smartforms? in the electronic health record to  facilitate the gathering and presentation of patient-reported functional data for chronic pain.  2) Evaluate alternative approaches for defining improvement based on data collected in clinical care as well as  based on patient surveys in a subsample of patients. We will consider how changes vary based on patient  demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics.  3) Explore the usability of pain PROMs for care planning, quality improvement and performance measurement  using interviews with patients, their clinicians and care team, and outside clinicians also trained in pain management. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) will collaborate with the Weitzman Institute at Community Health Center, Inc., a statewide FQHC serving a diverse and vulnerable population. Findings will provide practical information to support care and inform policy efforts to improve pain care and performance measurement."

"9349354","PROJECT SUMMARY Recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) depends on plasticity of the nervous system, both spontaneous and induced by task-specific training. Traditional activity-based paradigms produce modest functional gains. However, pronounced deficits in eccentric motor control persist, making independent ambulation impossible for most individuals with SCI. Eccentric-focused downhill treadmill training is a novel, challenging intervention designed to promote greater skill learning of locomotion. Interestingly, MRI studies in healthy rodents and humans show that motor skill learning is accompanied by white matter plasticity along tracts activated by the training paradigm. Further, animal studies show that differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors, known as NG2 cells, and subsequent new myelin formation are required for learning of a motor skill. This proposal will employ a novel experimental design that uses similar outcome measures (MRI, 3D Kinematics) to examine white matter plasticity and motor learning in humans alongside mechanistic animal experiments following an equivalent downhill training paradigm. Because white matter plasticity and motor learning are understudied in both rodent and human SCI, the proposal aims to determine the role of newly formed myelin in recovery and motor learning after SCI in rodents (Aim 1) as well as the extent of myelin plasticity induced by motor learning in animals and humans with SCI (Aim 2). In Aim 1, we will use transgenic reporter mice that allow fate mapping of NG2 cells along with novel multicomponent T2 relaxation imaging (MCRI) to identify myelin formed in response to eccentric-focused downhill training. Additionally, we will use a strong proof-of- principle design in which we will examine training-induced motor learning after SCI in the absence of new myelin. Aim 2 will leverage an ongoing clinical trial examining downhill treadmill training after SCI in humans along with MCRI obtained from animals in Aim 1 to determine the extent of myelin plasticity induced by motor learning across species. Preliminary data in rodents show that downhill training mitigates the persistent eccentric motor control deficits after SCI and improves overground locomotion. Thus, eccentric-focused training may indeed be novel and challenging enough to drive white matter plasticity and motor learning. Therefore, we hypothesize that task-specific interventions that are novel and challenging, in this case downhill treadmill exercise, improve locomotor recovery across species via active myelination of spared CNS axons remote from the SCI."
"9358756","Project Summary/Abstract Antibody (Ab)-mediated opsonization is essential for protective immunity to pneumococcus in humans, as attested by the frequent occurrence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in patients with B cell immunodeficiencies1,2. We are interested in deciphering the molecular genetic basis of three otherwise distinct primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) sharing an impaired Ab response to glycans and predisposition to IPD, (i) common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), (ii) specific antibody deficiency (SPAD) and IgG2 deficiency (IgG2D), and (iii) anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID). EDA-ID is a rare syndromic PID that manifests in multiple ways, yet underlies IPD and impaired Ab response to glycans in most, if not all patients3,4. Most patients carry mutations in NEMO and NFKBIA, which respectively underlie X-linked recessive (XR) and autosomal dominant (AD) forms5,6. Patients with SPAD/IgG2D display a much more selective impairment of Ab response to glycans, which also leads to IPD7,8. It is rarely caused by mutations in IgG29-12. CVID is more common and heterogeneous, of later onset, and results in a global decrease of IgG levels, underlying impaired Ab response to glycans and IPD among other consequences13-16. It is rarely caused by bi- allelic mutations in ICOS17, TACI18,19, BAFF-R20, CD8121, CD1922, CD2023, or LRBA24-26 or mono-allelic mutations in NFKB227, CTLA428, PIK3CD29,30, NFKB131, or IRF2BP232. We hypothesize that patients with genetically unexplained CVID, SPAD/IgG2D, or EDA-ID may suffer from novel inborn errors of immunity. We thus aim to decipher novel IPD-predisposing single-gene inborn errors of B cell- and Ab-mediated immunity to glycans in patients with these conditions. In the last four years, we discovered AD IKAROS deficiency as a novel genetic etiology of CVID33, and the first inborn errors of the linear ubiquitination complex (LUBAC), with mutations in HOIL1 and HOIP34,35 in patients with amylopectinosis and immunodeficiency (AM-ID), which is related to EDA-ID. To discover new genetic etiologies of these three related B cell deficiencies, we will rely on a unique recruitment of patients (including CVID from team 1), the recent advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), including whole-exome (WES) and -genome sequencing (WGS), which have been pioneered in the lab for PIDs36-38, and our development of powerful prediction software39-41. The immunological consequences of the mutant alleles will be studied in collaboration with the other PPG teams. Our preliminary data are exciting, as we have identified genetic etiologies of CVID (mutations in LIG1), SPAD/IgG2D (mutations in TIFA), and EDA- ID (the first mutation impacting quantitatively the four transcripts of NEMO). This project will discover new causes of CVID, SPAD/IgG2D, and EDA-ID/AM-ID. The immunological implications of this study are important, as it will shed new light onto the genetic control of human Ab responses to glycans and protective immunity to pneumococcus. The clinical implications are equally important, as our results will improve the management of affected families and facilitate the investigation of the genetic basis of other PIDs."

The program, administered and directed by PI Donald Zack and co-director Jeremy Nathans, is multidisciplinary and the interests of the training faculty cover many of the major areas of modern visual science. The goal of the VSTP is to recruit young, talented scientists into the visual sciences, and to provide them with broad theoretical and methodological research training that will allow them to contribute to our understanding of the biology of vision and the pathological mechanisms responsible for visual loss in the context of human disease. Hopkins is fortunate to have a large number of investigators who study vision; their approaches range from the molecular and cellular to the systems levels, and the technologies they employ include cell biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, developmental neurobiology, stem cell biology, electrophysiology, functional imaging, and psychophysics. The diverse nature of the vision research community at Hopkins provides a wide variety of research options for VSTP trainees. In this VSTP renewal application we are proposing to accept two predoctoral students per year and support both of them for two years, and to accept two postdoctoral fellows per year, and to support each of them for one year. As part of our training program, the VSTP, in collaboration with Wilmer and other Hopkins graduate programs, organizes and provides vision-related courses, seminars, and related activities.

"9316646","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The RISE program continues to transform the academic environment at UPR-Cayey (UPRC) by focusing on the preparation of students to become scientists. As part of this long term goal of increasing the number of Hispanics studying for the Ph.D., this proposal is concentrating on helping students in four areas; i) their lack of awareness of career opportunities in biomedical research and of their own potential for it; ii) their limited research skills and experience; iii) limited quantitative and analytical skills; and v) inadequate learning skills. These were identified as critical areas needing assistance and individual program components (5) have been designed to address these needs: Research Seminars and Workshops (RSW), Undergraduate Research Experiences (URE), Guided Discovery Chemistry (GDC), Quantitative and Spatial Analysis skills (QSS) and, Freshmen Research Skills (FRS). The implementation of each component will be monitored by an external evaluator working with the activity coordinators, program director, and the RISE Advisory Committee. In the RSW component, the visiting alumni scientists will offer seminars and workshops to improve attendees' awareness of new techniques and discover science careers, and to serve as role models. An improvement in the research skills of motivated students will be accomplished during their first year by having them participate in activities related to research techniques and scientific literacy. RISE students will take Discovery Chemistry (GDC) to enhance their learning skills based on observation, interpretation, and drawing of conclusions, rather than memorization. URE activities for 14 students will be offered during the academic year in Puerto Rico with active investigators at UPRC and four collaborating institutions. Additional research experiences will be offered to over 12 students during summer internships at 20 collaborating institutions in the USA. The students will be able to develop their mathematical and reasoning skills in scientific context by attending the workshops offered under the QSS component. It will also help them improve their visual communication skills. In addition, the activities designed under the program will have a positive impact on curriculum development and faculty training in new teaching methods that have been found to be effective in reducing attrition rates. Each component enables students to develop their potential by interacting with a different group of experts: 1) research skills with faculty mentors; 2) motivational seminars by visiting alumni scientists; 3) inquiry methodology by chemistry faculty; 4) mathematical skills with the activity coordinator; and 5) research lab experience with either on-island research mentors or with off-island scientists located in the USA. Each of these activities will provide the students with an appropriate environment and interaction with experts in order to develop scientifically and become future biomedical researchers. During the last 5 years (2010-14), 32 RISE alumni completed Ph.D.'s from major research universities, a 100% increase over the previous five-year period. By doubling the number of Ph.D. alumni, RISE will impact the community. These UPRC scientists will serve to meet the health disparity needs of the Hispanic population in Puerto Rico and the nation by working to discover the causes and remedies of diseases."
"9360117","Project Summary The ability to quantitatively characterize incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in its preclinical stage is a critical step for early interventions involving disease modifying therapy and for designing efficient clinical trials to test therapy efficacy. This project focuses on deriving statistical image analysis methods for identifying the relationship of morphometric changes in this early stage with direct indicators of AD pathology (such as amyloid deposition) and various risk factors such as family history in late midlife adults who are cognitively healthy. The proposed analysis will be conducted on the largest preclinical AD cohort assembled to date and help elucidate how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD. The core of our analyses is a set of algorithms that allow operating directly on powerful ?manifold-valued? representations of morphometric change and consequently yield high sensitivity in picking up real but statistically weak multi-modal patterns of the disease process. Hypothesis: 1) Detecting precise associations between morphometric changes in preclinical AD subjects with amyloid burden and various risk factors is possible using new algorithms that work directly with representations of the Jacobians of the deformation fields derived from longitudinal imaging data. 2) Conducting such analyses on a large multi-site cohort of asymptomatic at-risk preclinical AD individuals with identified AD pathology will a) reveal important insights into early disease processes when dementia is 15+ years away, b) provide preclinical AD biomarkers and c) provide frameworks for predicting clinical endpoints at the level of individual subjects. Specific Aims: 1) To develop new algorithms for performing statistical analysis of manifold representations of morphometric changes concurrently with multiple covariates representing risk factors, AD pathology markers, and clinical/cognitive measures. 2) Conducting an end-to-end analysis of two independent preclinical AD cohorts to identify the relationship of morphometric changes with various predictors as well as test/retest validation across sites. 3) Analyzing the largest preclinical AD cohort to date for characterizing the relationship of the entire spectrum of predictors to clinical endpoints for late midlife individuals. 4) Providing industry- strength open-source software implementing the full suite of models, integrated with existing software toolboxes, for deployments on a workstation, a high throughput cluster or the cloud. Significance: This project will have a significant impact across three distinct areas of brain imaging research: 1) characterization of how clinical-cognitive-imaging AD phenotypes emerge in asymptomatic individuals in the earliest stages of AD, 2) rigorous algorithms for morphometric change analysis in neuroimaging and neuroscience, 3) open-source end-to-end implementations of the algorithms for use within the community."
"9240286","Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections are a major public health concern as they can adversely affect female fertility and neonatal health. While natural history studies indicate that some women spontaneously clear their infection, the physiological conditions that permit spontaneous clearance of CT remain elusive. Understand the latter is key to developing an effective vaccine that to prevent CT infection and its devastating consequences. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that interferon gamma (IFN?) is the primary protective cytokine against CT. IFN? induces the host enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) that degrades tryptophan, an essential amino acid for CT, which cannot synthesize tryptophan de novo. All clinical genital CT isolates have evolved a mechanism to evade the effect of IFN?, specifically they can express a functional tryptophan synthase that salvages exogenously provided indole to generate tryptophan within the intracellular chlamydial inclusion where it is impervious to IDO1. While neither CT, nor human cells, synthesize indole, some members of the vaginal microbiome that increase greatly in number and proportion during bacterial vaginosis (BV), can do so. Thus, we hypothesize that the composition of the vaginal microbiome, and its capacity to provide indole, modulates the efficacy of IFN?-dependent host immunity against CT. This hypothesis is supported by our existing clinical data; although all women who spontaneously cleared CT infection had high endocervical IFN? levels, so did ~40% of women who failed to clear infection. We propose to rigorously test this hypothesis using a cohort of high-risk African-American women attending our STD clinic in New Orleans. The cohort will be stratified into groups that spontaneously clear CT infections (~28% in our cohort) or fail to clear CT infection between enrollment and return-for-treatment visits. By focusing on women who spontaneously clear infection, and the ~40% of non- clearing women who meet the threshold endocervical IFN? levels observed in clearers, we will investigate the following objectives: 1) Determine the infection micromilieu (tryptophan/indole/IFN?/CT load & gene expression profile) correlates of clearance; 2) Determine differences in the prevalent vaginal microbiome, and its indole- generation capacity, between clearers and non-clearers; and 3) Using a novel endocervical epithelial cell model, directly test the capacity of indole-producing microbiome members to limit IFN?-mediated CT clearance, and evaluate the efficacy of known small molecule indole biosynthesis inhibitors to augment IFN?-mediated CT clearance during co-infections. The outcomes from the proposed studies will provide essential information needed to design novel immunological and pharmacological approaches that improve clinical outcomes for CT- infected patients. Modeling the mechanisms used during spontaneous clearance will define the effects of co- infection on the efficacy of the host response to CT-infection. This will significantly improve patient health and welfare in light of the tremendous human and financial toll that is imposed by genital CT infections."
"9324135","PROJECT SUMMARY Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) are unrivaled in their lethality. PDAs have the highest 1- year, 5-year, and 10-year mortalities of any cancer and are expected to become the second-leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. An invasive PDA represents the coordinated evolution of cell- intrinsic and extrinsic processes and capabilities that subvert and repurpose the dictums of normal tissue composition, architecture, and physiology to foster unbridled growth and colonization. This new organizational entity is constructed at the behest of the mutated epithelial cell. The resulting PDA neo- organ contains a minority of tumor epithelial cells amidst a heterogeneous sea of non-epithelial cells; a complex interstitial stew of proteins, proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, together with both freely mobile and complexed water; and a paucity of vessels that otherwise resemble a normal vasculature in lacking fenestrae or interendothelial junctions, but that are collapsed under intense interstitial fluid pressures. We have undertaken a systematic exploration of the cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous processes that drive PDA pathogenesis and resistance. We have developed genetically engineered animal models that faithfully recapitulate the clinical syndrome, metastatic behavior, histopathology and molecular features of the human disease as primary platforms to both uncover critical principles of disease biology and to rigorously test strategies to overcome them. Through such investigations we have identified unusually high concentrations of intratumoral hyaluronan (HA) as the primary culprit in the extraordinarily elevated interstitial fluid pressures (IFP) in PDA that, in turn, cause the vascular collapse and hypoperfusion characteristic of this disease. The stromal barrier to perfusion also serves as a primary mechanism of drug resistance in limiting the tumor penetration of systemically delivered agents. We have additionally identified multiple mechanisms of immune suppression that prevent the development of an endogenous effector T cell response. Collectively, these unique aspects of stromal biology in PDA conspire to create a drug- and immune-privileged sanctuary for unimpeded growth of the pancreas cancer cell. Very recently, we have elaborated strategies to overcome critical aspects of these physical and immunological barriers to therapy revealing a perhaps unexpected degree of vulnerability once the barriers are breached. We describe a series of continuing investigations into this strategy of stromal re-engineering to expand upon the significant inroads made in the hopes of radically transforming the approach and prognosis for this formidable disease."

"9300733","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The death of a child by any cause places parents at risk of depression, anxiety, an inability to return to the work setting and an earlier death as compared to parents who do not experience the death of a child. Thus, a child's death places the health and functional status of parents and, thereby a family, at heightened risk; strategies to reduce these serious risks are needed. In our end-of-life studies about treatment decision­ making and symptom management, we discovered that parents strive to achieve their internal definition of 'being a good parent to my seriously ill child'. Achieving this definition could be a protective factor for parent health and functioning and family well-being in the context of a child's death. In our work to date, we have been able to  generate and validate the definition of 'being a good parent to my seriously ill child' in two  parent groups (parents of a child with incurable cancer, parents of a child in the pediatric  intensive care setting) who were involved in treatment decision-making on behalf of their very ill  child, but we do not yet know the internal and external factors that influence the parents' ability  to achieve their definition nor the exten to which this achievement is protective in terms of  parent health and family well-being outcomes. In this study we will use a grounded theory approach to synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence into a theoretical framework that explains influencing factors and outcomes of achieving one's definition of being a good parent. Our first Aim is to generate two substantive grounded theories, based on qualitative interviews, standardized questionnaires, field notes and theoretical memoing collected longitudinally (from the time of an end-of-life decision until 4 to 6 months after the child's death) from two purposefully sampled groups of parents (parents whose child's cancer becomes incurable; parents of a child who  experienced an unexpected accidental and life-threatening trauma). We project enrolling up to 40 families (one or both parents, thus up to 80 parents) in each of the two groups. For our second Aim, we will use metasynthesis strategies to develop an integrated formal grounded theory from the two substantive theories and other evidence sources (e.g., literature review) that is broadly applicable to other parent populations. The resulting theoretical framework will subsequently be used as the basis of a hospital-based, clinician-initiated intervention designed to reduce the risks to parent health and family well-being secondary to the loss of a child family member."
"9459614","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since pulmonary hypertension (PH) develops in a relatively small proportion of patients with a genetic abnormality, e.g., a mutation in bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR)2, or in conjunction with an environmental exposure, e.g., HIV or amphetamine (AMPH) abuse, aberrant genes and environmental factors are likely additive or synergistic in causing disease. Our preliminary studies with cultured cells and transgenic mice with dysfunctional BMPR2 suggest that common processes are amplified when the aberrant gene interacts with an adverse environmental factor. For example, we determined that loss of BMPR2 causes abnormal assembly of elastin fibers by pulmonary arterial (PA) smooth muscle cells (SMC) and fibroblasts (Fibro), and we hypothesize that accelerated degradation of these fibers would occur in response to the inflammation resulting from a viral infection. Similarly, loss of BMPR2 reduces cell survival signals in PA endothelial cells (EC), and hypoxia and AMPH further decrease the same signal, resulting in amplification of DNA damage and PA EC apoptosis. The goal of the present proposal is therefore to investigate how loss of BMPR2 signaling causes impaired assembly of elastin fibers and also renders EC susceptible to apoptosis and DNA damage, and whether, in combination with infection or AMPH, the consequences and amplification of these abnormalities increases severity or impairs resolution of PH. In preliminary studies we showed that loss of BMPR2 in PA SMC and Fibro impairs elastin fiber assembly by reducing fibrillin proteins and activating transforming growth inhibitory factor (TGIF), to prevent synthesis of tropoelastin. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether loss of BMPR2 decreases fibrillin-stabilizing proteins such as syndecans and ADAMTS disintegrins. We will establish whether the elevated level of p-p38 observed with reduced BMPR2 activates TGIF, and whether EGF phosphorylation is a necessary intermediary. We will assess the contribution of PA EC to formation of elastin fibers by SMC, and whether this is compromised by loss of BMPR2. In Bmpr2+/-Alk3+/- mice, or in mice with deleted Bmpr2 in SMC or Fibro, we will elucidate whether elastase activity, produced by perivascular inflammatory cells in response to a vasculotropic virus, will cause the abnormal PA elastin fibers to degrade, promoting adverse remodeling, including neointimal formation, and severe PH. In preliminary studies we showed a progressive loss of pAkt with reduced BMPR2, hypoxia and AMPH. Thus, in Specific Aim 2 we will investigate whether this is related to a similar phosphatase activated by reduced BMPR2, hypoxia and AMPH, and whether progressive perturbation in pAkt function causes DNA damage and EC apoptosis by impairing p53 dependent gene regulation. We will determine, in Bmpr2+/-Alk3+/- and in mice with loss of Bmpr2 in EC, whether AMPH mediated amplification of DNA damage worsens hypoxic PH and vascular changes and prevents reversal. Understanding the contribution of BMPR2 dysfunction to environmental insults will facilitate approaches to prevent and minimize PH in patients at risk."
"9381113","PROJECT SUMMARY Human Mitochondrial Complex I (CI) is composed of 44 distinct subunits that are assembled together with eight Fe-S clusters and a single flavin mononucleotide, to form a functioning enzyme. Ancillary proteins referred to as assembly factors assist with the assembly process; and a dozen or so bona fide CI assembly factors (CIAFs) have been characterized. However, about half of CI disorders cannot be traced to mutations in any of the 44 CI subunits or known assembly factors, which suggests that additional regulators of CI biogenesis remain to be characterized. Some regulators of CI assembly may not directly interact with any of the 44 CI subunits, but rather interact with CIAFs to regulate CI assembly indirectly. For instance, they may regulate the stability, subcellular localization, degree of post-translational modification, extent of activation, etc. of a CIAF. We refer to this class of regulators as remote regulators (RRs) of CI assembly. We hypothesize that at least some CI disorders may be attributed to mutations in RRs, many of which have not yet been discovered. The ideal model system for discovering RRs of CI assembly will have to satisfy at least 4 criteria: (i) the mechanism of CI assembly should closely mimic that of the human enzyme, (ii) it should be highly enriched with mitochondria to enable the examination of the effects of 1000s of candidate genes on CI assembly rather easily, (iii) the genetic tool kit in such an organism should be significantly advanced to the point where the effects of 1000s of candidate genes on CI assembly can rapidly be tested, and finally (iv) it should be possible to analyze CI assembly in vivo where it is subject to both developmental and environmental signals, and not prone to cell culture artifacts. None of the current model systems for studying CI assembly (in Neurospora crassa and various mammalian cell lines) satisfy all 4 criteria. To facilitate the discovery of RRs of CI assembly, we are using the mitochondria-enriched flight muscles in Drosophila as a novel system to study CI assembly as it satisfies all four criteria. We find that CI biogenesis in Drosophila skeletal muscles proceeds via the formation of ~315-, ~370-, ~550-, and ~815 kDa CI assembly intermediates as has been described in mammalian systems; and Drosophila CI has a comparable number of subunits as the human enzyme. Importantly, mutations in Drosophila orthologs of CIAFs described in humans, also impair CI assembly in Drosophila, further showing that the mechanism of CI assembly is conserved between humans and Drosophila. Here, we propose to use a genetic and proteomic approach to identify novel RRs of CI assembly in this system; and test our candidate regulators in both Drosophila and human cells. The ease of isolating copious amounts of mitochondria from flight muscles, extensive arsenal of tools for genetic analyses, relatively short generation time, and limited gene redundancy in Drosophila are assets that should facilitate the discovery of RRs of CI assembly."
"9321855","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this Career Development Award (K99/R00) is to provide protected time for the candidate to obtain the necessary training and mentoring to establish an independent clinical research program for understanding physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying pain modulation and how these mechanisms contribute to Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJD). The current proposal extends the candidate's previous background in stress and pain psychophysics with additional training to investigate physiological and psychological factors involved in the pathophysiology of TMJD. Specific training areas in the mentored phase of the K99 will help the candidate achieve several short-term goals including developing expertise in psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), psychological theory and assessment, and clinical exposure through guided mentorship, didactic coursework, and applied research experiences in healthy controls (HC) and in patients with TMJD. In addition, the training will establish the candidate as an independent clinical researcher by increasing his productivity, which will assist in obtaining a tenure-track faculty position and independent funding. Long term goals of the training include establishing an independent research laboratory to investigate physiological and psychological factors mediating clinical and experimental pain. The mentored phase of the K99 will take place at the University of Florida College of Dentistry under the direct mentorship of Dr. Roger Fillingim, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Dr. Joseph Riley, Ph.D., both mentors are nationally and internationally respected experts in the field of pain and orofacial research. The environment is ideal for this project because the university places a strong emphasis on pain research including orofacial pain. The necessary laboratory, equipment, and supplies needed to complete the series of studies described in this proposal are available to the candidate. The research plan offers a series of studies that are designed to elucidate factors mediating the reduced efficacy of endogenous pain inhibition TMJD patients based on a model of conditioned pain modulation (CPM). In this model, pain inhibition is characterized by a reduction of heat pain sensitivity during exposure to a tonic conditioning stimulus. While the mechanisms remain unknown, the reduced pain inhibitory capacity in TMJD could be due to a maladaptive stress system, which is influenced by abnormal physiological (i.e., endogenous opioids, cholecystokinin) and psychological (i.e., catastrophizing) responses to pain. The research plan will use the skills developed during the career plan to investigate the impact of maladaptive neuroendocrine and pro-inflammatory immune responses and negative psychological reactions as important factors in reduced pain inhibition in TMJD. These observations will be accomplished by cross-sectional evaluations (Aim 1) and experimental manipulations of pain expectation (Aim 2). The candidate will use the skills and knowledge gained during the mentored training phase (K99) to transition to the independent (R00) phase. Aim 3 will investigate the interactions of endogenous opioid and cholecystokinin systems with psychological and biological responses to pain. The proposed series of studies will provide a more thorough understanding of endogenous pain modulation in patients who suffer with TMJD. Since it is the goal of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) to understand the causes of orofacial pain, the mechanisms underlying endogenous pain inhibition are a potential target that could assist in development of therapies to prevent and treat TMJD."
"9332425","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The lung is constantly bombarded by inhaled particles and antigens, and has evolved numerous defense mechanisms that guard against the development of inflammation due to otherwise innocuous substances. These defense mechanisms include mucociliary clearance, the mucosal immune system, and epithelial apical junctional complexes (AJC). In recent years there have been significant advances in our understanding of junctional complex structure and function. However, most research to-date has been conducted with model epithelia and in non-pulmonary tissues, and many questions remain about the function of epithelial junctional complexes at mucosal surfaces. The relationship between barrier structure, antigen sampling by intraepithelial dendritic cells (DC), and sensing of mucosal danger needs further study. Interestingly, airway epithelial junction dysfunction is increasingly associated with asthma, but the underlying mechanisms involved and consequences for airway inflammation remain poorly understood. Furthermore, there are no good assays of outside/in airway permeability in clinical use. Here we show that Th2 cytokines, synthetic double stranded RNA (dsRNA), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induce striking disassembly of airway AJC. We identified a novel signaling pathway linking dsRNA and RSV with protein kinase D (PKD) and cytoskeletal remodeling resulting in airway epithelial junction dysfunction. Very little is known about the expression and function of PKD in the lung, but emerging evidence suggests that this versatile signaling molecule may play an important role in mucosal immunity in general. We next used a mouse model of mucosal sensitization with endotoxin-free ovalbumin (Ova), which when inhaled together with the dsRNA polyI:C, results in allergic-type inflammation two weeks later following challenge with Ova alone. Using reciprocal bone marrow chimeric mice, toll-like receptor 3(TLR3) expression was required in radioresistant (stromal) cells in order for dsRNA to act as a pro-allergic inhaled adjuvant. Here we will build on these data and propose a translational research program that will provide new insights into airway epithelial barrier function and epithelial:DC cross-talk of relevance to respiratory viral infections and allergic airway inflammation. We propose four specific aims that will: (1) Define the precise roles of epithelial PKD and dsRNA sensors during mucosal sensitization, (2) Test the hypothesis occludin overexpression inhibits mucosal allergen sensitization, (3) Test the hypothesis that RSV infection causes sustained dysfunction of the airway epithelial barrier in a PKD-dependent manner, and (4) Develop the Leaky Lung Test, a clinically useful and non-invasive assay of outside/in airway permeability."
"9330769","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Coronary microvascular dysfunction is an early and persistent defect in states of insulin resistance (IR) that are closely associated with inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Thus, RAAS activation is a major factor in IR-associated vascular dysfunction, acting via several mechanisms including oxidative stress, fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction and activation of serine kinases such as Rho kinase (ROK). Much existing evidence implicates angiotensin II involvement in these adverse effects; however, accumulating evidence demonstrates pronounced effects of aldosterone acting through vascular mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) as a putative mediator of vascular dysfunction in states of IR. In clinical trials, MR antagonism reduced cardiovascular mortality via unknown mechanisms. Furthermore, recent evidence demonstrates a pronounced effect of MR antagonism to improve coronary flow reserve (CFR) in diabetic patients. The exact mechanism(s) underlying MR-mediated coronary vascular dysfunction; however, remain unclear. Mounting evidence suggests that MR signaling is a primary regulator of cellular calcium homeostasis and contractility. Specifically, MR signaling appears to be a tonic regulator of L-type calcium channel (CaV1.2) function/expression in cardiomyocytes. Our recent work demonstrates that increased activation of coronary vascular MR by aldosterone leads to increased agonist- and CaV1.2-mediated coronary vasoconstrictor responsiveness, similar to that noted in states of IR. Furthermore, our data demonstrate direct activation of ROK, a primary modulator of calcium sensitivity, by MR signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Therefore, this proposal seeks to investigate novel molecular mechanisms by which VSMC MR signaling promotes VSMC hypercontractility, increased coronary vasoconstriction and reductions in CFR associated with IR. We hypothesize that inappropriate activation of vascular, specifically VSMC, MRs plays a central role in the development of VSMC hypercontractility via the modulation of calcium influx and sensitivity in IR. A corollary to this hypothesis is that MR-dependent signaling in VSMC directly mediates coronary dysfunction and the impairment of coronary blood flow control in states of IR. In our proposal, we will utilize a novel, innovative VSMC-specific MR knockout (VSMC MR KO) mouse model coupled with state-of-the-art microvascular imaging and functional techniques, to evaluate the effect of MR signaling (activated by exogenous aldosterone or diet-induced IR) to modulate VSMC calcium handling, coronary arteriolar function ex vivo and CFR in vivo. To address Specific Aim 1, we will examine the relationship between MR activation and CaV1.2 channel function/expression and ROK activation in primary cultured VSMC, freshly dispersed murine coronary VSMC and intact coronary arterioles. These parameters will be correlated to functional measures including arteriolar vasoconstriction, blood pressure and CFR. Specific Aim 2 will extend these findings and address the role of MR activation in VSMC in IR as a primary mediator of IR-associated coronary hypercontractility/dysfunction and its relationship to arteriolar function and CFR. IR will be induced in wild-type and VSMC MR KO mice with a high-fat, high-sucrose diet and will be assessed by glucose tolerance testing."
"9340109","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): This is an application for renewal of the George M. O'Brien Kidney Center at Yale. This center was established with the overarching goal to facilitate basic, translational and clinical research that will advance the prevention and treatment of kidney diseases. Major research areas of emphasis are renal epithelial cell biology and physiology; inherited kidney disease and kidney development; acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD); and vascular biology, inflammation and glomerular disease. A critically important benefit of the Center is to provide renal investigators both at Yale and across the country with access to highly specialized services not otherwise routinely available to support their research. To this end, the Center includes three cores to provide small animal physiology and phenotyping services to enable detailed characterization of renal function at the level of the tubule, the kidney, and the intact organism in normal animals and in animal models of renal injury and kidney disease; provide mouse genetics and cell line services to develop novel animal models and kidney cell lines to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying normal renal function and the pathophysiology of kidney diseases; and provide human genetics and clinical research services to enhance the ability of renal investigators to apply advanced genetic and genomic technologies to human investigation. Our cores currently have a combined user base of approximately 90 investigators, including over 40 at outside institutions. A Pilot and Feasibility Program has the goals of providing initial project funding for young investigators, attracting new investigators into the field of kidney disease research, and fostering translational and clinical studies directly related to kidney diseases. In addition, an Enrichment Program enhances kidney disease research by maximizing interaction and information sharing among renal investigators and trainees, and by providing activities to enhance recruitment and education of all levels of trainees from undergraduate students to postdoctoral fellows."
"9296661","Project Summary  Most immigrants begin their labor market trajectory in the US with lower earnings than natives with comparable levels of skills and work experience. Whether and how fast immigrants catch up to natives is critical for their own wellbeing and that of their children as numerous studies have found a strong relation between low parental income and a variety of negative outcomes for children, including worse health, greater likelihood of dropping out of school, higher risk of teenage pregnancy, and lower emotional and cognitive development.  Our knowledge of the economic progress of immigrants comes mostly from studies using a synthetic cohort approach whereby arrival cohorts are followed across decennial censuses. This approach suffers from well- known estimation problems. Chief among them is that repeated cross sections necessarily exclude individuals who return to their countries of origin between censuses, and also undercount circular migrants. The exclusion of circular and return migrants could lead to an overestimation of immigrants? ability to narrow the earnings gap with natives over time in the repeated cross-sectional approach. Our knowledge of the earnings assimilation of immigrants is also severely outdated as it is largely based on information from immigrants arriving in the 1980s or earlier.  In this study we will examine immigrant men?s earnings trajectories, and measure the extent to which the earnings gap with natives narrows over time, using a unique dataset that links respondents of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to their longitudinal earnings from individual tax records. We will follow immigrants? earnings for up to 20 years after arrival and compare their earnings trajectory to that of similarly-qualified natives. This longitudinal approach offers better estimates of the economic assimilation of foreign-born individuals over time than an approach using synthetic cohorts based on repeated cross sections. We will explore differences in the earnings growth trajectories of immigrants according to their level of education, country of origin, and racial and ethnic identification. Examining differences in the earnings assimilation of immigrants of different race and ethnicity is important because previous research has suggested that minority immigrants face greater obstacles in assimilating into the US labor market. We will also compare the earnings trajectories of different immigrant arrival cohorts to test the argument that immigrants are declining in their labor market ?quality? over time. Finally, we will use fixed-effects models to control for unobserved differences in immigrant selectivity, thereby isolating insofar as possible the effect of the context of reception on immigrants? earnings growth."
"9326349","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies indicate that cellular derived vesicles can alter the genomic phenotype of separate target cells by transfer of RNA species. Further work has indicated that mesenchymal stem cell-derived vesicles (MSC-dv) can mediate healing of injured renal and marrow tissue by transfer of microRNA. A critical need is to determine whether MSC-dv can be utilized to reverse kidney or marrow damage in humans so afflicted. The present proposal is to define the optimum approach for separating and characterizing MSC-dv carrying healing microRNA to renal tissue injured by glycerol exposure or by ischemia/reperfusion or marrow tissue (stem cells) injured by irradiation. The microRNA in healing MSC-dv will then be determined by deep sequencing and the specific healing microRNA determined by its capacity to be delivered to injured renal and marrow cell line models and restore proliferation and reduce apoptosis. This will be carried out by lipofecting injured cell lines and analyzing proliferation and apoptosis. We will also characterize optimal approaches to loading healing MSC-dv with specific healing microRNA(s). It is anticipated that these studies will yield the following expected outcomes: 1.) An understanding of the role of micro RNAs in tissue restoration, 2.) a definition of the specific micro RNA or subset of microRNAs responsible for cell fate change and 3.) the development an approach for the delivery of MSC vesicle microRNA to restore injured renal or marrow tissue. This constitutes Stage 1 of the proposal. In Stage 2, after the determination of a healing microRNA packaged optimally in MCS-dv for delivery to injured marrow or renal tissue, we next need to optimize delivery schedule for tissue repair, evaluate early and late toxicity, and distribution of the infued agent. In addition, we need to evaluate the stability of healing phenotype of the microRNA rich MSC-d vesicles with storage. Optimal healing levels will be assessed in time course experiments where different times and frequencies of infusion are evaluated as to healing effects in our models. During the course of these studies we will also determine early and late toxicities in the infused animals. Total animal organ histology and survival will also be assessed. Next we will track tissue distribution after an optimal infusion schedule and determine the stability of MSC-dv over time under different conditions. The totality of the studies outlined in Stage 1 and 2 are unique and innovative. The delivery of microRNA in MSC-dv to heal tissue injuries is designed to prepare the basis for therapeutic interventions in different renal and marrow diseases which have not been previously attempted."
"9383994","The long term goal of this project is to translate novel findings in the field of innate immunity into early phase immunotherapy clinical trials for patients with hematologic malignancies. In this proposal we focus on acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive cancer of developing myeloid cells that has a poor prognosis, with <30% of patients treated with standard therapy achieving long-term disease-free survival. While allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a standard treatment that is potentially curative for some patients with AML, this therapy is associated with significant morbidity (graft versus host disease and infection) and treatment-related mortality. This limits HCT applicability and overall effectiveness in this disease of older individuals. One promising strategy that preserves the anti-leukemia effector function against AML, without the morbidity and mortality of HCT, is the adoptive transfer of allogeneic lymphocytes.  Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that are specialized to eliminate malignantly transformed target cells. Clinical studies for AML patients using HLA-haploidentical allogeneic HCT have shown that the reactivity of donor NK cells against the patients' leukemia predicts for long-term disease-free survival. Adoptive immunotherapy with enriched allogeneic NK cell products administered to patients with active AML have resulted in complete remissions, although these are achieved in a minority of patients and are of limited duration. We hypothesize that enhancing NK cell recognition of, and effector function against, AML blasts will result in improved clinical outcomes following adoptive NK cell therapy.  Recently, paradigm shifting studies have shown that NK cells exhibit immune memory, a property previously attributed only to adaptive T and B lymphocytes. We have established that human NK cells exhibit innate memory following a brief combined stimulation with interleukins (IL)-12, -15, and -18. Preliminary data demonstrates that memory-like NK cells exhibit significantly enhanced AML recognition, functionality, longevity, and proliferative potential compared to naive or control NK cells. Recent preliminary data also shows that administration of allogeneic memory-like NK cells is safe, feasible, and results in clinical responses in AML patients. Thus, we hypothesize that allogeneic memory-like NK cells administered as adoptive immunotherapy for patients with AML will exhibit potent anti-leukemia responses. In this proposal, we will 1) test the safety and efficacy of allogeneic memory-like NK cell adoptive immunotherapy in a first-in-human phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with relapsed AML, 2) define memory-like NK cell correlates of clinical response, and elucidate key mechanisms important for memory-like NK cell anti-AML responses, and 3) define the importance of NKG2A as a memory-like NK cell checkpoint, and elucidate mechanisms of AML resistance to memory-like NK cell therapy."
"9318421","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this HIVRAD consortium is to develop and compare four novel vaccine candidates designed to deliver HIV envelope (Env) trimers mimicking the presentation of Env by HIV infection and ultimately generating broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against the AIDS virus. The team will work towards this goal by completing objectives in four Specific Aims. Aim 1 intends to design, develop, and characterize vaccine candidates that deliver stabilized, membrane-anchored Clade C 1086 spikes adapted from the well-ordered native flexibly linked (NFL) trimer design (EnvNFL). Aim 2 will conduct initial immunogenicity studies comparing the candidates in inbred mice including analysis of gene expression profiles, cellular and humoral immune responses, and Env-specific antibodies and B-cells guiding iterative improvement of the candidates. Aim 3 will further test the optimized candidates in small animal models that enable evaluation of HIV-neutralization activity elicited by vaccination including rabbits and novel, genetically-modified mice (VelocImmune(r)) that express antibodies with human VH and Vk domains. Aim 4 will prioritize two vaccine regimens for evaluation in macaques based on accumulated comparative data from small animal studies in Aims 2 and 3, ultimately conducting mucosal SHIV challenge experiments to correlate vaccine performance with degree of resistance to SHIV infection. Compared to previous HIV vaccine trials, this program hypothesizes that performance gains can be achieved if an Env vaccine is designed to deliver authentic spikes arrayed on enveloped particles, and if a trimer delivery platform can be identified that provides immunostimulatory signals promoting polyclonal responses of greater epitope breadth encompassing Abs with bNAb specificities. To this end, four novel Env trimer vaccines based on different delivery technologies that will evoke unique immune response profiles will be developed and compared. Each vaccine will deliver clade C trimers based on the EnvNFL design to promote efficient assembly of well-ordered complexes of greater uniformity and increased stability. The four vaccine platforms are: 1) RNActive(r) technology, an innovative mRNA vector and adjuvant delivery system; 2) EnvNFL trimers assembled on liposome-based VLPs; 3) EnvNFL trimers displayed on inactivated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles; and 4) EnvNFL delivered with a live VSV vector that incorporates Env in its viral envelope. Three projects supported by three cores will undertake the above experimental plan. Project 1 will design and develop the vectors in concert with Project 2, which will provide the Env trimers and develop a liposome-based vaccine, while Project 3 will evaluate the HIV Env-specific B cell repertoire in the small animal and NHP studies. Core C will provide gene signature analysis of the vaccine platforms and Core B will carry out the small animal and NHP studies. Administrative Core A will provide overall management of the program. Overall, the program will develop four new Env vaccines delivering stabilized trimers, and generate a comprehensive database on their performance in multiple animal models including nonhuman primates."
"9334185","Mouse models of human disease have provided essential insights into renal pathophysiological processes and are an important preclinical resource to test therapeutic and preventive approaches in acute kidney injury (AKI). The specific aims of Core B are to provide the facilities and requisite skills 1) to study murine models of AKI, 2) for small animal imaging, and 3) to determine renal physiological changes in AKI. This core will specifically provide (i) expertise in development and training in the use of rodent models of AKI specifically in the setting of ischemia/reperfusion injury, sepsis and renal transplantation, (ii) a multi-modality small animal imaging core that will provide state-of-the-art molecular imaging, including functional, structural and metabolic imaging using magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy, high frequency ultrasonography, microCT, gamma-ray imaging (gamma camera, microSPECT/CT, microPET/CT), and optical imaging (bioluminescence and fluorescence), and (iii) a physiology core that will provide expertise and training for studying renal function on the whole kidney and at the single nephron level, including micropuncture techniques and determination of GFR, microanalysis of tubular fluid and tubular reabsorption, renal hemodynamics with assessment of tubuloglomerular feedback, and metabolic assessment of kidney oxygen consumption in rodents. Core B will also provide technical expertise for the isolation of primary renal and vascular cells in culture from rodents.    The intent of Core B is to provide unique resources that help overcome barriers for investigators to utilize relevant rodent models for in vivo studies and rodent cell lines for in vitro studies to advance understanding of the pathophysiology of AKI. Core B has been very successful in supporting the kidney research community. Since the inception of Core B, more than 5,800 procedures have been performed for 80 principal investigators involving 92 projects. Of the 80 investigators, 60 (75%) were non-core personnel. The number of investigators using Core B each year is increasing, as is the annual publication rate. Core B has also supported the research efforts of 11 Pilot and Feasibility grant awardees. These combined efforts have been currently recognized in 83 peer-reviewed publications. The sophisticated infrastructure coupled with the unique expertise of Core B will continue to catalyze collaborative efforts between and UCSD and produce innovative new initiatives that will advance AKI research."
"9302724","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic cigarettes (ECIGs) are among the most important issues in public health today due to their dramatic increase in popularity. However, very little is known about ECIGs, including what factors may make them more likely to be used and abused. Examining factors that influence nicotine yield, delivery, and subjective effects from ECIGs is essential to understanding their abuse liability. Limited pre-clinical research has revealed that nicotine yield may be influenced by the ratio of the two liquid vehicles, propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG), most commonly found in ECIG solutions. Specifically, higher proportions of PG result in greater nicotine yields. However, the aerosols generated in this research were not produced by actual ECIG users' puffing behaviors, suggesting that the nicotine yields found may not be indicative of actual ECIG users' nicotine exposure. Moreover, the influence of PG:VG ratio on nicotine delivery and subjective effects associated with ECIG use has not been examined previously. This proposal describes a two-part study. The first examines the effect of PG and VG on nicotine delivery and subjective effects using a within-subjects design. Thirty experienced ECIG users will use an ECIG in five conditions that will differ only by the PG:VG ratio: 100:0, 70:30, 50:50, 30:70, and 0:100 (device voltage, heater resistance, liquid nicotine concentration, puff number, and interpuff interval all will be held constant). Plasma nicotine concentration, subjective effects, and puffing behaviors will be recorded in each condition. The second will generate ECIG aerosols using the puffing behavior recorded from ECIG users in the first part of the study and under identical experimental conditions (e.g., PG:VG ratio). The aerosol produced will be captured and assessed for nicotine yield. The primary hypotheses are that higher proportions of PG will result in greater nicotine delivery and subjective effect profiles suggestive of higher abuse liability in ECIG users and produce aerosols with higher nicotine yields. Results from this project will result in further understanding of the factors that influence the abuse liability of ECIGs and could inform regulation of these products."
"9373984","Project Summary/Abstract  Children with all levels of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are at increased risk for deficits in executive function, leading to impairments in behavior regulation and reduced academic achievement. The mechanisms linking SDB to daytime deficits are thought to include sleep disruption and/or neural damage from hypoxemia, but the relative contribution of each is unclear. Analyses of slow-wave activity (SWA) in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, a marker of both the restorative function of sleep and neural plasticity, have failed to consistently identify differences between SDB and healthy controls. The reasons for the inconsistencies in these data are likely multifactorial, but recent theoretical and technological advances highlight two likely contributors. First, our conceptual understanding of sleep has changed dramatically in the past few years; we now know that sleep is not a global, whole brain phenomenon, but instead is a process that can, and does, occur regionally. Regional sleep is particularly relevant during development; recent data demonstrate that the peak distribution of cortical SWA changes as a function of age. Prior EEG investigations of sleep in SDB have used standard clinical EEG montages that use only a few scalp electrodes. Given the developmental trajectory of SWA, such limited montages are not optimized to capture the distribution of SWA in the developing brain. Second, we now know that sleep and wake can co-exist in the brain. Recent data demonstrates that when neurons get `sleepy' due to extended use or sleep deprivation, they account for this by going to sleep, interrupting and resuming their discharge pattern as they do in sleep, in an otherwise wake brain. Critically, when neurons go to sleep in areas relevant for behavior, the result in lapses in neurobehavioral performance.  Using high-density EEG (hdEEG, 256 channel electroencephalography) we recently identified a reduction in SWA in the posterior cortex during NREM in a group of 5-13 year old children with SDB suggesting the presence of local impairments in sleep restoration and quality. Our central hypothesis is that regional loss of nocturnal SWA will result in episodes of local sleep during wakefulness that will underpin the well-documented daytime impairments common to SBD. We will test our hypothesis by 1. Confirming regional reductions in SWA in a larger group of children with SDB, and 2. Examining the relationship between neurobehavioral lapses and daytime theta activity (an EEG index of local sleep). The proposed study will increase our understanding of mechanisms contributing to daytime impairment in pediatric SDB as well as provide pilot data to design a future study to assess the effect of treatment on sleep EEG and daytime function."
"9215062","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for most end stage renal diseases, but remains encumbered by its requirement for chronic, multi-drug immunosuppression to prevent rejection. These regimens are incompletely effective ? most recipients eventually lose graft function to indolent rejection ? and are associated with serious side effects. Two particular agents, calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and steroids are widely used and dominate the morbidity observed in most patients. In 2011, belatacept, a fusion protein specific for CD28/B7 co-stimulation pathways, was introduced as a CNI alternative. The approved belatacept regimen, although avoiding CNIs, relies on steroids, and more importantly, has been associated with high rates of early acute rejection. Over the past 6 years, we have conducted a phase 2 clinical trial under the FDA OPD program investigating an alternative belatacept-based regimen that combines three approved drugs: alemtuzumab, belatacept and sirolimus, avoiding both CNIs and steroids, and reducing the rate of early acute rejection. The initial trial has been highly successful. Enrollment has been completed in two cohorts; the first, 20 low immunologic risk recipients of living related donor kidneys, and the second, a more generalizable cohort of 20 recipients, including deceased donor kidneys and sensitized recipients. There has been no graft or patient loss, and the regimen has avoided early rejection. Importantly, we have shown that many patients can be eventually withdrawn from sirolimus and maintained solely on belatacept, avoiding all daily immunosuppressive drugs in lieu of a single monthly infusion free of off-target side effects. As the funding cycle of the OPD grant mechanism is shorter than the time required to complete follow-up of enrolled patients, this application seeks three years of funding to complete the trial, and glean its unique clinical and mechanistic insights. The proposed study has two Specific Aims, each stemming from the ongoing study. Specific Aim 1 facilitates clinical follow-up of all patients transplanted under this trial to their planned 5-year post-transplant time point, continuing their medical and immunosuppressive management, study-related biopsies, and functional assessment in keeping with the originally approved protocol. Specific Aim 2 allows us to study this unprecedented cohort of patients, contrasting those maintained rejection-free on belatacept monotherapy to those requiring adjuvant immunosuppression. Specific attention will be directed toward polychromatic, flow cytometric immunophenotyping, through the period of homeostatic repopulation and into the establishment of a post-transplant steady state, to characterize the nature of patients maintained rejection-free solely through blockade of the CD28/B7 pathway. We will follow-up and develop observations made during the initial course of this study. These include post-depletional reconstitution of a more naïve T cell repertoire with enhanced reliance on CD28 co-stimulation, action of regulatory lymphocyte populations whose function is unfettered without CNIs, and sirolimus-driven endothelial changes fostering a tolerogenic graft-recipient interface."
"9407941","P3. Abstract The mature HIV-1 capsid is an ordered protein shell that houses the viral genome and other viral or host factors necessary for infection of a target cell. Its structure and stability are critical to infection?it must stay at least partially assembled until it reaches the nuclear periphery, and a variety of host factors, either beneficial or inhibitory to the virus, recognize specific capsid patterns only present in assembled cores. Potentially hundreds of host factors bind the HIV-1 capsid, but our knowledge of host factor-capsid interactions at the molecular level has been limited, in part caused by a lack of soluble capsid constructs that recapitulate lattice interfaces in the assembled state and by challenges in purifying recombinant capsid-binding host factors. To overcome these obstacles, we propose to design and build a repertoire of soluble capsid assemblies that represent all unique capsid-lattice interfaces. This will be achieved by making use of previously published intra-hexamer engineered disulfides and by incorporating the SpyCatcher/SpyTag system to create stable isopeptide bonds between hexamers. With these new capsid assemblies in hand, we will use well-established biophysical and biochemical techniques to map binding modes and determine high-resolution structures of these capsid assemblies in complex with a range of host factors including TRIM5?, TRIMCyp, MxB, Fez1, and CypA, most of which we have optimized for expression and purification. The proposed work will allow us to overcome major experimental hurdles to advance mechanistic understandings of the capsid-related key steps of the HIV life cycle."

"9246039","Summary: In parts of Africa, there is a heavy burden of parasitic diseases, including intestinal worms of several genera, collectively called helminths, and malaria. Some recent studies have implicated the worms in particular, in biasing the immune response towards a Th2 phenotype resulting in alteration of T cell and B cell responses. In fact recent work in mice has shown that pre-existing infection with Schistosoma mansoni down-regulates anti-HepB antibody levels and reduces response to vaccine and multiple reports have indicated that helminthic infections may be a contributing cause for weak responsiveness to the vaccines. However, very little information is available on the influence of parasites in general or helminth in particular on host immune response to vaccines in humans. A second critical contributor to diseases and many physiological parameters in humans is the microbiome. The intestinal microbiome has been shown to be related to a broad range of human diseases including many viral and metabolic diseases. Despite this emerging recognition that the microbiome has profound effects on immune and inflammatory processes in mammals, the effects of the microbiome on vaccine responses are less well defined. Our major hypothesis is that parasitic infection will alter the HepB vaccine response by modifying the state of the innate immune system and microbiome complexity, thereby qualitatively compromising the de novo priming of vaccine-induced T cell and B cell immunity. Our objective is to integrate and develop immune models of the molecular and sub-network signatures that characterize host response to HepB vaccination from low to high helminth burden, by using innovative bioinformatics and systems biology analyses."
"9323756","Project Summary for Mathematical Modeling and Bioinformatics Core The goal of this Core is to provide mathematical modeling and bioinformatics support for the three research projects. We have assembled a team of experts with experience in modeling HIV viral dynamics, the effects of antiretroviral therapy, the establishment of the HIV reservoir, and the effects of latency reversing agents on the reservoir and on the time to viral load rebound after ART termination. We also have experience in developing models of post-treatment control. In addition, we have experience in HIV sequence analysis and bioinformatics that will allow us to gain information from rebounding virus. Our technical expertise includes working with deterministic and stochastic models as well as in the development of simulation models. We have proven capabilities in fitting models to data, estimating parameters, parameter sensitivity analysis, parameter identification, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, pharmacometrics and biostatistics. Team members not only have modeling experience but have also worked with the three project PIs in the past and have good working relationships. The Core also has superb computing resources available through Los Alamos National Laboratory. The models to be developed by the Core will address strategies for cure or viral remission in pediatric and adult cases of HIV as well as in nonhuman primates infected with SIV. The models will provide a basis for synergy between the various projects, where information learned from models in one arena can inform models in another area. For example, models of pediatric patients with immature immune systems, when compared with model results for HIV-infected adults, may provide information about the role of more developed immune responses in HIV control. Models of the effects of checkpoint inhibitors and latency reversing agents in nonhuman primates may inform on the effects of immune modulators in HIV infected children and adults. Thus, through modeling we foresee integrating information obtained from all three research projects to benefit the overall goal of achieving viral remission or cure."

"9241962","Early diagnosis of systemic infection in humans and prediction of clinical outcome both remain elusive, despite the critical need for both. The two basic approaches for diagnosis and prognosis, direct identification of the infectious agent and measurement of host response features, have been limited by reliance on cultivation, pre-test assumptions about specific agents, limited breadth of coverage, and an insufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and computational tools for data analysis provide new opportunities for characterizing complex mixtures of DNA and RNA molecules in a minimally-biased fashion, and for detecting rare sequences of interest in clinical specimens. The goals of this project are to characterize microbial and viral genomic sequences in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects, as well as subjects with fever (and in some cases, known causative infectious agents) at the time of clinical presentation, to characterize human genome-wide RNA patterns in peripheral blood, and then to integrate these complementary forms of data so as to derive putative diagnostic and prognostic signatures for systemic infection. We propose three aims; (1) characterize microbial and viral sequences and host RNAs in peripheral blood of non-febrile, healthy subjects; (2) characterize microbial and viral sequences and host RNAs in human blood during febrile illness; and (3) identify and validate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers during early stages of febrile illness based on microbial and viral sequences, host RNAs, and clinical features. Our long-term objectives are to validate novel early diagnostic and prognostic signatures for several classes and species of pathogens and their related clinical syndromes, with attention to early predictors of subsequent critical illness requiring intensive care. Sequence-based signatures will serve as the basis for the design of probes on CMOS electrochemical-based active microarrays and other technologies, so that they can be exploited and deployed at the point-of-care in an easy-to-use format."
"9323527","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Purposeful human behavior requires attention, decisions and action, all basic functions mediated by brain networks primarily located in the neocortex, but modulated and shaped by sub-cortical processing. Behavioral and brain mechanisms of attention, including vigilance, orienting and perceptual and action selection, are key gateways into high-level function. Thus, in a general and even specific sense, attention, decision making and the ensuing actions define human mental activities. Deficits in these functions are common in both neurological and psychiatric disorders and can result in a wide range of higher-order behavioral deficits. We propose to establish a COBRE Center for Central Nervous System Function at Brown University that will investigate the mechanisms of higher brain function, with a focus on attention, decision making and action and disorders that modify these key systems, using a combination of genetic, behavior, and systems neuroscience approaches. This COBRE consists of five research projects led by junior faculty. Morrow will investigate the neurobiology of children diagnosed with difficult-to-treat autism, a group that often presents with obsessive compulsive behaviors. Amso will investigate the typical development of visual selective attention and the mechanisms of its disruption in autism spectrum disorder. Worden will examine selective attention mechanisms resulting from conflict. Asaad will investigate interactions between neocortex and basal ganglia during attention-based associative decision-making. Song will investigate how multiple neural systems become integrated to select actions, such as choosing to pick up a red instead of a blue pencil. A Design and Analysis Core will facilitate the research goals of these projects and benefit the broader Brown community by developing new tools and optimizing existing ones to image brain structure and function with MRI and EEG and neural recordings; and ensuring proper experimental design and analysis procedures across projects. Project leaders will benefit from senior faculty mentors who will provide support and guidance on research, publication, and grant preparation. An Administrative Core will oversee the operations of this COBRE (Center. The COBRE Center for Central Nervous System Function will fall under the auspices of the Brown Institute for Brain Science.

"9407758","Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a major unresolved medical issue impacting over 1 million patients in the United States alone. As of 2011, the global IBD therapeutics market had an estimated value of over $4.8 billion, and it is anticipated that the market will grow to over $6.2 billion by the end of 2017. IBD consists of two major disorders, Crohn?s disease and ulcerative colitis, both of which are typified by severe and chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Despite decades of research, disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood and there is no cure. The current standard of care for IBD focuses on disease management and mitigation of symptoms in order to minimize complications and patient suffering. Initial symptomatic relief may be achieved with anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, but long term therapy with these agents is not possible due to severe side effects. Longer term therapies for symptom suppression include the immunomodulatory drugs and anti-TNF-? monoclonal antibody, but none of these options are curative, and disease related morbidity remains unacceptably high. Surgical intervention to remove diseased tissue is an option, but reoccurrence is high in Crohn?s disease. Ultimately, curative therapeutic agents are necessary in order to fully address IBD. Recent literature reports have linked IBD to dysregulation of 5-HT activity in the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, TPH1-deficient mice exhibit significantly reduced IBD severity in mouse models (dextran sulfate sodium induced colitis and dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid induced colitis) as a result of decreased 5-HT in the gut. Artificial restoration of 5-HT in the gastrointestinal tract led to an increase in IBD severity in these models, strongly suggesting a key role for 5-HT in IBD. Similarly, attempts to induce colitis in mice lacking the 5-HT7 receptor led to significantly lower severity IBD than that observed in the wild type mice. Finally, the selective 5- HT7 receptor antagonist SB-269970 ameliorated acute and chronic DSS induced colitis in mice. Disease manifestation, histological damage, and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were all reduced. This has been attributed to the suppression of 5-HT7 activity in colonic dendritic cells, which play a pivotal role in primary immune response and intestinal inflammation associated with IBD. These studies implicate the 5-HT7 receptor as an important player in the progression of IBD and indicate that suppression of 5-HT7 activity with a selective 5-HT7 antagonist is a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of IBD. We have identified novel, selective 5-HT7 antagonists that have binding potencies and functional efficacy in the low nanomolar range. In addition, our initial proof of concept lead compound 170073 is efficacious in the acute and chronic DSS mouse models when dosed at 10 mg/kg IP, confirming the viability of our approach. As minimization of BBB penetration remains a main focus of the program, we have previously selected the spiro-sulfonamide 230168 as a test case for the correlation of CNS penetration and TPSA. Preliminary PK data on this compound demonstrated a decrease in CNS penetration, validating this approach. Through the course of this program, we will expand the scope of our chemical equity by exploring the chemical space surrounding our lead series and develop additional novel scaffolds. These efforts will focus on developing novel, orally bioavailable, lead compounds exhibiting minimal CNS penetration that are suitable for advanced in vivo efficacy studies as part of a phase 2 SBIR/STTR program."
"9337248","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is highly prevalent in Veterans and the VA spends >$177 million yearly on outpatient prescriptions for GERD. GERD decreases the quality of life and increases the risk for other co-morbidities, and increases the likelihood that a Veteran will undergo costly diagnostic endoscopy. Obesity is associated with significantly increased risk for GERD and Veteran are disproportionately overweight and obese. Thus, the American Gastroenterology Association guidelines advise weight loss for overweight/obese people with GERD.  It has long been thought that several dietary factors (acidic foods, spicy foods, mint, chocolate, caffeine and alcohol) as well as high-fat diet may precipitate GERD symptoms - none of which have borne out to close scrutiny. Much of the investigation on dietary factors has targeted total and saturated fat intake as risk factors. When data are adjusted for BMI the relationships between total or saturated fat intake and GERD are not significant. We hypothesize that a specific dietary intervention focused on carbohydrate intake will have significant efficacy to address GERD.  We recently conducted a nutrition intervention utilizing a low-carbohydrate / high-fat diet in adults with Class I obesity (BMI 30.0-39.9). At baseline, 25% of subjects reported experiencing GERD symptoms (heartburn, reflux and/or indigestion) at least once a week. Over 1/3 used a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or histamine 2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) at least once a week. At baseline, we found that subjects with GERD had significantly higher total sugar intakes (101.6      +/--50.3 vs 82.5 +/- 40.9 grams/day, p = 0.024), but not higher total fat intakes. Notably, total sugar intake was a strong predictor of having GERD symptoms (p = 0.007). Most unexpectedly, all GERD symptoms and medication use had resolved by completion of the 9-week low carbohydrate / high fat diet intervention. Moreover, reduced total sugar intake was significantly associated with improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR score: r =0.37, p =0.001), independent of weight loss. In this proposal we will capitalize on these novel findings and test our overarching hypothesis that the type and/or amount of dietary carbohydrate intake contributes to GERD symptoms in obese people.  Specific Hypothesis: Our preliminary findings suggest a physiological mechanism between dietary intake and GERD that may be related to type of dietary carbohydrate intake (complex vs simple carbohydrate). We hypothesize that modifying the type of dietary carbohydrate consumed - by reducing the proportion of simple carbohydrate (sugars) consumed - will reduce or resolve GERD symptoms and medication use in obese Veterans with chronic GERD. We further hypothesize that the mechanistic effects of reducing simple carbohydrate intake is related to either: a) improved dietary fiber intake and/or glycemic load, and thus, reduced amount and duration of esophageal acid exposure; and/or b) improved insulin sensitivity which would positively influence the function of key gastrointestinal hormones that regulate gastric motility and/or lower esophageal sphincter function. Aim 1: To determine effects of dietary carbohydrate consumed (amount and type) on percent time with esophageal pH < 4.0, number of reflux episodes, GERD symptoms and GERD medication use in 200 obese Veterans who have chronic high frequency of GERD symptoms. Aim 2: To assess associations between GERD resolution variables and factors related to potential mechanisms by which modifying dietary carbohydrate intake would resolve/reduce GERD in obese Veterans."
"9324263","PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT D    PRDM9 is an important regulator of recombination and transcription; it is uniquely expressed during meiosis; and its absence arrests meiotic progress and gametogenesis. Thus Prdm9 has evolved functionally to serve specific meiotic and gametogenic requirements; however, the full range and nature of these requirements is not known. In particular, the roles of PRDMS in the sequence of meiotic events, its pattern of expression, its relationship to meiotically relevant nuclear structures and domains, and how the structure of PRDMS mediates its varied enzymatic effects are all unknown. The broad, long-term goals of this project are to resolve these issues by using both cellular and genetic strategies to identify mechanisms of when (Aim 1), where (Aim 2) and how (Aim 3) PRDMS promotes recombination site activation, and successful meiosis and spermatogenesis. The results of Aim 1 will establish which steps in meiosis are subject to PRDMS control and whether PRDMS function is required continuously or only at specific meiotic or spermatogenic substages. Because preliminary evidence suggests that PRDMS occupancy in nuclei may be transient, this is important for determining when chromatin marks are set, when recombination site selection occurs, and when transcriptional control is possible. The results of Aim 2 will determine localization of the PRDMS protein and use both PrdmQ mutants and well established mouse meiosis mutant models to determine the extent to which PRDMS function is required for or dependent on proteins crucial for meiosis, including those mediating chromosome synapsis and recombination. The results of Aim 3 will determine which functions of PRDMS in meiosis and gametogenesis require either its histone methyltransferase activity or its transcription-regulating KRAB domain. Recent results suggest that non-coding RNAs are among the transcriptional targets of PRDMS. In cooperation with goals of Projects B and C, this aim will define PRDMS-specific genomic sequence targets and functional clusters of sequences epigenetically marked and/or with transcription regulated by specific PRDMS domains and their relationship to PRDMS-dependent recombination hotspots. Together, the results of this project will complement the other Projects by setting PRDMS function into the well-defined sequence of meiotic chromosome events, more specifically resolving the molecular basis for its multiple roles, and contributing to understanding how PRDMS fits into the larger network of proteins that control meiosis and gametogenesis. An important facet of PRDMS biology addressed by this project is that PRDMS is a major determinant of fertility; the aberrant recombination and failed meiosis that occur in its absence can lead to sterility or birth defects in humans."
"9323532","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):   In this project, we will develop an understanding of the range of clinical symptoms and biological factors (genetics and brain morphometry) that correlate with obsessive-compulsive behavior in autism. Autism is a highly heterogeneous disorder. A significant number of patients do not improve substantially with current treatments. We refer to this group of patients as difficult-to-treat autism (DTT-Autism). Our preliminary data suggest that these patients exhibit obsessive-compulsive behavior (OCB). We will test the central hypothesis that participants with autism with high OCB represent a subtype of difficult-to-treat autism (DTT-Autism) who will have abnormal maturation of frontal-striatal circuitry and genetic susceptibilities analogous to those previously studied in obsessive-compulsive spectrum (OCS) conditions. Capitalizing on recent progress in neuroimaging and genetics in OC spectrum (OCS) disorders, this project will test the hypothesis that autism with OCB will share genetic and brain circuitry changes that have been demonstrated in OCS disorders. We will test the hypothesis that autism with OCB will correlate with abnormalities in frontal-striatal circuitry as is true for OCD and related OCS disorders. We will also look for associations between rare and common variation in OC-related genes and OCB symptoms in autism. Using a combination of approaches including clinical assessment, neuroimaging and genotyping, we will characterize the subtype of autism with OCB. This work is important as it studies a group of autism patients who are in greatest need of treatment development. If our hypotheses about the strong biologic relationship between OC spectrum disorders and autism with OCB are accurate, novel treatments for autism may be drawn from ongoing research in interventions in treatment-refractory OCD."
"9334511","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major psychoses (SZ, SAD, BDP), when defined by clinical phenomenology alone, overlap extensively on neurobiological, biomarker, co-morbid, symptomatic, and genetic characteristics. Our field may benefit from transformational re-conceptualizations of disease seen in other areas of medicine when biological variables are considered in disease definitions and identification. This approach in psychiatry will depend on: (i) use of well- defined disease domains, (ii) large samples that capture clinical heterogeneity and support statistical approaches, and (iii) ability to acquire quantifiable laboratory measures t inform re-conceptualization of disease characteristics. The 5-site B-SNIP focus is psychosis, an ideal clinical phenotype for this purpose. B- SNIP1 recruited over 2500 volunteers and performed dense phenotyping across multiple levels of analysis (cognitive, psychophysiological, brain imaging, social and clinical). The overall data described a continuum of phenotypic alterations across the DSM psychosis diagnoses (BDP, SAD, SZ) with little evidence of diagnostic specificity. In an attempt to use these dense phenotypic characteristics to define biologically based subgroups, we re-grouped probands using biomarkers and a multistage multivariate analysis procedure. We identified 3 psychosis Biotypes based on core phenotypic features. Biotypes showed unique differences across external validators that were not used in the initial construction of the categories. B-SNIP2 will replicate and extend B- SNIP1 using enhanced proband number, biomarker panel, and sophistication of multivariate statistical approaches. We will accomplish our goals within the context of two specific aims. SA(1) Construct a 'Psychosis Biomarker Database' (PBD): Recruit 3000 new psychosis probands and 600 healthy volunteers and collect data including clinical, psychosocial, electrophysiological, ocular motor, imaging and blood biomarkers. Core biomarkers (used for Biotype definition) and external validators (used for verifying neurobiological distinctiveness of Biotypes) will be collected as specified. Genetic characteristics of the participants will be obtained in collaboratin with the Broad Institute. SA(2) Contrast and test taxometric approaches to categorizing psychosis: Evaluate the ability of different taxonomic structures to define psychosis subgroups, based on data in the PBD: (i) DSM, (ii) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on clinical variables, (iii) B-SNIP1 Biotypes, (iv) B-SNIP2-generated biotypes based on biomarkers, and (v) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on both clinical variables and biomarkers. Beginning with traditional DSM diagnostic criteria as the taxonomy and testing (i)-(v) we will use linear, quadratic and nonparametric discriminant function analysis applied to external biomarker validators to examine the association between the traditional diagnostic system and the biologically- derived classification (imaging, psychosocial and genetic external validators). We will be able to determine the strongest taxonomic approach based on biological characteristics. We seek a rational classification of psychotic disorders that will be successful in identifying novel disease targets and treatments approaches."
"9198015","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To restore vision, we must understand how information is processed in the retina and what circuit mechanisms shape the retinal output. One such mechanism is the interaction between converging excitatory and inhibitory signals, which plays a central role in regulating key properties of a neuronal output across most neural circuits. The nature of this interaction can be diverse based on 1) site of action and 2) temporal dynamics and determines how a neuron integrates the excitatory and inhibitory inputs (synaptic integration) to produce a response. This is exemplified in the retina where inhibitory interneurons can act postsynaptically on the dendrites of ganglion cells or presynaptically on bipolar cell terminals. Moreover, synaptic inhibition can exhibit a variety of temporal relationships (motifs) with excitation in the retina such as feedforward, feedback and crossover inhibition. An emerging theme of recent work in non-primate retina has been the surprisingly complex functions performed by ganglion cells, which rely heavily on inhibition and the mechanisms of synaptic integration. However, several fundamental questions remain unaddressed. How does synaptic integration regulate the output of key retinal circuits that dominate our visual perception? For instance, the primate fovea accounts for ~50% of the retinal output and yet we know nothing about the functional properties of excitatory and inhibitory inputs and how ganglion cells integrate these inputs. Secondly, what is the relative contribution of synaptic inhibition acting on pre vs postsynaptic neurons in shaping visual signals? The long-term goal of this project is to understand how retinal circuits use different modes of synaptic integration to drive distinct functions and visually guided behavior. The current objective is to identify what mode of synaptic integration shapes responses across distinct ganglion cell types and how it depends on the site of action. My central hypothesis is that there are different motifs by which excitatory and inhibitory inputs interact and the relation between the motifs and ganglion cell function is of direct relevance to behavior. In Aim 1, we will determine the properties of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, how they interact in time and their impact on output of diverse ganglion cell types in primate fovea. Moreover, we will determine if the functional properties change with retinal location underlying the retinal basis of known differences in visual perception across visual field. In Aim 2, we will dissect the role of presynaptic inhibition in ganglion cell function in distinct retinal circuits using transgenic approaches in mouse retina that will selectively eliminate inhibitory receptors in specific bipolar cell types. A common theme of both Aims will be to map the anatomical correlate of synaptic inhibition and excitation in the above retinal circuits using a combination of light and electron microscopy techniques. This will help construct a structure-function framework for how synaptic integration shapes retinal output. The approach is innovative because we will determine ganglion cell function in the fovea, which has so far been largely obscure. Moreover, we will be able to isolate the role of presynaptic inhibition using transgenic manipulation in mouse retina. The proposed works is significant because it will provide a structure-function framework for understanding how synaptic integration refines GC function in key retinal circuits and thus bridge the gap between anatomy, function and behavior. Knowledge about function at the level of individual circuits will be crucial to understanding the retinal substrates for diverse visual behavior and for identifying targets in retinal diseases for therapeutic interventions."
"9354510","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death and is characterized by clinical symptoms and spirometry. Additional measures for diagnosis can be taken using imaging modalities such as CT. However, the evaluation of lung destruction in COPD is limited by the inability to visualize the activation f pathological processes since imaging modalities are only able to evaluate end-organ damage. In this proposal, we aim to develop molecular imaging probes to target two critical processes in the initiation and progression of COPD. Apoptosis, a process of programmed cellular death, correlates with COPD severity and is not seen in the normal adult lung or in the lungs of smokers without COPD. In the past several years we have demonstrated the successful ability of AxV-128/99mTc to detect apoptosis in vivo in a rabbit smoke exposure emphysema model. Additionally, Phase 1 studies have demonstrated safety of this agent in healthy patients. Therefore, in the first two aims of this proposal we will bring to the clinic AxV-128/99mTc, an Annexin V targeted SPECT/CT imaging probe, to image disease in patients with COPD. In the first Aim we will determine whether the use of AxV-128/99mTc allows the imaging of apoptosis in patients with COPD. In the second Aim we will determine if AxV-128/99mTc SPECT-CT imaging identifies peri-operative lung injury in patients with COPD compared to individuals without COPD. In a third aim, we will develop a new matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) targeted imaging agent. Although apoptosis is an important component of COPD pathogenesis, MMP production is fundamental to the process of lung destruction. Therefore, in this final aim we will perform preclinical studies with an MMP probe in order to detect the presence of MMPs in vivo. It is our hypothesis that the development an MMP probe would complement imaging of apoptosis in a COPD patient population. If successful, such an approach will be a powerful tool to potentially predict disease progression after diagnosis, identify patients at risk for disease exacerbation related lung function decline, and monitor response to disease targeted therapy.

"9214396","Project Summary/Abstract Tuberculosis (TB) is the single greatest infectious disease killer globally. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, caused by M. tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, threatens global TB control. The lengthy, expensive treatments that can cure MDR-TB are often not accessible by patients who need them, are only 50% successful, and cause unacceptably high toxicity. Rifampin, by virtue of its sterilizing activity against M. tuberculosis, plays an indispensable role in modern six-month `short-course' therapy for drug-susceptible TB. In MDR-TB, it is the infecting bacteria's resistance to rifampin that is primarily responsible for the prolonged treatment duration of 18-24 months that is required when rifampin cannot be used. Up to now, there are simply no anti-TB drugs with demonstrated sterilizing potency equivalent to that of rifampin. Strategies that restore rifampin activity, even partially, may have important treatment shortening effects for MDR-TB. Strategies to potentiate rifampin activity -- that is, to increase the antituberculosis effect of a given dose of rifampin -- may also be relevant for treatment of drug-susceptible TB. Lamichhane and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University recently showed that the combination of rifampin plus a carbapenem/?- lactamase inhibitor is synergistic and lowers the effective rifampin MIC, even restoring the activity of rifampin in vitro against rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis. Further, the combination of meropenem plus amoxicillin/clavulanate has potent antituberculosis activity in human TB and is safe and well-tolerated. We propose a focused, proof-of-concept clinical trial to determine whether, in pulmonary TB patients, a carbapenem/ ?-lactamase inhibitor combination can serve as a rifampin `sensitizer' and thereby potentiate the antituberculosis activity of rifampin. In this phase 2a randomized, open-label trial we will enroll patients with rifampin-susceptible pulmonary TB as well as patients with rifampin-resistant pulmonary TB. Participants will be randomized to receive one of 5 treatments for 7 days:  Baseline DST Regimen Regimen Components  Rifampin resistant Randomized (1:1) to: A Rifampin Meropenem Amx/Clv B - Meropenem Amx/Clv Rifampin susceptible Randomized (1:1:1) to: C Rifampin Meropenem Amx/Clv D - Meropenem Amx/Clv E Rifampin - - Abbreviations: DST, drug-susceptibility testing; Amx/Clv, amoxicillin/clavulanate The primary endpoint is mean daily fall in log10 colony forming units of M. tuberculosis per mL of sputum over 7 days of treatment. Safety of the regimens will be assessed. We will incorporate intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) and mycobacteriology assessments which, in the context of a range of M. tuberculosis minimum inhibitor concentrations (MICs) and expected inter-individual rifampin PK variability, will allow determination of the pharmacodynamic relationships between rifampin, rifampin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and antituberculosis activity when rifampin is administered in combination with meropenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate. The ability to recoup rifampin's antituberculosis activity, even partially, through combination with a carbapenem and ?-lactamase inhibitor would transform the treatment of MDR-TB and have implications for individual patients and public health. Potentiation of rifampin activity is also likely to be relevant for treatment of drug-susceptible TB, not only in certain patient sub-groups but also as a component of a treatment-shortening strategy applicable to the majority of TB patients worldwide."
"9346647","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While the number and diversity of African immigrants in the United States (US) has increased, their needs and practices remain poorly understood and there is a growing need to assess their health care needs and practices in order to provide this population with effective services. In the US, the influx of immigrants from African countries with high Female Genital Cutting (FGC) prevalence rates has exposed medical and mental health professionals unfamiliar with this procedure to multiple dilemmas in service provision, including legal and ethical considerations around child protection and how to respond appropriately to physical, sexual and emotional problems caused by FGC. The purpose of this study is to understand the impact of FGC on Female African immigrants in the New York City metropolitan area from the perspective of both the women who have endured the procedure and their health care providers. The long term goals of this study are to develop the foundation for interventions: a) to reduce the occurrence of FGC through sensitive education within African immigrant communities; b) to work with women who have had the procedure on how to work with their health care providers and thereby take the best care of themselves; and c) to train professionals to provide culturally-sensitive clinical services for those who have already undergone the procedure or are at risk for it. Findings from such a study could be an initial step towards developing training and practice policies for service providers.  The research team for this project reflects a strong background and extensive experience in conducting research with immigrant populations, and in particular with West African immigrants, and in reproductive health, trauma, and support networks. Throughout this project, the PI will consult with her mentors: Drs. Denise Hien (research with women and trauma) and Beatrice Krauss (research with reproductive health, HIV and support networks) and her collaborators, Drs. Adriana Espinosa and Tracy Chu will contribute their data analysis and research expertise. In addition, there will be two graduate- level female Research Assistants (RAs) in health or behavioral sciences with at least one year of interview and research experience to assist the PI in recruiting, interviewing and analysis. The RAs will receive extensive training from the PI on FGC, interviewing on extremely sensitive topics, using and introducing the respondents to Audio Computer Self Interview Technology (ACASI) and verifying its correct use. They will also receive additional training in grounded theory approach in order to identify emergent themes in the focus groups. Finally, two undergraduate students from the City College of New York (CCNY), which is part of the City University of New York (CUNY) will be given the opportunity to gain research experience by assisting with administrative aspects of the project."
"9323525","Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs)?identified in early embryos?are cell sources to make the heart during fetal development, and abnormal CPC development is closely associated with the etiology of congenital heart defects. In particular, proper regulation of their number and fate is essential for the ensuing heart growth. However, it remained unknown if they undergo self-renewal and if there is a dedicated environment for their maintenance. We have identified a renewing population of CPCs and their niche during development, and this proposal aims to elucidate the mechanisms governing the self-renewal and expansion of CPCs in vivo. Numb family proteins (NFPs) are conserved endocytic proteins with critical roles in cell-fate decisions. We found that precardiac deletion of NFPs depletes CPCs in the second pharyngeal arch (PA2) and is associated with a hypoplastic heart and early embryonic lethality. Based on this phenotype, we hypothesized that CPCs expand in the PA2 before their cardiac differentiation. Confirming the hypothesis, CPCs normally remained undifferentiated and expansive in the PA2, and differentiated into cardiac cells soon as they migrated out of the PA2. CPCs co-cultured with PA2 cells formed distinct colonies that continued to grow without cardiac differentiation, and differentiated into cardiac cells when PA2 cells were removed. These suggested that CPCs proliferate without differentiation in the PA2, suggesting the presence of a stem cell?niche paradigm. The proliferation was promoted by Hedgehog (Hh) proteins, crucial developmental and stem cell regulators enriched in the PA2, implying the Hh signaling may mediate the environmental role of PA2 cells. To determine the CPC-autonomous role of NFPs in the PA2, we generated lineage-specific mosaicism that allowed tracing of CPCs lacking NFPs without causing the lethality. The NFP-deleted mutant CPCs normally populated in the PA2, but failed to expand in the PA2 and progressed to cardiac cells. The mutant CPCs showed dramatically decreased levels of the conserved stem cell regulator Itgb1. Itgb1 physically associated with NFP in CPCs, and precardiac deletion of Itgb1 resulted in CPC depletion in the PA2, similar to the phenotype of NFP-deleted embryos. These findings set the stage for a mechanistic exploration of CPC maintenance by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The specific aims of this proposal are (1) to determine if NFPs play an instructive role for CPC renewal in the PA2, (2) to determine if NFPs prevent endolysosomal degradation of Itgb1 for CPC maintenance, and (3) To investigate if PA2 cells affect CPC renewal and expansion via Hh signaling. With these aims, I expect to elucidate the factors and mechanisms by which CPCs are maintained in a renewing state in their microenvironment. This knowledge will provide first insights into the mechanistic understanding of the self-renewal of CPCs in their microenvironment during heart development, which will open up new avenues of research in congenital heart disease and may allow us to maintain and expand CPCs in a homogeneous and undifferentiated state in vitro for heart regeneration research."
"9355075","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Over 60 million youth and adolescents participate in organized sports per year resulting in a high incidence of preventable, overuse injuries. A primary factor for overuse injury is that high amount of specialized participation and high intensity training by adolescent athletes without allowing for sufficient rest and recovery. The result is repetitive submaximal loading of the musculoskeletal tissue, leading to tissue failure. The objective of this NIAMS R21 proposal is to develop an innovative, non-invasive model that can detect the musculoskeletal tissue trauma and level of recovery that may be contributing to the overuse injuries associated with adolescent sports participation. Our approach utilizes two aims to 1.) demonstrate that diagnostic ultrasound obtained muscle cross-sectional area and echo intensity reflect physiological trauma and recovery from a bout of sport participation by comparing it to a common physiological gold standard (blood creatine kinase levels) and 2.) demonstrating that the model is feasible for use in a large cohort of adolescent participants in the field setting. Baseball pitching by adolescent baseball players will be the vehicle by which we will test our model given the high incidence of throwing-related overuse arm (shoulder and elbow) injuries we see in this population. Our rationale is for us to develop a non-invasive model that will be used in future R01 work to better understand overuse injury mechanisms for both the upper and lower extremity, in numerous sport and occupational activities. The application of the proposed model will be used to 1.) create, evaluate, and validate participation recommendations for those who participate in sports with high overuse injury risk, 2.) create evidence-based interventions (therapeutic modalities, pharmacology, and active rest models) for recovery following participation, and 3.) ultimately create evidenced-based strategies to prevent overuse injury in the youth and adolescent athlete."
"9332025","Over 50% of pregnant women take one or more prescription drugs, but there are limited data on the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of the majority of drugs used during pregnancy. Accumulating evidence indicates that drug disposition is altered during pregnancy due to the extensive physiological changes, including altered rate of hepatic drug metabolism. For most drugs, doses used in non-pregnant women cannot be extrapolated to pregnancy. Yet, dosing guidelines for pregnant women have been lacking, mainly because current understanding about altered drug disposition during pregnancy is incomplete. This subsequently leads to an increased risk for over- or under-dosing of drugs in pregnant women and exposure of her fetus to either adverse drug effects or maternal disease. Thorough understanding of the PK changes of drugs during pregnancy and factors responsible for the changes is imperative to achieve optimal drug therapy during pregnancy. The long-term goal of our research is to build a solid knowledge base for the prediction of PK changes and the design of optimal individualized dosage regimens for pregnant women. The objectives of this application are to provide mechanistic understanding of altered drug metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP3A4 and to translate the findings to human pregnancy. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are the two most important drug-metabolizing enzymes and together responsible for metabolizing ~70% of marketed drugs. Clinical data indicate that elimination of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 is faster at term pregnancy (as compared to postpartum period), but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In previous studies, we established models to study regulation of DME expression throughout gestation and identified factors contributing to CYP2D6 induction during pregnancy. Specifically, our results suggest that lower hepatic retinoid level and subsequent decreases in the expression of a transcription factor (i.e., SHP) are involved in CYP2D6 induction during pregnancy. Also, results from human hepatocytes suggest that CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism is highest during early pregnancy (compared to the later time points of pregnancy or postpartum period), potentially due to changes in thyroid hormone concentration. Based on these results, we propose to: (1) elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying CYP2D6 induction during pregnancy, and (2) define factors responsible for temporal changes in CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism during pregnancy. To this end, we will perform studies ranging from in vitro/animal studies to human clinical PK studies, testing translation of in vitro or animal findings to human pregnancy. The results are expected to have a positive impact by laying a foundation for PK prediction of CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 substrates and guide individualized dosing recommendations for pregnant women."
"9332471","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV rates are at catastrophic levels among young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM). A study in 21 US cities found that 21% of YBMSM aged 18-29 were HIV+, compared to 9% of Latino and 7% of white young MSM (YMSM), and these disparities are worsening. YBMSM are more likely to be HIV-infected, less likely to be aware of their HIV-infection, and less likely to disclose that they are HIV-infected, relative to men of other ethnic/racial groups. HIV+ YBMSM are also less likely than white MSM to be in treatment for HIV and to have undetectable viral loads (VLs). When HIV+ individuals achieve an undetectable VL, their own health improves, and they are also less infectious to others. Getting to that point, however, requires that HIV+ individuals: (1) know their HIV status; (2) link to HIV care; (3) stay in care over time; (4) begin appropriate treatment; and (5) adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We refer to these steps as engagement in the HIV Care Continuum (CC). While these approaches have great potential to reduce HIV incidence, it is estimated that only 25% of HIV+ people in the US have engaged in the CC to the point of having undetectable VLs. Research suggests that HIV+ YBMSM engage in the CC far less than others. A community-level intervention (CLI) to build and mobilize communities of YBMSM to support HIV+ men to engage in the CC, decrease psychosocial barriers and increase psychosocial facilitators to engage in the CC within those communities may be an efficacious approach to prevent HIV transmission and improve health outcomes for YBMSM. This proposal will test the efficacy of such a CLI model, called United Black Element+ (UBE+). UBE+ will be an adaptation of a current CLI, called UBE. UBE has already engaged hundreds of YBMSM in Dallas TX, and it diffuses support for HIV prevention and creates positive social norms around reducing rates of unprotected sex and increasing regular HIV testing by building an empowered, mobilized YBMSM community. UBE+ will be an adaptation and extension of UBE designed to increase YBMSM's engagement in the CC. The aims of this project are: (1) To adapt and expand UBE into UBE+, a multilevel intervention that includes a new focus on increasing engagement in the CC among HIV+YBMSM, including targeting psychosocial barriers and facilitators to engaging in the CC that are experienced in this community (e.g., HIV stigma and social support); (2) To implement UBE+ in Dallas for 3 years in collaboration with a local AIDS Service Organization currently implementing UBE, the Dallas County Health Department, and the Texas Department of State Health Services' (TDSHS) HIV-STD Program; and (3) To evaluate the efficacy of UBE+ in increasing engagement in the CC in Dallas (utilizing Houston as a control community) using 2 independent methods: (a) a longitudinal cohort of HIV+ YBMSM providing data on engagement in care, and experiences of psychosocial and logistic barriers and facilitators to engagement in care; and (b) public health data that the TDSHS independently collects on HIV+ YBMSM's engagement in the CC."
"9323801","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of this P01 project is to identify biomarkers that will enable us to predict the likely duration of the lag phase or ?remission? period prior to HIV rebound following discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected individuals. In our study, a large number of virologic and immunologic parameters will be measured in a cohort of ~125 well-characterized HIV-infected individuals undergoing analytical treatment interruption (ATI), to determine if any of these measurements allow us to reliably predict the kinetics of viral rebound post-ART cessation. A large amount of high-dimensional data including next-generation sequencing data (transcriptomes and microRNA profiles) and CyTOF data will be generated in our proposed experiments. The Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core will play a leading role in compiling, curating, analyzing and disseminating data generated in all three projects associated with this P01 application. To maximize our chances of identifying meaningful signatures predicting time until viral rebound, we will implement several statistical approaches and ensemble learning methods (e.g., gradient boosting, random forests) to develop theories, and we will rely on established classifier performance evaluation procedures (e.g. cross validation, recursive feature elimination, and feature importance measures) to rigorously determine the predictive potential of biomarkers under consideration. In Aim 1 of our Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core project, we will evaluate the capacity of individual putative blood cell-associated biomarkers studied in Project 2 to predict time until viral rebound following ATI. Measurements include the frequency of replication-competent proviral genomes in CD4+ T cells and global characterization of the host cell transcriptome. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the capacity of individual putative cell- free plasma- and CSF-derived biomarkers studied in Project 3 to predict time until viral rebound following ATI. Measurements include circulating microRNA profile, extracellular vesicle phenotype, and multiplex cytokine and antibody characterization. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will perform a combined analysis of biomarkers across all 3 projects (including CyTOF immunophenotypic data generated in Project 1) to assess their relative performance and to identify potential synergies between predictors. Ensemble learning methods are ideal for discovering complex combinations of predictive features. They also provide a framework for evaluating the predictive importance of candidate biomarkers both individually and in combination with other biomarkers. The Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core will play a central role in achieving our P01 objectives and in advancing the HIV cure agenda, transforming copious and diverse, high-dimensional data into robust predictors of HIV rebound following ART interruption."
"9322783","ABSTRACT: Uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) are benign tumors that develop during reproductive age, and symptomatic tumors account for 1/3 of hysterectomies performed in the United States. Although the molecular mechanisms that cause formation and development of leiomyoma are unknown, leiomyoma cells overexpress pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes, suggesting that inflammation and fibrosis are key drivers of their growth and development. If so, then it could be possible to develop non-surgical therapeutic approaches to prevent, manage, or reverse leiomyoma development, but designing such strategies will require a deeper knowledge of underlying molecular mechanisms. Expression profiling has identified many miRNAs with altered expression in leiomyoma as compared to myometrium, and our laboratory has focused on understanding how these miRNAs impact pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways and effectors in leiomyoma. Our results strongly implicate two miRNAs?miR-200c and miR-29c?in the development of leiomyoma. Expression of both miR-200c and miR-29c is significantly reduced in leiomyoma compared to adjacent normal myometrium. We showed that miR-200c regulates expression of IL-8 in leiomyoma smooth muscle cells (LSMC) by altering NF-kB activity and by directly targeting IKBKB, whose phosphorylated form was elevated in leiomyoma as compared to matched myometrium, collectively suggesting enhanced NF-kB signaling in leiomyoma. Based on our published and preliminary results we hypothesize that a co-regulatory interaction between NF-kB signaling and epigenetic modification serves as the underlying mechanism that promotes miR-200c and miR-29c suppression, resulting in elevated expression of their specific target genes whose products play a central role in pathogenesis of leiomyoma. This central hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism underlying miR-200c and miR-29c suppression in leiomyoma. We hypothesize that the low level of expression of miR-200c/miR-29c in leiomyomas is due to activation of NF-kB signaling leading to their transcriptional repression by NF-kB (p65) and to epigenetic modification through DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, which are also regulated by NF-kB signaling. Aim 2 will determine the therapeutic potential of an NF-kB signaling inhibitor (Bay 11-7082), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (Zebularine) and anti- inflammatory/anti-fibrotic agent (Tranilast) on leiomyoma initiation and regression in a mouse leiomyoma model. The proposed interactive specific aims through novel mechanistic approaches will decipher the independent and co-regulatory functions of miRNAs and NF-kB signaling pathway that lead to leiomyoma growth, and will determine the potential utility of novel therapeutic drugs that influence the expression of these miRNAs and could be useful as a pharmacologic treatment of leiomyomas. If so, this could reduce the number of relatively costly hysterectomies performed, reduce or eradicate symptoms of leiomyoma, and preserve fertility in women with leiomyoma who may still desire to bear children."
"9527912","Project Summary Through NIDCD funding (R21DC013172) we showed that noise-induced temporary damage to the auditory dendrites is more severe when the exposure occurs at night compared to the day. Preliminary data strongly suggest that circulating glucocorticoids, which peak at nighttime in mice, are responsible for the greater sensitivity to night noise trauma. In absence of circulating glucocorticoids (by adrenalectomy), mice exposed to night noise show complete recovery of their auditory brainstem thresholds, and have their synaptic ribbons protected. RNAseq data show that inflammatory pathways rise at nighttime in the cochlea, and this is abolished in adrenalectomised mice, suggesting that inflammatory response could underlie the greater vulnerability of the auditory synapse. The RNAseq identified 7211 genes in the cochlea that have circadian expression and 65% of these genes show maximal expression at night-time. Since it is not standard practice in the auditory field to collect samples at different time points throughout the day a full understanding of gene regulation during the day and the night in the cochlea is lacking. Our laboratory is currently addressing this challenge with the following aims: Specific Aim 1: To identify glucocorticoid-dependent inflammatory signals that display circadian patterns and are triggered by day or night noise trauma in the cochlea. Hypothesis: GCs modulate inflammatory signals in a circadian manner causing a greater inflammatory response to night noise trauma compared to the day. Specific Aim 2: To determine whether Bmal1 in the cochlea regulates the GC-dependent inflammatory signals in response to day or night noise trauma. Hypothesis: In the cochlea, the core clock protein Bmal1 regulates the circadian cytokine release in response to noise and causing synaptopathy. Specific Aim 3: To develop new pharmacological treatments targeting the circadian machinery to protect from inflammatory-triggered noise-induced synaptopathy. Hypothesis: Inhibition of the clock at nighttime can prevent night noise-induced synaptopathy via the inhibition of inflammatory responses. This project will clarify how circadian and glucocorticoid-dependent inflammatory signals cause cochlear synaptopathy after temporary noise trauma. A battery of functional methods (auditory electrophysiology, noise trauma), quantitative morphological methods (cochleograms, spiral ganglion neuron counts, pre/post synaptic counts) and molecular methods (genetic mouse models, RNA seq) will be used. Ultimately, novel drugs that will modulate circadian rhythms could emerge to prevent and treat from noise-induced synaptopathy. Our results will introduce a new concept to the auditory field, namely, chronopharmacology, where optimal efficacy of drug treatment depends on the time of administration. The novel theoretical concept of this proposal is that the optimal function of the auditory system requires periods of activity followed by rest that is tightly regulated by clock genes. As simple and obvious as this may sound, this concept has neither been previously explored in the context of noise trauma nor treatment strategies."
"9256999","Developmental toxicants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorophenols (e.g., pentachlorophenol - PCP) are persistent organic contaminants found at many hazardous waste sites throughout the United States. These contaminants are of great concern because they present high toxicological risk in terms of their potential for bioaccumulation in the food chain as well as adverse health effects. Hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) such as PAHs, PCBs and PCP are particularly challenging to bioremediate because their chemical characteristics diminish their bioavailability to microorganisms thereby limiting their potential for efficient biodegradation. As a result of this constraint, HOC remediation strategies tend to focus on physical-chemical approaches consisting of either complete excavation of contaminated media or contaminant in situ immobilization via amendment mediated sequestration which can have significant negative long term impacts on local ecosystems. In this project, we propose an alternative treatment approach which consists of stimulating cooperative bacterial-fungal biofilms for HOC biodegradation. Using this approach, indigenous fungi will first be stimulated to degrade toxicants using nonspecific extracellular enzymes and generate by-products more bioavailable to bacteria for subsequent biodegradation. While using remediation treatment approaches based on the production of fungal extracellular enzymes is not entirely new, the novelty of this project resides in the fact that our focus will be directed towards the promotion of indigenous Ascomycetes associated with sediment microbial biofilms, a phylum which has not received much attention for bioremediation. The overall objective of this project is to maximize HOC biodegradation in sediment settings by stimulating the growth of synergistic fungal-bacterial biofilms using engineered composite organic amendments. The general hypothesis for Project 5 is that the physico-chemical environment can be altered using composite organic amendments to stimulate the formation of a cooperative bacterial-fungal biofilms in which indigenous fungi produce extracellular enzymes breaking down hydrophobic contaminants into by-products which are more readily transported into bacterial cells and broken down by indigenous bacteria. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) Perform microbial and geochemical characterizations of contaminated sediments for the construction of a microbial association network model; 2) Identify organic amendments which support the growth of cooperative fungal-bacterial biofilm and maximize HOC degradation in microcosms; 3) Engineer and test composite amendments for delivery in sediment treatment scenarios and; 4) Implement the composite amendment strategy in large-scale mesocosms as well as validate its efficiency for HOC degradation by stimulated mixed fungal-bacterial biofilms. Ultimately, this project will create a framework to better understand cooperative fungal-bacterial biofilms in the context of sediment bioremediation and yield field translatable approaches for the bioremediation of HOCs."
"9350362","Cytoskeletal-driven membrane dynamics requires the concerted action of microtubules, actin, and their associated motors and activators. Although specific motors and adaptors have been identified that participate in the transport, tubulation, and retraction of biological membranes, the molecular mechanisms of many of these processes are not well defined. This gap in knowledge is due, in part, to the lack of understanding of the biophysical parameters of the key cytoskeletal components that drive these dynamic membrane events. Knowledge of these parameters allows formation of quantitative models that consider the mechanical and kinetic limits of protein function. Therefore, this subproject proposes to use single-molecule and ensemble biophysical techniques to measure directly the motile and mechanical properties of cytoplasmic dynein (mammalian and yeast) and kinesin (KIF16B) motors. Results will be correlated directly with new insights from analysis of motor structural dynamics obtained in collaboration with Dr. Goldman, and will provide the biophysical parameters required to better understand the cellular and in vitro experiments performed collaboration with Dr. Holzbaur. We will also determine mechanical properties of the key scaffolding proteins that link membranes, motors, and cytoskeletal filaments. These interactions include the attachment of KIF16B to phosphoinositides, the dynein-bicaudalD-Rab6-membrane complex, and the interaction of WHAMM with membranes. The results will be correlated directly to biochemical, structural, and cellular experiments performed in collaboration with Drs. Dominguez and Holzbaur. Our studies will provide the biophysical parameters required to generate quantitative models for the roles of cytoskeletal motors and scaffolding protein in powering membrane dynamics and transport."
"9365514","Abstract: Supplemental O2 therapy and non-invasive ventilation (e.g. continuous positive pressure support, CPAP) are two major life-saving modalities of respiratory care for the treatment of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Unfortunately, there are significant unintended consequences associated with clinical care. Supplemental O2 therapy specifically has long been recognized as a potent contributor to the pathogenesis of wheezing and asthma of former preterm infants ? these observations have led to efforts to titrate and minimize the usage of O2 in the NICU setting and a shift toward increased use of CPAP. The dilemma, however, is that virtually nothing is known about whether there are also any adverse side-effects of CPAP. In this proposal, we will utilize a novel neonatal mouse model of CPAP (developed in our lab) to test the hypothesis that there are indeed, long-term adverse consequences associated with CPAP, manifest as an increase in airway hyperreactivity (AHR). We further hypothesize that the mechanistic basis underlying the effects of CPAP on AHR involves a stretch-induced increase in low-molecular weight hyaluronan (HALMW) expression in airway smooth muscle. HALMW is a major component of the extracellular matrix and our data show that it initiates downstream signaling pathways leading to increased calcium signaling, hyperreactivity, and smooth muscle proliferation. In parallel studies, we also show that the HA- Ca2+ pathway is functional in age-appropriate (for preterm infants) human fetal airway smooth muscle cells. Interestingly, offsetting or counter-balancing the increased HALMW by exogenous delivery of high molecular weight HA (HAHMW) prevents the adverse effects of CPAP. The clinical safety of HAHMW has been tested in a variety of settings ranging from treating eye abnormalities in preterm infants to children with cystic fibrosis, and adults with asthma. Therefore, this proposal will utilize a novel mouse model of neonatal CPAP to highlight the mechanistic basis for the unintended consequences it has on airway function, and provide evidence demonstrating tremendous promise for HAHMW administration as a viable therapy for the treatment and prevention of wheezing and asthma in former preterm infants."

In particular, our goal is to convert the identity of skin at the stump site of amputees to thick palmo/plantar (volar) type skin to enhance their use of prosthetics. Towards this clinical goal we first will define the basic genetic control of volar fibroblast skin identity Then we will define homeostatic mechanisms whereby non-volar tissue retains its identity. In so doing, we will optimize conditions for our final effort to use autologous fibroblasts to induce ectopic volar skin in volunteers. We will fully excise this ectopic acral skin as a proof-of-concep trial and a prelude to clinical optimization and use in amputees."
"9371694","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  My career goal is to lead a multidisciplinary research team that investigates the developmental pathways between early adversity and anxiety. The lab will implement a cross-species model, using forwards and backwards translation across multiple biological and psychological systems to uncover malleable points of intervention, which can then be age-appropriately targeted to affect change in anxiety symptoms. To effectively lead this future research team, I require intensive training in the fields of microbiology, neuroscience, and developmental psychology. My training to date has provided me with a strong foundation of skills in clinical/developmental psychology, rodent behavior, and molecular neuroscience. My career development plan expands on this skill set to provide essential further training in stress/adversity, development, memory, fMRI, analysis of microbial ecology, and psychopathology. By engaging in this protected training time, I will enter my independent stage of research well prepared to lead the first research team purposefully established to study the development of microbiome-brain interactions following adversity. Research Project: Early experiences of adversity are strong contributors to anxiety disorders. However, the developmental mechanisms underlying the adversity-anxiety link remain elusive. Extensive evidence now implicates two systems in the emergence of anxiety, and which are affected by early adversity: the gastrointestinal microbiome and the hippocampal memory system. While studies have independently found associations between adversity, anxiety, microbial and hippocampal development, the shared and interactive effects of the microbiome and hippocampal memory on the emergence of anxiety symptoms have never been examined. The goal of the proposed project is to produce a longitudinal data set integrating microbial, hippocampal, and memory information across typical and adversity-exposed developing samples and to use this data to uncover predictive pathways that end in anxiety. Specifically, in line with my preliminary data, I will test the hypothesis that adversity effects on anxiety are mediated through a sequential pathway of alterations to the microbiome, and hippocampal memory systems. In one integrated study I will determine the effect of early adversity on microbiome composition across development (Aim 1), before examining the association between the microbiome and hippocampal-based memory maturation in typically developing humans (Aim 2). Finally, in the R00-phase I will determine whether effects of adversity on anxiety occur through the pathway of microbial alterations and hippocampal memory development alterations (Aim 3). Elucidating the independent and interactive contributions of the microbiome and hippocampal memory system to anxiety is essential for identifying treatment targets which can be applied to adversity exposed individuals, benefiting lifespan mental health."

"9329409","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Disorders of iron metabolism, whether caused by inborn genetic errors, maladaptive responses to disease or diet are major public health issues in the U.S. and throughout the world. Nutritional iron deficiency is associated with impaired cognitive development and reduced work output resulting in significant negative economic and social consequences. Other than iron metabolism per se, the physiological pathways involved in the adaptive cellular and organismal response to iron deficiency remain poorly defined. In addition to diet, anemia can be caused by disorders in oxygen sensing pathways associated with renal failure, normal aging, genetic mutations in hemoglobin or other proteins, and as a consequence of preterm delivery when the full switch to post-natal mechanisms of controlling erythropoietin production has not occurred. In sum, these pathological states affect millions of people in the U.S. alone. The ability to properly integrate the control of iron and oxygen metabolism is essential for optimal health throughout the life cycle.  In vertebrates, iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) and IRP2 are central regulators of cellular iron metabolism. IRP dictate the fate of mRNA encoding proteins required for the maintenance of iron homeostasis and for the adaptive changes in response to iron status. The mRNA encoding hypoxia inducible factor 2? (HIF2?), a transcription factor central to the genome wide responses to oxygen and iron, has been previously shown to be a specific target of IRP1 in cultured cells. We demonstrate that HIF2? mRNA translation is activated in IRP1-/- mice but not in IRP2 -/- mice. IRP1 -/- mice have profound disturbances in erythropoiesis, including a transient severe polycythemia, and display symptoms of dysregulated stress erythropoiesis. Our results to date also demonstrate that the 5' untranslated region of HIF2? mRNA contains multiple previously unrecognized putative translational regulatory elements that strongly suggest that translational control is a critical additional level at which changes in iron and oxygen level are integrated wit the level of expression and action of HIF2?. We propose that the IRP1-HIF2? regulatory axis is required for coordinating iron absorption and other adaptive processes with homeostatic and stress-induced erythropoiesis.  Consequently, the specific aims are to determine the: 1) tissue specific roles of IRP1 deficiency in the development of polycythemia; 2) mechanisms regulating HIF2? mRNA translation by iron and oxygen. In elucidating the role of the IRP1-HIF2? axis in the adaptive and maladaptive control of central pathways of iron and oxygen metabolism our studies may ultimately have a transformative effect on the development of new therapeutic strategies for treatment of common disorders."
"9328170","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases with clinical, pathological and genetic overlap. The expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat in a non-coding region of C9ORF72 is the major genetic cause of FTD and ALS. Elucidating how these expanded repeats cause c9FTD/ALS has since become an important goal of the field. Our recent study identifying a new pathological hallmark of c9FTD/ALS - the accumulation of neuronal inclusions composed of peptides produced by repeat associated non-ATG (RAN) translation of sense and antisense transcripts of the expanded repeat - implicates RAN translation as a mechanism of disease. This unconventional mode of translation was first described for expanded CAG?CTG repeats and accounts for the accumulation of polyA or polyQ proteins in spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 and myotonic dystrophy type 1, respectively. Based on our findings that RAN translation of expanded repeats similarly occurs in c9FTD/ALS, we believe that peptides thusly produced play a role in disease pathogenesis. This project aims to investigate this pressing question, as well as several others. Specifically, we will evaluate whether: 1) the various peptides produced via RAN translation show a differential pattern of expression in c9FTD/ALS; 2) there is differential toxicity among RAN translated peptides or among soluble and insoluble species; 3) toxicity is enhanced by loss of C9ORF72 function; and 4) expression of RAN translated peptides influences disease phenotype or depend upon repeat length. To investigate these questions we will utilize novel antibodies, develop new cell culture and animal models, and examine fibroblasts and tissues from c9FTD/ALS patients. In addition to being subject to RAN translation, accumulating sense (GGGGCC)exp and antisense (CCCCGG)exp RNA transcripts may result in the sequestration of RNA-binding proteins in c9FTD/ALS. Nuclear RNA foci of expanded RNA transcripts accumulate in frontal cortex, spinal cord and cerebellum of C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers. The sequestration and inactivation of RNA- binding proteins by RNA foci is observed in several repeat expansion diseases and is thought to account for some features of disease. The identification of RNA-binding proteins sequestered by transcripts of expanded repeats in C9ORF72, and determining whether the function of these proteins are altered in c9FTD/ALS, will increase our understanding of this potential mechanism of disease. Overall, the goals of Project 2 are to test the hypothesis that transcripts of expanded repeats contribute to c9FTD/ALS pathogenesis via two mechanisms: by RAN translation and by the mis-regulation of RNA-binding proteins."
"9332330","The design of an AIDS vaccine is complicated by the fact that any HIV/SIV-specific immune responses aimed at preventing transmission or disease progression inevitably result in the generation of activated CD4+ T cells that may paradoxically facilitate transmission and/or disease progression. Indeed, increased HIV acquisition in the ineffective Step/Phambili trials and the lack of efficacy in HVTN-505 indicate that vaccine-elicited CD4+ T-cell responses can mitigate protection and, in some cases, increase acquisition. The overarching goal of this Program Project grant is to test the hypothesis that durable and balanced HIV-specific humoral immune responses are needed to provide effective protection from mucosal challenge, and avoid paradoxical effects that may enhance virus acquisition. This project focuses on the question of whether vaccine-induced changes in the mucosal micro-environment are factors influencing, and often undermining, the protective efficacy of humoral immunity in rhesus macaques (RMs) and by extension, humans. Three main aspects of the mucosal environment will be examined: (1) the role of activated CD4+ T cells as potential targets for the virus; (2) the role of the innate immune response, and in particular type I interferon (IFN-I) and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)- mediated pathways, as antiviral but also pro-inflammatory factors; and (3) the potential role of abortive infection and induction of pyroptotic cell death in quiescent mucosal CD4+ T cells as a source of inflammatory/activating signals facilitating spread of the transmitted founder virus populations. The studies proposed in in this project leverage animals and samples from Project 1 (which will elucidate the humoral determinants for persistent anti- gp120 responses) and Project 2 (in which the protection conferred by passive administration of an anti-gp120 antibody will be tested in the setting of concomitant exposure to a vector-based vaccine known to induce strong mucosal cellular immune responses to HIV/SIV). There are three specific aims. Aim 1: To examine how the in vivo interventions in Projects 1 and 2 affect the number, phenotype, activation state, histological location, and gene expression of mucosal CD4+ T cells. Aim 2: To examine how the in vivo interventions in Projects 1 and 2 affect the innate immune environment of mucosal tissues, with specific focus on IFN-I and ISGs. Aim 3: To determine whether abortive infection and inflammatory pyroptosis occur in mucosal CD4+ T cells of vaccinated macaques and promote expansion and dissemination of SHIV infection. This work will provide a comprehensive picture of the mucosal micro-environment in the macaque vaccine model, within the context of settings where protective anti-gp120 antibodies are present. This information will validate hypotheses regarding the causal relationships between balanced mucosal immune profiles and protective efficacy via humoral immunity. Such information will have significant translational impact on the development of future HIV vaccine strategies."

"9323804","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT While the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection, viral eradication is not achievable due to the persistence of latently-infected cells during treatment. ART must therefore be taken on a lifelong basis. Accumulating data suggest that HIV- infected individuals often experience persistent immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and accelerated aging even in the setting of ART-mediated viral suppression. These realities have created a pronounced interest in developing strategies to eradicate HIV in infected individuals. The development, evaluation and implementation of HIV curative strategies will depend critically on our capacity to determine when viral recrudescence in the near term is unlikely in an infected individual, justifying cessation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The goal of this P01 project is to identify biomarkers that will enable us to predict the duration of the lag phase or ?remission? period prior to HIV rebound following discontinuation of ART in HIV-infected individuals. In our study, a large number of virologic and immunologic parameters will be measured in a cohort of 125 well-characterized HIV-infected individuals undergoing analytical treatment interruption (ATI), to identify biomarkers that allow us to reliably predict the kinetics of viral rebound post-ART cessation. The experiments described in Project 3 of our P01 proposal will specifically examine the prognostic value of a broad spectrum of circulating factors in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leveraging cutting edge technologies and an unprecedented collection of longitudinal specimens from multiple ATI studies. In Aim 1, we will implement next-generation sequencing approaches to determine the relationship between circulating nucleic acids and viral rebound, focusing on microRNA profile, cell-free DNA, and residual low-level HIV viremia. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the prognostic significance of circulating extracellular vesicles, characterizing their abundance, cellular origin, and nucleic acid and viral protein cargo. Finally, in Aim 3, soluble antiviral immune factors will be evaluated as predictors of viral rebound, focusing on high-resolution analyses of anti-HIV antibody responses, cytokines and chemokines associated with HIV persistence. We will work closely with our Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core to transform our high-dimensional data into robust predictors of HIV rebound following ART interruption, relying on sophisticated ensemble machine learning approaches. Ultimately, the identification of a reliable blood plasma-based predictor of viral rebound will represent an optimal scenario for the field, enabling rapid development, scaling and deployment of cost- effective, non-invasive diagnostic approaches to facilitate the search for an HIV cure."
"9336978","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The personal and societal costs of Parkinson's disease (PD) are expected to increase significantly in the next two decades. The mechanisms of neurodegeneration are not well understood, and no treatment clearly slows the neurodegenerative process in PD. Alpha-synuclein (?syn) is a protein that is central to PD pathogenesis, and recent studies show that the transmission of ?syn between different cell populations is key to its ability to cause toxicity. Release of ?syn is the first critical componen of transmission, and occurs through exosomal and non-exosomal mediated pathways. A second key feature of prion-like spread of ?syn is the uptake in target neurons, leading to consequent misfolding of endogenous ?syn. What mechanisms regulate the release and spread of ?syn pathology are not known. The 14-3-3 proteins are chaperone-like proteins that can reduce protein aggregation, regulate protein secretion, and promote cell survival. We have previously shown that 14-3-3s are protective in several models of PD and can regulate the exosomal release of LRRK2, a key protein implicated in PD. In this proposal, we present preliminary data that overexpression of the 14-3-3? isoform in ?syn-producing cells reduces the toxicity of released ?syn. Our central hypothesis is that 14-3-3 proteins can protect against ?syn toxicity by reducing the transmission of toxic ?syn species. In Aims 1 and 2, we will investigate whether 14-3-3s can regulate ?syn release through exosomes or alternative non-exosomal pathways and assess how any changes in release impacts paracrine ?syn toxicity. For these studies, we will use a paracrine inducible ?syn culture system in which released ?syn induced cell death in separately culture primary neurons. In Aim 1, we will use biochemical and imaging approaches to determine if 14-3-3s alter the amount and conformation of ?syn in exosomes. We will also assess how alterations in exosomal ?syn impact paracrine ?syn toxicity. In Aim 2, we will use similar techniques to test if 14-3-3s reduce ?syn release and toxicity through inhibition of the recycling endosomal pathway. In Aim 3, we will focus on the effects of 14-3-3s in target cells exposed to extracellular ?syn. Specifically, we will use in vitro and in vivo ?syn fibril models to test whether 14-3-3s can reduce ?syn uptake, aggregation, and toxicity in these models. If we can establish that 14-3-3s regulate the pathological transmission of ?syn, this would justify exploration of potential PD therapies targeting the 14-3-3s."
"9483938","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular mechanism of P23H rhodopsin autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is still not clear, and currently there is no effective treatment for this retinal degenerative disease. Certain findings suggest that misfolded P23H opsin is the main trigger of photoreceptor death whereas others indicate that the mutant rhodopsin instead disrupts the disc organization of rod outer segments to cause this effect. The short term goal of this proposed study is to determine the predominant molecular mechanism of P23H rhodopsin- related photoreceptor death, and identify novel therapeutics that prevents this retinopathy.  Aim 1 of this study focuses on the discovery and characterization of pharmacological chaperones of P23H opsin, and use developed lead compounds to test whether stabilizing P23H opsin prevents photoreceptor death in P23H mouse model. Experiments for Aim 1 will be undertaken in the candidate's dependent phase.  Aim 2 is to identify and characterize pharmacological enhancers of P23H opsin clearance, which will be tested for their effects in prevention of photoreceptor degeneration and correction of disc organization in outer segments. The proposed experiments for Aim 2 will be accomplished in the candidate's independent phase.  Novel small-molecule compounds have been identified by two high-throughput screens, which either rescue the translocation of P23H opsin or enhance its clearance in cell culture. Molecular pathways perturbed by these compounds initially will be identified by in vitro studies. The efficacy and potency of such compounds will be validated and improved in cell culture systems. Qualified compounds then will be further evaluated in a transgenic C. elegans model for their effects on neuron protection and biochemical properties of P23H rhodopsin. Finally, one or two lead compounds from each drug discovery strategy will be tested in P23H/+ knock-in mice to evaluate their protective effects on retinal structure and function, including the maintenance of disc organization in rod outer segments. Results from these experiments will suggest the dominant mechanism for photoreceptor death, and more importantly, candidates for treatment of P23H adRP.  Under mentorship of Dr. Krzysztof Palczewski, the candidate will strengthen and extend her training in drug discovery and development for retinal diseases. Through close collaboration with Drs. Phoebe Stewart, Akiko Maeda, and Marcin Golczak, the candidate will have access to a combination of cutting edge techniques including medicinal chemistry, ultra-high resolution imaging of retinal structures, functional analysis of retina, and cryo-electron tomography. The candidate's progress in science and career development will be under supervision of an advisory committee to aid in her transition from a postdoctoral trainee to an independent investigator. In the long term, the candidate is interested in mechanistic and drug discovery studies of other blinding retinal diseases."
"9394283","Project Summary Lung infections and inflammation are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Uncontrolled lung infection and its associated inflammatory injuries lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for which no specific treatment is available. An ideal therapeutic would be one that can control pathogen burden and suppress the inflammatory response. Using computational, immunochemical, and functional screening approaches, a Toll-like receptor (TLR4)-interacting surfactant protein-A derived peptide called SPA4 (amino acids: GDFRYSDGTPVNYTNWYRGE) has been identified. The SPA4 peptide binds to the TLR4, suppresses the TLR4-induced inflammation, and yet maintains the TLR4-induced pathogen-recognition, uptake and intracellular processing. The project hypothesis is that the SPA4 peptide will reduce the pathogen burden and inflammatory response during lung infection and inflammation by interacting with and altering the assembly of the TLR4 complex. The specific aims are to: (1) define the molecular basis of the pro-phagocytic and anti-inflammatory effects of the SPA4 peptide, (2) evaluate the biological effects of SPA4 peptide in mouse models of lung infection and inflammation, and (3) analyze the activity of SPA4 peptide on TLR4-signaling and immune function. We will determine the amino acids and motif of SPA4 peptide that are critical for binding to TLR4 and activity against infectious stimuli. We will investigate the TLR4-assembly with its adaptor molecules in human cells and models using structural biology, computational, molecular, biochemical, and cellular approaches. The bacterial uptake and clearance and inflammatory parameters will be simultaneously assessed in primary human cells. Mouse models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa- and lipopolysaccharide- induced lung infection and inflammation will be used to test the biological relevance of SPA4 peptide. We will investigate the SPA4 peptide?s toxicity and immunogenicity, and efficacy of SPA4 peptide upon repeat administration, in immunosuppressed mice, in secondary challenge model, and when administered in combination with conventional antibiotic, surfactant, or anti-inflammatory agent. Bacterial burden, inflammatory parameters, tissue pathology, lung function, symptoms and survival will be assessed. The binding, distribution, pharmacokinetics, and activity of SPA4 peptide will be evaluated for modulation of TLR4-dependent mechanisms at cellular and tissue levels in lungs of wild type and genetic mouse models of TLR4 and its adaptors, using in vivo imaging, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. It is expected that the end-point determinants of the proposed studies and analyses will eventually help establish the mechanism of action of the SPA4 peptide. This project uses the unique concept of developing a novel peptide-based immunotherapeutic. We anticipate that the results of this study will facilitate the development of SPA4 peptide as an immunotherapeutic to help reduce pathogen burden and inflammation, improve the clinical condition and survival of patients suffering from lung infection and inflammatory injuries, and control ARDS."

Dr. El Mallah's long-term career goal is to become a successful independent pediatric pulmonary clinician scientist with an emphasis on translational research. As a result of her research she has published her findings, presented them at national meetings and has received several awards and grants, including the Parker B. Francis fellowship award. ENVIRONMENT: Drs. Fuller and Byrne are exceptional mentors, with a track record of successful mentees. Dr. Fuller is a leader in respiratory neurobiology, while Dr. Byrne is a national gene therapy expert. They both have extensive NIH funding, very active and productive laboratories, and will provide the resources to assist the candidate in her research project. The University of Florida (UF) Pediatric Department offers a structured scholars program designed to enhance research and leadership skills, and to give structured feedback and evaluations. UF also offers an employee education program to support coursework for the candidate. RESEARCH: The research project in this proposal will build on the candidate's prior research on targeting respiratory dysfunction in Pompe disease. In addition, it will explore a novel therapeutic agent for stimulating respiratory drive in a Pompe (Gaa-/-) mouse model. Pompe disease is a fatal neuromuscular disorder resulting from mutations in the gene for acid alpha- glucosidase (GAA) - an enzyme necessary to degrade lysosomal glycogen. Infants with Pompe disease suffer with respiratory insufficiency often leading to mechanical ventilation. Breathing problems have originally been attributed to muscle pathology but our group has recently shown a central nervous system contribution. Unfortunately, the only FDA approved therapy for Pompe disease (enzyme replacement therapy) is suboptimal because it does not cross the blood brain barrier. Therefore, many patients on enzyme replacement therapy still require mechanical ventilation. We propose a series of pre-clinical studies that directly address the need for treatment of the CNS in Pompe disease. Specifically, we will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ampakines, compounds that enhance excitatory glutaminergic neural transmission in respiratory neurons. In addition, since ampakines do not directly address the underlying pathology, we will use gene delivery to correct the underlying gene defect. Alone, gene delivery does not transduce the entire motoneuron pool and appears to only partially correct neural dysfunction. Therefore we propose to study the impact of ampakines on respiratory function following AAV gene therapy in Pompe mice in order to optimize therapy for respiratory dysfunction. Overall, this project will test an important and novel hypothesis and will provide the candidate with training in new experimental techniques. The fundamental hypothesis driving this proposal is that ampakine therapy will potentiate respiratory motor output in Pompe disease, and the function of these drugs will be further enhanced after CNS GAA activity is increased via AAV-based gene therapy. This will be examined using two specific aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that ampakine therapy will stimulate respiratory drive in a mouse model of Pompe disease. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the efficacy of ampakine therapy will be further enhanced after CNS GAA activity is increased via AAV-based gene therapy. PROJECT RELEVANCE: This work is innovative because the impact of these excitatory agents, ampakines on respiratory dysfunction has not been evaluated in the context of neuromuscular disorders. Moreover, the ampakine treatments, which definitively work via a neural mechanism, will serve to emphasize the neural contribution to respiratory dysfunction in Pompe mice, and the necessity to target the CNS in order to treat this fatal disease. In addition, since both ampakines and AAV-GAA have already undergone phase I and II clinical trials and are safe for human use, this work has the strong potential to quickly translate to human care and to impact the clinical treatment of Pompe disease."
"9357687","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is a known risk factor for morbidity and mortality in a wide range of diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Because the prevalence of depression in HIV seropositive individuals is double that of the general population, effectively targeting depression in people living with HIV is an important public health need. Moreover, because depression and HIV infection share certain alterations in immune system function, namely suppressed innate immunity and overactivated cellular immunity marked by systemic inflammation, it may be possible to improve immune function in patients with HIV/AIDS by treating their depression. Although many clinicians generally consider selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) safe and effective in treating depression in HIV/AIDS, there have been very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressant medications among depressed HIV seropositive individuals, and results have been mixed. Moreover, no previous trials examined biomarkers of immune dysregulation common to both depression and HIV/AIDS. Our prior work has established links between depression, immune dysregulation, and HIV disease progression on the one hand, and immune regulating and antiviral effects of SSRI treatment on the other. For example, we found depression was associated with decreased natural killer (NK) cytolytic activity in both medically healthy individuals and in HIV- infected patients, and we showed that depression was associated with accelerated HIV disease progression. We also observed that resolution of depression was associated with increased NK cytotoxicity and we demonstrated that ex vivo SSRI treatment of immune cells enhances NK cytolytic activity. Further, we discovered that an SSRI inhibited HIV infectivity of immune cells e vivo, and that SSRI treatment significantly down-regulated the expression of HIV receptors and co-receptors (CD4, CXCR4, CXCR5) on macrophages and T-cells. Our studies thus indicate that SSRIs may have a direct action on peripheral immune cells. Taken together, this work suggests that SSRI treatment could conceivably reduce psychiatric morbidity and help reverse immune dysregulation in depressed, People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). To pursue our long-term objective of successfully treating co-morbid mental and medical disorders in HIV/AIDS, this study aims to determine whether: 1) SSRI treatment significantly increases innate immunity and decreases chronic inflammation and immune activation, and 2) changes in depressive symptoms correlate with changes in immune regulation in HIV/AIDS. This study will be the first double-blind, placebo controlled trial of a SSRI for treating depression in HIV/AIDS with a focus on innate immunity and inflammation. If successful, this project will advance the field of HIV care by demonstrating for the first time, immune benefits of drug therapy for clinical depression and resolution of depressive symptoms among people with well-controlled viral load: thus leading to a potential new use of SSRIs as adjuncts to cART, which could lead to a change in clinical care of depressed PLWH, and set the stage for SSRI immune studies in non-depressed PLWH."
"9324297","Project Abstract  The central goal is to determine whether glutamate signaling is disrupted in different striatal circuits that underlie repetitive behaviors in mouse models of autism. Biosensor technology will be employed concomitantly with behavioral testing to determine real-time glutamate changes in the striatum during learning, reversal learning and marble burying. Restricted and repetitive behaviors are common to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) but have considerable heterogeneity that can vary in severity and type. A varying severity of cognitive impairment may arise from the degree of heightened dependence on positive reinforcement and increased salience to unpredicted non-reinforcement. This can lead to either a learning deficit or inflexible behavior. Developing probabilistic learning tests for mouse models that match those used to test ASD individuals, we have captured some of the cognitive heterogeneity reported in ASD by testing SHANK3+/- and BTBR mice. SHANK3+/- mice exhibit a probabilistic learning deficit while BTBR mice exhibit a selective probabilistic reversal learning deficit. In a complementary way, we found that BTBR and SHANK3+/- mice exhibit elevated marble burying behavior, but BTBR mice have greater levels than SHANK3+/- mice. To date, there are significant gaps in our knowledge of what neural circuitry and neurochemical mechanisms are altered that underlie repetitive behaviors in ASD. Accumulating evidence indicates that abnormal striatal circuits may underlie certain repetitive behaviors. Further, a long-standing hypothesis to explain ASD features, including cognitive deficits, is an imbalance in the brain excitation/inhibition ratio. There are different lines of evidence that support this hypothesis, although at present, there have been no direct real-time glutamate measurements during behavioral expression of the symptoms. The proposed project will for the first time in two different mouse models of ASD directly examine dynamic changes in striatal glutamate signaling during cognitive tests and expression of a stereotyped behavior. Specific Aim 1 will determine whether real-time glutamate signaling in the dorsomedial striatum, dorsolateral striatum or nucleus accumbens of SHANK3+/- and BTBR mice is altered during spatial learning and reversal learning under conditions in which feedback is certain (100% accurate) and feedback is uncertain (80% accurate for correct choice). Specific Aim 2 will determine in SHANK3+/- and BTBR mice whether glutamate signaling differs in striatal subregions during marble burying behavior. Overall, examination of in vivo glutamate transmission during behavioral testing can provide a better mechanistic understanding of ASD pathophysiology and identify novel therapeutic targets in a disorder known to have heterogeneous symptomology."

"9482361","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Navidea Biopharmaceuticals is seeking SBIR Fast Track grant support for preclinical animal studies and a regulatory phase 1/2 clinical study of the ability of 99mTc-tilmanocept to identify skeletal joint inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic, progressive, systemic, autoimmune disease characterized by skeletal joint inflammation. If not treated successfully, RA can lead to disability, disfigurement and premature death. Recently, antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have dramatically improved outcomes for many RA patients. Three problems persist: 1 ] DMARDs are most effective when RA symptoms first appear, which is problematic for current RA diagnostics; 2 ] monitoring the effectiveness of DMARD therapy is challenging; and 3 ] a significant portion of RA patients respond poorly or not at all to current DMARDs. Therefore, there are significant unmet medical/clinical needs for a more accurate RA diagnostic, especially for early stage RA, and for more effective RA therapies. With this application, Navidea is initiating efforts intended to address these clinically pivotal needs. 99mTc- Tilmanocept is a wholly synthetic molecule designed specifically to bind with high affinity to macrophage mannose receptors (CD206). The original intended use for 99mTc-tilmanocept was for imaging sentinel lymph nodes during cancer surgeries, an indication for which 99mTc-tilmanocept has received FDA approval. 99mTc-Tilmanocept binds to CD206 displayed on macrophages residing in tumor associated lymph nodes. In RA, large numbers of CD206 expressing macrophages infiltrate into the synovial spaces of inflamed joints. An animal study with a mouse model of RA showed that 99mTc-tilmanocept can be injected intravenously and thereafter accumulates specifically in RA-inflamed joints. In an ex vivo test of human synovial aspirates, Cy3-tilmanocept strongly differentiated RA from osteoarthritis and healthy control tissue. In this application, additional animal studies are proposed to ensure the safety of injecting 99mTc-tilmanocept intravenously. Then in a clinical study, 99mTc-tilmanocept will be injected intravenously into four types of study participants: 12 participants with active RA, 30 participants with recent development of polyarthralgia (PAT), 12 healthy, arthritis free individuals over the age of 50, and 12 patients with painful joints not caused by RA. PAT may have many causes, of which RA is only one. About 2/3 of PAT patients are expected to progress to frank RA in =1 yr. It is the RA patients among these patients that would benefit m o s t from early diagnosis so that they can receive DMARD therapy when it is most effective. Participants injected with 99mTc Tc-tilmanocept will be imaged by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This study will investigate the ability of 99mTc-tilmanocept to identify RA inflamed joints and to identify early RA patients among those with PAT. Follow on studies will investigate if tilmanocept can also target delivery of therapeutics to RA inflamed joints, thus enabling better therapies."
"9330784","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The candidate is a junior investigator in rheumatology with advanced training in clinical epidemiology and a focus on patient-oriented research in chronic rheumatic diseases. He has a long history of clinical work within the Philadelphia VA and has recently been appointed here as clinical faculty. Throughout his training he has shown dedication to the care of veterans and proposes to develop his career within the VA. The candidate proposes a comprehensive interdisciplinary career development plan that will provide him with the skills and experience for his development into an independent clinical investigator. His co-mentors are NIH K24-funded senior investigators from the UPENN and VA, who have expertise in bone and joint health in varied chronic diseases. His multidisciplinary team includes additional NIH-funded leaders in biostatistics, epidemiology, bone metabolism, body composition, and rheumatic disease, each of whom is dedicated to a coordinated effort to ward the success of his career. He will draw on outstanding resources, including the VA Rheumatoid Arthritis national registry as well as the CTSA-supported Center for Clinical and Translational Research, and the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at nearby UPENN. He will also complete additional formal didactic training in methods relevant to this proposal. The proposed project will build on his epidemiology training and prior research experience to promote his transition to independence. His long-term goals are to conduct clinical trials to improve body composition, bone health, and related outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The study proposed here is the necessary first step to inform these trials. Osteoporotic fractures and joint damage account for significant morbidity in RA, resulting in billions of dollars in national costs.1 Recent studies suggest a greater prevalence and severity of arthritis in US veterans, compared with non-veterans.2 Furthermore, the VA identified arthritis, pain, obesity, and osteoporosis as priority conditions in women; each of these is addressed in this application. Low body weight has been associated with many adverse outcomes in RA, including fractures, joint damage, and death. However, the dynamic effect of the disease itself on BMI has not been characterized nor have the effects of altered body composition on RA outcomes. The long-term effects of this chronic inflammatory disease on body weight have not been clarified and may help explain these associations. Similarly, low BMI is associated with low lean mass. The applicant demonstrated that low lean mass and greater fat mass are associated with cortical thinning of bone among healthy adults. Given that 1) rheumatoid cachexia is characterized by reduced lean mass with normal or increased fat mass and 2) low lean mass is associated with thinning of cortical bone, loss of lean mass in RA likely contributes to the excess fracture risk in this population. The critical knowledge gaps are 1) whether associations between bone and BMI are related to confounding by long-term effects of disease and 2) to what extent altered lean and fat mass (rather than BMI) account for bone deficits. Taken further, the positive effects of lean mass on cortical bone may be important for prevention of invasion of inflammatory pannus, and integral to the health of overlying cartilage. Interventions to reverse lean mass deficits in RA could therefore have a valuable impact on disease outcomes through mechanical effects on cortical bone or production of muscle- derived factors. The applicant aims to 1) quantify alterations in bone structure and body composition in RA, compared with controls, and to evaluate associations with growth factors, cytokines and structural joint damage within RA participants at baseline, 2) identify baseline disease characteristics, physical function, serologic measures, and body composition measures associated with longitudinal deteriorations in ALM, bone density and structure, joint damage and disability over 2 years, and 3) To determine if lower disease activity is associated with greater increases in BMI, independent of glucocorticoid therapy in VARA participants."
"9303420","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goals of this project are to complete our understanding of the genetic basis for the nemaline myopathies (NMs) with the aim of developing rapid genetic diagnostic tests suitable for newborn screening programs, and to develop effective and innovative therapies for one of the common causes of NM that would be identified through such screening. The nemaline myopathies are a genetically heterogeneous group of closely related congenital myopathies, defined on the basis of congenital presentation of moderate to profound skeletal muscle weakness and muscle biopsy revealing nemaline rods in myofibers of affected children. The unifying molecular feature of these conditions is that fact that six of the seven known genes encode components of the actin thin filament, making this a disease of the sarcomere. Despite extensive genetic investigations utilizing mapping and candidate gene analysis, the genetic basis for many cases remains unknown. However, the advent of next generation DNA sequencing, and availability of whole exome and genome sequencing makes comprehensive genetic studies feasible in a rapid and cost-effective manner. Whole exome sequencing will be utilized to complete the genetic analysis of a large and well- characterized cohort of NM patients, and on the basis of these results, a specific DNA capture chip will be designed to facilitate rapid analysis of all the genes for NM and related congenital myopathies for use in screening hypotonic and weak newborns. Effective therapies for NM are lacking, and a major hurdle to their development is absence of model systems suitable for screening potential therapeutic compounds. To address this problem, zebrafish models of skeletal actin (ACTA1 gene) related NM (NEM3) will be developed and characterized, and utilized in high throughput drug screens to identify lead compounds with therapeutic potential for NM and related disorders in patients with primary skeletal myopathies and muscular dystrophies. Development of this efficient and sensitive newborn DNA-based screening protocol will allow for rapid and accurate diagnosis, eliminating the need for more invasive and risky procedures such as muscle biopsy, and will allow for early prognostic determinations, carrier testing in at risk relatives to prevent births of future affected children, and will allow for optial early medical management. Identification of new therapeutic compounds and approaches will set the stage for preclinical testing of new therapies that may one day be used to treat children with these devastating neuromuscular diseases. These advances will also increase our knowledge of basic muscle biology with implications for our understanding of other neuromuscular diseases."
"9336811","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The aim of the current proposal is to supplement a clinical trial of brain stimulation for the treatment of patients with major depression by studying key variables that alter the effectiveness of the intervention. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a treatment which was recently approved by the FDA for treatment resistant major depression (TRMD), i.e. patients who've failed to respond to multiple medications. CSP 556 is a nine site clinical trial that has been funded to evaluate rTMS effectiveness in the VA system. In order to administer the treatment, the rTMS stimulus generating equipment (coil) is placed over the patient's head to stimulate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex region (DLPFC) of the brain. This stimulation induces focal magnetic fields to depolarize neurons in discrete cortical areas. Positioning the coil over the correct brain region and administering adequate stimulation intensity are critical for its antidepressant efficacy (Herbsman et al., 2009; George et al., 2010). The aim of this proposal is to maximize the knowledge gained from CSP 556 by studying key variables in coil positioning known to alter both these variables (accuracy in targeting DLPFC and intensity of stimulation). These coil position variables have been directly related to treatment outcomes. Results from this proposal could lead to an optimization of TMS delivery and improved care of depressed veterans. We chose to focus on two key aspects of coil position that alter antidepressant response: A) coil position along the scalp, which determines accuracy of brain location, B) distance of the coil from the underlying cortex, or skull to cortex distance (SCD), which is proportional to the magnetic field strength at the target brain region. We will calculate SCD based on the MRI image and correlate this value with change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Because VA patients have risk factors for cortical atrophy including advanced age, vascular risks (e.g. smoking), this SCD may be larger than in the civilian population and the stimulation intensity of the TMS may be inadequate to reach their cortex. With respect to the first variable, position along the scalp, the current standard of clinical practice is to position the TMS coil 5 cm anterior relative to the point at which stimulation induces a thumb twitch. A previous MRI study of coil position suggested that this 5 cm rule was not sufficiently anterior to reach DLPFC in 1/3 of the patients (Herbsman et al., 2009; George et al., 2010). In fact, the size of improvement in depressive symptoms (defined by a change in the HRSD) was associated with the degree to which the coil was placed anteriorly. CSP 556 improved upon prevailing clinical practices by positioning the coil 6 cm, and not 5 cm, from the location where TMS makes the thumb twitch. We propose to formally test the effectiveness of the 6 cm rule by examining whether a relationship between coil position and HRSD continues to exist. This would be an extension of the previous study conducted in patients treated with the 5 cm rule (Herbsman et al., 2009; George et al., 2010). MRI's will be collected on 120 patients in CSP 556 along with a marker to indicate on the MRI where the TMS coil was positioned during treatment. These images will be digitally warped to a standard space that will enable the correlation between anterior/posterior coil position and change in HRSD. We predict that this relationship will exist in the active and not the sham patients. It is also possible that a standar clinical rule will be inadequate to target stimulation and the 6 cm rule may also be inaccurate and MRI may be needed to improve accuracy. We will thus explore the potential benefit of more innovatively defined approaches to coil positioning by comparing change in HRSD to the distance of the stimulating coil from structural and functional MRI defined DLPFC. Finally, one of the missions of CSP 556 is to develop decision rules for when rTMS is cost effective (Naimark, Krahn, Naglie, Redelmeier, & Detsky, 1997). This proposal also augments CSP 556 by developing a decision rule for when adding MRI to assess coil position would be cost effective."
"9329512","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are fatal neurological disorders that involve the selective degeneration of spinal motor neurons. SMA ? the most common genetic cause of infant mortality ? is a monogenic disorder caused by widespread deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein due to deletion of the SMN1 gene. In contrast, ALS is predominantly a sporadic disorder, but in a minority of familial cases, mutations in over 20 different genes cause motor neuron degeneration. Genetic and molecular studies increasingly suggest that ALS and SMA may share common underlying mechanisms of disease. This project focuses on one form of familial ALS caused by mutations in the RNA binding protein fused in sarcoma (FUS) - which are associated with a broad range of clinical phenotypes including some of the most aggressive, juvenile-onset forms of the disease - and the possible role of SMN biology in the pathogenesis of FUS-dependent motor neuron degeneration. SMN has a well-established function in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) involved in diverse mRNA processing pathways and increasing evidence links SMN-dependent RNA dysregulation with the etiology of SMA. Remarkably, recent studies in cultured mammalian cells and ALS patients' fibroblasts have shown that FUS depletion or expression of ALS-linked FUS mutations disrupt the normal localization of SMN to nuclear bodies known as Gems. Furthermore, FUS has been shown to associate with SMN as well as specific snRNPs whose biogenesis is SMN-dependent and might be disrupted by ALS-linked FUS mutations. Together, these findings suggest that FUS and SMN are functionally linked through a shared molecular pathway(s) and support the view that SMA and ALS are related motor neuron diseases. However, the normal requirement of FUS for snRNP biogenesis and the pathogenic impact of FUS mutations on SMN biology have not yet been defined mechanistically, and the contribution of SMN dysfunction to FUS-ALS pathology remains unknown. To address these outstanding questions directly, our project takes a systematic, multi-disciplinary approach involving novel mouse models of FUS-dependent ALS to explore potential SMN-dependent mechanisms of FUS-mediated motor neuron degeneration. In Aim 1, we will investigate the phenotypic effects of both reduced and increased SMN expression on FUS-dependent motor neuron pathology in mouse models of ALS. In Aim2, we will employ a comprehensive set of molecular approaches to establish the functional relevance of normal and pathogenic FUS-SMN interactions in the pathway(s) of snRNP biogenesis in motor neurons using a combination of cellular and animal model systems. Collectively, these studies aim to establish convergent mechanisms in ALS and SMA and will yield a more complete understanding of the biology of FUS and SMN that is relevant to motor neuron survival. Identification of shared molecular pathways contributing to death and dysfunction of motor neurons in SMA and ALS may also expand the range of therapeutic targets for these diseases."

Aim 2 will develop and validate electroencephalography(EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that can improve important CNS functions, such as motor control in people with severe neuromuscular disabilities (e.g., stroke) and emotion regulation in people with addiction disorders (thereby reducing craving and substance abuse). Aim 3 will develop and validate methods that use electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals from the cortical surface to localize and characterize brain processes with temporal and spatial resolution beyond that now possible. This work will develop novel algorithms for modeling, co-registration, representation, and reduction of ECoG signals; and will incorporate them into real-time software for detecting, mapping, and interacting with the brain processes underlying specific functions and dysfunctions. Aim 4 will create a novel interdisciplinary training curriculum that provides a theoretical foundation in adaptive neurotechnologies and practical experience in applying them to important scientific and clinical applications. This curriculum will be incorporated into training courses and workshops. Aim 5 will develop and support dissemination channels for adaptive neurotechnologies, including: the highly interactive Center website; review articles in scientific, engineering, and clinical journals; and presentations and workshops at scientific and clinical meetings."
"9527909","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Locating objects of interest in space is a vital aspect of sensation. In most mammals, olfaction plays an important role in localization, yet the neural basis of this ability remains poorly understood. As animals move toward an odor source, the odor concentration changes from sniff to sniff. These concentration changes have been shown to guide odor source localization in studies of freely moving animals. Yet studies in freely moving animals do not allow sufficient stimulus control for precise study of olfactory neuronal or behavioral responses. We have developed a system for presenting stimuli that rapidly change concentration to head- fixed mice. In this proposal, we will use this system to mimic odor concentration fluctuation during source localization and to study how the mouse olfactory bulb represents stimuli that change concentration from sniff to sniff. In preliminary experiments, we have found that a subset of neurons in the olfactory bulb is sensitive to concentration changes, modulating their activity when the odor concentration changes across sniffs. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the novel response properties of these neurons in electrophysiological recordings. In Specific Aim 2, we will take an optogenetic approach to test whether these concentration change sensitive neurons are a functional cell type. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will record in animals performing a precise psychophysical task in which they report detection of concentration changes. We will ask whether activity in concentration change sensitive neurons can predict the animal's perceptual report. By defining the neural representation of ethologically relevant odor dynamics, our work will advance a general understanding of how the brain operates with input that changes through time, which is essential to guide successful behavior."
"9396075","PROJECT SUMMARY Increased anxiety during alcohol withdrawal is a central characteristic of alcohol dependence and has been reported as a common, underlying cause of relapse in those with alcohol dependence, which is a critical barrier to their treatment. Animal models of alcohol dependence likewise show increased anxiety-like behaviors during alcohol withdrawal, suggesting they are a valid translational model. The lateral/basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been identified as a critical component of the neural circuitry that regulates many emotional behaviors, including anxiety. Our laboratory has recently shown that chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal produce distinct synaptic alterations in the BLA that are input- and timing-specific. For example, glutamatergic afferents arriving within the stria terminalis (ST) along the medial BLA boundary express a presynaptic form of plasticity that develops early during alcohol exposure, whereas inputs arriving via the external capsule (EC) along the lateral boarder of the BLA express postsynaptic potentiation later in alcohol exposure. These data suggest that this initial presynaptic facilitation of ST inputs may be crucial for development of the behavioral and physiologic characteristics that develop during prolonged ethanol exposure. However, little is known about how specific inputs from distinct upstream brain regions are affected by chronic ethanol exposure or how these might independently influence anxiety during alcohol withdrawal. In the current NRSA proposal, we will examine inputs to the BLA from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the agranular insular cortex (AI), which project to the BLA via these two anatomically distinct pathways. Thus, the overall goal of this training proposal is to understand whether the mPFC and/or AI inputs to the BLA undergo similar or unique synaptic alterations following chronic ethanol exposure/withdrawal, and whether they are necessary for the expression of withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior. Our central hypothesis is that early presynaptic facilitation of the ST- BLA from mPFC inputs is necessary for the subsequent neurophysiologic and behavioral consequences of chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal. We will address this hypothesis through two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will use DREADD technology to manipulate these BLA inputs at different times during chronic ethanol exposure and use a variety of anxiety assays including the elevated plus maze and light/dark box. Our hypothesis is that early facilitation of mPFC-BLA inputs during chronic ethanol exposure mediate withdrawal- induced anxiety-like behavior. Using these same animals, in Aim 2, we will employ whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology and optogenetics to characterize the temporal physiological relationships between pre- and postsynaptic potentiation of ST- and EC-BLA synapses following chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal. The identification of specific brain regions might lead to potential novel targets for more effective treatments of alcohol withdrawal-induced anxiety in the clinical setting."

"9323535","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  This project will investigate the systems-level mechanisms of reinforcement learning as applied towards attention and visual-motor associative learning. We will use cross-areal neuronal recordings as well as combined cortical and subcortical stimulation in awake, behaving macaques to study prefrontal-striatal interactions during learning, and to drive attention and learning. We will record simultaneously in the lateral prefrontal cortex and striatum while animals perform an online learning task, to characterize learning-related changes in their correlated activity. We predict that learning will modify the magnitude or nature of these interactions. Furthermore, we will attempt to drive visual-spatial attention and visual-motor associative learning through the application of microstimulation to the frontal eye fields and to the dopamine-neuron containing regions of the midbrain. We predict that such combined stimulation will synergistically potentiate neural responses in the striatum, and will produce learned (programmed) biases in attention and visualmotor behavior."
"9318583","PROJECT SUMMARY  The pathological accumulation of alpha-synuclein (?-syn) is believed to play a major role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. The autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) provides for the high-capacity clearance of ?-syn and its dysfunction is well-documented in PD. Inhibiting the ALP has been shown to induce ?-syn accumulation. Conversely, excess ?-syn has been shown to inhibit the ALP. Because the lysosome is critical for ?-syn clearance we believe its continued investigation will further delineate mechanisms of PD pathogenesis and foster development of PD therapeutics. Alpha-Galactosidase A (?-Gal A) is a soluble lysosomal enzyme, with mutations causing the rare lysosomal disorder Fabry disease. While it is unknown if ?- syn accumulates in Fabry patients, our analysis of postmortem PD brains indicates a decrease in ?-Gal A activity specific to specimens with increased ?-syn pathology. Our preliminary data also indicate reduced ?-Gal A activity in neuroblastoma cells following the conditional over-expression of ?-syn. Together with our report of ?-syn pathology and altered ALP markers in ?-Gal A-deficient mouse brain, these findings suggest a strong link between ?-Gal A deficiency and ?-syn accumulation. However, whether ?-Gal A deficiency exacerbates the neurotoxic potential of ?-syn is unknown. Increasing ?-Gal A activity via enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is clinically approved therapy for Fabry disease. Because ERT has limited CNS bioavailability, there is a critical gap in understanding its potential for treating PD. To help bridge this gap we developed novel research tools to increase ?-Gal A activity in neuronal systems, including its dose-responsive increase in neuronal cells via ERT, and transgenic mice that exhibit two-fold increases in ?-Gal A brain activity. Our preliminary data in neuroblastoma cells shows that ?-Gal A ERT enhances the clearance of over-expressed ?-syn. However, whether increasing ?-Gal A activity attenuates ?-syn-associated neurotoxicity has not been tested. Taken together, we hypothesize that ?-syn-associated neurotoxicity is exacerbated by ?-Gal A deficiency and is attenuated by increasing ?-Gal A activity. In Aim 1 we will determine if ?-Gal A-deficiency in primary neuron cultures exacerbates neurotoxicity resulting from the exogenous addition of ?-syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) in a manner concomitant with ALP disruption. We will also determine if ?-Gal A?deficient mice exhibit exacerbated loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra following AAV2-mediated over- expression of human wild-type ?-syn. In Aim 2 we will determine if ?-syn PFF-mediated neurotoxicity in primary neuron cultures is attenuated by ?-Gal A ERT or the transgenic over-expression of ?-Gal A and if this protection is regulated by the ALP. We will also determine if ?-Gal A over-expressing mice exhibit a reduction in TH-positive neuron loss resulting from AAV2-?-syn. If our hypothesis is correct, it would suggest that ?-Gal A deficiency regulates ?-syn pathogenesis, a mechanism worthy of future investigation, and would accelerate the development of therapeutics for PD that act by increasing CNS ?-Gal A activity."
"9398865","ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Vectors, Pathogens and Diseases: Current Trends and Emerging Challenges, organized by Drs. Maureen Coetzee, Josiane Etang, Stephen Torr, and Scott L. O'Neill. The conference will be held in Durban, South Africa from September 10-14, 2017. The elimination or eradication of several vector-borne diseases is high on the agenda of the World Health Organization, including malaria, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis. Sustainable vector control is currently the only mass prevention strategy. Success, however, is hampered by many challenges posed by both the vectors and the pathogens. These challenges include insecticide resistance in mosquitoes and drug resistance in parasites with little on the immediate horizon to alleviate these problems. Insecticide and drug resistance are two parallel phenomena in vectors and parasites. While combination drugs have been developed to overcome parasite resistance to monotherapies, only four classes of insecticides are available for vector control. The unexpected emergence of arboviruses such as Zika in Brazil and south-east Asia, yellow fever in southern Africa, Dengue and Chikungunya, etc. pose their own unique challenges. The key goals of this conference are to review the latest scientific knowledge on vectors and pathogens that are responsible for emerging or re-emerging diseases, to highlight the problems facing various parts of the world, to address innovative methods for the control or elimination of vector-borne diseases and to enhance awareness of the landscape of vector-borne diseases and related new scientific knowledge aiming at improving the health of vulnerable human populations. In addition, the difficulties in ?going the final mile? to achieve elimination, in terms of surveillance, capacity and funding, will be addressed. The conference also aims to break down the ?insect silos? in which the vector-borne disease research community too commonly operates, providing a forum for researchers to interact, create networks and partnerships, exchange ideas, and think creatively across disciplines."
"9368662","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: IWITH-IN As many as 75% of long-term pediatric liver allografts harbor chronic portal inflammation, interface hepatitis, and/or fibrosis (peri-portal and/or peri-venular), even in the face of normal liver tests. Substantial gaps in knowledge remain as to the natural history, risk factors, and mechanisms of subclinical, progressive, chronic allograft deterioration. Interventions to mitigate inexorable allograft damage must be informed by definitive data regarding sensitive and specific biomarkers of progressive allograft injury and/or detailed knowledge regarding injury mechanism(s). To attack the problem of structural deterioration of pediatric liver allografts, our proposed ancillary study will utilize a unique and invaluable set of longitudinal data and tissue (blood and biopsy) specimens from subjects identified as INeligible to proceed to immunosuppression withdrawal in the parent iWITH study. The data and specimens will be collected during the tenure of and made available by the leadership of the parent iWITH study. This proposal responds eloquently to the Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR-16-034 as it leverages unique and rich information available for the iWITH-IN cohort that are the focus of this ancillary study proposal. This proposal calls for a direct and detailed interrogation of the allograft microenvironment, to identify demographic, clinical, serological, and histological characteristics associated with allograft stability versus progression as determined by a central pathologist's assessment of sequential surveillance liver biopsies separated by 4-5 years. Pre-designed multiplex staining panels will be used to characterize parenchymal, non- parenchymal, and infiltrating cell populations. These phenotypic data will be complemented by and correlated with transcriptional profiling data indicative of the allograft's functional status as well as serological data indicative of the humoral immune response to the allograft. Finally, sophisticated statistical analytical platforms will be utilized to integrate clinical data with the histological, serological, immunohistochemical, and transcriptional data streams to generate cross-platform risk classifiers and/or elucidate mechanisms of progressive allograft damage. The innovation of this proposal is embodied in the longitudinal liver biopsies to delineate patterns of allograft deterioration and the cutting-edge cross-platform analyses of rich and varied datasets. These essential resources are absolutely without parallel. Moreover, the PI has recruited and led a team of clinical and translational investigators with stellar records of expertise and experience. The knowledge gained will yield the requisite insight to guide the rational design of intervention(s) to arrest, reverse, and/or prevent subclinical chronic allograft damage that threatens the health and longevity of pediatric liver transplant recipients."
"9315172","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) was created in 2005 to evaluate the clinical course of perinatally acquired HIV infection among adolescents and pre-adolescents and the consequences of fetal and neonatal exposure to HIV and antiretroviral chemotherapy among a representative cohort of children in the United States. PHACS is comprised of a Scientific Leadership Group (SLG), which is overseen by a Coordinating Center, a Data and Operations Center (DOC), and 22 clinical units (CU). The Department of Epidemiology and the Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research at the Harvard School of Public Health, Westat, and the Frontier Science Foundation form the PHACS DOC. The DOC collaborates with the SLG to define the PHACS research agenda; provides methodological leadership for the development of all PHACS analytic projects; maintains CU subcontracts and trains and monitors sites in proper procedures for PHACS research; plans and conducts all leadership and full PHACS network meetings; develops HIV- and health- related educational materials and opportunities for the PHACS community; and, supports an active Community Advisory Board. The Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP), a cohort of 450 perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and preadolescents age 7-16 at enrollment, was established to investigate the impact of HIV and ART on organ systems, growth and development, sexual maturation, pubertal development, cognition, emotional development, and socialization; AMP Up was subsequently designed to extend follow-up of AMP participants and other HIV-infected young adults who have reached 18 years of age using a streamlined, mobile-friendly protocol. A drug toxicity surveillance system, Surveillance Monitoring for Anti-Retroviral Toxicities (SMART), has enrolled 3,506 perinatally HIV-exposed, uninfected children to evaluate long-term effects of in-utero ART exposure. In PHACS III, the DOC will continue to carry out the PHACS scientific agenda in an increasing efficient manner, enrolling and following an additional 1,000 newborns into SMARTT and an additional 525 HIV-infected and HIV-exposed, uninfected young adults into AMP Up. Together, HSPH, Westat and Frontier Science bring a long and successful history of providing the scientific and operational leadership required by PHACS, as well as innovative methods to enhance and maximize the efficiency of the PHACS study design, conduct, and analyses. Given our prior experience we are uniquely positioned to continue to provide the scientific/epidemiologic and operational leadership essential to the continued success of PHACS."
"9315814","Project Description Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are one of five epithelial cell lineages in the intestine that arise from intestinal stem cells. EECs are notable for their secretion of peptide hormones and biogenic amines. Secreted products regulate food intake, energy homeostasis, insulin secretion and the function of most digestive organs. Relatively little is known about the transcriptional programs that drive enteroendocrine cell differentiation. Until recently, it has difficult to isolate enough EECs for gene expression analysis since EECs represent less than 2% of the intestinal epithelium. The ability to collect fluorescently labeled EECs from transgenic mice combined with technological improvements in high throughput sequencing, make it possible to consider gene expression studies in EECs that previously could not be done. Two basic helix loop helix transcription factors are critical for EEC differentiation. Neurogenin3 (Neurog3) is required for the earliest stages of EEC specification but can give rise to nonendocrine cell types. Expression of the bHLH protein NeuroD1 is expressed in all EECs, restricting cells to an endocrine cell fate. As a relatively weak transcriptional activator, it is not known how NeuroD1 drives cells to become EECs. Our understanding is further limited by the paucity of identified NeuroD1 targets in enteroendocrine cells. An increasing body of information has revealed that tissue specific expression depends on both the local chromatin environment and enhancer occupancy by multiple tissue specific transcription factors. The overall goals of this proposal are to identify NeuroD1 transcriptional targets, to identify other proteins that occupy sites close to NeuroD1, and determine how NeuroD1 activity is influenced by the local chromatin environment. In addition, the contribution of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors bound to nearby sites, to NeuroD1 transcriptional activity will be examined. The goal of Aim 1 is to identify genes that are activated by NeuroD1 in EECs and to identify other transcription factors that bind to DNA in close proximity with NeuroD1 to enhance target gene expression. Studies in Aim 2 will examine the broad role of RREB1 and LSD1, two members of the CtBP co-repressor complex that associate with NeuroD1 to potentiate transcription. The goal of Aim 3 is to determine the importance open chromatin subtypes and enhancer occupancy by multiple transcription factors in NeuroD1 driven tissue specific gene expression. The final goal of Aim3 will be to determine if any identified NeuroD1 enhancer clusters are linked to disease associated variants (SNPs) in the GWAS catalogue. Completion of the proposed studies will expand our knowledge about enteroendocrine cell differentiation and their potential impact on common diseases like diabetes and obesity."
"9317026","Abstract: The Scale-Up Component of the Partnership in Implementation Science for Geriatric Mental Health (PRISM) project proposes an evidence-based physical exercise intervention for older adults who exhibit behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). The intervention will be delivered in Thai communities through an evidence-based implementation strategy of ?task sharing? among community health workers (CHWs), nurses, primary care physicians, and mental health specialists. In response to the common problem of technical and cultural compatibility between evidence-based interventions and local implementation contexts as well as the uneven local political will for implementing mental health service initiatives, we propose to develop and test an innovative implementation support strategy (i.e., the GTO-ThAI model), based on the evidence-based Getting-to-Outcome model, which will be adapted to Thai settings, to ensure the success of implementation and scaling up of the mental health service for older adults in Thailand. To our knowledge, no previous study has examined the effectiveness of a GTO-ThAI implementation support strategy for delivering clinical interventions for older adults with BPSD in Asia.  The proposed evaluation study will conduct a randomized controlled trial with a Hyprid Type 3 design to compare the intervention arm that implements the culturally-adapted GTO model (GTO-ThAI) to deliver implementation support, with a control arm, which receives usual top-down administrative instruction for implementing a policy initiative. Our specific scale-up study aims are to: 1) tailor an evidence-based physical exercise intervention (EBPEI) to fit with Thai local social, cultural, and policy context (Yr 1); 2) develop culturally-informed tools to assess readiness for implementing EBPEI to improve mental health of older adults in local provinces of Thailand (Yr 1); 3) develop the GTO-ThAI implementation support model through a pre- implementation case study and formative evaluation (Yr 2); 4) evaluate implementation strategies and clinical outcomes through a hybrid Type 3 randomized trial to test effectiveness of the GTO-ThAI implementation support strategy for the delivery of EBPEI, compared with the existing standard administrative procedures for delivering the same EBPEI (Yrs 3-4); 5) develop policy recommendations with tools and performance indicators (Yr 5). The proposed scale-up study is expected to generate knowledge and tools essential for further scale-up of mental health services in Thailand, and will contribute significantly to knowledge development within other NIMH program HUBs on going to scale with mental health innovations in LMICs."
"9333125","Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke,  relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as  cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While  vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a  dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center)  to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our  preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and  Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling  modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.    Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.    The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and  create a sustainable data-sharing consortia. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal. The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility."
"9347541","Project Summary Rodent-borne viral outbreaks are increasing in both frequency and impact. As weather patterns evolve, rodent populations are affected and may multiply in areas where increased contact with humans results in infection. Hantaviruses, including Andes (ANDV) and Sin Nombre (SNV), are transmitted through the excreta of infected rodents and, when aerosolized, infect humans. In the Americas, hantavirus infection leads to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), a devastating condition that features rapid onset of pulmonary edema, respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. Treatment is supportive, not pathogen-targeted, and accordingly, approximately 40% of patients do not survive. Because hantaviruses establish lifelong, asymptomatic infections in their rodent reservoirs, they are highly prevalent in nature and represent a constant threat to humans. For example, SNV is carried by the most abundant mammal in North America, the deer mouse, which has a near ubiquitous distribution throughout the US and Canada. In the case of the South American ANDV, in addition to rodent-to-human transmission, human-to-human transmission occurs, putting not only the patient, but also family members and health care workers at risk. Despite this large potential for infection and the high case fatality rate, there are no FDA-approved treatment options or vaccines available. Hantaviruses are thus classified as NIAID Priority Pathogens and considered potential bioterrorism threats. Our long term goal is to develop an effective therapeutic against HCPS-causing hantaviruses. This proposal seeks to develop human neutralizing antibodies for therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of HCPS caused by ANDV. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of molecular virologists, clinicians, B cell immunologists, and industry partners with experience developing antibody-based therapeutics. The successful development of a potent neutralizing antibody against ANDV has the potential to be a first-line antiviral for the treatment or prevention of HCPS."
"9368648","FDA Orphan Products Grants Program 1 Ph 1/2 Study of PRTX-100 for Immune Thrombocytopenia Project Summary/Abstract Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a bleeding disorder characterized by a decreased number of circulating platelets. Platelets are blood cell fragments that are critical for proper blood clotting. ITP is considered an orphan condition because it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. ITP can be a chronically debilitating and life threatening condition due to the high risk of bleeding. Although ITP is not commonly fatal, the propensity to bleed, the side effects of some treatments, and significant fatigue, which is a very common symptom of ITP, have been shown to substantially reduce a patient?s quality of life. Current treatment options for ITP are often unsuitable for long-term use due to side effects, tolerability, or administration issues. Advances made in understanding the mechanisms causing ITP have led to the development of newer agents, however there is still a need for therapies that provide additional improvements in efficacy, safety, and convenience. The proposed project will support the clinical development of a potentially new treatment for ITP called PRTX-100, which may offer benefits over current therapies. This is in line with the goal of FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) grant program, to support the clinical development of products for use in rare diseases or conditions where current therapy options are absent or where the proposed product will be superior to existing therapies. PRTX-100 is a highly purified protein drug product under investigation as an injectable treatment for autoimmune diseases including ITP. The mechanism of action of PRTX-100 may involve multiple modulatory effects on the immune system and the rationale for its development as an ITP therapy is based on observations in preclinical investigations and clinical studies demonstrating that it may improve platelet levels with an acceptable safety profile. The clinical study central to the project, PRTX- 100-202, is a phase one/two multi-site trial in the US, evaluating up to 6 different doses of PRTX-100 in up to 36 adult patients with ITP. The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the ability of PRTX-100 to increase platelet levels in ITP patients who have a very low number of platelets in their blood (less than 50,000/µl; normal is greater than 150,000/µl). Additional study objectives are to evaluate the safety of PRTX-100 at each dose level, and measure blood levels of PRTX-100 and effects on specific elements of the immune system after repeated doses. A very important outcome of this study is to identify the dose and treatment schedule that can be used in future studies with PRTX-100 in patients with ITP. In the PRTX-100-202 study, 3 ITP patients will initially receive weekly treatments with the lowest dose of PRTX-100 for a period of 4 weeks. Patients will be monitored weekly following their last treatment for one month, followed by 2 monthly visits and then visits at 6 months and 12 months to study the effectiveness and safety of PRTX-100. After the first 3 patients complete their 4 weeks of treatment, an independent monitoring committee will review the patient data and determine if another group of 3 patients can be treated at the next higher dose or if these patients should be studied at the current dose. Based on the data from patients treated at each of the 6 different doses of PRTX-100 an additional group of patients will be treated with a selected dose(s) the help determine the best dose and treatment schedule to be used for treating ITP patients with PRTX-100. Determining the most appropriate dose PRTX-100 will be critically important for the clinical development and potential approval of PRTX-100 for the treatment of ITP."
"9370511","ABSTRACT Electronic cigarettes (or e-cigarettes) are currently a popular emerging tobacco product. Because e-cigarettes do not generate toxic tobacco combustion products produced when smoking regular cigarettes, they are perceived and sometimes promoted as a less harmful alternative to smoking and also as a means to quit smoking. Although they may be less harmful, the ef?cacy of using them for smoking cessation has not been demonstrated conclu- sively with studies indicating evidence both favoring and opposing such an application for them. Furthermore, owing to their recent introduction, there are also safety concerns given reported adverse events. The US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has introduced regulations that went into effect on 8/8/2016 requiring FDA review for e-cigarette products, banning sales to minors and free samples, and requiring warning labels on certain prod- ucts. In this context, surveillance of evolving themes and factors contributing to message popularity for e-cigarette chatter on social media platforms is an important activity. Twitter has become the favorite network for teenagers and young adults owing to the short message size and associated ease of use on smart phones. For an emerg- ing product like e-cigarettes, the asymmetric follower-friend connections and hashtag functionality in Twitter offer a convenient way to propagate information and facilitate discussion. Among online forums, Reddit allows for longer messages from users inviting speci?c feedback from other users. Within Reddit, the e-cigarette subreddit facilitates focused discussions on e-cigarette use and products. In this project, we propose to computationally analyze the contents and user pro?les available in the dataset of all e-cigarette tweets generated during 7/2016? 6/2017 and all e-cigarette subreddit posts/comments generated since 9/2016. We will continue such analyses with data collected through free but rate limited API throughout the duration of the project. Our ?rst aim is to sur- face speci?c themes of interest directly from e-cigarette messages using phrase based online and binned topic models. We expect these themes to complement familiar broad themes that researchers currently consider when analyzing online messages. Next, we will identify factors (involving message content and pro?le characteristics) that contribute to different notions of popularity (#retweets, #replies, #up-votes) of e-cigarette tweets/messages. We expect these results will help health agencies, the FDA, and researchers gain insights into observed viral nature of certain messages and designing effective strategies to maximize diffusion of their messages. Finally, we will conduct these analyses along the dimensions of gender, race, and age to grasp variations in themes and popularity factors speci?c to different vulnerable demographic segments."
"9326369","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     A neuropathological hallmark of a group of neurodegenerative diseases, known as human 'synucleinopathies', is the presence of intracellular protein aggregates, Lewy bodies (LB), upon postmortem brain examination. The alpha-synuclein protein is a major component of LB. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the prototype of human 'synucleinopathies' and has been studied extensively. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated the alpha-synuclein (SNCA) gene as a central player in the pathogenesis of PD. Several studies in cell-cultures and animal models reported that over expression of wild-type SNCA can be toxic and may lead to cell death. Moreover, previously we documented elevated SNCA expression in sporadic-PD patients. Describing the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of SNCA expression, and any genetic variability that impinges on this regulation, is highly important for understanding the pathogenesis of LB related diseases. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the genetic elements controlling SNCA expression. We will further investigate whether any genetic variants in SNCA locus and/or changes in gene expression are associated with a broad-spectrum of LB diseases, focusing on autopsy-confirmed cases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and LB presentation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To accomplish our goals, we will address the following specific aims: 1. Determine whether SNCA variants are associated with LB neuropathology in neurodegenerative diseases, specifically in AD and DLB. 2. Determine whether genetic variability in the SNCA locus alters SNCA-mRNA and protein expression in different anatomic areas of neuropathologically normal and LB-affected human brains; 3. Explore in depth candidate sub-regions within the SNCA locus to identify novel variants that contribute to the risk to develop LB pathology, and evaluate their effect on SNCA expression. The fulfillment of these aims will enrich our understanding of the genetic basis of variability in SNCA expression and the general relevance of these variants to LB pathology. Moreover, the proposed studies will enhance our understanding of the genetic risk factors and molecular mechanisms that contribute to LB diseases including PD and provide valuable information for developing therapies targeting SNCA expression levels."
"9375341","Although significant advances have been made in cancer treatment, the prognosis for oral cancer remains poor in comparison to other cancer types, including breast, skin, and prostate. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are necessary to improve the outcome of this disease. The discovery that the introduction of chemically synthesized small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into mammalian cells could efficiently induce sequence-specific inhibition of gene expression, made evident the therapeutic potential of harnessing RNA interference (RNAi) as a means to specifically target and silence disease-causing genes. Although the design of therapeutic-grade siRNAs has improved, delivery still remains the single greatest obstacle towards the pervasive use of siRNAs for therapeutic applications. Thus, to enhance the intracellular bioavailability of siRNAs in diseased tissues, effective new strategies for delivery are needed. Recently, we demonstrated that a novel peptide carrier we designed, termed 599, that comprised cell-penetrating and endosome-disruptive properties, could enhance the intracellular delivery and bioavailability of siRNAs designed to target the CIP2A oncogene (siCIP2A) into oral cancer cells in vitro, with intratumoral administration of the 599 peptide-siCIP2A complex inducing CIP2A silencing and consequently tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Despite these findings, further studies are still needed to better understand the importance in the chemical design of the 599 peptide and in determining the therapeutic effectiveness of administering the 599 peptide intravenously, since systemic delivery remains the standard method of administering drugs for the treatment of solid tumors. Consequently, because the 599 peptide was not cell/tissue-specific, we recently developed a dual peptide-mediated technology, where we found in our preliminary studies that combining a cancer cell-targeting peptide with the 599 peptide into a dual peptide-siCIP2A complex could mediate increased targeted delivery of siCIP2As into tumor tissues and significantly enhance CIP2A silencing upon systemic delivery. Therefore, based on the above findings, the goal of the current proposal is to further develop and improve upon the design of this 599 peptide-based siRNA delivery strategy for the treatment of oral cancer by determining the importance of amino acid chirality in 599 peptide design/function and whether systemic delivery of siCIP2As using the dual peptide- mediated technology can reduce tumor burden. To accomplish this goal, we will use biochemical and molecular biology approaches to: (1) determine the functional importance of stereochemistry in terms of 599 peptide-mediated intracellular delivery of bioactive siRNAs; and (2) determine the efficacy of the dual peptide- siCIP2A complex in mediating tumor growth inhibition in treated animals. The outcomes of the proposed research are expected to lead to improved chemical designs of the 599 peptide in mediating the delivery of bioactive siRNAs into cancer cells/tissues and in helping establish the therapeutic potential of the dual peptide- mediated technology for RNAi-based therapy in human oral cancer."

This AIM will be realized by scheduling annual in-person meetings with the grant PIs, external  SAB and the NIH Program Officer(s), to evaluate progress and provide critical guidance towards successful  completion of the program."
"9384029","ABSTRACT The anti-nuclear autoantibodies (ANA) present in lupus are high-affinity, class-switched Abs that arise through T cell-dependent germinal center (GC) reactions. GC development and persistence is dependent on help from Follicular Helper CD4+ T cells (TFH). Although aberrant development and function of TFH drive disease in both SLE patients and murine models of lupus, the molecular and cellular pathways that initiate and reinforce the TFH fate remain poorly defined. This limits our ability to dissect the altered biology underlying lupus. Additionally, the study of human TFH has been hampered by lack of access to the secondary lymphoid tissues where they differentiate and function. Changes in the epigenetic code mediate the identity, specificity, stability, and function of differentiated CD4+ T helper (Th) cell subsets. Indeed, the epigenetic landscape may be a better indicator of the developmental and functional relationships amongst Th subsets than lineage-specific transcription factors. In preliminary data, our epigenetic analyses show that a significant number of lupus susceptibility GWAS SNPs map to regions of open chromatin in TFH, suggesting that altered TFH biology mediates a significant component of lupus genetic risk. We previously used unique murine models to define discreet stages of TFH differentiation: conventional DCs prime CD4+ T cells toward an unstable pre-TFH intermediate that expresses Bcl6 and CXCR5. Cognate T-B interactions drive the pre-TFH to produce IL-21, express PD-1, and repress production of IL-17. Preliminary epigenetic analyses confirm that pre-TFH are not fully committed to the TFH fate and show that we can identify a B cell-dependent module. However, B cell MHCII expression--with no requirement for DC priming--is sufficient for TFH differentiation in immunological settings similar to lupus. The proposal will utilize unique murine models and primary human cells to establish the epigenetic roadmap that defines commitment to the TFH fate. Lupus-prone mice with limited expression of MHCII will be utilized to define how sequential interactions between CD4+ T cells and DCs followed by B cells mediate changes in the epigenetic code. ATAC-Seq analyses of pre-TFH and TFH will identify the regulatory cascades, transcription factor programs, and metabolic pathways that are regulated by DCs and B cells during TFH differentiation. Secondly, we will build on these analyses to define how lupus disrupts this transcriptional and functional program. Does lupus: 1. alter the requirement for sequential cDC and B cell antigen presentation in the differentiation and maintenance of TFH? or 2. disrupt the epigenetic landscape of TFH differentiation and commitment? These experiments should identify the epigenetic signatures that 1. Define the B cell contribution to TFH differentiation and 2. Distinguish TFH in lupus and health controls. These results will provide the framework for future therapeutic interventions to ameliorate disease."
"9256997","Duke University's Superfund Research Center examines the problem of early life exposure to hazardous chemicals and later life consequences. Growing evidence suggests that the toxic effects of certain chemicals on mitochondrial function can be highly persistent, and that some individuals may be more sensitive due to genetic differences. Mitochondria undergo biogenesis and major functional changes during early development and cellular differentiation, periods during which epigenetic reprogramming also occurs. We will test the hypotheses that mitochondrial toxicity during vulnerable, plastic windows of mitochondrial and epigenetic programming results in persistent mitochondrial dysfunction, persistent epigenetic repatterning, and that these changes are mechanistically linked. We will assess the persistence of both mitochondrial and epigenetic changes throughout life, and through three subsequent generations, to test the possibility that effects are persistent even in the absence of direct chemical exposure. We acknowledge and will also test the possibilities that persistent mitochondrial effects are not mediated by epigenetic changes, and that epigenetic changes may occur but not have effects on mitochondrial function. Finally, we will also test the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction will be exacerbated in genetic backgrounds, chosen on the basis of human mitochondrial disease relevance, in which mitochondrial homeostatic processes are reduced. Innovative aspects of this proposal include: 1) examination of epigenetic and transcriptional changes linked to mitochondrial disruption during potentially sensitive windows of time early in development and during cellular differentiation; 2) analysis of less-studied histone modifications in conjunction with better-studied cytosine methylation; 3) systematic examination of the effects of deficiencies in genetic pathways that modulate mitochondrial toxicity; and 4) development of high-throughput, rapid, in vivo and in vitro systems for testing persistent and trasngenerational effects. "
"9321529","ABSTRACT (Core B: Viral Genetics Core) Viral rebound from latent HIV-1 reservoirs is the major threat for HIV-positive patients. One major hurdle in defining viral rebound is the inability of current technology to accurately quantify the latent HIV-1 viral pool and track the reactivation and viral expansion events that contribute to the rebound process. The overall goal of this program project is to develop a better understanding of HIV rebound using the humanized BLT (bone marrow- liver-thymus) mouse model for HIV infection and latency. To improve this model, we have developed a barcode approach to track the HIV infection during initial acute infection, ART suppression (latency) and rebound with Drs. Matt Marsden and Jerry Zack. We have also developed highly sensitive sequencing approach with Dr. Otto Yang to define viral quasi-species in HIV patient samples, which will be applied to our analysis of viral sequences in this project. In pursuit of the goals of the P01, Core B will provide novel viral genetic technology. The rationale for this technology is to enable more precise measurements of HIV-1 latently infected cells that are induced to express in vivo, and to more effectively monitor the viral strains that emerge and predominate in the plasma and tissues during rebound. Our innovative strategy involves barcoding individual HIV-1 viruses and then using them for tracking infection, thereby enabling the marking of each latently infected cell with a unique barcode identifier, and thereafter progeny viruses. The barcoded HIV-1 latent pool will then allow us to track the viral activity (transcription and virion production) in each latently infected cell as well as the fate of these latently infected cells by sequence analysis of the barcodes present in samples harvested from in vitro and in vivo experiments. The objective of this Viral Genetic Core is to provide technical support for tracking HIV during acute infection, latency and rebound with the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Construction and characterization of barcoded HIV virus libraries. Specific Aim 2. Sequencing-analyses the barcoded libraries during acute infection, latency and rebound. We will provide barcode technology to understand the tissue location of latent reservoirs, how tissue/cellular environment and immune responses impact reactivation potentials, and subsequent expansion/elimination of the viral pool by various treatment and immune responses."
"9346072","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My career goal is to develop and apply new MRI technologies that will help us understand and address important issues in Healthcare. This award will allow me to train under the guidance of Prof. Vaughan, Prof. Ugurbil, Prof. Vitek and Dr. Harel and then as an independent scientist. Center for Magnetic Resonance Research at the University of Minnesota is one of the largest MRI research centers in the world. I believe that I can develop a strong research program in collaboration with valuable scientists in this institute with the support of this award. My background is in electrical engineering. I have expertise in the analysis of electromagnetic interactions of the fields in MRI with the human body. As part of this project, I would like to learn more about the clinical practice of deep brain stimulation (DBS). I believe that this will be a unique research direction that will distinguish my research from my current mentor as an independent researcher in the future. If we can develop safe methods related to this goal, this may create many new research directions related to imaging patients with various neurological diseases and treating them with DBS technology. I also would like acquire additional experience in thermodynamic modeling to assess the safety issues related to temperature increases in the living tissue. In addition I also plan to gain expertise in animal experiments for testing MR safety. We propose to develop a workflow that utilizes parallel RF transmitter arrays scan animals with implanted devices. We hypothesize that adding new degrees of freedom by increasing the number of channels will enable a safer, artifact-free imaging session. Multi-Channel excitation with RF coil arrays will enable temperature reduction around the implants. We hope that the workflow that we will develop with animal studies will pave the way for imaging patients with neural implants safely and efficiently in future clinical settings. This project will have an overall public health impact. If we can successfully complete the specific aims of this project, we will develop a workflow that may enable safe scanning of millions of patients who currently cannot be scanned. If we can enable MRI to safely use with the patients with neural implants we will be able to optimize the implant placement procedures. In addition we will be able to optimize the implant devices and the stimulation methods to treat neurological diseases like depression, bipolar disorder and Parkinson's disease. Based on my strong analytical background and my training in MRI and the guidance of my mentors, I believe that I can conduct the research that is proposed in this grant application."

"9358755","The commensal microbiota establishes a mutualistic relationship with the gut immune system by activating B cells via T cell-dependent (TD) and T cell-independent (TI) pathways that generate secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) with high and low affinity for antigen, respectively. High-affinity (HA)-SIgA emerges from a relatively well- understood TD pathway involving CD40L and is generally viewed as essential for gut homeostasis due to its specific recognition of bacterial cells. However, recent studies indicate that also (LA)-SIgA from a poorly understood TI pathway specifically recognizes commensal bacteria. Additional evidence shows that HA-SIgA coats colitogenic bacteria in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), raising the possibility that gut homeostasis requires balanced HA-SIgA and LA-SIgA responses. This proposal will combine an in-depth analysis of primary immunodeficiency (PID) specimens with studies of knockout, germfree and gnotobiotic mouse models to dissect the regulation, microbiota reactivity and function of LA-SIgA and HA-SIgA responses. Preliminary data show that TI production of LA-SIgA involves CD40-independent activation of gut B cells by TACI, a BAFF/APRIL receptor that triggers IgM-to-IgA class switching through the kinase mTOR. Additional preliminary evidence shows that TACI deficiency impairs microbiota diversity and gut homeostasis by decreasing the coating of bacterial cells by LA-SIgA. Here, we hypothesize that TACI and CD40 orchestrate LA-SIgA and HA-SIgA responses through mTOR-regulated TI and TD pathways targeting non-overlapping consortia of gut bacteria. Three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 is to elucidate the regulation of LA-SIgA and HA-SIgA responses by TACI and CD40 and dissect their reactivity for the gut microbiota. Aim 2 is to characterize the composition and function of bacterial communities targeted by LA-SIgA and HA-SIgA antibodies; Aim 3 is to dissect the functional interplay of LA-SIgA and HA-SIgA responses induced by TACI and CD40 with B cell signals from mTOR. This kinase activates B cells by engaging TACI through MyD88. The proposed studies (Project 3) will take advantage of cells, stool and tissues made available by this consortium and of the complementary and integrative expertise of the Cunningham-Rundles group, which evaluates the role of TACI in B cell proliferation and differentiation (Project 1), the Meffre group (Project 2), which explores the role of TACI and other key antibody- regulating molecules in B cell tolerance, and the Casanova group (Project 4), which seeks to identify new causative genes in PIDs."
"9360055","ABSTRACT People suffering from anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) very often use and abuse reinforcing drugs such as opioids. Although the comorbidity of PTSD and substance abuse is exceedingly high, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that result in this comorbidity. By leveraging the Fanselow laboratory's development of a preclinical model of PTSD with the expertise within the Center for Study of Opioid Receptors and Drugs of Abuse (CSORDA) we plan to attack this question. Based on findings with our model we hypothesize that, during a single traumatic event, stress hormones (corticosterone/cortisol) and neuromodulators (acetylcholine) act in concert on amygdala neurons resulting in changes in neural plasticity within this brain structure. These changes result in the altered fear responses that characterize several aspects of PTSD. The amygdala also contains neurons that participate in the rewarding property of drugs and we hypothesize that trauma causes similar changes in those neurons and this leads to increased drug reward learning. Therefore, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will determine if manipulations that mitigate the potentiation of fear learning caused by trauma also mitigate alterations in drug responsivity following trauma. Aim 2 seeks to identify a set of amygdala neurons that are activated by BOTH trauma and drug exposure and using optogenetics tests if activity in these neurons is necessary for comorbidity. We will also assess how stress and drug experience alter gene expression patterns in the amygdala. While most of the focus on drug use/anxiety disorder comorbidity has focused on stress as a causal factor in altered drug taking, we have obtained preliminary data that the converse is also true. A history of drug use and withdrawal increases the impact that a future stressor has on fear processes. Aim 3 investigates potential mechanisms for the ability of drug exposure to adversely impact fear behavior. We will determine if mu-opioid or kappa-opioid receptors in the amygdala are necessary for morphine's effects on future stress reactivity. We will also use resting state fMRI, with an amygdala seed, to determine the overlap in the modifications of whole brain connectivity caused by drug exposure and by stress."
"9398645","Project Summary/Abstract In the USA alone, over half of the 100,000 people that undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and up to 80 per cent of the 500,000 that have rotator cuff repairs yearly will experience repair failure, mostly due to the inability to regenerate a functioning enthesis. The structural and mechanical gradients of entheses are critical for normal function and regenerating these gradients is a major challenge. The present study?s goal is to develop a two- component system in which an electrospun template (component 1) will be used to deliver physicochemical cues to engineered adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) (component 2) to generate a countergradient of growth factors that will guide the regeneration of the gradient structure of the enthesis. Ultimately, we envision this strategy as part of an integrated reconstruction system to be deployed via state of the art arthroscopic surgical procedures, providing a template to promote complete tendon/ligament regeneration. The work proposed in this study will delve into the basis for enthesis regeneration, the missing link identified as a cornerstone for further development of this integrated system. To achieve this goal, the following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 is to develop and characterize electrospun templates with physicochemical cues to drive regeneration of a functional, biomimetic enthesis, component 1. Aim 2 is to generate engineered ASCs with synthetic gene regulatory networks constructed with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based logical gates that respond to stimuli to create countergradients of growth factors and drive regeneration of a functional enthesis, component 2. The electrospun templates will be characterized using standard protocols for structural and mechanical properties, in vitro elution of cumate, derived blue light gradient, in vitro cytocompatibility and in vivo biocompatibility. The engineered ASCs will be generated and their growth factor expression in response to stimuli will be evaluated by renilla reporter and on-cell western assays, while their paracrine effect on directing wild-type ASC differentiation in gradient patterns will be evaluated using a transwell assay under a defined cumate and light environment without a template. Results from this project will inform future research on interfacial tissue engineering and further development of a complete tendon/ligament reconstruction system that will alleviate the burden of reconstruction surgery failure."
"9324696","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We are facing an epidemic of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs), not only those found incidentally, but also through the proliferation of CT screening programs targeting high-risk individuals for lung cancer following the encouraging results of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Although the large majority of IPNs are benign, there are currently no effective predictive tools to discriminate benign from malignant nodules, leading to a large number of follow-up CTs, unnecessary invasive biopsies, anxiety, and wasted healthcare spending. Our project addresses this deficiency in knowledge, which we expect will result in improved non-invasive testing and paradigm-shifting prediction models in the clinical management of patients with IPNs. This project has the potential to transform the management of individuals presenting with IPNs. We aim at obtaining significant gains in non-invasive diagnostic accuracy of screening-detected and incidentally-detected IPNs by integrating clinical variables, innovative quantitative structural CT variables with novel blood-based biomarker candidates of IPNs. We will produce actionable diagnostic prediction models to personalize care and identify the small subset of individuals who will need a definitive intervention for lung cancer, and conversely, others who are at very low risk and do not require extensive follow-up. Based on findings from this project, we anticipate 1) using longitudinal data to improve our prediction accuracy for IPNs over time; 2) reduction in the rate of unneeded thoracotomies, the burden of unnecessary follow-up including anxiety; 3) ultimately increase the rate of cure and reduction of unnecessary radiation and healthcare cost."

"9526306","Engineering an intranasal universal influenza vaccine Influenza virus causes serious respiratory illness. Due to the high mutation rate in influenza genes, antigenic drift can create a new strain each year. Consequently there is significant economic burden to monitor virus activity and to create and distribute new influenza vaccines to the public each year. Furthermore, due to gene reassortment, a novel influenza subtype could emerge, which is virulent and has never circulated amongst humans, and could cause a devastating pandemic. It is therefore crucial that unlike current vaccines, more universal vaccination strategies be developed against influenza A that can protect against all influenza A subtypes. The 23 amino acid-long extracellular domain of the viral transmembrane protein M2 (M2e) found on human (h) influenza A viruses has remained highly conserved since the 1918 pandemic; and hM2e is thus considered a good candidate for the development of a universal influenza A vaccine. However, hM2e is poorly immunogenic. We have designed an intranasal delivery system for hM2e. Our studies show that by attaching hM2e to virus-mimicking gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and by using CpG as a soluble adjuvant (AuNP- hM2e+sCpG vaccine) a broad heterosubtypic protection can be observed in Balb/c mice against human H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A strains, and the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N1. However, the consensus amino acid sequence of M2e in human (h), avian (a), and swine (s) influenza viruses shows variability. Indeed our preliminary study shows that mice vaccinated intranasally by the AuNP-hM2e+sCpG vaccine are only partially protected against a lethal challenge by Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), which is an avian reassortant virus, and whose M2e sequence has more homology to avian aM2e than hM2e. Amazingly, our vaccine can also induce M2e antibody response in C57BL/6 mice and CD-1 mice (an outbred strain), thus demonstrating an ability to be applicable to a genetically diverse population. We thus hypothesize that a multivalent vaccine based on AuNP?M2e+sCpG and comprising of hM2e, aM2e, and sM2e consensus sequences as antigens can be developed in to a broadly cross-protective, durable and safe influenza A vaccine that is effective in a genetically diverse population. Our specific aims are: (i) Establish breadth of cross-protection in genetically diverse mouse strains and evaluate long term vaccine protection. (ii) Determine mechanism of immune stimulation by the vaccine. (iii) Determine biodistribution and safety of the vaccine. If successful these studies will provide the efficacy and safety data necessary to support moving the vaccine in to phase-I clinical trials."

"9409735","Project Summary/Abstract. ?-lactam antibiotics are the most widely used antibiotic class in the U.S., accounting for more than 50% of antibacterial prescriptions. Among other roles, they are critical therapeutics for difficult-to-treat infections due to gram negative pathogens such as E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter spp. However, the utility of this class of antibiotics is being rapidly compromised by the alarming spread of new ?-lactamase resistance mechanisms; enzymes produced by bacteria that hydrolytically inactivate ?-lactam antibiotics. A particularly important concern is the lack of orally bioavailable ?-lactam/?-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) combinations capable of addressing this emerging challenge, both in the Biodefense arena and in the hospital/community settings. Orally available ?-lactam combinations with legacy BLIs (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or Augmentin®) demonstrate reasonable activity against Gram negative pathogens expressing Ambler Class A Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamases (ESBLs), but lack activity against organisms expressing Class A carbapenemases (KPC-type), Class C cephalosporinases (chromosomal and plasmidic) and Class D oxacillinases. We have identified a compound series with potent and broad spectrum activity against these serine ?-lactamases. These compounds rescue the activity of the orally bioavailable cephalosporin cefixime in MDR-strains of Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. Moreover, we have shown that prototype prodrugs in the series demonstrate striking oral bioavailability in rodents, and that they rescue cefixime activity in murine models of bacterial disease. The objectives of this project are to advance the selected Development Candidate to IND filing for use in combination with cefixime."
"9321999","Project Summary Coma is a state of unconsciousness due to severe brain injury, in which patients are rendered unresponsive to external stimuli. Due to the limitations of current clinical tests in identifying a specific injury or causes associated with coma, devising treatment strategies for coma patients is a persistent clinical challenge. A signature feature of coma is severe disruption of the brain's electrical activity. Thus, the electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures the brain's electrical activity patterns, is routinely used in the neurology and neurosurgery intensive care unit (NNICU) to monitor patients in coma. However, the utility of EEG for diagnosing coma is largely limited to clinicians reading electrical activity in `raw' form as waveform tracings on a monitor. The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop and evaluate new algorithms, derived from engineering theory that will extract information about coma from the EEG that might not be apparent when reading the activity with the naked eye. Consequently, these new methods will enable the automatic EEG-based classification of coma etiology, gradation of injury severity, and prediction of clinical outcome. Eventually, these techniques could potentially be used to help tailor clinical treatment strategies for patients in coma. In this project, we will record EEG data from patients diagnosed with a range of coma etiologies. These data will be assimilated into a biological mathematical model for how the brain produces electrical activity, i.e., the neural dynamics. Enabled by these models, we will use a new type of analysis, called network reachability analysis, which characterizes the different types of electrical activity patterns that the models can produce. As an analogy, an airplane in flight might seem relatively stationary, but the plane's dynamics are actually complex since it could execute many different maneuvers at any time. Our analysis will describe how many `maneuvers' the brain is capable of making, thus providing a dynamical, quantitative characterization of the brain's lability. Our hypothesis is that different types of coma will exhibit different lability. To test this hypothesis, and to explore its clinical utility, we will apply network reachability analysis to the recordings we will obtain from patients with coma. Through this analysis, we will construct quantitative biomarkers that could be integrated into a new type of EEG monitor tailored for coma and other related disorders. Thus, the outcomes of this project will have significant and immediate impact on neurocritical care by facilitating more precise quantitative analysis of the neural dynamics of coma. More generally, the development of these techniques might shed new light on the mechanisms that underlie pathological states of unconsciousness, as well as normal sleep and wakefulness."

Given that NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States and that known outcomes include cirrhosis, liver transplant and liver cancer, it is imperative that we develop better noninvasive measures to diagnose with more severe or progressive forms of NAFLD and that we find improved therapies with unique and rational targets. The proposal in this limited competition renewal for our Clinical Center demonstrates the progress made in longitudinal database studies and significant findings in past and current/ongoing randomized clinical trials in adults and children (FLINT and CyNCh, respectively). Our Center and the Network describe plans for completion and continued development of clinical trials, for finding novel bio-imaging methods to assess response to therapy and to complete and develop ancillary studies for understanding the role of genetic and environmental factors in modulating the course of disease. In this regard, we lead studies in genome-wide association scans in Hispanic boys with NAFLD, in recognizing the role of sex steroids and nuclear hormone receptors in steatosis, inflammation and cell injury; and in elucidating the role of the gut microbiome in pediatric NAFLD. We intend to continue to play leading roles in the NASH CRN, as the PI is Co-Chair of the Steering Committee and Database Committee, a member of the Executive Committee, and Chair of the Pediatric Committee.

"9276476","CENTER FOR GENOME EDITING AND RECORDING: PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to understand normal and pathologic functions of the human genome and to translate that knowledge into effective therapies depends critically on determining how encoded genetic information confers phenotype. Recent advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics have provided vast quantities of genomic data that, in principle, hold the keys to advances in preventive medicine and therapeutic intervention. However, realizing the promise of personalized medicine will require accurate interrogation and manipulation of DNA sequences in situ at a scale and level of accuracy not currently available. The Center for Genome Editing and Recording (CGER) will address these challenges by creating technologies to detect, alter and record the sequence and output of the genome in individual cells and tissues. Building on the CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering technology harnessed from bacteria, CGER will couple the RNA-guided DNA cleavage activity of the Cas9 enzyme to strategies for enhancing DNA sequence replacement using homology-directed double- strand break repair. In parallel, CGER will conjugate Cas9 to DNA ?base editing? domains to enable accurate introduction or correction of point mutations without double-stranded DNA cleavage. Using cell-based assays, CGER researchers will interrogate specific disease-associated loci in human cells to provide new biological insights and uncover new therapeutic targets. Together, these approaches will enable the creation of any desired sequence alteration at any locus with high specificity and efficiency, with profound implications for both genome science and practical therapeutic intervention. To complement this suite of genome-manipulation technologies, CGER will also develop a high-throughput pipeline for testing the functional gene expression impacts of sequence variants responsible for human disease. This pipeline will identify and illuminate the relationships between human genome sequence variations, target gene expression and interactions with other genes. Finally, CGER will create new methods for permanently recording cell state changes in DNA so that they can be read out in a single-cell RNA-seq format. This development of molecular cell recorders will focus primarily on an evolving lineage tracer that, by enabling the generation of fate maps at unprecedented resolutions, holds the promise to revolutionize studies of normal development and disease progression. To achieve its goals, the Center brings together investigators with strengths in functional genomics, biochemistry, chemical biology and medicine, all of whom have been instrumental in developing genome engineering tools across multiple systems. The work proposed builds on capabilities at the University of California, the Innovative Genomics Initiative, Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital to create transformative capabilities and to access state-of-the-art research facilities and resources for training, education and community outreach. CGER's Education and Outreach plan emphasizes broadening the educational pipeline and attracting new investigators and those from adjacent fields to conduct genomics research."
"9532339","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA methylation is a key epigenetic signature playing mediating role in gene expression. Numerous studies have established a link between aberrant genomic methylation and cancers. In Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), a heterogeneous group of malignant hematopoietic disorders, DNA methylation abnormalities play a pivotal role during the progression to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) occurring in 30 percent of the cases. To date the cause of a deleterious genomic methylation remains elusive. Recently we identified a novel class of RNAs able to interact with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), DNMT1-interacting RNAs (DiRs) and inhibit DNMT1 enzymatic activity thus regulating genomic methylation patterns and expression of the corresponding genes. We have shown that DiR originating within the locus of the methylation sensitive gene CEBPA - the extra-coding CEBPA (ecCEBPA) - regulates CEBPA expression by preventing CEBPA gene locus methylation through its interaction with DNMT1. Furthermore, by deep sequencing of the transcripts associated with DNMT1, combined with genome-scale methylation and expression profiling we have extended the generality of this finding to numerous gene loci. Here, we hypothesize that dysregulation of transcriptional profile triggers DNA methylation changes promoting secondary leukemogenesis. The two aims of this project are: 1) to identify DiRs involved in the establishment of aberrant DNA methylation patterns in MDS evolution to AML: and 2) to validate their potential as a tool to reset aberrant genomic methylation. Aim 1 will be accomplished during the K99 mentored phase, under the guidance of Prof. Daniel G Tenen (Harvard Medical School) and Prof. John L. Rinn (Harvard University), world-leading experts in the field of leukemogenesis and RNA biology, respectively. By correlating DiRs and DiRs-regulated genes' transcription profiles of primary paired MDS (diagnosis)/AML (progression) bone marrow mononuclear cells with DNA methylation status of the correspondent genomic regions, DNA methylation and gene expression profiles will be linked to the presence or absence of RNA-DNMT association. This will lead to the identification of DiRs associated with aberrant DNA methylation patterns in MDS-AML transformation (Aim 1). Chosen candidates will be functionally validated during the R00 phase, in vitro and in vivo systems (Aim 2). This approach will allow correcting gene-specific aberrant DNA methylation using RNA molecules. Currently, the only demethylating agents approved for therapeutic applications are Azacitidine and Decitabine. However major downsides for using these drugs include cytotoxic effects and global non-specific demethylation. This study holds promise for a genuine, rather than nominal, targeted therapy. While in the short terms this research will lead to the identification of novel ky regulators contributing to leukemogenesis; in the long terms it will pave the way for the development of a long-awaited gene-specific demethylating tool for the treatment of cancer and other diseases triggered by DNA methylation abnormalities."
"9448028","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinically significant thrombotic events are common complications of many systemic diseases associated with chronic inflammation, including atherosclerosis and diabetes. Many of these life- threatening thrombi occur in the arterial circulation and relate to inappropriate platelet activation. This proposal will test the novel hypothesis that the type B scavenger receptor CD36 functionally links metabolic and oxidant stress to platelet hyper-reactivity and thus to the increased risk of thrombosis. Published and preliminary studies using mouse thrombosis models and primary human and mouse cells identified CD36 as a platelet signaling receptor that recognizes and responds to endogenous danger signals generated during inflammation, including oxidized LDL, advanced glycated proteins, and cell-derived microparticles. A specific CD36-triggered signaling pathway in platelets involving recruitment/assembly of an activated signaling complex made up of Src kinases, MAP kinases, and Vav family guanine nucleotide exchange factors was identified and shown to be unique from other platelet pathways. This proposal will test the hypothesis that signaling cascades triggered by CD36 engagement with danger signal ligands promote a unique hypersensitive platelet phenotype that contributes to a pro-thrombotic state in vivo. The mechanisms by which CD36 activates specific platelet signaling pathways to regulate cytoskeletal functions and oxidative stress will be defined. Sophisticated imaging systems using a microfluidic in vitro model of platelet function under shear and novel in vivo thrombosis models will be exploited to connect CD36-specific signaling pathways to the mechanisms of the related pro-thrombotic effect. Reciprocal influences of other platelet pro- and anti-activation pathways on the CD36 pathway will be defined to reveal novel synergies and interactions. In vivo models will be used to test the hypothesis that CD36-specific endogenous danger signal ligands promote thrombosis via functional interactions with toll like receptors and the cell-specific role f CD36 in promoting thrombosis in vivo in the setting of metabolic and oxidant stress will be determined using targeted genetic deletion and bone marrow transplantation strategies with in vivo models of inflammation and thrombosis."
"9306097","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to understand how cells cope with mutant Rhodopsin-1 (Rh-1) proteins that underlie age-related retinal degeneration in the Drosophila model for Autosomal Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa (ADRP). The Rh-1 alleles in this model impair the encoded protein's folding property and impose stress to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Healthy young cells exhibit robust ER stress-response mechanisms that allow the afflicted photoreceptors to survive until old age. On the other hand, old cells succumb to stress by activating cell death pathways, leading to age-related retinal degeneration. A better understanding of these pathways may allow the development of effective therapeutic strategies against this disease. Through our unique Drosophila-based approach, we identified a number of cellular response mechanisms to mutant Rh-1 that were unexpected, yet likely to play important roles in ADRP. Here, we propose three Specific Aims to investigate those mechanisms. In Aim 1, we plan to examine how cells degrade misfolded rhodopsins to reduce stress in the ER. We had previously established that a central ubiquitin ligase involved in this process, HRD1, can significantly delay the course of retinal degeneration in the Drosophila ADRP model. HRD1 requires the cooperation of other proteins that help recognize and degrade misfolded Rh-1. Through a genetic screen, we identified a poorly characterized carboxypeptidase as one of the most potent factors that help reduce misfolded Rh-1 levels. Here, we propose to validate the intriguing idea that HRD1-mediated degradation of misfolded rhodopsin requires this carboxypeptidase of unknown function. In Aim 2, we propose to determine the role of translational inhibitors in the ER stress response. Translational inhibition s a common outcome of cellular stress, and specifically in response to misfolded protein overload in the ER, cells activate the translational inhibitor PERK to reduce the burden on the ER protein folding system. Unexpectedly, we discovered that another translational inhibitor, 4E-BP, is induced downstream of PERK. As 4E-BP is known for its effects in enhancing stress resistance and prolonging lifespan, we plan to test the functional significance of 4E-BP induction in the ADRP model. Moreover, we propose to determine how 4E-BP protects cells against ER stress. In Aim 3, we propose to study how ER stress induces cell death. Many cell death regulators localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane for their function, and we hypothesize that a specific cell death pathway conveys stress signals from the ER to the mitochondria. Through a genetic screen, we identified two Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDKs) that are unexpectedly involved in this cell death signaling. Here, we propose to test the idea these CDKs form a linear pathway that promotes pro-apoptotic events at the mitochondrial outer membrane. The genes of interest here will be further examined for their roles in age-related retinal degeneration in a Drosophila model of ADRP. A successful outcome of this proposal is expected to bring conceptual advances to the three poorly understood areas of ER stress response that are directly related to the pathology of ADRP."

"9356546","Abstract Under the auspices of the Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium (PCBC), our hub at Boston Children's Hospital used unbiased chemical screens in zebrafish and human induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) Cells to identify two drugs that rescue the hematopoietic defects in Diamond Blackfan Anemia, a genetic bone marrow failure syndrome that lacks adequate pharmacologic or cell-based treatments. In the initial years of the next phase? the Progenitor Cell Translation Consortium?we propose to initiate clinical trials with these agents, and to establish a comprehensive center that during the subsequent years will develop new drugs, progenitor-based cell therapies, and gene therapies for additional genetic blood diseases, including Shwachman Diamond Syndrome, Fanconi Anemia, Dyskeratosis Congenita, primary immune deficiency, and hemoglobinopathy. We will build competency for both internal discovery and clinical translation, as well as Core facilities and generic platforms that will invite collaborations from external investigators, thereby serving the broader mission of the PCTC. Success in our aims will address considerable unmet needs for both the investigation of fundamental mechanisms of genetic blood disease and the development of novel therapeutics for conditions that while individually rare, are collectively a major challenge for hematology. The blood affords considerable advantages as a discovery system, given that analytic reagents and molecular catalogues of blood lineages abound; the high probability of success for blood diseases will establish a powerful proof-of-principle for leveraging human iPS cell models in clinical translation for other diseases."
"9308030","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One major challenge in biomedical research is to leverage advances in genome sequencing into lead therapeutic modalities to treat human disease. This precision medicine approach holds great promise to advance patient-specific therapeutics and to provide highly selective chemical probes of function to study disease biology. In this proposal, we describe an innovative precision therapeutic approach to custom synthesize highly selective and potent lead therapeutics in only disease-affected cells and tissues by using a disease-causing gene product as a catalyst. That is, the disease-affected cell serves as a reaction vessel and a disease-causing RNA as a catalyst to allow for the synthesis of its own treatment. This is in contrast to traditional precision medicine approaches in which both healthy and disease-affected cells are exposed to the therapeutic, potentially causing toxicity due to binding off-targets.  Our technology will be applied to develop compounds to treat and study microsatellite disorders that affect millions of people worldwide and have no known cure. Microsatellite disorders are caused by expanded repeating sequences located in both coding and non-coding regions, with the RNA being a key pathogenic agent. We have previously shown that repeating transcripts are most effectively targeted with multivalent compounds. However, as the compounds increase in valency, their molecular weights increase and their drug- likeness decreases. We therefore recently developed an innovative strategy to synthesize multivalent compounds, from their monovalent components, in cellulo using a disease-affected cell as a reaction vessel and a toxic, disease-causing RNA as a catalyst. We will take these exciting results in new directions and apply them to other debilitating microsatellite disorders including Huntington's disease, various forms of muscular dystrophy, the genetic defect that causes fragile X syndrome (the only known single gene cause of auti"

"9407824","Abstract Sepsis is a major public health concern and the primary cause of death in the intensive care unit, accounting for more than $20 billion (5.2%) of total US hospital costs in 2011. Sepsis can lead to a life-threatening drop in blood pressure termed septic shock, which can quickly lead to the failure of vital organs such as lungs, kidneys, and liver, and eventually to death. Nearly all sepsis cases are associated with bacterial or fungal blood stream infection (BSI). Due to the rapid progression of sepsis, the therapeutic window is very short. In order for hospitals to qualify for Medicare in the US, physicians are required to treat suspected BSI within 3 hours of an empirical BSI diagnosis. The current standard of care until definite diagnosis of pathogen is reached by immediate intervention with broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy and supportive treatment, have been shown to have the greatest impact on outcomes. However, the broad spectrum drugs are not always well tolerated, often do not target fungal infections and are expensive. Therefore a major hurdle of treating sepsis caused by BSI remains reaching a fast diagnosis of the causative pathogen. A variety of nucleic acid based molecular tests can be performed on positive cultures for identifying the pathogen(s) and characterizing their antibiotic susceptibility. However, the average time to receive a positive culture result is slow (2-6 days), and species identification and drug sensitivity profiling prolongs the process even further. We offer the use of the TangenDx Molecular Diagnostic Platform for BSI Detection. Tangen?s unique technological advantage is in capturing and concentrating the pathogens from a raw sample before they go into the instrument. Tangen is able to achieve high sensitivity of detection directly from whole blood because of development of unique laser-drilled kapton filters that enable large blood volumes, ranging from tens of milliliters to tens of microliters, to be concentrated by the LVCTM technology. For BSI, the TangenDx will provide a diagnostic sensitivity that is equal to or superior to blood culture methods and deliver a diagnosis and pathogen ID in less than 2 hours total. A major hurdle to using nucleic acid based molecular assays to directly detect blood stream pathogens is the fact that the concentration of cells per ml of blood is very low (1 CFU/ml of blood). Our approach to overcome this problem involves two strategies; first targeting multi-copy gene regions (e.g. Mitochondrial, transposons or rRNA genes), and second performing a global Whole Genome Amplification step in the central chamber of the Assay disk prior to distributing the amplified genomic material to the 33/35 Assay wells. We have demonstrated that it is feasible to detect as few as 10 genome copies with LAMP primers targeting rRNA multi-copy genes and that WGA can be successfully applied to the captured genomes prior to the LAMP reactions. We will also test the fully integrated system with spiked blood samples. Such a rapid diagnostics with faster turnaround time could enable rapid selection of appropriate treatment and reduce the 15% to 40% mortality sepsis rate."
"9324941","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a popular psychostimulant, methamphetamine (METH) use leads to long-lasting, strong euphoric effects. While METH abuse is common in the general population, approximately 10-15% of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) patients report METH abuse. METH exacerbates the severity and onset of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Both METH and HAND neuropathogenesis mechanistically concur with neuroinflammation, astrocyte activation, brain hyperthermia, oxidative stress and excitotoxicity. Thus, METH affects a multitude of astrocyte functions, yet the mechanism through which this is attained is unclear. Recently, we reported trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) as a novel astrocyte receptor for METH signaling. In this proposal, we will investigate METH-mediated regulation and activation of TAAR1 and the downstream effects that lead to exacerbation of HAND in the context of METH comorbidity. Our preliminary data in this proposal suggest a critical role of pCREB in astrocyte-METH signaling. Recently, TAAR1 has also emerged as a promising pharmacotherapeutic target.  We propose that METH-abuse in HAND modulates astrocyte-TAAR1 and downstream signaling via cAMP, [Ca2+]i, PKA/ERK, PKC and NF-kB regulating CREB. These pathways play critical mechanistic role(s) in astrocyte-mediated neurotoxic outcomes, including mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation. Further, we propose astrocyte-TAAR1 as a novel therapeutic target in HAND and METH comorbidity.  We will conduct investigations in the molecular regulation of TAAR1 in Aim 1, delineate the complex intracellular signaling pathways altering astrocyte function in Aim 2 and lastly extend the work to potential therapeutic avenues using a HAND relevant animal model in Aim 3. First, we will investigate the regulation of astrocyte-TAAR1 and following cAMP changes leading to gliosis and neuroinflammation (Aim 1: Molecular). Human astrocytes activated with virotoxins, or those expressing viral proteins, with/out METH will be used. TAAR1-GFP overexpression model will be used to identify TAAR1-specific responses. Next, we will delineate astrocyte-TAAR1 intracellular signaling leading to METH comorbidity in HAND (Aim 2: Signaling and function). Lastly, we will evaluate TAAR1 as a potential therapeutic target (Aim 3: Translational). Taken together, we employ a combined cellular and molecular approach with ex vivo, in vitro and in vivo studies that will have broader implication(s) for astrocyte-TAAR1 regulation, its role in substance abuse-based neurological deficits and as a novel therapeutic target for METH comorbidity in HAND."
"9319283","ABSTRACT Neonatal brachial plexus injury (NBPI) is a traumatic perinatal neuromuscular injury causing muscle paralysis and lifelong arm impairment. Muscle paralysis in these children also leads to bone and joint consequences, including deformed growth of the scapula and humerus. These musculoskeletal impairments, and their negative impact on function, persist even if the nerve recovers. Perinatal paralysis occurs during a critical period of rapid musculoskeletal development, but almost nothing is understood about the parallel postnatal development of muscle and bone that drives these persistent deformities and resultant impaired function. Our primary hypothesis is that nerve injury directly affects bone formation and metabolism, and that restricted muscle growth induces additional deformity through mechanical and cell-signaling pathways. We will apply our unique rodent model of NBPI in an innovative experimental design that isolates effects of neural, muscle loading, and disuse effects on bone development to 1) determine direct effects of nerve injury on humeral and scapular postnatal development by employing a previously validated rat model of brachial plexus injury to assess metabolic, vascular, and microstructural changes in bone; and 2) determine the influence of impaired muscle development following NBPI on the parallel development of bone with nerve injury by evaluating muscle fibrosis, structure, and expression of factors important for muscle-bone crosstalk. This exploratory R21 project, conducted by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in orthopedic surgery and biomechanical engineering, has high potential to elucidate the role of denervation in the parallel development of bone and muscle that occurs postnatally. Unlike previous studies, in this project, we will be able to measure both effects of mechanical and metabolic factors on deformity formation. Our innovative study design permits us to isolate both direct neural effects on bone and indirect effects from altered muscle on bone development in a way that has not previously been possible. Ultimately, this work challenges the paradigm of an isolated focus on muscle as a treatment target to reduce or eliminate deformity by distinguishing interactions between bone and muscle during development after a nerve injury that underlie deformity and loss of function. We anticipate our results will provide new candidates for effective treatment of NBPI and other neuromuscular injuries."

"9317027","Research Plan: Capacity Building Component Abstract The Capacity Building Core, as a key part of the Partnership in Implementation Science for Geriatric Mental Health (PRISM) project, seeks to achieve the larger and long-term goal of closing the mental health treatment gap first within the participating countries, Thailand and China, and also in other LMICs through other NIMH- funded scale-up hubs in the South-East Asia region. Through development of regional capacity both to conduct mental health implementation research and to use science-based procedures and information in developing mental health programs and policies, PRISM will prepare the regional health care system for transformative changes that will expedite the scale-up of evidence-based mental health services for older adults and other service-users. The specific capacity development aims of PRISM include: 1) Establishing networks and Communities of Learning for sharing and dissemination of learning products, first within Thailand and China, and second, within countries targeted by other NIMH-funded scale-up hubs; 2) Providing a comprehensive research training program to enhance the skills of health services researchers to conduct evidence-based mental health scale-up implementation research; 3) Conducting a series of workshops to enhance the skills of health care leaders and policy makers in using evidence informed decision making (EIDM) for policy development and program planning; and 4) Compiling training materials, tools, and other project resources for broader national and regional dissemination. Strategies will include a focus on improving capacities to generate, communicate, and utilize mental health implementation research; developing infrastructure to support a critical mass of trained researchers and policy makers and health care leaders, as well as a network of collaborating institutions; and providing resources in the form of structured curricula for organizing the learning experiences that are necessary for the improvement in skills to enable sustainable scale-up efforts. The PRISM project is built upon partnerships among investigators who have collaborated over the past two decades. Most relevant to the success of capacity building efforts are the partnerships that have been established between the project lead investigators and key stakeholders in each of the two participating countries. Long-term research collaborations among project investigators and committed partnerships with key stakeholders will greatly facilitate the successful accomplishment of PRISM capacity building core aims. 1"
"9328171","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  While C9ORF72 mutations were originally described in individuals with either amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTLD), the clinical spectrum is wider and includes patients clinically thought to have amnestic dementia compatible with Alzheimer's disease. Pathologically, while most c9FTD/ALS cases have Type B TDP-43 pathology, this is not universal and some cases also have Type A or even Type C TDP-43 pathology. The basis for this heterogeneity is unknown and will be explored in this project. Discovery of RAN translation and the generation of antibodies specific to predicted RAN translation products (C9RANT) from the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in C9ORF72 is a major development in identifying disease specific biomarkers. Thus, C9RANT immunohistochemistry might prove to be a valuable tool for screening for C9ORF72 expansion carriers. The nature of the pathology related to RAN translation remains to be defined. Pathologic inclusions in c9FTD/ALS are heterogeneous and include TDP-43-positive and TDP-43-negative neuronal and glial inclusions. TDP-43 negative inclusions are detected with immunohistochemistry for ubiquitin (Ubq) and Ubq-binding proteins such as p62/sequestosome and ubiquilin2 (Ubqln2). It is uncertain how inclusions detected by C9RANT immunohistochemistry relate to those detected by Ubq, Ubqln2 and p62. The relative contribution of these various pathologic processes to the clinical phenotype is an area that remains unexplored and will be addressed in this project using qualitative and quantitative methods, including advanced digital microscopy, as well as immunogold electron microscopy. It also remains to be determined if genetic risk factors, in particular the C9ORF72 GGGGCC repeat length, influence clinical and pathologic heterogeneity of c9FTD/ALS. The following Specific Aims are proposed to address gaps in knowledge about c9FTD/ALS. Aim 1. Characterize the multiproteinopathy of c9FTD/ALS using double labeling immunohistochemistry and immunogold electron microscopy with antibodies specific to c9RAN, Ubqln2, TDP-43, p62 and to markers of proteotoxic stress. Aim 2. Map distribution of neuronal inclusions immunoreactive with antibodies to c9RAN polypeptides in all reading frames in sense and antisense direction, as well as arginine methylation, with markers of neurodegeneration using digital microscopy. Aim 3. Create a database of quantitative and semiquantitative data from Aims 1 and 2 as well as biochemical data from Project 2 for exploratory associations with clinical features as well as C9ORF72 repeat length (from Project 1) and common genetic variants in GRN and TMEM106B (from Core B)."

"9323534","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Detection of and adaptation to stimulus-response conflict are critical and central aspects of human executive function. Yet, how such adaptation occurs is not well understood. Conflict occurs when multiple stimuli or multiple aspects of the same stimulus become associated with different behavioral responses. Behaviorally, conflict results in slower responses and increased errors. However, observers show moment-to-moment adaptation to conditions of conflict. An outcome of this adaptation is that subsequent conflicting stimuli have less of a negative impact on performance. It has been theorized that top-down control in response to conflict engages selective attention mechanisms to reduce additional conflict; this type of dynamic endogenous modulation has promise as a more ecologically valid model to study selective attention than classic experimental designs. However, the existing literature is inconsistent regarding the nature of these conflict driven attention effects. Some results point to multiple mechanisms of conflict driven attention operating at early stages of visual processing. Other results suggest that some attention mechanisms, such as distractor inhibition, for which there is substantial experimental evidence, may not play an important role in attention driven by contextual conflict. These same data do not support conflict related attention effects for early visual processing. This project proposes to use functional MRI and scalp electroencephalography to explore the brain mechanisms responsible for conflict adaptation, asking when, where and how these mechanisms affect visual processing. Specifically, we ask whether and how the brain uses selective visual attention to filter out unwanted information in response to conflict, whether conflict-driven perceptual modulation operates on feature and space based processing and whether such modulation is allocated in anticipation of impending stimulus events."

In this proposal, we seek to provide more precise information about the pathophysiological consequences of LRRK2 mutations in SPNs. In particular, it is our central hypothesis that LRRK2R1441C mutation leads to aberrant dopaminergic signaling in SPNs. The resultant striatal dysfunction, in turn, contributes to the symptomatology of PD. To pursue this, we will examine if LRRK2R1441C mutation alters dopamine signaling, corticostriatal transmission, corticostriatal plasticity, and excitability in SPNs through PKA signaling dysregulation. Moreover, assessment of striatal-dependent motor learning along with pharmacological manipulations will provide insight on the effects of LRRK2R1441C mutation in a whole-animal setting. In conjunction with standard cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological approaches, our investigations will capitalize on a combination of cutting-edge approaches that overcome obstacles that have impeded progress to date. These include, LRRK2 mutant mice, striatal pathway-specific (Cre and reporter) mice, viral gene delivery, and super-resolution imaging. The successful achievement of these aims will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying PD, and in doing so, will promote the development of new therapies for PD patients in the future."
"9386582","Project Summary/Abstract  Research has shown that immune function is associated with depression, although the reasons for this link are unclear. One important step is to investigate neural processes, given that there is research implicating abnormal neural function in depression, and associations between inflammation, brain activity, and depressed mood. However, this has not yet been explored in adolescents, even though early adolescence is a sensitive developmental period of brain growth and organization. Immune dysfunction may have a strong effect on brain function during this time, which in turn, may increase risk for elevated depressed mood; however, the temporal direction of these associations remains unclear. In addition, pubertal development has also shown to be associated with both brain development and the onset of mental health symptoms, and to moderate the association between immune function and depressive symptoms. Puberty may be especially salient for girls, as rates of depression increase to twice that of boys starting at puberty, and female sex hormones are associated with a stronger immune response. My pilot data shows that earlier developing girls have a negative correlation between inflammation and brain activity in the insula, striatum and anterior cingulate cortex during emotional face processing, which in turn is negatively associated with depressive symptoms. However, longitudinal research in this area is lacking, making it difficult to determine if immune function and changes in brain function precede changes in mood and the emergence of clinical depression during adolescence, and how pubertal timing and tempo may affect these associations. Development of brain connectivity has also not been explored. My training goals for the proposed K01 are to train in fMRI and resting-state connectivity analysis, and to understand longitudinal developmental neuroscience models relevant to psychoneuroimmunology, which will establish me as an independent investigator. These goals will be met by having support from an established and experienced mentoring and advisor team, and through the research aims of this study, which are to prospectively examine immunology, brain function and connectivity, and depression in girls in early adolescence, and to determine the effect that puberty has on these associations. Specifically, the study will collect data from an established longitudinal cohort of N=170 adolescent girls, at 11, 12.5, and 14 years old, which does not yet have any specific research questions regarding immune functioning. First, at each time point, I will assess cross-sectional associations between inflammation, brain activity and connectivity, and depressive symptoms, and the moderating effect of pubertal timing. Second, I will investigate longitudinal developmental patterns, such as changes in brain activity and connectivity as a mediator of the association between immune function and depression, or prediction of trajectories of these variables. Third, I will conduct a sub-study of 64 girls to examine inflammatory responses to and brain activity during an fMRI social-evaluative stressor. Overall, this study will identify mental health outcomes of inflammation from a developmental and neurobiological perspective, and will establish me as an independent research scientist in this area."
"9320871","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the DTSGC is to use genomic and proteomic high-throughput measurements coupled with mid-throughput experimental measurement of protein states as the basis for computational analysis that integrates network analyses with structural constraints and dynamical models in multiple cell types to identify signatures that predict toxicity induced by individual drugs and mitigation of this toxicity by dru combinations. To anchor the signatures in observable human disease and therapeutics, we will leverage the strategy employed in our recent study, in which we searched the FDA-Adverse Event Reporting System Database (FAERS) and found nearly thousands of drug combinations used in humans where a second drug mitigates serious toxicity associated with first drug. We hypothesize that we can use these observations to improve our capability to predict toxicity of drugs and mitigation by drug pairs. The Center has three major goals: 1) experimentally obtain expression patterns of mRNA, proteins and protein states (e.g.  phosphorylation) for around 250 perturbagens: 120 two-drug combinations identified in the FAERS whereby  the second drug mitigates serious toxicities induced by the first drug and 130 individual drugs that have been  shown in FAERS to cause one of three serious toxicities-cardiotoxicity; hepatic toxicity or peripheral  neuropathy. We will use primary or established human cell lines and cell types directly differentiated from human induced pluripotent cells (hIPSC). For each drug combination and the two constituent drugs we will obtain mRNA, proteomic data, and dynamic protein state from least 18 cell lines. 2) We will utilize the experimental data for multi-tier analyses that combines statistical and network models using the human interactome and Gene Ontology with structural model based filtering and dynamical multi-compartment ODE models to obtain sets of relational signatures for each drug combination. For this we will combine the perturbagen induced changes in mRNA levels and protein levels to develop networks that will be constrained by structural modeling to identify new off-targets and dynamical models using the protein state data. The network models provide toxicity mitigation mechanism hypotheses in the form of a directed sign-specified graph which will be quantitatively weighted by global sensitivity analysis of the dynamical models. We propose to obtain non-weighted and weighted signatures for both drug combinations and individual drugs at the rate of around 4000 signatures per year. 3) We will develop computational and visualization tools for sharing the raw and processed data with the LINCS Data Coordinating Center and the larger community. We  will i) develop web-based tools for data visualization and de novo analysis for all types of researchers ii) run  web-based courses using Coursera for data utilization and development of signature-based research  projects iii) conduct 4-6 personalized workshops to enable academic researchers to utilize our signatures to  develop research projects that can compete for individual research grant funding."
"9303347","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pollen is a ubiquitous allergen that affects a large population with allergic diseases. However, the mechanisms leading to resolution of pollen allergen-induced inflammation remain poorly understood, a knowledge gap preventing us from developing new targeted therapies to cure allergic diseases. We have recently uncovered a novel pollen/TLR4 innate immunity pathway where short ragweed (SRW) pollen triggers allergic inflammation via TLR4-dependent innate signaling by mucosal epithelium that produces proallergic cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). We thus extended our investigation to another epithelial proallergic cytokine interleukine (IL) 33 and other major innate immune cells that may respond to pollen allergen. We hypothesize that TLR4-dependent innate immunity by ocular mucosal epithelia, dendritic cells and macrophages in response to pollen allergen, initiates Th2-dominant allergic inflammation via two stimulated allergic pathways, TSLP/OX40L/OX40 and IL-33/ST2, with an inhibited protective signaling IL-27/IL-10. The long-term goal of this project is to discover new molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets for treating allergic diseases. Four Specific Aims are proposed to fulfill this novel project for public health. Aim 1 is to confirm the hypothesis that SRW pollen stimulates production of two pro-allergic cytokines TSLP and IL-33 by ocular epithelium via activating TLR4/MyD88/NF-?B innate immunity pathway; Aim 2 is to investigate the hypothesis that TLR4-dependent innate immune responses by dendritic cells amplify Th2-dominant inflammation via autocrine activation of TSLP/OX40L and IL-33/ST2 signaling with inhibitory regulation of IL-27 in response to SRW pollen allergen; Aim 3 is to explore the hypothesis that SRW pollen allergen primes macrophage polarization toward an alternatively activated (M2) phenotype to promote Th2- inducing cytokines (TSLP, IL-33 and OX40L) and Th2-attracting chemokines (CCL17 and CCL22) via TLR4-dependent innate immunity; and Aim 4 is to test the hypothesis that pollen/TLR4 concept may create a novel TLR4-targeted therapy for pollen-triggered allergic diseases using TLR4 antagonists and/or agonists. At the conclusion of this project, we will uncover a novel phenomenon and molecular mechanism by which pollen allergen triggers Th2-dominant allergic inflammation via TLR4-dependent innate immune response that activates TSLP/OX40L/OX40 and IL-33/ST2 allergic pathways but suppresses IL-27/IL-10 protective signaling in mucosal innate immunity system. The end product of this project will be a fundamental new understanding and potential TLR4-targeted therapeutic strategies, a new hope to prevent and cure allergic disease."
"9217556","The Medicinal Chemistry and Lead Development Core (MCLDC) is a key component of the Antiviral Drug Discovery and Development Center, contributing to the goals of each of the individual projects. The MCLDC will provide hit-to-lead analysis, synthetic chemistry, structure-activity relationship (SAR) data and analysis, computational support, and lead optimization chemistry to further the CETR's goal of developing new replication inhibitors and other broad-based therapeutics for the treatment of emerging pathogens. In this role, the MCLDC, in conjunction with the Screening Core (SC), will be the central focus of the translational research component of the program. As the SC optimizes the novel assays developed by various Research Projects, and subsequently prosecutes the screening campaign, it will be the function of the MCLDC to assess the quality ofthe hit compounds that emerge, and ultimately to convert novel, tractable hits into potential clinically useful drugs with optimized biological and biophysical properties. As such, the MCLDC will work closely with both the SC and each of the Research Project teams. As new chemical entities are prepared during the lead optimization process, because of the anticipated synthetic throughput the SC will generally test these analogs in a primary assay in order to drive the SAR investigation. As described in detail below, appropriate compounds will also be provided to the various Research Project teams for advanced studies including efficacy, mechanism of action, and other experiments. The resulting data about these compounds, generated by the SC and Research Projects, will then be analyzed by the MCLDC in order to drive the iterative drug discovery program to completion. The MCLDC will incorporate key members of the SC and Research Project teams into the prioritization and decision making procedures. The end result of this process will be the identification of novel drugs appropriate for IND applications."
"9280227","Project Summary This proposal is for a new R21, and we are responding to the NIAID's Interest to Highlight High-Priority Zika virus (ZIKV) Research Areas (NOT-AI-16-026). ZIKV is a rapidly emerging flavivirus that is spread primarily by the mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. The current ZIKV outbreak in South America has been associated with a 20-fold increase in the rate of babies born with microcephaly and has also been linked with the development of Guillain-Barre syndrome. The regions involved in the current outbreak are known to be endemic for another flavivirus, dengue virus (DENV). This indicates that a large percentage of the population may have preexisting DENV immunity. It has been shown that preexisting immunity to DENV can enhance infection with other closely related flaviviruses. ZIKV is genetically very close to DENV. The purpose of this study is to identify potential enhancement of ZIKV infection by antibodies recognizing DENV. As the World Health Organization considers the current ZIKV epidemic and related microcephaly association an international public health emergency, investigations into ZIKV infection and behavior in human immune cells, with and without preexisting flaviviral immunity, are a priority area of research. Our central hypothesis is that antibodies recognizing DENV can complex with ZIKV and that this immune complex is able to infect monocytes and other Fc receptor-bearing cells, which would result in higher viremia.  Specifically, Aim 1 will establish a model of antibody-dependent enhancement using ZIKV infection and sera from South American DENV patients, collected prior to the current ZIKV outbreak. Aim 2 will characterize the role preexisting DENV immunity may play in ZIKV infection of neural cells. We will examine avidity and affinity between ZIKV and DENV antibodies; evaluate ZIKV infection in primary human immune cells and neural cells in the presence of antibodies recognizing DENV 1-4; and examine cytokine and chemokine production by ZIKV infected cells with and without anti-DENV immune sera. Together, these aims will provide a more comprehensive picture of ZIKV infection in the presence of preexisting DENV immunity."
"9338820","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major psychoses (SZ, SAD, BDP), when defined by clinical phenomenology alone, overlap extensively on neurobiological, biomarker, co-morbid, symptomatic, and genetic characteristics. Our field may benefit from transformational re-conceptualizations of disease seen in other areas of medicine when biological variables are considered in disease definitions and identification. This approach in psychiatry will depend on: (i) use of well- defined disease domains, (ii) large samples that capture clinical heterogeneity and support statistical approaches, and (iii) ability to acquire quantifiable laboratory measures t inform re-conceptualization of disease characteristics. The 5-site B-SNIP focus is psychosis, an ideal clinical phenotype for this purpose. B- SNIP1 recruited over 2500 volunteers and performed dense phenotyping across multiple levels of analysis (cognitive, psychophysiological, brain imaging, social and clinical). The overall data described a continuum of phenotypic alterations across the DSM psychosis diagnoses (BDP, SAD, SZ) with little evidence of diagnostic specificity. In an attempt to use these dense phenotypic characteristics to define biologically based subgroups, we re-grouped probands using biomarkers and a multistage multivariate analysis procedure. We identified 3 psychosis Biotypes based on core phenotypic features. Biotypes showed unique differences across external validators that were not used in the initial construction of the categories. B-SNIP2 will replicate and extend B- SNIP1 using enhanced proband number, biomarker panel, and sophistication of multivariate statistical approaches. We will accomplish our goals within the context of two specific aims. SA(1) Construct a 'Psychosis Biomarker Database' (PBD): Recruit 3000 new psychosis probands and 600 healthy volunteers and collect data including clinical, psychosocial, electrophysiological, ocular motor, imaging and blood biomarkers. Core biomarkers (used for Biotype definition) and external validators (used for verifying neurobiological distinctiveness of Biotypes) will be collected as specified. Genetic characteristics of the participants will be obtained in collaboratin with the Broad Institute. SA(2) Contrast and test taxometric approaches to categorizing psychosis: Evaluate the ability of different taxonomic structures to define psychosis subgroups, based on data in the PBD: (i) DSM, (ii) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on clinical variables, (iii) B-SNIP1 Biotypes, (iv) B-SNIP2-generated biotypes based on biomarkers, and (v) B-SNIP2 biotypes based on both clinical variables and biomarkers. Beginning with traditional DSM diagnostic criteria as the taxonomy and testing (i)-(v) we will use linear, quadratic and nonparametric discriminant function analysis applied to external biomarker validators to examine the association between the traditional diagnostic system and the biologically- derived classification (imaging, psychosocial and genetic external validators). We will be able to determine the strongest taxonomic approach based on biological characteristics. We seek a rational classification of psychotic disorders that will be successful in identifying novel disease targets and treatments approaches."

"9225350","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adding or modifying tobacco licensing laws is becoming an increasingly popular tobacco control approach, but the implications for health disparities is unknown. Currently, it is well-documented that the density of tobacco retailers is greater in low-income, African American, and Hispanic neighborhoods. Marketing at these retailers' points of sale impacts the social environment and can have powerful effects on promoting initiation and inhibiting cessation. With licensing-law strategies, communities can not only require stores to obtain a license to sell tobacco, but can set stipulations to granting these licenses (e.g., capping the number of retailers in an area, or banning retailers from within 1000 feet of a school). Research suggests this public policy approach is an effective means for reducing the number of tobacco retailers and their corresponding point-of-sale marketing. However, some of these strategies could be more beneficial for affluent, low-minority areas than for low-income, high-racial/ethnic minority areas?what the proposal is referring to as ?high risk? areas. This potential outcome is particularly troubling given that low-income, African American, and Hispanic populations also exhibit some of the highest rates of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the purpose of this R21 proposal is to evaluate in Ohio the equality-impact of the four major licensing-law strategies that have been proposed to restrict tobacco retailers. Aim 1 will test whether reducing the number and/or density of tobacco retailers will reduce inequalities in the distribution of tobacco retailers. Aim 2 will test whether restricting tobacco retailers from being close to schools will reduce current inequalities in the distribution of tobacco retailers. Aim 3 will test whether banning tobacco sales in pharmacies will exacerbate inequalities in the distribution of tobacco retailers. Analyses will be conducted using spatial modeling techniques, which have rarely been used in tobacco control research. With a list that has already been acquired of all 10,722 tobacco retailers in Ohio, analyses will begin by establishing the current, pre-policy state of tobacco retailer density, at the census-tract level. Each aim will then model the effects of a licensing-law restriction and estimate the post- policy retailer density. Finally, each policy will be evaluated in terms of its equality-impact (whether it will provide less, equal, or greater benefit to vulnerable groups). Three benchmarks will be used: the % reduction in retailer density is not greater for low-risk census tracts; the strength of the relation between tobacco retailer density and sociodemographics has diminished; and the post-policy density of tobacco retailers is not greater in low-risk census tracts. This novel project will provide much-need information on the relative equality-impact of the major licensing-law strategies. Findings will guide state and community efforts away from licensing-law strategies that will inadvertently widen the nation's cancer disparities and toward licensing-law strategies that will have a positive equality-impact. As the first project to integrate licensing-law research with disparities research, this project could significantly change the direction of tobacco control research and policy."
"9353324","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common type of ovarian cancer and has very poor survival, as the tumors quickly become resistant to the current drug treatments. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project has performed tumor profiling of ~500 HGSOC cases. From the expression analysis TCGA has recently identified a panel of genes that can be used to predict survival. Although the panel of genes validate in other studies many of the individual genes do not show consistent results across studies. To identify validated prognostic markers suitable to use as drug targets will require discovery in a larger set of tumors followed by validation in a very large series of samples. We have established the Ovarian Tumor Tissue Analysis (OTTA) consortium, an international collaboration of 30 studies with approximately 8,000 ovarian tumors and extensive clinical data. The majority of these tumors is from cases participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC) and therefore have genotyping data on 200,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epidemiological data. We have identified SNPs that are associated with survival from our genome wide association study (GWAS) and preliminary data suggests that these germline changes may help to identify novel genes that may also be important somatic prognostic factors. We will utilize these existing datasets from TCGA, OTTA and OCAC to identify candidate prognostic genes and validate these genes in samples from OTTA. These biomarkers could be useful in the clinical setting for type of treatment and decision-making in recurrence and they will also provide a much-needed understanding of the biology of the disease. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1: To identify candidate prognostic genes from a meta-analysis of expression data including subgroups of HGSOC and from an analysis of our survival GWAS. Aim 2: To perform expression analysis of 400 genes using the Nanostring platform on thousands of primary tumors to identify prognostic markers and to subtype the tumors. Aim 3: To reanalyze the survival GWAS data using the subgroups of the tumors and identify novel changes associated with survival. Aim 4: To test the identified genes and pathways in novel ovarian cancer models to determine if they could be used as targets for new drug treatments."

"9391272","ABSTRACT The carbohydrate synthesis is lagging far behind the current status of peptide and nucleotide synthesis. This is not due to the lack of importance. In fact, carbohydrates are ubiquitous and play a vital role in many important biological events. The development of efficient and selective chemical methods for the synthesis of carbohydrates and their analogues is necessary for the understanding of the specific roles of carbohydrates and for therapeutic development. Current carbohydrate synthesis requires extensive training and knowledge. One has to think outside the box for transformative solutions that can enable non-experts in the biomedical community to study carbohydrate structure and function. The two most essential issues in carbohydrate synthesis are stereoselective glycosidic bond formation and differentiation of hydroxyl groups. In this proposal, we will develop catalytic methods to address both issues and streamline the assembly of oligosaccharides. In Aim 1, we propose to site-selectively functionalize hydroxyl groups in various monosaccharides in a predictable, general, and systematic manner. These transformations will be used for streamlining the synthesis of carbohydrate building blocks. Working models that can predict the site-selectivity in diverse carbohydrates will be established with the help from computational chemists. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling glycosylation (CCG) to construct the glycosyl carbon-oxygen bond guided by density functional theory calculations and published literature on cross-coupling reactions. The CCG will allow us to assemble the stereochemically defined benchtop stable glycosyl donors and novel glycosyl acceptors stereospecifically without any manipulation after glycosylation. Our proposed glycosylation methods are innovative because they don?t involve the formation of the oxocarbenium ion, which often makes the current glycosylation methods not completely stereoselective. The glycosyl donors and acceptors for CCG will be derived from naturally occurring monosaccharides. Similar to all chemical methods, the CCG can also be used for the synthesis of carbohydrate analogues. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods in several iterative syntheses of bioactive bacterial and human glycans. The iterative synthesis only involves one step of activation of glycosyl donors or acceptors and one step of CCG for the addition of any monosaccharide unit. Glycosyl donors and acceptors without protecting the nonparticipating hydroxyl groups can also be employed because of the unique feature of the CCG. The above proposed aims are significant because they will yield readily available tools for anyone in the biomedical community including non-experts to study carbohydrate structures and functions. The successful development of the proposed methods will place the oligosaccharide synthesis close to the modern status of oligopeptide and oligonucleotide synthesis."

"9266413","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of eye disease is critical for preventing vision loss that affects more than 38 million Americans. Current diagnostic tools often reveal retinal changes only after vision loss has already occurred. Tests of visual function are limited by their subjectivity, and by the pooling of signals from tens to thousands of retinal cells. Tests of retinal structure are limited by the substantial anatomical variation among individuals, which makes early disease detection impossible without baseline measurements. In most cases structural tests can therefore detect only macroscopic changes that follow major cell death. These limitations could be overcome by a non-invasive method to detect chemical changes that precede cell death. For this purpose, we will develop two novel technologies, adaptive longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) correction and axially- resolved hyperspectral retinal imaging. These will be demonstrated in combination with ophthalmic adaptive optics, to characterize the spectra of idiopathic epiretinal membranes, with or without associated retinal traction or macular hole, as well as age-related macular degeneration and central serous retinopathy."
"9328173","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   The discovery of mutations in C9ORF72 as a cause of both FTLD and ALS provides a clear link  between these two degenerative diseases and suggests that they form a clinicopathologic disease spectrum.  Research on C9ORF72 related neurodegenerative disorders, thus, holds promise to unlock secrets related to  this disease spectrum. Postmortem neuropathology plays an important role in establishing the range of  pathology in both ALS and FTLD, as well as documenting other disease processes that may have contributed  to the clinical syndrome. As animal models are developed to study disease pathogenesis of ALS and FTLD,  neuropathologic studies are increasingly important to monitor outcomes of experimental manipulations and for  comparison to human disorders. Core C participates in these activities as well as providing tissue samples to  investigators obtain from postmortem studies. Core C will work closely with clinical coordinators to obtain rapid  autopsies of patients enrolled in clinical studies in Core B.

For enrolled subjects in  the deeded autopsy program who die during the course of the project, conduct autopsies to harvest brain, spinal  cord, skeletal muscle and peripheral nerve, as well as samples from internal organs, with a portion of each  sample frozen for subsequent research and another portion preserved in fixative for diagnostic evaluation and for  future research studies. A neuropathologic diagnostic evaluation will be performed on each case using a  standardized protocol. Upon completion of the diagnostic evaluation, reports will be entered into the electronic  medical record and copies will be sent to the next-of-kin along with an explanatory letter in lay person terms.  Specific Aim 2. Process and assist in the neuropathologic characterization of mouse brains from Project 2, and  assist with characterizing antibodies generated in Project 2. Specific Aim 3. Provide tissue samples to Projects  1, 2 and 3 as well as to qualified investigators at other institutions. Core C will facilitate research in the program  project, but also contribute to medical education, physician quality control, and feedback to families whose  relatives were engaged in research on ALS and FTLD."
"9355461","PROJECT SUMMARY Humoral immunity is marked by long-lived responses against antigens. The duration of this response is dependent on long-lived plasma cells that are primarily located in the bone marrow and are of switched isotype. However, we have recently identified a population of long-lived IgM plasma cells that reside in the red pulp of the spleen that display an atypical mutation profile. We find that mutations primarily occur in the framework regions of the VH gene unlike IgG plasma cells, where mutations are predominantly located within the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). Upon further analysis of these mutations, we find strong evidence that these mutations occur in tracts and appear to be shared between multiple IgM plasma cell clones from individual animals. Further, these tracts completely match in position and identity with other highly homologous VH genes and therefore we posit that these mutations are not random but are templated from other VH genes and occur through the process of gene conversion. We hypothesize that (1) VH genes on the opposite allele serve as donor sequences for gene conversion, introducing mutations in expressed VH genes and (2) that these mutations occur in the framework region such that they preserve CDR specificity but alter CDR conformation allowing CDRs to reach targets on drifted and heterosubtypic influenza strains following immunization. To date, we have analyzed the µ heavy chain and have yet to sequence paired heavy and light chains. In this project, our goals are to (1) use a high throughput paired IgH:IgL analysis to characterize the heavy and light chain usage and mutation profile on a per cell basis from thousands of IgM plasma cells, (2) analyze the contribution of framework mutations to antibody binding and cross protection in an influenza model, and (3) identify if gene conversion utilizes the other allele for gene conversion in Balb/c x C57BL/6 F1 mice. Taken together, knowledge gained from these studies will identify the role of framework mutations in IgM plasma cells and could potentially identify gene conversion as a mechanism of diversification of the rearranged IgV loci."
"9234483","Summary ? Core C  Lack of animal models that accurately mimic human enteric disease limits studies of  pathogenesis in the GI tract. Furthermore, elucidating the role of the microbiome in  protecting against or exacerbating an infection is complicated by the fact that the  commensal microbiota in model animals such as mice, rats, and hamsters are very  different from those found in humans. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop and  validate novel pre-clinical models of human enteric disease that more accurately model  natural host-pathogen interactions, particularly those in which the impact of the  commensal microbes can be evaluated.  One strategic mission the Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research at  Baylor College of Medicine is adopting and developing idealized model systems to study  host-microbe interactions. The enteroid model is provocative in terms of providing the  ability to study host-microbe interactions at a systematic level and incorporating a variety  of host and/or commensal perturbations. Development of the enteroids provides an  exciting opportunity to advance our understanding of how pathogenic as well as  beneficial microorganisms interact with and induce responses from the intestinal  epithelium. The goal of the Genomics and Microbiome Core is to provide a centralized  facility to meet the comprehensive microbiome needs of all of the investigators involved  in this NAMSED proposal and to enable NAMSED investigators to test the hypothesis  that commensal microbiota are involved in enteric disease susceptibility and/or  protection. Therefore, the long-range objectives of the Microbiome Core are to: (1)  characterize how pathogen infection of enteroids impact host and (2) microbe  transcription; 3) determine whether enteroids can maintain colonization with individual  and communities of commensal microbiota; and 4) characterize how enteroid-  association impacts commensal microbiota gene expression. This integrated facility will  be cost effective and will ensure reproducibility of genomic, metagenomic, and  metatranscriptomic data generated in each of the proposed projects."
"9374376","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Congenital anomalies of the lymphatic vasculature arise due to defects in lymphatic development and are increasingly detected in utero. The lymphatic vasculature is responsible for maintaining tissue fluid homeostasis, interstitial hormone levels, immune surveillance, and intestinal lipid absorption. Disruption of these functions by anomalous lymphatics can impose significant morbidities on affected individuals, including hemorrhage, bony deformities, respiratory compromise, intestinal dysfunction, and sepsis. Lymphatic anomalies are relatively common among congenital conditions (individual occurrence from 1:3500 to 1:10,000 births) and contribute significantly to the population requiring intensive care, beginning in the prenatal period. These patients go on to accumulate severe lifelong consequences of these conditions. Despite this, the genetics of lymphatic anomalies are poorly understood and there is a paucity of relevant mouse models, limiting prenatal diagnosis and the development of effective treatments.  Different subtypes of lymphatic anomalies have been shown to arise from germline and somatic mutations. However, the genetic causes of the vast majority of lymphatic anomalies remain unknown. To further understand lymphatic anomaly genetics and pathobiology, we propose to develop a bedside-to-bench approach to identify and characterize genetic mutations. We hypothesize that affected-lymphatic endothelial cells isolated from fetal anomaly specimens, as well as parental-fetal germline specimens, can be used to comprehensively screen for novel lymphatic anomaly mutations. We propose to bring together and establish a multidisciplinary clinical and basic research team with expertise in prenatal and pediatric lymphatic anomalies, and human genetics. In Aim 1, we propose to develop a fetal lymphatic anomalies program to isolate affected lymphatic endothelial cells from fetal lymphatic anomalies and subject them and fetal-maternal-paternal trios to WES and cohort analysis. Our initial analysis of a small set of lymphatic anomalies fetal-maternal-paternal trio data identified a loss-of-function mutation in Rere as a likely pathological mutation in a fetal cystic hygroma. Rere is a positive regulator of retinoic acid signaling, a pathway known to function in lymphatic development. In Aim 2, we propose to develop a novel mouse model in which we delete lymphatic endothelial Rere and determine its role in lymphatic development.  The goal of this pilot grant is to develop a precision medicine program at Columbia University that is effective at identifying and characterizing the genetic causes of lymphatic anomalies. Findings will be used to generate preliminary data for mutli-PI R01s and Program Project Grants to be submitted by the multidisciplinary team. These studies also aim to identify and understand how novel genes and pathways function in lymphatic development and homeostasis."
"9379600","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The ability to characterize individual cells in a heterogeneous population is becoming increasingly important in biological research and clinical diagnostics. Traditionally, most classification methods have relied on optical detection of cell-surface proteins. Downstream analysis of the sorted cells provides an additional layer of information for cellular phenotyping and characterization. With the decreasing costs of high-throughput sequencing over the past few years, many researchers have started to perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on their FACS-sorted cells to correlate the content of their transcriptomes to the expression of specific cell-surface markers. While effective, FACS/scRNA-Seq approaches suffer from relatively low throughput and from an experimental bias in that only cell types chosen a priori are sorted and sequenced. Clearly these methods are not well suited for discovery of novel cell populations or for characterizing complex tissues that require the analysis of tens of thousands of cells. The recent explosion of droplet-based microfluidic techniques for single-cell sequencing has allowed scRNA- Seq experiments to scale to enormous numbers of cells, alleviating the throughput bottleneck and bypassing the experimental bias encountered by FACS. However, droplet-based scRNA-Seq approaches have yet to become mainstream and ubiquitous owing to two key disadvantages. First, the equipment to perform microfluidic droplet-based single-cell sequencing is expensive and requires specifically trained personnel for assembly and operation, which hinders accessibility of these systems to the average research or clinical laboratory. Second, none of the currently available droplet-based single-cell-sequencing methods are able to capture the cell-surface expression data that is attainable by FACS analysis. To overcome the limitations with current droplet technologies, we plan to accomplish the following two aims. First, we will create an affordable, open-source, and compact/portable microfluidic platform to broadly enable droplet-based single-cell sequencing methods. This device, named ?mini-Drops?, will empower any lab to perform microfluidic single-cell experiments, either at the bench, in the clinic, or in the field. Second, we will develop a technique, termed ?cellular indexing of transcriptome and epitopes by sequencing? or CITE-seq, to simultaneously characterize the transcriptome and a potentially unlimited number of cell-surface markers from the same cell in a high-throughput manner. We aim to transform the understanding of cellular processes and disease states with high information content single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic profiling by performing CITE-seq on mini-Drops in diverse laboratory settings."
"9321161","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes affect most Americans: 70% of US adults are overweight or obese, 26 million have diabetes, and 79 million people have pre-diabetes. While diet and exercise improve outcomes in diabetes, most people with type 2 diabetes eat an unhealthy diet, do little physical activity, and have trouble making and sustaining changes in health behavior. The Look AHEAD trial demonstrated that an intensive lifestyle intervention that teaches skills necessary to make changes in diet and activity led to sustained weight loss, diabetes remission, lower rates of complications, medication reduction, and improved physical fitness and quality of life compared to diabetes support and education. This project will adapt the highly effective but resource-intensive Look AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention so that it may be delivered with fewer resources in community health center settings, potentially via telephone, greatly expanding its potential reach and impact. Pilot data show feasibility and effectiveness comparable to the Look AHEAD lifestyle intervention: lifestyle group participants lost 6.7% of body weight compared to 2.6% in the individual medical nutrition therapy (MNT) arm (P=0.003) and had twice as much reduction in medications. In this project, we will compare two different implementation strategies for delivery of this group adaptation of the Look AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention, one using an in-person approach and one using a telephone approach, to dietitian referral for individual medical nutrition therapy in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. The interventions will take place at three community health centers. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Aim 1: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the adapted Look AHEAD lifestyle change interventions in a three-arm trial comparing random assignment to in-person (IP) group (n=70) and telephone conference call (TCC) group (n=70) implementation strategies to standard of care defined as individual MNT (control; n=70). Medical outcomes will include weight loss (primary), glycemic control, cardiac risk factors, medication dose, and cost. Behavioral outcomes include self-efficacy and health-related quality of life. Aim 2: To evaluate the reach, adoption, implementation fidelity, and maintenance of the adapted Look AHEAD lifestyle change program in in-person and telephone call implementation strategies at the three community health center settings, comparing factors across centers using the RE-AIM Model Dimension items checklist and employing a mixed methods approach including focus groups and structured interviews. Aim 3: To estimate the incremental cost per percentage point decrease in body weight of the implementation strategies assessed in this study compared to usual care. If effective, materials with estimates of approximate implementation costs from this project can be readily disseminated for use in usual care settings throughout the United States."
"9324691","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a clinician who is dually trained as a rheumatologist and a neurologist, as well as having a Masters in Clinical Investigation, my long-term career goal is to improve the diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain in rheumatic diseases. When I started my faculty career at Johns Hopkins, there was no pre-existing infrastructure which would allow me access to the spectrum of patients I desired to study. Therefore, I started a novel Neuro-Rheumatology Clinic, which rapidly recruited a large cohort of Sj?gren's syndrome (SS) patients with neuropathic pain, allowed me to establish an expansive serum and skin biopsy biospecimen repository, and enabled me to forge multi-disciplinary collaborations. This thriving infrastructure will enable me to accomplish the Aims of this proposal, which are to identify biomarkers to improve diagnosis and treatment of Sj?gren's patients with neuropathic pain. I will play an intimate and direct participatory role in all phasesof this project, including the ongoing recruitment and phenotyping of patients, sustaining the growth of a tissue repository, learning how to perform ELISAs and interpreting skin biopsies, and performing all biostatistical studies. The specific Aims will be to define whether novel anti-dorsal root ganglia antibodies, skin biopsy assays, serum measurements of pro-nociceptive neurotrophins and cytokines, and novel neuroimaging studies are potential biomarkers of SS neuropathic pain. My recent publications have identified how lupus and rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with Tumor Necrosis Factor-inhibitors can develop similar phenotypes and mechanisms of neuropathic pain as described in SS patients. Therefore, biomarkers of SS neuropathic pain which we may identify in this proposal are likely to be relevant across many different rheumatic diseases. The versatility of these biomarkers would provide a natural and logical direction for future studies, and would form the basis of a competitive R01 research proposal. To prepare for a career as an independent clinician- investigator, the career development plan includes rigorous mentorship, advanced coursework in epidemiology and biostatistics, and career growth opportunities offered by a Rheumatology Division committed to my career success. Altogether, this K23 award would therefore enable me to mature into an independent clinician- investigator, such that I could devote an entire career towards improving care and treatment of neuropathic pain in rheumatic diseases."
"9334269","Burden and Risk of Neurological and Cognitive Impairment in Pediatric Sickle Cell Anemia in Uganda Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is the most common inherited disorder in sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda, an estimated 20,000 children are born with SCA annually. Vasculopathy in SCA is associated with brain injury and affect neurologic and cognitive function. Brain injury in pediatric SCA may follow acute inflammatory events, including infections. Acute bacterial, malarial and other infections and malnutrition are highly prevalent in SSA, and may contribute to or precipitate SCA vascular brain injury. Our goal is to establish the burden and clinical spectrum of pediatric brain injury from SCA, identify risk factors, and build research capacity to support interventions for brain injury reduction. Our hypothesis is that risk factors (sickle vasculopathy, malnutrition, other) independently or with triggers (inflammation or infections) predispose children with SCA in SSA to a high burden of neurological and cognitive impairments. The objectives of this application are to determine the age-related spectrum and burden of brain injury associated with SCA in Ugandan children, and determine the predisposing risk factors. Knowledge of the magnitude of brain injury from SCA and the underlying risk factors will drive the design of future studies on pathogenesis and preventive measures to improve outcome. In response to PAR-14-331, we propose to: Aim 1. Determine the burden and spectrum of neurological and cognitive impairment in children with SCA aged 0-12 years in Uganda; Aim 2. Examine risk factors or triggers for neurological and cognitive impairment in children with SCA in the same sample; and Aims 3. Enhance existing brain research capacity in Uganda through the study of pediatric neurologic and cognitive impairment in SCA. Through this work, we will have established an estimate of the burden, spectrum and associated risk factors and triggers for brain injury in children with SCA in Uganda, a SCA repository; developed a cohort to follow prospectively; inform the design of prospective studies to understand the pathogenesis and test interventions to reduce the burden of brain injury in SCA in Uganda; and increased capacity for carrying out north-south and south-south research collaborations in SCA and will fill a substantial gap in our institutional, national and regional capacity in brain research and training across the lifespan."
"9389242","Project summary Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder that affects an estimated 1 in 100 persons. Though its key symptoms generally appear late in adolescence, schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental condition with a strong genetic component and heritability estimated to be as high as 80%. Although therapeutic treatments do exist, they target few putative mechanisms and are not effective in all the patients and/or do not address all the symptoms of the disease. While there have been improvements in the understanding of the biological systems implicated in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of schizophrenia, progress has been slow and limited both by the difficulty in obtaining relevant tissues from patients and the inadequacy of animal models to deal with the level of genetic complexity involved in this disease. To date, most of the molecular and cellular studies of schizophrenia have been performed on postmortem tissues or on genetically defined mouse models that do not fully recapitulate the human genetic risk or neural phenotype. The rapid advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) methodology provide new opportunities to overcome some of the obstacles inherent to the modeling of neurodevelopmental diseases. As a consequence of the groundbreaking work of the Yamanaka laboratory, somatic cells from a simple patient biopsy can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells that can be differentiated into other cell types, including neural cells. Because the resulting neural cells retain that individual's genetic information, this approach has tremendous potential as a tool for understanding genes and pathways that are dysregulated in schizophrenia and can provide a platform for in vitro screening assay for novel therapeutics. The first aim of the project is to apply revolutionary robotic methods to generate pluripotent stem cells from a large cohort of patients and carefully matched controls. We will then use this sample, as well as two existing samples of iPSCs with child onset schizophrenia and/ or known, rare, highly penetrant genetic lesions, to generate excitatory neurons. This will create the first large scale, highly standardized library of iPSC and neurons derived from patients with schizophrenia. The second aim of the project is to perform gene expression profiling on the schizophrenia and control neurons and use innovative systems biological analyses to identify dysregulated pathways in schizophrenia and key molecular drivers that underlie these pathway changes. These key molecular drivers represent potentially high-impact targets for drug development. Altogether, the completion of the aims will provide new insight into the neuronal pathways disrupted in schizophrenia, and identify potential drug targets. The study will also provide the community with a large schizophrenia iPSC cohort and a neuronal RNA sequencing dataset, and will lay the foundation towards establishing a high-throughput platform useful for drug screening and accelerating drug development processes."

We envision the GRC on Alcohol and the Nervous System will significantly advance our current understanding of the neurobiology of alcohol addiction and stimulate the development of effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of alcohol use disorders."
"9351123","Gulf War Illness (GWI) continues to be a lingering condition for some Operation Desert Shield/Storm (ODS) veterans deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1990-1991. Recent reports suggest permanent changes in the brains of those still experiencing symptoms. Sarin exposure from the Khamisiyah ?nerve-gas cloud? has been implicated as the cause, but GWI symptoms have been experienced by personnel deployed to areas, not believed to be under that cloud. Neuroinflammation could have caused acute GWI symptoms, and, eventually, long-term cognitive problems because of structural changes to the white matter tracks. Yet, sarin exposure may not have been the only cause of such neuroinflammation. We hypothesize that repeated exposure to a combination of personnel-issued chemical supplies along with bacterial infection is sufficient to cause persistent neuroinflammation, eventually leading to structural changes in neuroanatomy, in the form of reduced white matter tracks. The type I pyrethroid permethrin (PERM) was an active ingredient in the issued sprays, creams, and human flea collars; repeated exposure to PERM causes neuroinflammation in rodents. Repeated exposure to the nerve-gas prophylactic pyridostigmine bromide (PB) induces acute signs of neuroinflammation in rodents. Bacterial infection was a significant problem for troops both on the ground, as well as on the high seas; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is part of the cell membrane of gram negative bacteria that causes acute peripheral inflammation, but it can also cause neuroinflammation. Thus, the goal of this pilot project is to establish a model of combined PERM/PB/LPS exposure, demonstrating functional (behavioral) and structural (histological) alterations in the rodent brain. Our working hypothesis is that a temporal confluence of PERM, PB, and LPS within a relatively short period of time (one month) will cause persistent neuroinflammation beyond the exposure period in mice. This will lead to behavioral deficits in tasks associated with cognitive functioning (a chief symptom of lingering GWI). A battery of rodent cognitive tests is designed to discern different aspects of brain functioning post-exposure: spatial and non-spatial memory, rule learning and flexibility, fatigability/motivation and gait/balance. In parallel to these experiments, brains of exposed mice will be analyzed for cellular signs of neuroinflammation and white matter track integrity. These analyses will primarily be focused in hippocampus, hypothalamus and the internal capsule white matter tracks. These are regions demonstrated to be involved in these cognitive and behavioral processes; implicated as abnormal from the human GWI brain scan studies; or previously demonstrated to be affected by PERM, PB, or LPS alone in the rodent toxicology studies. This 2-year pilot program will provide a foundation of knowledge needed to explore the possibility that non-sarin sources can induce neuroinflammation and symptoms of GWI. This will assist in achieving the long-term goals of understanding how those exposures affect the brain over long periods of time (aging), identifying individual vulnerabilities that increase or decrease susceptibility to these exposures (using genetically manipulated mice), and, most importantly, developing strategies for treating any identified neurodegeneration stemming from these multiple chemical/biological exposures."
"9326284","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Four independent hematopoietic precursor cell types are specified during development, culminating in specification of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which self-renew and provide all of the major blood lineages over the lifetime of an adult organism. The first three precursor cell types are transient progenitors believed to temporarily provide blood and immune cells to the embryo until HSCs finally emerge. Precisely where and when HSCs are specified has until recently been highly controversial, but recent studies have conclusively demonstrated that they arise from hemogenic endothelium, a special population of endothelial cells within the ventral wall of the primitive dorsal aorta that transdifferentiate into HSCs. In our previous studies, we imaged directly the birth of HSCs from ventral aortic endothelium for the first time. Complementary lineage tracing of these HSC founders indicated that they provide all adult hematopoietic cells, and are thus the unique source of all HSCs. The signaling events underlying the developmental specification of hemogenic endothelium remain poorly understood. In our recent studies, we utilized the unique experimental advantages afforded by the zebrafish embryo to uncover a novel model of HSC induction, where Wnt16 function in the ventral somite is required for HSC specification. The HSC defect in Wnt16 morphants could be rescued by enforced Notch signaling, but only within an early window of development, well before HSC precursors experience Notch signaling. This environmental Notch requirement is mediated by the Notch ligands DeltaC and DeltaD, but how these connect to Notch signaling within the precursors of HSCs is unknown. Our current studies demonstrate that three of the four Notch receptors are required to establish HSC fate. The focus of our continuing efforts is to determine where and when each of these requirements are needed, to determine whether or not each is required in a cell-autonomous manner, to determine which Notch ligands are utilized to regulate each signaling event, and to determine functionally when HSC fate is established through lineage tracing and cell transplantation assays. With the elucidation of this signaling axis, and the cellular behaviors it controls, our wok will ultimately enable ex vivo approaches to direct patient-specific iPS cells towards the HSC fate for cellular replacement therapies."
"9358346","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Megalencephaly (MEG) or large brain is a developmental disorder associated with brain overgrowth, frequent cortical malformations, and variable intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation, and a host of other developmental and health problems. MEG has historically been considered as distinct from hemimegalencephaly and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). However, recent genetic studies have identified mutations of the same genes that all function in the PI3K-AKT intracellular signaling pathway, especially PIK3CA, PIK3R2, PTEN, AKT3 and CCND2.  We have enrolled a cohort of more than 400 children with MEG-HEG-FCD syndromes, with mutations of these 5 genes found in 10% to 75% depending on the specific syndrome. In this project, we propose to better define the phenotype, perform detailed genotype-phenotype analysis, examine the PI3K-AKT and other signaling pathways by immunohistochemistry and reverse phase protein arrays, perform deep targeted sequencing for both known and strong candidate genes, study the effects of mosaicism, and search for additional causative genes using whole exome and whole genome sequencing."
"9323758","Project Summary The overarching goal of this proposal is to better understand the dynamics of HIV-1 persistence in perinatal infection with very early treatment (VET) within 48 hours of life, early treatment by 2-3 months of age combined with long-term suppression, and when initial ART is combined with broadly neutralizing antibodies, to facilitate viral remission. Eliminating the resting memory CD4+ T cell latent HIV-1 reservoir is the major challenge for eradicating HIV-1 from treated individuals. VET and early treatment of perinatal infection leads to a dramatic reduction in HIV-1 reservoir size that may enable sustained HIV-1 remission, but requires additional studies including mathematical modelling of reservoir dynamics. The proposed project will address a critical barrier to assessing HIV remission and cure studies in perinatally infected children and adolescents, with direct application to the rapidly evolving and exciting field of HIV cure. The studies have direct relevance to the research mission of the National Institutes of Health where finding ways to achieve HIV-1 viral remission or cure is a top research priority."
"9467019","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): New experiences are initially encoded as labile short-term memories, which are converted into stable long-term memory by gene transcription-dependent processes. In the hours after learning, the induction of gene expression follows a specific pattern that involves transient waves of transcriptional activity, which are needed for memory consolidation. Recent work has also identified persistent, long-lasting transcriptional changes that are induced by learning, which appear to contribute to storage of long-term memory. It is emerging that this transcription is regulated by epigenomic mechanisms such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation. These epigenetic modifications are critical for the long-lasting regulation of gene expression during development and may be a major mechanism of information storage in the brain. Changes in epigenetic modifications occur in animal models of depression and anxiety disorders, and alterations in DNA methylation have been found in post-mortem brains from patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, autism and bipolar disorder. Defects in epigenetic modifications may contribute to impairments in synaptic plasticity and cognitive function associated with many psychiatric disorders. Our work suggests that epigenetic modifications are a critical component of both synaptic plasticity and memory formation and storage, but the genes targeted by these epigenetic regulatory processes remain unknown. In this application, we propose three Specific Aims to address these issues. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the role of the NR4A orphan nuclear receptors, which are critical for long-term memory and long-term potentiation, as well as for the enhancement of memory and plasticity by HDAC inhibition. We will define the key NR4A target genes required for hippocampus-dependent memory and test if the NR4A transcription factors are novel targets for cognitive enhancement. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the molecular mechanisms through which the co-repressor SIN3A, which coordinates a transcriptional regulatory complex that includes histone-modifying enzymes HDAC1 and HDAC2, negatively regulates long-term memory and synaptic plasticity. Specific Aim 3 will build on evidence that a persistent long-lasting increase in the expression of transcription factor NFIL3 contributes to long-term memory storage in the hippocampus, thus defining the persistent transcription that mediates long-term memory storage in the hippocampus. Our understanding of the master transcriptional regulatory proteins involved in consolidation and storage of long- term memory may ultimately lead to the development of new treatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression."
"9505435","Research conducted within the Duke University?s Superfund Research Center (DUSRC) focuses on a central research question: How does early life exposure to hazardous substances elicit developmental toxicity, and what are the later-life consequences? As such the theme of our center is ?Developmental Exposures: Mechanisms, Consequences and Remediation?, and we remain committed to investigating the vulnerability of the developing organism to hazardous chemical exposures. Within the DUSRC we emphasize research on both ATSDR priority chemicals (e.g. PAHs, metals, organophosphate chemicals) and emerging chemicals of concern (e.g. halogenated flame retardants) that are known to, or have potential to, adversely effect development. Mechanisms of action that are central to the mission and research conducted within the DUSRC include mechanisms underlying molecular and physiological effects from developmental exposures, mechanisms underlying ameliorations of and adaptations to these effects, and mechanisms and approaches to engineering solutions for the ultimate removal of these chemicals from the environment. A unifying theme across the DUSRC projects is effects on neurobehavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes from these exposures. DUSRC researchers are conducting research using in vitro (e.g. cell culture) and in vivo (e.g. zebrafish, rats) models to determine effects of these hazardous chemicals on neurodevelopmental across projects, but several individual projects are also exploring effects on skeletal and fat development, cardiovascular development and bioenergetics. Of key interest is the ability of some contaminants to converge on similar phenotypes through multiple mechanisms of action. With the heightened interest in developing Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) within regulatory agencies, the DUSRC is well poised to support these endeavors. Our interdisciplinary team of biomedical/environmental scientists and engineers provide the DUSRC with a unique opportunity to address and examine ?holistic? consequences of developmental exposures. This integration is central to evaluating the true risk from exposure to hazardous substances. The DUSRC directly addresses the program mandates by investigating health effects and risks and remediation of hazardous substances in an interdisciplinary fashion. In addition to responding to SRP mandates, the DUSRC?s research, research translation, and community engagement activities are also highly relevant to numerous stakeholders, including the Environmental Protection Agency."
"9381946","Project Summary This project will explore the mechanochemistry of myosin II filaments moving on actin filaments using in vitro methods. We will use our recently-developed inverted motility assay to measure myosin filament velocities moving on actin filaments. By varying the number of myosin heads in the filaments and the ATP concentration, we have developed a deterministic model describing the parameters that define and limit the rate of filament- filament sliding that inform mechanisms of muscle contraction. Our prior work revealed how assembling myosin into filaments allows for attachment-limited kinetics at physiological numbers of myosins in the filaments, in contrast to the current paradigm in the field of detachment-limited kinetics. We use this assay as the basis for addressing further specific structural and kinetic hypotheses about how force and motion are generated when myosin is incorporated into a filament. Myosin filaments, both reconstituted and native, from smooth, skeletal, insect flight, and cardiac muscle will be compared. Genetically engineered fruit flies will be generated to express insect flight muscle myosin with either shortened or lengthened S2 domains, which is the myosin heavy chain domain that we hypothesize to underlie the attachment-limited kinetics mentioned above. The effects of phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chains will be examined, with the goal of testing a novel hypothesis about the activity of myosin with only one of its heads phosphorylated. The assay will be modified in two ways to extend its utility. First, single myosin heads will be labeled with quantum dots an incorporated into co-filaments. The global motion of the moving filament and the quantum dot within the moving filament will simultaneously visualized, and by analysis of the motion by tracking software, the presence or absence of predicted mechanical signatures will be assessed. The identity of those signatures will be assessed by correlation to changing experimental conditions that we predict will change the signature. Also, the inverted in vitro motility assay will be modified to allow measurement of myosin filament moving under load, allowing underlying effects of load on kinetics to be examined and allow comparisons of the relative ability of different myosins to generate power. Final, we will build on these approaches by using the inverted motility assay to probe mechanisms underlying the regulation of thin filament ?thick filament sliding by calcium and myosin head binding."
"9336927","Project summary  Visual information is processed through specialized channels: In each ommatidium of the Drosophila retina, motion is processed by the six ?outer photoreceptors? that project to the lamina. Color is detected by photoreceptors R7 and R8 that belong to two subtypes: In the p subtype, pR7 expresses UV-sensitive Rh3 and pR8 contains Blue-Rh5. In the y subtype, UV-Rh4 in yR7 is coupled to Green-Rh6 in yR8. We offer to study the signal that relays this information from R7 to R8 to coordinate the expression of Rhodopsins (Aim 1).  We will extend this work to the signals originating from outer photoreceptors, which control the division of lamina precursor cells (LPCs) by releasing Hedgehog, and which induce the differentiation of the lamina neurons L1-L5 by releasing EGF/Spitz from their termini. In Aim 2, we will determine how the development of photoreceptors and of their lamina targets is coordinated.  We also discovered that distinct glial cell types play specific roles in patterning each of the five lamina cell types. This has prompted us to study how glia originate in different regions of the optic lobes, how they migrate to take on their final positions, and how they mediate differentiation signals to L1-L5 (Aim 3). Aim 1. Specification of the R8 subtype fate by signaling from R7 photoreceptors. We will analyze the significance of multiple BMP/Activin ligands that participate in R7-R8 communication, and test whether they signal through their canonical receptors. The signal is reinforced in R8 by a bistable loop involving the Warts tumor suppressor and a growth regulator, Melted. We will determine whether Mad/Smad2 activate melted or repress warts, to generate and maintain the correct ommatidial R7 and R8 subtypes. The BMP/Activin signals are restricted to a single ommatidium, and do not diffuse to neighboring ommatidia. We have shown that the Hibris cell adhesion molecule limits this diffusion and will study how it affects R7-R8 pairing. Expanded signal diffusion leads to clusters of Rh5 R8s that are reminiscent of clusters of pigmentation in the eye of Eristalinus flies. We will use our evo-devo expertise to study how the signal may be propagated in specific species. Aim 2: How do signals from photoreceptors specify the five cell types of the lamina? We will explore how signals from the outer photoreceptors regulate proliferation and cell cycle exit to generate lamina precursors. We will then manipulate EGFR to ask how Spitz levels from photoreceptors affect lamina differentiation. We will also test how EGFR/Notch antagonism among lamina precursors contributes to L1-L5 diversification. Aim 3. The role of different glial populations for the specification of lamina neurons. We have evidence that the order and kinetics of lamina cell determination is coupled with glial development. We will manipulate glial cells to determine how they are involved in mediating the EGF signal from photoreceptors. Using genomics and live imaging, we will characterize the different populations of glia and determine their origin. We will then develop a quantitative and predictive model of the interactions that contribute to specifying lamina neuronal diversity."
"9407946","Abstract for Technology Development Program 1 - MicroED X-ray crystallography over the last 50 years has been the most successful method to obtain atomic structures of biological molecules. Crystallization of large multi-protein complexes is challenging, and even if successful, the resulting crystals are usually small, delicate and present multiple challenges. New developments such as serial femtosecond crystallography using a free electron laser (FEL) and electron crystallography or micro-electron diffraction (microED) are alternative approaches to obtain structures, using nano-meter or low micro-meter sized crystals (nanocrystals). Solving structures of bio-macromolecules using FELs requires billions of nanocrystals, amounts of material that frequently is not available. Solving structures with microED, on the other hand, may, in principle, be possible with only a few nanocrystals, thus overcoming problems related to sample quantity. The Calero laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh has pioneered nanocrystal discovery and optimization using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This has permitted to significantly increase the number of potential crystallization conditions through direct observation of crystal lattices. In this technology development proposal, we intend to develop new methodologies to determine structures of protein complexes of HIV-1 proteins and their human binding partners by exploring nano crystallization space and optimizing stabilizing conditions for the application of microED approaches for structure determination."
"9402506","Lysosomal function is crucial for cell homeostasis, autophagy, nutrient sensing, apoptosis and tissue remodeling. In lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), characterized by genetic defects leading to anomalous accumulation of metabolites in lysosomes, cells are affected by lysosomal malfunction frequently leading to cell death. Cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from defects in the cystine transporter cystinosin (CTNS). Increased levels of intra-lysosomal cystine lead to cell malfunction and progressive tissue deterioration, which is especially manifested in kidneys. As with most LSDs, this leads to a slow but irreversible deterioration, organ dysfunction and early death. Patients with nephropathic cystinosis develop proximal tubule cell dedifferentiation, Fanconi syndrome and progressive renal injury, which are not corrected by the current therapy, cysteamine. Thus, cell malfunction and tissue failure occur despite cystine depletion, suggesting that cystine accumulation is not the only cause of all the defects observed in cystinosis. We recently revealed a defective mechanism of chaperone- mediated autophagy (CMA) in cystinosis. Defective CMA is directly linked to human disease, including kidney pathologies and neurological disorders. CMA defects in cystinosis are caused by mislocalization and downregulation of the only lysosomal CMA receptor, LAMP2A. Defective CMA activity correlates with high susceptibility to cell death in cystinosis. Importantly, the defect was not rescued by cystine depleting therapies supporting that it is independent of lysosomal overload. Our data highlight that CMA impairment is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of cystinosis and underline the need for new treatments to complement cystine- depletion therapies. Our research plan aims to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to abnormal CMA activity in cystinosis. We also propose translational approaches that utilize small-molecule activators of CMA to improve cellular function in cystinosis. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To understand the molecular basis of the regulation of LAMP2A function in cystinosis. To this end, we will study the interplay between the CTNS protein and the CMA receptor LAMP2A and elucidate the mechanisms that mediate LAMP2A trafficking and destabilization at the lysosomal membrane in cystinosis. Aim 2: To determine the molecular basis of the regulation of CMA activity and proximal tubule cell function in cystinosis. We will study the mechanisms mediated by CTNS to regulate CMA function and will test the hypothesis that the rescue of LAMP2A expression and CMA activity improves the function of proximal tubule cells from cystinotic patients. Aim 3: To utilize small- molecule CMA activators in vivo to improve renal function in cystinotic mice. We will correct cellular and renal function in cystinotic mice using CMA activators, alone, or in combination with cysteamine. Our research is highly significant because it aims to elucidate molecular mechanisms associated with a devastating human pathology and will help develop new therapies for the treatment of cystinosis and other human diseases."
"9535567","Loss-of-function mutations in interleukin-10 (IL10) or the IL10 receptor (IL10R) lead to a life-threatening immune deficiency presenting as severe very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD). IL10 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that is secreted by a variety of hematopoietic cells, primarily myeloid, B and T cells, which reduces inflammation, at least in part by limiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The receptor for IL10 is composed of two IL10R1 and two IL10R2 chains and is expressed predominantly on hematopoietic cells. Mice deficient for either IL10R or IL10 develop spontaneous colitis and similarly, patients with loss-of-function mutations of either the IL10RA or IL10RB develop severe VEO-IBD. Recent studies have shown that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) may lead to a sustained remission of the disease, but allogeneic HSCT carries significant risks of acute toxicities and graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and requires a suitable HLA-matched donor. Preliminary data from our group has indicated that Il10rb gene transfer into IL10R?-deficient bone marrow precursors followed by HSCT into IL10R? knockout models can prevent the development of IBD. We propose to use gene transfer into autologous HSCs via lentivirus vectors (permitting either ubiquitous or lineage-specific Il10rb expression) to restore IL10R signaling and provide an alternative treatment option. In this proposal, we will develop and optimize lentivirus vectors to express Il10rb, determine the in vitro and in vivo efficacy and safety of these vectors in established murine knockout models. In addition, we will utilize novel humanized mouse models recently developed that permits the use of patient derived CD34+ HSCs to assess both the functional consequence of IL10R2 deficiency in human cells in vivo as well as the effectiveness of gene transfer in patient-derived HSCs. Moreover, we plan to generate CRISPR- Cas9 gene-edited HSCs derived from IL10R1- and IL10R2-deficient human patients and assess the frequency and precision of editing events and functional consequences. These investigations will provide the preclinical data clarifying the transgenic expression levels needed for correcting the immune dysregulation and the safety of expressing a signaling molecule in hematopoietic cells. Finally, we will determine in both standard IL10R?- deficient murine as well as humanized mouse models, transplanted with murine- and patient-derived IL10R?/IL10R2-deficient HSCs with lineage-specific Il10rb/IL10RB-expressing lentivirus vectors, the precise cell populations that require IL10R? expression to correct immune dysfunction. These studies will enhance our understanding of the basic cellular pathobiology of this rare disease and also address the complexities associated with heterologous expression of transgene in specific components of the hematopoietic compartment. Deep expertise in gene therapy (Williams) and immunology/IBD (Snapper) will form an excellent basis to develop a gene therapy approach for this indication.  "
"9391149","Project Summary In this NIH SBIR Phase II project, Arborsense will continue to develop a discreet standalone graphene nanoelectronic transdermal alcohol sensor with integrated electronics to collect sweat alcohol readings continuously and in real-time and transmit it to a mobile app. Excessive alcohol consumption is the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the US. It led to around 88,000 deaths per year in the US from 2006-2010 and in 2006 alone cost the economy around $224 billion. Arborsense?s wearable alcohol monitoring device will lead to a better awareness about alcohol consumption amongst general population and will enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. Arborsense received an NSF Phase I SBIR grant (NSF: IIP-1548317) in January 2016 with which we achieved the stated Phase I goals and milestones of: (1) fabrication and assembly of graphene alcohol sensors on a flexible polymer backing; (2) the graphene sensor capability in detecting alcohol in sweat and calibration of sensors? alcohol detection responsivity; and (3) test sensors? feasibility and reliability on human volunteers, benchmarking against breathalyzer readings. Based on these results, in this NIH Phase II project Arborsense aims to achieve standalone sensor modules which are accurate (range?0.02% BAC), discreet (watch/wrist-band), light (~100g), cost-effective (~$100), and hands-free (Bluetooth connectivity). The modules will have integrated self-calibration electronics and Bluetooth transceiver to transmit data wirelessly to a mobile or tablet. In Phase II, Arborsense will collaborate with the University of Michigan to develop, test, calibrate, and benchmark sensor modules with the stated performance metrics. The graphene sensors will be fabricated on flexible polymer substrate, encapsulated with protective membranes, stacked with electronic circuity and a rechargeable battery, and enclosed in a discreet housing. The modules will first be calibrated in extensive performance tests in lab, and then tested on human volunteers while being benchmarked with a police grade breathalyzer. Good correlation between our sensor and breathalyzer will confirm the technical and commercial feasibility of our sensors, which can then be shipped to early-adopters, pitched to investors, and ultimately introduced for sales. We will also develop an interactive phone app and study ways of providing information to users about intoxication to maximize the benefits of self-monitoring."
"9319288","Diabetic retinopathy has been associated with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic activation of inflammatory and degenerative pathways. Substantial evidence implicates the retinal mitochondrial ? oxidative stress axis as a major unifying pathogenic factor for virtually all diabetes-induced cellular changes implicated in the development of retinal complications. Therapies directed against these individual pathways have provided disappointing results in human clinical trials. Likewise, clinical trials utilizing antioxidants have produced equally ambiguous results. Taken together, these trials suggest a significant knowledge gap regarding underlying mechanism(s) linking oxidative stress to activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-degenerative pathways in diabetic retinas. Based on our previous work in Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 patients, together with new data provided in this revised application using relevant retinal cells, we propose the novel hypothesis that ROS-mediated DNA damage in diabetes chronically activates the DNA damage response (DDR) ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) pathway. There is a strong link between increased DNA damage accumulation and development of diabetic complications including retinopathy. Also, there is a growing consensus that ATM not only acts as a DNA damage sensor to coordinate repair of damaged sites to maintain genome integrity but also plays a critical role in modulating the activities of cellular metabolic sensors to interfere with mitochondrial function, cellular energy homeostasis, inflammation, and apoptosis. How the DDR-ATM pathway interconnects various signaling components to disrupt cellular energy metabolism and enhance pro-degenerative signaling is the subject of intense investigation but remains unexplored in the retina. Our recent studies have shown that chronic activation of the DDR pathway interferes with mitochondrial function by suppressing PGC-1? activity, a key transcription co-activator that regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and cellular energy homeostasis. Our new preliminary data demonstrating increased DNA damage and ATM activation in diabetic retina supports our hypothesis. The experiments proposed in this application will test the central hypothesis that diabetes-induced oxidative stress causes double stranded DNA damage resulting in ATM activation, leading to downregulation of PGC1? that impacts multiple pathogenic pathways observed in diabetic retinas. We hypothesize that ATM activation induces a significant amplification of diabetes-induced oxidative stress via mitochondrial disruption by multiple mechanisms (aim 1), vascular and neuronal degeneration (aim 2), and chronic inflammation (aim 3). These aims have the potential to establish a unifying molecular mechanism that links enhanced DNA damage to chronic oxidative, degenerative, and inflammatory abnormalities observed in diabetes. The greatest impact of our work is to provide a regulatory mechanism offering a novel explanation for how hyperglycemia impacts mitochondrial dysfunction to amplify oxidative, inflammatory and degenerative changes in the retina.

"9300953","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are interested in understanding transcriptional regulation of follicle activation and oocyte survival. Early stages of ovarian follicle formation, beginning with the breakdown of germ cell cysts, formation of primordial follicles and transition to primary and secondary follicles, are critical in determining the reproductive life span and fertility. Transcription of numerous germ cell specific genes, necessary and essential for follicular development, is initiated during these early stages of follicle formation. We discovered novel germ cell specific transcriptional regulators Sohlh1, Sohlh2, Lhx8, and Nobox. We also discovered that mutations in oocyte- specific transcriptional regulators such as Nobox and Figla associate with premature ovarian failure, emphasizing the importance of these pathways to women's health. Sohlh1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator that suppresses primordial follicle activation (PFA), and Sohlh1 depletion causes rapid PFA and oocyte loss. LHX8, a highly conserved LIM homeodomain protein, is located downstream of SOHLH1, and also represses primordial follicle activation. SOHLH1 and LHX8 are uniquely expressed in the germline, and their deficiency affects gonadal development. We developed a conditional knockout of Lhx8 and other tools to study how this pathway regulates postnatal folliculogenesis. We will use Lhx8 as a model system to understand oocyte-specific repression of follicle activation. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine mechanisms whereby LHX8 suppresses primordial follicle activation. Conditional deficiency of Lhx8 in oocytes of primordial follicles, leads to massive primordial follicle activation and premature oocyte depletion. We hypothesize that Lhx8 controls PFA via cross talk with the PI3K-AKT/mTORC1 dependent pathways, and by regulating novel secreted factors. In Specific Aim 2, we hypothesize that oocyte-specific pathways are important not only in the developing ovary but also adult ovary and at different stages of folliculogenesis. In Specific Aim 3, we hypothesize that LHX8 directly binds promoters of oocyte-specific regulators essential for follicle activation. Our previous and current studies focus on oocyte specific mechanisms that suppress follicular activation and oocyte loss. We identified unique regulators of follicle activation and oocyte survival, yet mechanisms of their action remain unknown. We will utilize our unique animal models to elucidate these mechanisms. Our studies are likely to identify novel biomarkers of primordial follicle reserves as well as tissue-specific targets to control reproductive life span."
"9313720","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early life stress (ELS), including abuse, neglect, and loss, is associated with dramatic increases in lifelong risk for the development of mental and physical health difficulties. The mechanisms through which ELS confers risk for these negative outcomes, however, are not well understood. Stressful life experiences activate the stress response systems, and high levels of stress have been linked to telomere shortening, an epigenetic marker of aging. Thus, shorter telomere length may be one mechanism through which ELS leads to negative health outcomes later in life. In the proposed study we will examine the association of ELS with a measure of cellular aging, as well as with measures of mental and physical health during childhood. More specifically, we will examine in a large sample of pre-pubertal boys and girls the association between ELS and telomere length, as well as rate of telomere attrition across the pubertal period as a function of early experiences of stress. We will  also examine the link between ELS and irritability, a common characteristic of several psychiatric disorders, that has been associated with more severe and chronic forms of mental health difficulties. In addition, we also will examine the association between ELS and physical health, given that global measures of health in childhood are likely to precede the onset of specific diseases of aging in adulthood. Finally, we will examine the degree to which variability in telomere length explains increased irritability and physical health problems in individuals with  a history of ELS, in order to test a potential mechanism by which early adverse experiences result in maladaptive outcomes. The results of this study will not only increase our understanding of the relations among ELS, telomere length, and health outcomes, but will also provide insight into a markers of cellular aging longitudinally during the important developmental period of adolescence, a stage of increased risk for the onset of mental health difficulties following ELS. Thus, we anticipate that the current study will contribute to our understanding both of models of the onset of psychopathology following ELS and of mechanisms by which ELS confers heightened risk for negative health outcomes. Findings from the proposed study will increase our knowledge of biological responses to stress and will provide insight into the onset and progression of disease following early adversity."

"9368867","Aphasia is a common outcome following brain injury and often leads to long-term disability and diminished quality of life. Language production disorders in particular, such as difficulty finding the right word or problems speaking in sentences, are the most common symptoms of aphasia, and significantly hinder communication and social participation. While some people with language production deficits recover well during the first year after injury, others will not, and this discrepancy in outcomes is largely unpredictable. Many factors affect recovery patterns across individuals, one of which is the involvement of different neuroanatomical structures in the resulting impairment and subsequent degree of recovery. Surprisingly, little is known about structural changes in the brain accompanying recovery from language production deficits in aphasia, though preliminary evidence suggests they may be better predictors of recovery than traditionally-used functional change measures.  The proposed longitudinal, multimodal neuroimaging study will explore the patterns of recovery in a large group of individuals with aphasia following stroke. By combining a number of novel techniques, we will investigate the contributions of numerous gray and white matter structures to the recovery of language production deficits. Fifty individuals with aphasia will be tested at 1-, 3- and 12-months post stroke on various measures of language production at the word, sentence and discourse level to establish baseline measures of performance and monitor changes across the different stages of recovery. At the same three time points, participants will undergo structural MRI and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) to determine lesion site, white matter integrity, and changes in grey and white matter over time.  The first main objective of the study is to determine which damaged cortical regions and white matter pathways impede recovery of language production throughout the first year. The second main objective is to measure neuronal changes in gray matter morphometry and white matter integrity that accompany observed behavioral improvement. Evaluating different time periods during the first year post-stroke will enable us to tease out neural indices predicting, impeding, and supporting language recovery at different stages.  The proposed project will be the first comprehensive longitudinal study using state-of-the art techniques to examine plasticity within gray matter regions and white matter tracts and their contribution to recovery of different language levels over the course of one full year. In the end, the results of this study will provide important insights into factors contributing to successful recovery of language abilities and enable clinicians to utilize neuroimaging information in prognosis and selection of the most optimal treatments."
"9403567","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This R34 application, led by an Early Stage Investigator, aims to understand and address the multiple ways in which gender-based violence (GBV) impacts the effective use of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) ages 15-24 in Kenya. AGYW account for 25% of all HIV new infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Although PrEP has the potential to reduce HIV risk in this population, adherence has been low among young African women in previous studies, limiting its protective benefit. Many current studies aim to increase PrEP uptake and adherence among AGYW, but none, to our knowledge, incorporate targeted PrEP interventions for GBV survivors. In Kenya, the lifetime prevalence of physical or sexual GBV among AGYW is over 40%, and GBV is associated with higher HIV incidence and lower adherence to PrEP. There is an urgent need for effective interventions to address GBV- specific barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence, to reduce HIV risk in this vulnerable group. We propose to conduct formative research to better understand individual-, partner-, community-, and clinic-level barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence in AGYW GBV survivors. Based on this formative work, we will develop and pilot an intervention to address these barriers. The research will be nested within the ongoing DREAMS HIV prevention activities for AGYW, including PrEP delivery, implemented by Impact Research and Development Organization (IRDO) in Siaya County, western Kenya. The specific aims are 1) to characterize patterns of PrEP uptake and adherence among young GBV survivors, and to understand their unique barriers and facilitators to PrEP use, by means of mixed-methods formative research; 2) to develop and pre-test an intervention that addresses multi-level GBV-related barriers to PrEP use among AGYW; and 3) to implement and assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of the resulting intervention through a pilot cluster randomized-controlled trial (cRCT) with 100 AGYW GBV survivors at four PrEP delivery sites. Key intervention components can be integrated and sustained within adherence support activities for all AGYW, and include GBV screening; video vignettes to role model successful PrEP use; adherence support clubs; counseling on safety planning and disclosure; and provider training and support. Primary outcomes of the pilot cRCT will include feasibility and safety. We will also determine whether the intervention shows promise in increasing PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence at 6 months. We will conduct participant in-depth interviews and provider focus groups to explore acceptability and effects on PrEP decision-making. The proposed work is innovative because it builds on the existing DREAMS Initiative and engages youth in intervention design. The focus on GBV survivors is novel and fills a critical gap in our efforts to end the HIV epidemic. If successful, the findings will provide robust preliminary data for an R01 proposal to test the efficacy of this intervention on PrEP uptake, persistence, and biologic markers of adherence in a fully powered multisite RCT."
"9329195","Abstract  Many hematopoietic disorders are characterized by an unbalanced blood system whereby certain cell types are either abnormally abundant or deficient. Currently, the primary treatment available for these diseases involves bone marrow transplantation from healthy donors. In this treatment, donor hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) adapt their differentiation programs to the presence or absence of other HSCs. However, few studies have addressed this intercellular coordination between stem cells, which plays a critical role in maintaining a balanced blood system. The proposed research will offer a clonal perspective on the progression of hematopoietic disorders that result from an unbalanced blood system. In particular, HSCs with specific differentiation characteristics (i.e., balanced blood production) may possess a greater capacity to respond to changes to other HSCs. In my proposed research, I will investigate the dynamics of HSC coordination by precisely perturbing a specific cell type in the blood system and assaying the temporal responses of individual HSCs. These experiments will identify HSCs that respond quickly and/or persistently to perturbations to the HSC population, two characteristics that are highly desirable for therapeutic purposes. I will determine how HSCs dynamically adapt their differentiation programs in response to deficiencies in their partner HSCs. I will track individual normal HSCs in vivo using a single cell tracking technology that was previously developed in our lab. This novel approach will allow the tracing of thousands of individual HSCs simultaneously in a mouse model and help identify the interactions between normal and lineage deficient HSCs. Finally, I will determine whether compensation for lymphoid lineage deficiency can be enhanced by stimulating the normal transplanted HSCs with small molecule compounds using a novel in vivo small molecule screening assay I developed. Compounds that increase the production of certain blood cell types or enhance the engraftment of transplanted HSCs can be applied to improve efficacy transplantation efficacy."
"9277205","Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this proposal is to generate data and develop a statistical sampling/analysis strategy to aid FDA/COER policy in drafting data-based guidance in support of the use of appropriate statistical tools and standards. The goal will be addressed by organizing the work under the following specific aims: 1) Selection of recently distributed pharmaceutical products: Develop a selection rationale to identify major dosage form categories based on the complexity of the dosage form and key characteristics including dose, release mechanism, BCS, therapeutic index, and manufacturing method. 2) Sampling organization and data generation: Organize the sampling to insure that sufficient data are collected for the range of statistical treatments to be developed and tested. Generate the data for selected critical quality, chemical and physical attributes (e.g., tablet weight, hardness, friability, assay, content uniformity, and dissolution) and determine the mean and variance of the entire sample. 3)Comparative estimation accuracy of current/proposed models: Using current standards and alternate models' ability to predict the means and variance against those actually observed from experimentation. 4) Generate standards and alternates for dosage form category specific statistical methods: Develop and identify approaches for inter and intra-category variability suitable for lot release for the categories of dosage forms studied. Variability in the way drug products perform is a major reason for product recalls and potentially negative outcomes in the patient population. This variability may be manifested in the physical-chemical characteristics of the final dosage form as produced, the way it delivers the drug substance, or the way it retains the desired behavior with time, i.e., the self-life. The goal of process control and product testing is to assess the quality of the dosage forms upon release to detect issues and to anticipate problems that may occur during its shelf-life. Because different dosage forms may be designed to perform differently and be variable over a range of characteristics, the proposed project will provide both an exhaustive benchmarking of the variability over the range of dosage forms currently marketed and advanced statistical analysis tools that are ?tailored? to identity meaningful variability within each categories of dosage form identified. This will be driven by an adaptive statistical approach for directing the experimentation as well as developing to desired dosage form category specific tools. The significance of the project is that; 1) it will provide targeted statistical methods to be applied to product release and trouble shooting for the major dosage form categories, and 2) these methods will facilitate the review and approval of new drug products and generic drug products. Together this means higher quality, reduced time to market, and reduced cost."

A major goal of Core D (Body Composition, Thermoregulation, and Food Intake Behavior) is to provide investigators with the services necessary to accurately measure the major components of energy balance (energy intake, energy expenditure, body composition, nutrient digestibility) in their mouse models. Core D also provides tests that allow investigators to examine physiological factors that may influence food intake or energy expenditure. In particular, our research team offers services to investigate the role the gut microbiota and epithelial function play in obesity and metabolic disease. The Core D investigators have complementary expertise in energy metabolism, gastrointestinal physiology and gut microbiota and provide clients with assistance in all steps of the research process, from designing experiments to analyzing and interpreting data. In addition to offering standard services in our catalog, Core D also works with investigators to design custom tests or develop new tests to meet their research needs. Based on requests from investigators, we have developed services to determine thermoneutral zone and investigate energy expenditure in response to acute cold or heat stress. We also provide custom, high resolution energy expenditure measurements required to link energy expenditure to specific events (burst of activity, meal consumption, etc.) and accurately determine physical activity energy expenditure, resting energy expenditure and thermic effect of feeding. Core D is currently developing transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches which will expand our microbiota services and provide indicators of microbial function, and we have recently added measures of intestinal barrier function to our catalog of services. Core D will continue to provide our clients with in-depth physiological measurements relevant to body weight regulation while also developing new tests to meet the evolving needs of the research community."

Once we detect the magnitude of racial and ethnic disparities in health care provision, we can then seek to understand why such disparities exist, which can then inform interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities and achieve health equity. Through rigorous evaluation and use of multicenter comprehensive clinical data, this proposal will provide critical evidence and lay the framework for the next steps of our research mission - to develop and test interventions to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the provision of pediatric emergency care."
"9241960","Rapid, efficient differential diagnosis is critical to controlling the morbidity and mortality of acute infectious diseases and to enabling efficient resource allocation. Many infectious diseases present with non-specific signs and symptoms; hence, history and physical exam alone are typically insufficient to inform clinical management or characterize outbreaks. A wide range of molecular methods have been developed for direct detection of microbial nucleic acids in clinical materials. These advances have transformed microbiology and medicine; nonetheless, high throughput sequencing, the most highly multiplexed of these methods, remains too complex and expensive for application in many clinical settings. Furthermore, none of these methods will serve in instances where microbial nucleic acids are not present in an accessible sample or where disease may have been triggered by an agent that is no longer present. The risk of developing disease and its severity after exposure to an infectious agent is modulated by an individual's previous exposures to similar agents or vaccines. Such exposures may confer complete or partial protection or result in increased risk for more severe disease due to antibody-mediated enhancement, as is the case in dengue fever. Thus, knowledge of an individual's immunological history may influence decisions concerning his/her treatment, vaccination or deployment as a first responder or health care worker in areas with increased probability of encountering specific pathogens. Our objective is to enhance differential diagnosis and management of infectious diseases through pursuit of two aims that will (1) establish a new highly multiplexed serology platform for profiling a subject's pathogen exposure history and (2) improve the efficiency of sequencing for direct detection of microbial nucleic acids in clinical specimens. Investments in sequencing have largely focused on driving down costs per base and on increasing read length and number. We will complement these efforts by establishing new methods for sample preparation that will enrich for relevant template, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing the complexity of bioinformatic analyses."
"9328169","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Identification of the C9ORF72 GGGGCC repeat expansion as the most common cause of ALS and FTD has generated wide interest in elucidating disease mechanisms associated with this mutation. Importantly, varied clinical manifestations and penetrance are striking characteristics of ALS associated with the C9ORF72 repeat expansion (c9ALS). Diverse neuropsychological and motor features, association with 5-7% of sporadic ALS, onset from the 4th to 8th decade and apparent nonpenetrance in obligate carriers suggest that the pathogenesis of c9ALS may differ among patients, and could be influenced by associated disease modifying genes. To elucidate the molecular basis of c9ALS and better understand its variable expression and presentation will require correlation of clinical phenotypes with effects of the repeat expansion on disease expression and potential concomitant molecular markers. Pathogenic significance of structural characteristics of the repeat expansion in relation to disease penetrance, such as repeat length and the presence of short deletions in the GC-rich sequence adjacent to the repeat is not well established. A variable loss of C9ORF72 expression in repeat carriers resulting from epigenetic changes, including trimethylation of histone H3 and H4, may also affect disease penetrance and presentation and the relationship of these molecular markers to the onset of clinical motor and neuropsychological abnormalities in c9FTD/ALS remains unknown. Alterations in C9ORF72 mRNA expression associated with aberrant histone methylation patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may represent a disease-specific biomarker of toxic RNA expression and clinical features of c9FTD/ALS. In vivo biomarkers linking clinical manifestations of disease with underlying pathology could facilitate estimation of lifetime disease risk in mutation carriers, support earlier diagnosis, and provide a direct means to monitor response to therapy. However, investigation of these markers in relation to clinical phenotype, will require cross- sectional and longitudinal clinical data in c9ALS patients and asymptomatic repeat expansion carriers. As such, we hypothesize that penetrance, progression and clinical features of c9ALS may be associated with several molecular markers in peripheral blood, including the length of the C9ORF72 repeat expansion and its sequence context, tri-methylation of histone H3K9 and H3K27, expression C9ORF72 mRNA and/or TMEM106B genotype. In this Project, we propose to assess whether C9ORF72 repeat lengths (Aim 1), aberrant histone methylation (Aim 2) and C9ORF72 mRNA expression (Aim 3) respectively differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic repeat carriers, change over time in symptomatic and/or asymptomatic repeat carriers, and associate with cross-sectional and longitudinal clinical measures. Finally, we will determine whether TMEM106B is associated with the severity of cognitive changes in c9ALS patients (Aim 4)."
"9385894","Project Summary Impairments in cognitive function are among the ?hallmark? characteristics of addiction. In this regard, alcoholism is associated with dysfunction of multiple cognitive faculties that may underlie the difficulties in reversing alcohol- seeking behaviors during extended periods of abstinence. Repeated cycles of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal dysregulate brain amino acid systems, an effect that is thought to impart a hyperexcitable state. Whereas acute withdrawal mobilizes signaling of the primary excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, over time these neurological disturbances subside. The emergence of cognitive disruptions during protracted withdrawal suggests an underlying dysfunction in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In this regard, drugs of abuse mobilize protein kinases that, over the course of repeated exposures, produce long-term changes in synaptic function and molecular signaling networks that coincide with addictive phenotypes. We propose that withdrawal- induced cognitive impairments relate to an undercurrent of dysfunctional kinase signaling pathways that preserve aberrant glutamate receptor signaling in discrete regions of the mPFC. To this end, the K99 phase will involve training in novel proteomic enrichment strategies to broadly evaluate the mPFC proteome, as isolated by dorsal and ventral regions, towards the goal of identifying novel protein signaling targets in alcohol-dependent rats experiencing protracted withdrawal. We will then seek to characterize the molecular and cognitive behavioral relevance of these targets throughout the R00 phase using novel peptidomimetic strategies that target the disruption of specific protein-protein interactions. This study will provide novel insight into distinct signaling pathways that underlie alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction."
"9334338","Associate Program 2  Project Summary The goal of Associate Program 2 is to use ecological insights to guide the discovery of novel natural products with biological activity against a targeted group of diseases critical to developing nations and to the United States. In complex environments such as near-shore marine habitats, secondary metabolism has evolved over billions of years in response to intense selection pressure on organisms to solve critical challenges associated with survival and reproduction. In particular, tropical coral reefs host diverse microorganisms, algae, and invertebrates that use chemical cues and chemical defenses as a language driving interactions among and within species. Small organic molecules that are critical in mediating ecological interactions are strong candidates for new medicines targeting infectious disease caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites, in addition to cancer and neurological disorders. We will explore understudied coral reef organisms including rare species of marine algae and invertebrates and microbes associated with algal and coral surfaces. We will apply ecological assays to uncover novel secondary metabolism, extending our previous work testing for antimicrobial, antiherbivore, and allelopathic compounds by adding microbial overlay and challenge assays to seek chemically rich microbes specialized as pathogens, mutualists, or commensals that produce unique secondary metabolites due to complex ecological interactions. Pursuit of lead drug molecules will be based on prioritized activity in a series of pharmacological screens relevant to infectious disease, tropical neglected disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative and CNS disorders. Identification of novel natural product structures will utilize modern spectroscopic techniques, leading to preclinical studies. Once our aims are met, we will have contributed novel pharmaceutical leads to the biomedical research community; revealed new molecular scaffolds and receptor-ligand interactions to the chemistry and chemical biology communities; learned new lessons on the roles of chemical cues and chemical defenses among marine macro- and microorganisms; applied new metabolomic and metabolic networking approaches to studying secondary metabolism in marine organisms; and trained a generation of scientific personnel in the U.S. and the South Pacific."
"9355211","ABSTRACT ?? iLook Out for Child Abuse: An Innovative Learning Module for Childcare Providers    The epidemic of child abuse in the U.S. (>680,000 confirmed annually) causes massive harm to children and the adults they become. Sequellae include physical disabilities and neurological damage, mental health problems, maladaptive behaviors, and perpetuating cycles of abuse. Young children (aged 0?5 years) are particularly vulnerable to victimization. They account for >75% of deaths from abuse and a greater proportion of victims than older children for all categories of maltreatment except sexual abuse. Yet despite >8 million American children being in childcare, childcare providers (CCPs) report fewer than 0.5% (~2,500) of all substantiated cases of child abuse. Research shows that CCPs are not adequately prepared to identify at-risk children, and there are no evidence-based interventions with demonstrated efficacy for improving CCP reporting of suspected child abuse. That said, efforts to raise CCP reporting rates must be careful not to promote inappropriate reporting that merely wastes scarce resources and causes families undue stress. This 5-year study will evaluate the efficacy of an innovative educational intervention, iLook Out for Child Abuse (iLookOut) for increasing rates of accurate child abuse reporting. Grounded in an Experiential Learning conceptual model, iLookOut is a multi-media, online intervention that engages learners emotionally and intellectually through an interactive, video-based storyline that provides education, challenges learners with decision-points, and gives critical feedback. iLookOut uses gamification strategies to promote experiential learning through simulation, problem-solving, and practice opportunities to apply new information and understanding. It also will include follow-up activities that promote retention and integration of new knowledge, as well as help CCPs to remain aware and engaged. Prior studies have demonstrated that iLookOut significantly improves CCP knowledge and attitudes about reporting suspected child abuse, and is very well received by CCPs. To evaluate its impact on actual reporting behavior, the proposed research will randomize 3 geographically distinct regions in the state of Maine (which was chosen because of its excellent child welfare information system, centralized reporting structure, and enthusiasm to collaborate) to receive iLookOut, Standard training, or Control (no intervention). The primary goal is to increase the number of CCP reports for which either child abuse is confirmed or social services (e.g., therapeutic services, nutritional assistance) are recommended ?as these are the kinds of reports that are likely to actually benefit a child. The secondary goal is to decrease the proportion of reports that don't offer such benefit, and in particular to decrease costs to the state associated with intake and investigation of non-beneficial reports. If, as hypothesized, iLookOut 1) increases the incidence of beneficial reports, and 2) decreases the proportionate costs of non-beneficial reports, we will have the first evidence-based tool for helping CCPs accurately identify and report young children who are victims of abuse."
"9309288","Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 ? 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH?s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma."
"9233912","Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and human herpesvirus (HHV6) are members ofthe herpesvirus family and are included on the NIAID list of Emerging/Re-Emerging pathogens. HHV8/KSHV is associated with three different cancers in the human population including Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. In Sub-Saharan Africa, KS is the most common cancer in men. Human herpesvirus type-6 (HHV-6) is the infectious cause of roseola infantum in young children. In response to RFA-AI-12-048, Immune mechanisms of Viral Control, we propose to determine how DNA herpes viruses are sensed by the host immune system. We propose to determine the interaction of multiple pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) with these DNA viruses and the mechanisms by which these viruses are sensed by host PRRs to activate the innate immune response. We hypothesize that PRRs involved in nucleic acid sensing of viral genomes are able to detect KSHV and HHV6 and activate innate immune responses. Additionally, the DNA damage response induced by herpes viral infection may also contribute to activation of innate immune pathways. This project advances the overall goals of the program by using cutting edge quantitative proteomic approaches to identify novel paradigm shifting pathways of pathogen sensing, identifying nucleic acid binding by human PRRs, and determining cross-talk between multiple PRRs in the host response to NIAID Emerging/Reemerging viruses."
"9320879","The overall aim of the Data Analysis and Signature Generation Core is to use the experimental data from the  Data Generation Core for multi-tier analyses that combine human interactome- and Gene Ontology-based  statistical network models with dynamical multi-compartment ODE models to obtain multiple types of  signatures. The data are characterized by the three LINCS data matrix axes; cell types are cardiomyocytes,  hepatocytes, and neurons from cell lines and derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells;  perturbagens are 130 individual drugs that induce cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy  and 120 drug combinations where a second drug mitigates the toxicity; assays are microarray for mRNA  levels, mass spec for protein levels, and microwestern for protein state levels. The first signature tier is  experimentally-observed signatures (EOS). These are lists of differentially expressed genes based on mRNA  alone, protein alone, and their combination. We expect that the combination of mRNA and protein data will  be synergistic for generating signatures. The second tier is network-inferred signatures (NIS). This takes  EOS as input and combines it with prior knowledge (human interactome, gene expression omnibus) to  generate biological networks, in the form of bipartite graphs associated with drug toxicity and its potential  mitigation. Analysis of these networks will inform drug-relevant pathways for assay by microwestern array;  this crosstalk between cores is a key integration point of this center proposal. The third tier is dynamical  model-weighted signatures (wNIS and wEOS). The key pathways identified above by NIS will inform the  development of dynamical, multi-compartment ODE models which will be constrained by the microwestern  array data. Global sensitivity analysis of these dynamical models will quantify the fragility of nodes in  associated networks. Thus we will weight elements of previously developed signatures by their dynamical  model-predicted fragility. We expect this signature pipeline to produce roughly 4,000 signatures per year.  Finally, we will use these signatures as input to build classifiers of drug-induced toxicity, using matched  (cardiomyocyte data for a cardiotoxic drug) vs. unmatched conditions as training controls. The entire  signature generating pipeline and its output will be annotated with a deep level of integrated quality control to  ensure proper dissemination of our models and signatures to the public."
"9331730","PROJECT SUMMARY The placenta plays a critical role in supporting fetal development. Consequently, placental dysfunction can have catastrophic consequences for both the fetus and the mother. While insight into the mechanisms underlying the placenta's role in supporting pregnancy is lacking, we know that certain microRNA (miRNA) species are central to this process. In this project, we focus on a family of primate-specific miRNAs that are expressed from the largest cluster of human miRNAs, located on chromosome 19 (called Ch. 19 miRNA cluster, or C19MC). These miRNAs are highly expressed, almost exclusively in the placenta, where they are implicated in the defense against viral infection. These C19MC miRNAs are also involved in regulation of trophoblast migration and invasion, which are critical for proper placentation. Indeed, deviant expression patterns of C19MC miRNA species have been reported in pregnancies complicated by placental insufficiency. Moreover, C19MC miRNAs are ectopically expressed in several forms of aggressive tumors, underscoring their role in controlling cell fate decisions and the need for tight control of C19MC expression. To decipher the mechanisms underlying the regulation of C19MC expression, we recently generated several transgenic mouse lines, engineered to genomically harbor a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) plasmid containing the entire human C19MC region. Although the C19MC is primate specific, we found that the expression pattern of these human miRNAs in mouse tissues is extraordinarily parallel to that observed in humans, implying that the BAC- based transgene contains all regulatory elements necessary for adequate transcriptional control of the C19MC, and that the mouse placenta provides an epigenomic context akin to the human placenta. We used ATAC-seq assay to map the open chromatin landscape of the C19MC region, and luciferase reporter assays to identify genomic DNA domains with enhancer activity. Our goal in this project is to analyze the function and the regulatory potential of these genomic elements, using a set of functional assays. We will first use the CRISPR- Cas9 system to genetically disable endogenous genomic elements in placental cell lines, and determine the consequences on C19MC expression. We will further analyze the functional importance of the C19MC regulatory elements in two different mouse models: one designed to interrogate the ability of each genomic element to activate a heterologous promoter in the mouse placenta, using lentivirus-mediated placenta-specific transgenesis; the other is our ?humanized? transgenic mouse model, carrying the C19MC locus, which will be used to assess the influence of each discrete element, in the context of native chromatin, on placental expression. Using these non-overlapping, complementary approaches, this project will provide critically needed information about the mechanisms underlying the unique expression of C19MC miRNAs and their placental specificity. This project will provide essential information on trophoblast invasion and differentiation, placental dysfunction, trophoblast protection against viral infections during pregnancy, and carcinogenesis."

We will compare the targeted cancer panel to germline whole exome sequencing (WES) of unselected childhood cancer patients (n=1100) and WES, transcriptome sequencing and copy number array of FFPE tumor samples for the subset of patients with high-risk tumors (n=360). We will build on our success completing the CSER program BASIC3 exome sequencing trial (which included 60% Hispanic and African-American patients from a single large academic center) in this large multi-institutional study of an even more diverse patient population from five heterogeneous healthcare settings across Texas. The trial will be led by an experienced multi-PI team of Drs. Plon (medical geneticist), Parsons (pediatric oncologist) and McGuire (ethicist and health policy expert). We will assess clinical utility of these tests by measuring the frequency of diagnostic and/or actionable germline and tumor findings and the effect on treatment decisions (Aim 1). We will compare uptake by first degree relatives for familial genetic testing and recommended cancer surveillance by race, ethnicity and clinical settings (Aim 2). We will describe perceived utility (clinical, psychological, and pragmatic) by surveying and interviewing parents and participating pediatric oncologists (n=40) (Aim 3). Working with our pediatric cancer stakeholders, including advocates, BASIC3 study parents, and national organizations, we will create and evaluate the use of culturally sensitive educational materials, including videos in English and Spanish, improved integrated genomic test reports and counseling materials, and will compare in-person versus telemedicine exome results disclosure (Aim 4). Finally, we will provide data to guide future application of clinical genomics through three innovative pilot projects focused on health economics, decision support for cancer surveillance and whole genome sequencing (Aim 5). Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children?s Hospital, and our partner institutions across the state are ideally suited to conduct this study and play leadership roles in CSER2 consortium activities based on our longstanding pediatric oncology and cancer genetics expertise, extensive experience in CLIA-certified clinical germline and cancer genomic diagnostic testing, and a track record of scholarship in ethical and social implications of genomics and health disparities research."
"9328911","Project Summary/Abstract  Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are thought to result from in brain synapse dysfunction. Mutations or deletions of the MEF2C gene have been linked recently to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, intellectual disability (ID) and schizophrenia (SCZ). Mef2 transcription factors promote activity- dependent, glutamatergic synapse elimination ? a possible dysregulated process in autism. We find that Mef2c conditional forebrain knockout (Mef2c cKO) mice display behavioral abnormalities similar to the 3 core features used to diagnose autism in humans, including abnormalities in communication, social interaction, and repetitive motor behaviors. Surprisingly, we observed a significant increase in inhibitory (GABAergic) and a decrease in excitatory (glutamatergic) synapse density and strength, which suggests the hypothesis that Mef2c functions as an activity-regulated transcriptional repressor to control the balance of inhibitory and excitatory synapses in developing cortical neurons. Loss of Mef2c repressor function promotes excitatory synapse elimination and increases inhibitory synapse density, which results in numerous behaviors with potential relevance to autism, ID and SCZ. In this revised grant proposal, we seek to extend our extensive preliminary findings to explore the role and regulation of Mef2c in cortical synapse development and in behaviors associated with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  Aim 1. In this aim, we will use well-established behavioral assays in the lab to analyze social interaction, communication, repetitive behaviors, reward, anxiety, and learning and memory tests in Mef2c cKO mice.  Aim 2. In this aim, we will take a multi-pronged approach in culture and in vivo to analyze the role of Mef2c in the regulation of excitatory and inhibitory synapse density and function. We will test the hypothesis that Mef2c functions cell-autonomously as a transcriptional repressor to regulate glutamatergic synapse elimination and GABAergic synapse formation/stabilization, and it does so in an activity-dependent, homeostatic, negative feedback mechanism that promotes inhibition and reduces excitation.  Aim 3. In this aim, we will extend our preliminary findings with HTS-CLIP and RNA-seq to assess the role of Pcdh17, an newly identified common MEF2/FMRP target gene, in Mef2c-induced excitatory synapse elimination and inhibitory synapse formation in cortical pyramidal neurons in culture and in vivo."
"9397088","Project Summary  The diaphragm is an essential skeletal muscle, playing a critical role in respiration and serving as a barrier that separates the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Development of the diaphragm requires the integration of muscle, connective tissue, tendon, bone, and nerves that arise from different embryonic sources. Defects in muscularization of the diaphragm cause congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDH), a common birth defect (1 in 3,000 births) where the liver herniates into the thorax, impeding lung development and resulting in a 50% neonatal mortality rate. Diaphragm development entails the migration of muscle precursors from the somites and the extension phrenic nerve axons (the sole source of innervation) to connective tissue progenitors. However, in spite of the high incidence of CDH and functional importance of the diaphragm, the cellular interactions and molecular signals directing muscle migration and axon guidance required for diaphragm muscularization and innervation are largely unknown and the subject of this proposal. Our lab has recently demonstrated that interactions between muscle and connective tissue are crucial for normal development of the diaphragm muscle and defects in this interaction are a source of CDH. The muscle connective tissue originates from transient embryonic structures, termed the pleuroperitoneal folds (PPFs). This project focuses on the role of PPFs and, in particular, Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) secreted by the PPFs, in guiding muscle progenitors and the phrenic nerve to the developing diaphragm. Preliminary data showing the expression of Met in the diaphragm's muscle progenitors and Hgf in PPF fibroblasts suggests that PPF-derived HGF is important for recruiting MET+ muscle progenitors into the developing diaphragm. However, an earlier MET requirement for delamination of progenitors from the somites has precluded an explicit test of this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine which somites are the source of diaphragm muscle and test the hypothesis that HGF is an important PPF-derived secreted signal that critically regulates migration of muscle into and throughout the diaphragm. By conditional deletion of Hgf in PPFs after muscle progenitors have emigrated from the somite, I will test the role of HGF/MET signaling in muscle progenitor migration into the diaphragm. Preliminary data suggest that loss of PPF-derived Hgf disrupts normal muscularization and guidance of phrenic nerve axons into the diaphragm. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that PPF and muscle derived signals are required for guiding phrenic nerve axons to and throughout the diaphragm. I will determine whether the pleuroperitoneal folds have chemoattractant properties in culture and characterize how the depletion of secreted signals, including Hgf, affect the guidance of phrenic nerve axons. Taken together, these studies exploit the powerful genetics of mice to define the role of connective tissue progenitors in muscle migration and axon guidance to the developing diaphragm and establish a basis for understanding how connective tissue defects can contribute to congenital diaphragmatic hernias."
"9360052","ABSTRACT A major force driving relapse in drug addiction, including opiate addiction, is the almost intolerable aversive effects of drug withdrawal. The biological bases of learned aversion to the drug withdrawal state have important mechanistic overlap with those for aversion to non-drug-related noxious stimuli (e.g. bitter taste, footshock, social defeat, traumatic stress) and involve multiple brain regions. Among them, the interconnected basal ganglia (BG) nuclei, including nucleus accumbens (NAc), ventral pallidum (VP) and dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental areas (VTA) appear to be particularly crucial. In this proposal, we will focus our study on the NAc, not only because prior studies have implicated this brain region as a critical substrate for both rewarding and aversive effects of opiates, but also because recent studies suggest a particular neuronal cell type in the NAc, the D2 medium spiny neuron (D2-MSN), is essential to establishment of avoidance behaviors elicited by noxious environmental stimuli as well as the intense aversive effects of opiate withdrawal. Since manipulating the activities of D2-MSNs using the latest chemogenetic or optogenetic tools have demonstrated pivotal roles of these neurons in aversive behaviors, we reason the critical next step is to dissect the roles of D2-MSNs in non-drug-related and opiate withdrawal-related aversion through genetic analyses of endogenous genes that are highly selectively expressed in D2-MSNs. To this end, we hypothesize three such genes - two receptors (Gpr6 and Adora2a) and one peptide precursor (pre-pro-enkephalin (Penk)) - play important roles in opiate withdrawal aversion. We propose that signaling through these two Gs-linked receptors, by opposing the signaling imparted by the Gi/o-coupled dopamine D2 receptor, is crucial for D2- MSN mediation of both non-drug and opiate withdrawal-related aversion. To test this, we will investigate the behavioral and signaling effects of single or double deletion of these receptors. Conversely, our recent data demonstrate that pro-enkephalin-derived peptides in D2-MSNs play a crucial role in mediating an endogenous opioid hedonic tone, hence we will test the idea that removal of Penk in D2-MSNs will exacerbate the aversive effects of opiate withdrawal. Finally, we have obtained exciting preliminary data, using RNA-seq and network analyses, showing aberrant changes in NAc molecular networks upon the establishment of opiate dependence. We will apply such powerful integrative systems biology approaches to investigate whether genetic perturbation of key D2-MSN genes or opioid network genes alters the molecular signatures of opiate dependence."
"9281740","The overall goal of this project, Cumulative Environmental Effects: Expanding Research with the Hopi Tribe, is  to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to collaborate with the Hopi Tribe  investigating household exposures to inform policy decisions. Household exposures are major sources of  environmental hazards encountered by many American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities.  Household exposures include combustion by-products from heating and cooking, particulate from nearby  mining and other land uses, and water and food contamination. These exposures, and co-exposures such as  unemployment and poor access to preventive programs and health services, impact respiratory health and  obesity among children and adults, and warrant evaluation of AI/AN household exposures within a social  ecological framework. The Hopi Tribe in northern Arizona has identified several areas of concern, including  the impact of burning coal and biomass in homes for heating and its potential impact on respiratory health.  Other issues include concerns about arsenic and uranium species in drinking and surface water. Arsenic  exposure is linked to compromised lung function and an increase in body mass index. This application seeks  to expand existing relationships to include Hopi officials in the Hopi Environmental Protection Office and  university environmental scientists and health promotion experts. The project proposes to: 1) Characterize  magnitude of environmental exposures to particulate matter (PM), arsenic species, uranium and other  contaminants from air, water, and food in selected households on Hopi tribal lands; 2) Evaluate how exposures  are moderated by social determinants of health, social capital, community resilience and other cultural assets;  and 3) Expand Hopi capacity to address areas of environmental concern. The effort will build additional  capacity within the Hopi Tribe to evaluate and mitigate environmental hazards of concern to the Tribe. The  proposed joint project provides an opportunity to develop and strengthen a relationship built on trust between  the Hopi Tribe and university researchers and to increase the capacity of the Hopi Environmental Protection  Office to monitor its air and water quality. Anticipated results include modeling of cumulative exposures to  arsenic species and particulate among Hopi residents and addressing environmental concerns of the Tribe in  terms of health inequities. The project will build the Hopi Tribe's capacity to conduct research on adverse  exposures and develop programs that inform tribal environmental and health policies for a sustainable future."

This 22nd Evergreen International Phage Meeting (Aug. 6-11) will again bring together a very diverse group of biotechnologists and basic research scientists who are engaged in applying phage biology to current needs in animal and human health, food safety, biotechnology, and other applications as well as carrying out basic studies of the very large variety of phages being discovered and analyzed in recent years. Presentations will include 5 full days of keynote talks by invited speakers as well as talks chosen from submitted abstracts and extensive display and discussion of posters from most participants. The funding requested will facilitate participation of U.S. young investigators and under-represented minorities, phage scientists from underdeveloped countries, and leading international speakers, including Former Soviet Union (FSU) scientists, providing U.S. scientists access to their extensive therapeutic phage collections and over 80 years of experience with human phage therapy. The cost is kept very low: $600 ($450 for students) includes all meals and housing in suites of rooms on The Evergreen State College campus. The informal, interactive atmosphere results in many regional and international collaborations. It also provides a particularly good opportunity for young investigators (graduate students, postdocs, junior faculty) and senior scientists from other disciplinary backgrounds to interact closely with well-established and influential scientists in these fields and to present their research at extensive poster sessions. There is also an opportunity for oral presentations in a supportive environment for those showing the most promise; many current leaders in the field gave their first talks as grad students at Evergreen meetings. Particular attention is paid to providing opportunities for talented women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities to participate actively in the meeting, showcasing their results and facilitating interactions with other scientists in their fields. This year, a special initiative is bringing 15 African scientists involved in a multinational program to develop phage applications in disease management and food safety, with their air fare supported by the Gates Foundation, to build partnerships as well as knowledge and skills."

"9334285","PROJECT SUMMARY: Sensitive periods in neuronal development vary by brain region, sensitivity and vulnerability to disruptive agents. We have discovered that the second postnatal week in the rat is a sensitive period in cerebellar development to dysregulation by inflammation. This sensitive period is characterized by increased production of prostaglandins, in particular PGE2. This sensitive period coincides with a time of increased risk for perinatal H/I (e.g. birth in human infants). The source of the stunting of the Purkinje neuron dendritic tree following inflammation is unknown. Microglia are the brains innate immune cells and serve a variety of functions in both health and disease. We have observed tightly regulated and temporally controlled phagocytic activity of microglia in the developing cerebellum and we hypothesize this plays an important role in normal cerebellar development. We provide evidence that H/I at PN10 increases still further the peak in phagocytosis normally seen at PN17. One of the key signals regulating microglia phagocytic activity is the membrane lipid phosphatidylserine, which is externalized to the outer leaflet and promotes phagocytosis. Hypoxia has been known to stimulate phagocytosis by stressing cells sufficiently to externalize phosphotidylserine. The role of metabolism or lipid rafts in the externalization of this lipid has not been considered, nor have either of these variables been characterized in microglia in a surveying versus activated state. Hypoxic-Ischemic brain injury often occurs following an inflammatory insult, resulting in further injury than would otherwise occur. Whether this is true in the developing cerebellum has not been carefully explored nor have sex differences in hypoxic-ischemic brain or inflammatory injury been considered. We propose three Specific Aims focused on 1) morphometery of Purkinje neurons, granule cells and the deep cerebellar nuclei following H/I with and without inflammation, 2) the role of microglia in neuronal damage induced by H/I with and without inflammation and 3) the impact of tetracycline based antibiotic, Minocycline, as proof of principle and the glutamate transporter modifying antibiotic Ceftriaxone as a potential therapeutic. We will also explore the dietary supplement, choline and conduct behavioral and histological analyses to assess injury and recovery. Data generated by these experiments will provide novel insights into the impact of H/I on the cerebellum and the degree to which it contributes to the impaired cognitive and motor function seen in infants suffering hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy."
"9350363","Project Summary Active transport of vesicular cargoes is vital to the targeted delivery of organelles, proteins, and signaling mol- ecules in the complex and crowded cellular environment. Accordingly, defects are linked to developmental, neurodegenerative, pigmentation, immunological, and other diseases. Knowing the detailed mechano- chemistry and structural dynamics of isolated motor proteins is essential for integrating the divergent mechani- cal and kinetic properties of cytoskeletal motor families. We have developed a number of powerful new bio- physical tools that reveal the modulation of mechanical and ATPase reaction kinetics under applied mechani- cal force, elucidate the essential rotational conformational transitions of specific domains within the motor pro- teins and produce reliable force, stepping dynamics, and local viscoelastic parameters of the cellular environ- ment. We will apply these unique tools to investigate the divergent biochemical and mechanical properties of myosin-I (Myo1) and dynein isoforms that have that have not yet been approached at the mechanistic detail now possible. Aim 1: Using simultaneous optical trapping and TIRF microscopy, determine stress- and strain-dependence of the binding and dissociation of ATP and ADP that fuel motion and control motor stepping; Aim 1A: in myosins 1b and 1c; Aim 1B: in budding yeast and mammalian cytoplasmic dynein. Aim 2: To determine the rotational motions of motor heads and lever arms that generate force and cargo translocation using single molecule polarized TIRF (polTIRF) microscopy; 2A: in myosins 1b and 1c; 2B: in yeast cytoplasmic dynein. We discovered that Myo1b and Myo1c have markedly different strain-dependent attachment lifetime, even though their unloaded kinetics and protein sequences are quite similar. We will apply our formidable single-molecule mechanical and fluorescence technologies to understand how these closely related motors have optimized their kinetic and structural variations for their different cellular roles. Mammalian and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic dynein have overlapping roles in their respec- tive cells, but their properties are very different. We are in the unique position to compare them using advanced biophysical methods. We will determine their strain-dependent ATPase dynamics and rotational motions. We anticipate that these studies will provide insight into the motors' mechanisms, and will also reveal biochemical and mechanical adaptations to their distinct functions. Aim 3: We will use our unique new technology for measuring and calibrating optical trap signals within live cells to 3A: determine the functional speciali- zations that vary the complement of motors among early and late endosomes, and small and large la- tex bead compartments (LBCs) endocytosed or phagocytosed into live cells. 3B: measure forces and motor dynamics during remodeling of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by interaction with endosomal vesi- cles. All three aims represent close, essential collaborations with Drs. Ostap, Holzbaur and Shuman. Many cargos have opposing motors bound simultaneously; these motors may operate in teams functioning either cooperatively or competitively. We will focus on the role of oppositely directed motors at critical junctures in cellular organelle trafficking: early and late endosomes and the remodeling of endoplasmic reticulum we have observed when transport vesicles interact with the ER. Together, these studies will provide insights into the roles of the molecular motor families in regulating organelle motility, morphology and remodeling. These stud- ies will lead to a much improved understanding of myosin I and dynein isoforms that operate very differently from the better understood kinesin and myosin motors, leading to a more rigorous understanding of their func- tions in cell biology and disease."
"9233914","Triggered by viral infection, the PRR-mediated immune response pathways are highly robust and  complicated with the involvement of multiple, transiently assembled protein complexes that function in an  interconnected and phenotypic manner. This complex assembly and diverse pathways demand new  technology capable of systematically profiling those critical pathway components in more sensitive and  precise approaches. We have previously demonstrated the unique strength of our discovery proteomics  platform in identifying/profiling novel pathway constituents, including those dynamic protein-protein  interactions (PPIs) and post-translational modifications (PTMs) involved in the regulation of the initiation,  progression and termination of PRR-mediated immune signaling. We also showed that these results from the  proteomic dissection of PRR-mediated pathways could guide and streamline in-depth functional analyses  using conventional genetic, cell biology, and immunology approaches, thereby enlarging the scope of  mechanistic understanding of the host immune response. Leveraging this extensive experience, the overall  objective of this shared resource Core B is to enumerate the constituents of the subsequent signaling  pathways caused by the interaction of innate immune PRRs with viruses. All quantitative proteomic analyses  of PPIs and PTMs, the two major pathway operators, as well as virus-induced protein translocations, can be  performed comparatively for infected subjects versus non-infected controls or at different infection stages in  either global or subcellular compartments or in organelle-specific fashion. Various quantitative schemes  including AACT/SILAC, ITRAQ, and label-free quantitation will be complimentarily used in our experiments  for not only cell lines, but also primary cells or tissues. Additionally, we will be significantly involved in guiding  sample preparation in all Projects, particularly those associated with newly developed techniques of  proteomics. Results will generate multiple hypotheses (i.e. discovery of novel proteins, PPIs or PTMs) in  both interconnected and efficient manners to guide concurrently the discovery and elucidation of novel  biologies, pathways and mechanisms. Specifically by applying the state-of-the-art technology of quantitative  proteomics, we will (1) dissect either global or pathway-specific protein-protein interaction networks  (interactome) involved in the PRR-mediated immune response to viral infection, and (2) identify/profile global  or interactome-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs) including phosphorylation, acetylation, and  ubiquitination involved in the PRR-mediated immune response to viral infection."
"9335353","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) refers to a sudden decrease in kidney function. Recent population-based epidemiology studies show that the incidence of AKI is rising rapidly, thus emphasizing its clinical and public health importance. AKI is well known to be associated with a high risk of death during hospitalization. More recent data indicate that AKI is also associated with an increased risk of development of and/or acceleration of chronic kidney disease months to years after the AKI episode. However, much remains unknown about other long-term consequences of AKI, including its impact on the risk of cardiovascular events. Our preliminary data demonstrate that dialysis-requiring AKI is associated with an increased risk of subsequent acute coronary syndromes. In the proposed studies, we will use two complementary study cohorts to further test the hypothesis that AKI is a novel risk factor for cardiovascular events. First, using a large population-based cohort at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we will evaluate the impact of an episode of AKI as well as the severity of AKI on the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. This analysis will extend our prior work by examining the impact of AKI on different atherosclerotic and non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, including acute coronary syndromes, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and heart failure as well as by examining the impact of non-dialysis-requiring AKI as a risk factor for cardiovascular events. Second, using banked biospecimens from the NIDDK-funded Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae in Acute Kidney Injury Consortium (ASSESS-AKI), a multicenter cohort study focused on the natural history of AKI after hospital discharge, we will test several biochemical pathways that may associate an episode of AKI with subsequent cardiovascular events. These pathways involve dysregulated mineral metabolism (measured using phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, 25(OH), 1,25(OH)2 and 24,25(OH)2 vitamin D, FGF-23 and fetuin-A) and inflammation (measured through high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-?). The proposed efforts will establish the association of AKI with the risk for cardiovascular events as well as shed light on the potential biological pathways through which AKI may impact cardiovascular risk. Since several of the biological pathways to be studied are modifiable using currently available therapies, understanding which pathways associate AKI with cardiovascular disease has the potential to directly improve the care of the growing number of hospitalized patients who suffer an episode of AKI."

"9382862","Project Summary In this research project, we propose to perform task-based optimization of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) with respect to acquisition scheme using acquisition tailored image reconstruction algorithms. DBT is quickly being adopted in clinics alongside conventional 2D mammography for breast cancer screening. Mammography is inherently limited by the overlapping of 3D structures in a 2D image of the breast, allowing morphology indicative of breast cancer to be hidden by dense structures or mimicked by the superposition of overlapping tissues. DBT addresses this issue by providing 3D information via a limited- angle, tomographic approach. While the potential advantages of DBT have been widely demonstrated in the literature, optimization of the modality with respect to acquisition scheme remains an active area of research. A number of task-based optimization studies in DBT have been performed over the past decade, but these have typically confined their attention to a single reconstruction algorithm. The proposed work addresses this issue by performing a task-based comparison of acquisition schemes while employing acquisition-tailored reconstruction algorithms designed using task-based, objective metrics. Both traditional and advanced sparsity-exploiting reconstruction algorithms will be employed for this purpose. Through tailoring of the reconstruction algorithms, the work can also be expected to provide an objective improvement in image quality in the acquisition schemes considered. The specific aims of the proposed project are: (1) investigate traditional DBT reconstruction algorithms with varying acquisition scheme, (2) investigate sparsity-exploiting optimization-based DBT image reconstruction, (3) investigate and design DBT-specific image quality metrics for algorithm optimization, and (4) perform task-based assessment of acquisition-tailored algorithms with human observer studies. The first aim will address the tailoring of current image reconstruction methods to acquisition schemes of practical interest in order to establish a baseline for which to compare more advanced algorithms. The second aim will focus on the development and investigation of advanced, sparsity-exploiting, optimization- based DBT image reconstruction algorithms. This aim will involve both the development of efficient algorithms for, and the investigation of, these reconstruction techniques. In the third aim, task-based image quality metrics based on clinically relevant tasks in DBT will be developed for tuning of the previously developed optimization-based reconstruction algorithms, yielding acquisition tailored, advanced reconstruction algorithms. Lastly, in aim 4, task-based comparison of the acquisition tailored reconstruction algorithms will be performed with human observer studies."
"9437644","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunization rates for recommended childhood vaccines have consistently been high, with childhood series completion near 80% by 19-35 months. However, these high immunization coverage rates do not fully account for delays or refusals of early childhood (i.e., less than one year of age) vaccine uptake. Overall, the proportion of children not receiving all recommended vaccines or whose parents are consistently limiting visit-level vaccine administration is increasing. Children who do not receive all recommended vaccines are at greater risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases, which can lead to development of severe sequelae, hospitalizations, and death. Additionally, despite evidence showing the effect of vaccinating pregnant women in reducing disease among infants too young to be fully vaccinated, maternal immunization rates remain low. We developed and pilot tested a novel, innovative, evidence based, and comprehensive immunization intervention at the Practice, Provider, and Patient (P3) levels to meet the diverse and complex information needs of mothers. This P3 intervention included components such as use of practice-level vaccine champions, expanded reminder-recall systems, and provision of practice-level immunization rate feedback (practice-level interventions); physician peer-delivered training related to vaccines, vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccination recommendations, and vaccination system logistics, as well as standardized talking points for use when recommendation vaccination (provider-level interventions); and an interactive tablet computer (iPad) education application for pregnant women to view while waiting for care (patient-level intervention). Our pilot testing found this P3 intervention to be well received by providers and patients and indicated a few areas where the intervention could be improved. In the proposed project, we will develop and evaluate an improved version of the P3 intervention, to be called P3+. Improvements to the initial P3 framework will be based on findings from the original evaluation project as well as additional formative research. We will then evaluate the P3+ intervention in a geographically and socio-demographically diverse set of obstetrician- gynecologist offices in Georgia (community-level practices) and Colorado (offices of the Kaiser Permanente Colorado managed care organization). The research will be led by Multiple PIs who have extensive experienced in understanding and addressing barriers to vaccine uptake. The proposed evaluation will address vaccine uptake both for pregnant women and for their children, through 24 months of age, to test the hypothesis that increasing acceptability of vaccines during pregnancy will lead to positive changes in acceptance of vaccines for children."
"9328116","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is to build and develop a Tobacco Regulation and Addiction Center at the American Heart Association (AHA). This virtual Center will be a network of consortia between AHA and several leading academic institutions. It will house programs of multidisciplinary research that will inform the manufacture, distribution and marketing of tobacco products related to the regulatory authority of the FDA. Center investigators will study the cardiovascular toxicity of tobacco products and the relationship between tobacco product use and subclinical progression of cardiovascular disease to identify sensitive and robust biomarkers of cardiovascular injury related to tobacco product exposure. These studies will help to identify the relative sensitivity of specific domains of cardiovascular injury that are sensitive to tobacco exposure and facilitate the identification of harmful and potentially harmful constituents of current, new and emerging tobacco products that cause cardiovascular injury and how the impact of these constituents on cardiovascular disease outcomes could be measured. In cohorts of varying ethnicities, behavior, perceptions, and attitudes regarding tobacco products will be studied to identify which communications channels are used by vulnerable populations to obtain information about tobacco products, and which strategies are likely to be effective in discouraging initiation and continuation of tobacco use. The Center will also provide comprehensive education, state-of-the-art training in tobacco regulatory science and foster the development of independent research careers of junior investigators. Research in the Center will be supported by facilities/cores that will provide assessments and characterization of exposure to tobacco products and unified measurements of biomarkers and validated indices of cardiovascular injury. The administrative core of the Center will provide scientific, administrative and logistic oversight to all aspects of the Center and coordinate integrative team science focused on addressing the research priorities of the FDA. The Center will be well-poised to undertake strong and coordinated research projects in response to new developments and conduct collaborative research with other Centers in the Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science.     RELEVANCE: Research supported by the AHA-Tobacco Regulation and Addiction Center (A-TRAC) will aid the development and evaluation of tobacco product regulation by the FDA and thereby contribute to the protection of public health and reduction of tobacco-related disease, disability and death."
"9321426","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vesicular trafficking is crucial to cell function and survival, and deregulation of vesicular trafficking is associated with many human diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and peripheral neuropathy. The long-term goal of this research is to understand, at the molecular level, how vesicular trafficking is controlled in norma physiology and how this process becomes dysregulated in disease states. Charcot- Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common hereditary peripheral neuropathy that has been known for more than 125 years, yet the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this disease remain unclear and there are currently no effective treatment for peripheral neuropathy. Human genetic studies reveal that missense mutations in SIMPLE, a ubiquitously expressed protein of unknown function, cause an autosomal dominant form of peripheral neuropathy known as CMT type 1C. The connection of SIMPLE to CMT underscores the importance of understanding the function of this understudied protein and opens up new avenues for investigating the molecular mechanisms that trigger peripheral neuropathy. Recently, the applicant's team found that SIMPLE is an early endosomal membrane protein involved in regulation of endosome-to- lysosome trafficking and generated the first CMT1C mouse model expressing a disease-linked human SIMPLE mutant protein. In this project, the applicant's team will build on their recent studies and use a combination of biochemical, molecular biological, cell biological, proteomic, and mouse genetic approaches to define the mechanisms of SIMPLE action in regulating vesicular trafficking and elucidate the pathogenic pathways by which SIMPLE mutations cause peripheral neuropathy. Successful completion of this project will advance our knowledge of the fundamental mechanisms governing vesicular trafficking and provide useful information needed for development of effective therapies to treat peripheral neuropathy and other human diseases with disturbed vesicular trafficking."
"9328167","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In this P01 resubmission proposal entitled Pathobiology of Neurodegeneration in C9ORF72 Repeat Expansion, we seek to evaluate the mechanisms of C9ORF72 expanded repeats, the most common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and front temporal dementia (FTD), to improve the diagnosis of and prognosis for patients suffering from c9FTD/ALS. We have assembled a world-class team combining expertise in neurology, genetics, neuropathology, and cell biology that has worked closely together and has all resources in place. Our significant progress to elucidate how expanded repeat RNA transcripts and epigenetic changes may respectively drive toxicity and haploinsufficiency in c9FTD/ALS has led to the discovery that repeat expansion size does affect disease severity, and the identification of a potential biomarker detectable in blood of c9FTD/ALS patients. We now present evidence that aberrant methylation of histone 3 at lysine 9 is detectable in brain tissue, fibroblasts and blood of C9ORF72 mutation carriers. We also identified TMEM106B as the first genetic modifier of disease phenotype in C9FTD/ALS. In drawing upon the strengths of the Mayo Clinic Neurology Department, we have begun longitudinal studies of 44 C9ALS pedigrees to determine whether expansion size, tri-methylation of histone lysine residues, mRNA expression levels and TMEM106B genotypes, correlate with phenotypic variability in c9FTD/ALS. In addition, we have since produced and characterized antibodies critical for detecting each of the five repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation peptides [poly(GP), poly(GA), poly(GR), poly(PA) and poly(PR)] in cell and animal models as well as human tissue. We also provide evidence that ubiquilin-2, tau and p62/sequestosome are present in neuronal inclusions in various brain regions and spinal cord, indicating that these proteins, in addition to TDP-43, may play a role in pathogenesis of front temporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP). We provide preliminary data that TDP-43-negative/C9RANT-positive neuronal inclusions can also be detected with antibodies to dimethylarginine, suggesting a new disease mechanism involving non-histone protein methylation. Simply put, our multi-disciplinary studies will improve understanding of C9ORF72-related neurodegeneration, identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and develop a compelling brain, biofluid and biopsy resource to aid future drug discovery."
"9345354","Emergency Medical Services (EMS) commonly schedules providers to work shifts of 24-hours or longer, con- tributing to severe fatigue, occupational injury, and potentially putting patients at risk. Our long-term goal is to identify shift schedules that are safe for providers and the patients they treat and transport. These schedules must consider the frequency of emergency responses on an average shift, feasibility and utilization of on-shift rest, and also conform to workforce availability and cost constraints. The overall objective of this application is to determine the extent to which scheduling, health behaviors, and workplace factors increase risk of negative safety outcomes. The central theme is that individual and agency- specific factors compound the risk of negative safety outcomes posed by extended shifts. We hypothesize that untreated sleep disorders, adverse health behaviors, and frequent calls for emergency response that reduce sleep opportunity increase the risk for motor vehicle crashes and occupational injuries. Completion of this work will identify modifiable factors amenable to intervention and assist in design of agency-level scheduling strate- gies and interventions to improve safety. The application proposes three specific aims. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that a greater number of emergency responses per shift will be associated with less on-shift sleep. Our preliminary data suggest on-shift sleep var- ies and may be related to the opportunity for rest. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that individual factors, such as sleep disorders and simultaneous employment at multiple jobs, increase the risk of injury, motor vehicle crash- es (MVCs), and near-miss MVCs. Our preliminary data suggest that EMS providers with sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea, shift work disorder, insomnia) and those who work multiple jobs will have an in- creased risk of negative safety outcomes. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that EMS agency-level factors, such as policies that restrict daytime sleep and policies that allow more than 24 hours of consecutive work, increase the risk of injury, MVCs, and near-miss MVCs. Preliminary data suggest that these policies are common and may increase the risk of negative safety outcomes through fatigue-related performance decrements. The outcomes of this proposal will characterize the relative importance of individual-level and agency-level fac- tors with respect to occupational safety. The proposed analysis will determine the extent to which sleep is ob- tained across settings with varying environmental conditions and demands. These findings are critical for de- termining appropriate policies for shift-length regulation among EMS clinicians who must provide emergency services 24-hours per day. We will identify the rate of crashes on the commute home from work, an unexplored area of risk in this workforce."
"9379102","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In 2014 approximately 310,030 women in the United States (U.S.) will be diagnosed with breast cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), or colorectal cancer (CRC), and 68,060 women will die from these cancers. These three cancers account for 39% of the cancer burden and 25% of the cancer mortality among women in the U.S. Although effective screening tests are widely available for all three cancers, many women do not adhere to screening guidelines. Furthermore, the burden of these cancers is higher among some population groups and regions. Thirty-two rural counties in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana share similar socioeconomically underserved populations of predominately (96.2%) white women who have elevated BC, CRC, and CC mortality rates, and lower screening rates with mammography, Pap tests, and fecal occult blood testing or colonoscopy. No known intervention has addressed improving screening rates for these three main female cancers simultaneously, even though multiple health behavior change research is emerging as a new model to change the way in which interventions can be packaged. The proposed project uses an overall theoretical framework to understand health disparities which includes individual, social and community level variables, and a conceptual model for the intervention which uses a multiple behavior theoretical approach, all of which have demonstrated efficacy in improving adherence to single screening test behaviors, as well as other preventive health behaviors. The goal of this proposal is to test the comparative effectiveness of a tailored interactive computer program delivered via DVD (TIDVD) vs. a TIDVD + telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TNI) vs. Usual Care (UC) to increase guideline-based screening rates for BC, CC, and CRC among women age 50 to 74 living in these rural counties of Ohio and Indiana. Specific aims are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) vs. TIDVD + telephone-based PN intervention (TNI) vs. UC, to increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for BC, CC, and CRC among 1058 women age 50 to 74 living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana; and 2) compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + TNI intervention vs. UC, for adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests. As an Exploratory Aim, we will identify associations between theoretical variables (community, social, and individual) and screening outcomes, including interactions with the interventions. If found to be cost effective, either or both interventions hae the potential to be immediately disseminated to increase BC, CC, and CRC screening rates and ultimately reduce cancer disparities for underserved rural women."
"9325094","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this UH2 and UH3 is to study how exosomes can deliver siRNAs across the blood brain barrier to enter neurons and other brain cells. The immediate target is the mutant huntingtin mRNA. Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an increase in the CAG trinucleotide repeats to ? 36 in series; it necessitates years in a high level nursing facility because of neurodegeneration first in striatum and cortex and then to other brain structures. HD patients have cognitive impairment, depression and aberrant movements. Most HD patient present by 30 to 40 years of age; a few have a juvenile onset. A rational treatment is to decrease expression of mutant huntingtin mRNA; this therapeutic can be accomplished in HD mouse models by siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) with shRNAmir directed against huntingtin mRNA. However, delivery remains a pitfall to practical implementation of the therapeutics. siRNA and ASO require long-term infusion. In non-human primates, ASO administered to spinal fluid does not reach the striatum and spread of siRNA is limited in brain. Although promising, AAV-shRNA requires several injections into brain areas and the shRNAmir is unregulated. A gap in HD therapeutics can be filled by microvesicles normally extruded by cells, exosomes. Exosomes with rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) on their surface can be injected into the blood, cross the blood brain barrier, and enter neurons and glia. RVG-exosomes can carry siRNA cargo. Delivered into the blood circulation, the exosomes deposit siRNA in neurons to engage in RNA interference. Our purpose is to develop exosomes as a therapeutic in HD. The UH2 examines the ability of RVG-exosomes carrying siRNA against huntingtin mRNA to cross the blood brain barrier to enter neurons. Localization in brain and RNAi dependent knock down will be studied. Hyper-functional siRNAs will be sought. Because exosomes are made from cytoplasm of cells, exosome mRNA, miRNA, and implaced siRNA will be identified by deep sequencing. Immune reactivity and immune-neutralization will be studied, since exosomes have potential antigens, like RVG, and will need to be administrated often. The UH3 further establishes exosome-based therapeutics, by study of reversal or prevention of neuropathology and aberrant movement in HD mouse models. Dosing of exosomes will be secured. A team of experts in HD pathogenesis, siRNA development, RNA identification and measurement, RNAi mechanisms and exosome production and brain delivery will carry out the studies. Harnessing exosomes for brain delivery is expected to form a viable therapeutic to reduce expression of mutant huntingtin in patients with HD. Patients with other genetically- based neurodegeneration will benefit."
"9409241","Minnesota HealthSolutions (MHS) in conjunction with Mayo Clinic of Rochester proposes the current project to address the NIMH DSIR priority to develop novel tools for the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatment (EBT). We propose to develop a web- and mobile-based platform, eChildPsych, which integrates assessment, treatment tools, progress monitoring, and reporting. This sustainable and novel technological solution will improve the quality of mental health assessment and treatment for children through interactive tools to a) support initial and ongoing assessment and documentation, b) facilitate selection of key, diagnosis-relevant EBT components, c) implement progress monitoring by automatically collecting real-time patient-level data on fidelity, engagement, therapeutic progress and outcome, and d) facilitate organizational decision-making by providing aggregate fidelity and assessment data. Mental disorders are a leading cause of disability and often begin in childhood. At any given time approximately one in eight children suffers from a psychiatric disorder of sufficient severity to be impairing, the majority of which go untreated. Although effective assessment and treatment protocols exist for the majority of psychiatric conditions, the vast majority of treatment offered in real-world (non-research) settings is not consistent with best practices. This project aims to expand child access to evidence-based mental health care for the most common psychiatric diagnoses by building a system that addresses barriers to clinician use of evidence-based practices and broadens the potential base of users to other health providers (e.g., primary care) and families for self-help."
"9338249","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There exists a fundamental gap in understanding of the complex interplay of the integrated processes that determine, induce and regulate plasticity in the perceptual systems. This gap represents an important problem because we can only have a fractured understanding of plasticity in the visual system without knowing how different factors contribute to and interact in learning. This limits our ability to effectively translate basic sciece findings of perceptual plasticity into therapies that could help the over 100 million people worldwide who suffer from low vision; deficits in vision due to disease, injury, stroke or aging that have significant negative impacts on all aspects of individuals' lives. The specific objective to fill the knowledge gap and develop a novel therapeutic approach that integrates, and benefits from, multiple perceptual-learning principles, is driven by the hypothesis that integrating perceptual-learning principles into a coordinated approach, will operate through multiple mechanisms to ameliorate a wider range of visual deficits. We formulated this hypothesis based on research showing that stimulus-reinforcement contingencies, multisensory stimulation, stimulation protocols derived from studies of synaptic plasticity, multi-stimulus training, and video games all enhance the magnitude and quality of learning. However, a key limitation of modern perceptual-learning research is the focus on singular mechanisms, which fail to illuminate the coordinated interactions of multiple learning factors in natural set- tings. Our preliminary data show that a video game that integrates multiple approaches dramatically improves basic visual abilities (e.g., acuity and contrast), and generalizes to untrained stimulus sets. The rationale of the proposed research is that integrated approaches will unravel natural learning mechanisms and improve out- comes for the patients afflicted with low vision. In Aim 1, we will examine how perceptual learning approaches interact and determine the most efficacious integrated therapy, and in Aim 2, we will apply that therapy to low vision to understand mechanisms of action of the therapy to disease mechanisms affecting eye-dominance, spatial distortion to the retinal mosaic, and rapid change in aberrations in the eye. We are well prepared to undertake the proposed research because the investigative team combines veteran video game production executives and developers with an optometrist and a neuro-ophthalmologist who have experience treating low- vision populations. Aaron Seitz (PI), who developed many of the principles upon which this novel integrative approach is based, anchors the team. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by integrating multiple principles of perceptual learning. This contribution is significant because the development of effective therapies to treat the brain-based aspect of low vision can lead to life-altering benefits for many millions of people worldwide. Our proposed studies should also catalyze a paradigm shift in the field of vision research, and pave the way for designing efficacious treatments of low vision conditions like amblyopia, age-related macular degeneration and cataracts, in the future."
"9237449","PROJECT SUMMARY In our continued efforts to understand the biology of Influenza A virus (IAV), we have characterized RNA from both the host and virus using next generation sequencing. These efforts led to the discovery of a small virus- derived RNA (svRNA) that was necessary for mediating the viral switch from transcription to replication. Upon characterizing the biology of svRNA, we documented the surprising finding that svRNA synthesis was dependent on the expression of NEP, a minor protein of the virus that slowly accumulates in the cell as a result of inefficient splicing. Together, these two discoveries suggested NEP may be the master regulator of IAV infection. In short, we found that the slow accumulation of NEP provided the virus with a ?timer? to coordinate svRNA production and the subsequent switch from transcription to replication. Furthermore, we, and others, have found that NEP-mediated svRNA synthesis is dependent on its capacity to induce cRNA. Despite determining this function for NEP, how it coordinates this activity remains entirely unknown. Here we seek to understand this activity through three complementary aims. Aim 1 details a strategy to ascertain how NEP interaction with the RNA dependent RNA polymerase influences its activity. Aim 2 seeks to ascertain why NEP is associating with host factors involved in RNA processing. Aim 3 investigates the impact of NEP and its associated proteins on virus pathogenicity and tropism. The experimental strategy comprising these aims will reveal exciting new molecular targets that can be exploited to generate a novel class of antivirals and will significantly increase our understanding of IAV replication."

Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 groups, Usual Care (UC), Social Cognitive Theory-based Group Counseling (SCT), Mobile self-monitoring with tailored feedback and advice (MONITORING), or a combination of SCT plus MONITORING conditions (COMBINED). We will evaluate the intervention arms primarily in terms of weight reduction, urinary sodium excretion, and serum phosphorus. We will explore the impact on physical activity, blood pressure, fasting lipids, medication requirements, and pulse wave velocity. Measurements will occur at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Interaction effects will be examined using a 2-way ANOVA. Statistical modeling of baseline, 6 mos and 12 mos outcomes will be based on logistic generalized linear mixed models (for binary outcomes) linear mixed models (for continuous outcomes), and random effects multinomial models (for outcomes with more than 2 levels, such as changes in medication management). The mediating effect of self-efficacy on the primary outcomes will be evaluated using structural equation models."
"9398334","PROJECT SUMMARY The Midwest Microbial Pathogenesis Conference (MMPC) is a long-standing scientific meeting that engages junior and established investigators studying microbial pathogenesis in the Midwest Region of the United States. The first MMPC convened in 1994 at the University of Iowa and the meeting has subsequently been held annually at alternating academic institutions in the Midwest. Between 250-350 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty participate in this meeting annually. The 24th Annual MMPC is being held at the University of Notre Dame from August 25- 27, 2017. This is the first time MMPC has been hosted at Notre Dame. The MMPC constitutes a major scientific venue that supports the development of the next generation of research scientists with special emphasis upon inclusion of women and researchers from underrepresented minority (URM) populations. In addition to providing an interactive and engaging scientific forum for inves- tigators to present their work and establish collaborations, the MMPC fosters networking between investigators and institutions in the Midwest. Regional accessibility, low cost, and travel/registra- tion support provided for select attendees allows this meeting to attract a diverse group of partic- ipants. In keeping with long tradition, approximately 60% of speakers invited to give oral presen- tations at the 2017 meeting will be Assistant Professors who are often presenting their first formal seminar since establishing their own laboratories. Talks from a smaller number of more estab- lished investigators who recently moved their laboratories to the Midwest are also planned to encourage networking. Five graduate student or postdoctoral fellows chosen based upon merit of their submitted abstracts will also be invited to present their research orally, providing an invalu- able opportunity to showcase their research in a collegial and interactive environment. We pro- pose to select from abstract submissions 10 additional trainees for registration waivers, focusing again on merit and URM status. We will provide registration fee waivers to at least 10 URM and 16 female young scholars local organizations to promote exploration of the field of Microbial Path- ogenesis. This year's MMPC will also include an interactive forum focused on global health and field research, which will be led by a panel of prominent scientists. Thus, the MMPC will be sup- porting a variety of activities that are directly relevant to the missions of the National Institutes of Health."
"9355647","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness and visual morbidity. Because the disease causes irreversible damage to neural tissue it is of upmost importance to identify glaucoma and its progression at the earliest possible stages. Through advancements in the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and other technologies, the long-term goal of this research project is to precisely and accurately detect ocular structural and functional changes associated with glaucoma and to identify eyes with glaucoma that are at risk for future disease progression. This is accomplished by consolidating our long-term data acquired from various generations of OCT technology over the last 19 years. By using innovative methods for image quality improvement along with signal morphing, it is now possible to reliably bridge data acquired by the different generations and manufacturers of OCT, creating the longest-term cohort of longitudinal OCT measurements of the retina and optic nerve head regions. Advanced retinal segmentation software will be applied enabling detailed discrimination of all retinal layers even in the presence of ocular co-morbidity coincident with glaucoma (a previous exclusion criteria), allowing maximal use of subject and patient data. Using this cohort, two methods will be uniquely applied for determining the long-term relationship between structure and function: Continuous-time hidden Markov model and Latent differential equation models. This would enhance understanding of the disease process and allow determination of the best methods to identify disease and its progression at various stages.  We will utilize advanced innovative imaging technologies and methods to accurately and precisely detect evidence of early structural changes: Swept-source OCT, Adaptive-optics OCT and Polarization-sensitive OCT. These technologies will be used to image the retina, sclera and optic nerve head providing enhanced information of the lamina cribrosa and birefringence properties. Scans will be also acquired during and following provocative acute IOP elevation testing to asses the morphological and biomechanical responses as potential markers for current and future disease characterization.  The outcomes of this research project will provide an innovative and enhanced evaluation of ocular structure and function in glaucoma that will expand our understanding of the disease pathophysiology, offer new diagnostic tools for early disease detection and disease progression and identify subjects at risk for rapid glaucoma progression."
"9311039","Project Summary/Abstract  Rett syndrome (RTT), a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder, is largely caused by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene encoding the epigenetic regulator MeCP2. Our group was the first to show a detrimental role of microglial abnormalities in a MECP2 knockout (MECP2-KO) mouse model of RTT. Recent in vivo data suggest that correcting microglial abnormalities is sufficient to rectify major RTT-like symptoms in this model. Therefore, how MeCP2 deficiency causes microglial abnormalities and how the functional states of MeCP2-deficient microglia (RTT-MG) influence RTT pathology is a critical question. Recently we found that MeCP2 deficiency in RTT-MG resulted in enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production, which we hypothesize would lead to metabolic derangements and abnormal microglial functions. Interestingly, in vitro studies showed that several key RTT-MG abnormalities were rescued by mitochondria- targeted transgene mCAT (the antioxidant enzyme catalase being expressed only in mitochondria, which usually do not harbor catalase) and two FDA-approved mitoactive Nrf2 activators, opening a possibility for intervention. Our preliminary data further showed that global expression of mCAT (GL-mCAT) prolonged the lifespan and improved motor and respiratory functions of the MECP2-KO mice, supporting the promise of our approach in a whole animal setting. Here we propose to extend this line of research to gain a deeper understanding of how MeCP2 is related to functional and pathological states of microglia, and to generate preclinical proof of principle that is instrumental for developing novel therapies for RTT: Aim 1: Determine the pathological role of microglial mtROS in vivo: Several lines of evidence support that microglia abnormalities drive the progression of RTT. We have shown that global expression of mCAT ameliorates the RTT-like phenotype in MECP2-KO mice. Based on this encouraging result, we further hypothesize that quenching mtROS selectively in microglia to rectify microglial abnormalities will also ameliorate RTT-like deficits in MECP2-KO mice. For this aim, we will generate and analyze the phenotype and microglial pathology of MECP2-KO/MG-mCAT mice with microglia-targeted expression of mCAT. The result would support the role of microglial mtROS in the pathogenesis of RTT. Aim 2: Determine the role of mtROS in pathological characteristics and functional responsiveness of RTT microglia: Our previous data, mostly in vitro work, support the hypothesis that mtROS-related metabolic/molecular derangements lead to RTT-MG abnormalities including the loss of the ?metabolic flexibility? required to drive their functional responsiveness. Now in this aim we will test this hypothesis in vivo, mainly by analyzing microglia acutely isolated from MECP2-KO and MECP2-KO/mCAT mice. We will determine if mCAT, expressed in vivo, is able to (a) rectify the metabolic/molecular derangements of RTT-MG, and (b) recover the ability of RTT-MG to respond to M1/M2-inducing signals with proper functional differentiation. Key microglial cellular features such as phagocytic function, mitochondrial integrity, aerobic glycolysis, functional polarization, and Nrf2 antioxidation pathway will be analyzed to determine the beneficial effects of mtROS suppression by mCAT. Aim 3: Test the therapeutic effects of two FDA-approved mitoactive/Nrf2 activating drugs in vivo: The success of the mCAT approach provides a rationale for anti-mtROS therapy. To translate this finding to potential therapies, we screened 1,600 FDA-approved drugs to identify mitoactive anti-mtROS compounds, and subsequently screened the hits on a RTT-MG culture platform. We now have two leads able to correct RTT- MG abnormalities in vitro. Interestingly, both are known activators of the Nrf2 antioxidation pathway, supporting our hypothesized pivotal role of Nrf2 in RTT-MG. Because of their known favorable pharmacokinetics/safety profiles, now we will test them in vivo; efficacy shown in this aim would enable rapid translation by re-purposing these FDA-approved drugs for RTT.  In summary, these studies will clarify mechanisms of MeCP2-regulated microglial function, the role of microglial mtROS in RTT, and advance novel therapies for RTT, for which no effective treatment is available. We hope that findings in this proposal would set the foundation to explore several new areas, such as how mtROS and metabolic modules such as aerobic glycolysis mediate or modulate microglial function including M1/M2 differentiation and phagocytosis, and the role of Nrf2 in microglial function. Moreover, RTT is one of few Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) whose cause is identified as a single gene mutation and shares important pathogenic pathways with autism. Our studies, therefore, may implicate novel mechanisms and therapeutic approaches as well for autism where mitochondrial and microglia dysfunction could also play a role."
"9321020","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent emergence of gut microbiota as a novel factor influencing obesity and related metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, very little is known about the role of long-term diet on microbially mediated disease risk. The primary reasons for this lack of understanding are: 1) lack of high quality, long-term diet data in combination with microbiome data; 2) lack of data in populations undergoing rapid changes in environments and outcomes, with enough variability to create a range of exposures; and 3) insufficient use of complex statistical models to allow examination of each piece of the time-dependent, complex system. The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), an NIH-funded study of more than 15,000 individuals followed over 25 years, provides high quality longitudinal data and captures the transition from traditional to Western diet in parallel with urbanization and emergence of obesity and cardiovascular disease during the past two decades. We will use these data to generate insights that would not be obtainable in studies with subjects who consume only a Westernized diet. Using sophisticated statistical models we propose to examine whether information on gut microbiota composition along with data on the plasma metabolome can predict markers of cardiometabolic disease (body mass index, central adiposity, diabetes and inflammation), allowing us to implicate microbiota in disease pathways. We propose to collect fecal samples from 10,000 adult CHNS participants aged 30-65 at the 2015 exam. In a subsample from two neighboring Southern provinces (Guizhou, actively urbanizing, n=500; and Hunan, already urbanized, n=500) varying in current (and long-term change) in Western diet, we will create microbial sequences in the 16S V3-V4 region (n=1,000) and store the remaining (n=9,000) fecal samples. We will select a subsample with 16S data who have consumed a traditional diet over the 25 years (n=400) and conduct plasma metabolomics of the host. In the CHNS subsample with microbiota plus metabolome (n=400) data, we will collect replicate blood and fecal samples in CHNS2017 to derive 16S and plasma metabolomics data to assess two-year changes (2015-2017) in diet, gut microbiota, plasma metabolites and in markers of cardiometabolic disease. We will examine whether gut microbiota and plasma metabolites differ depending upon when, within the 25-year period, diet changes occur, and if they are associated with health outcomes. In our longitudinal subsample we will examine changes in markers of Western diet in relation to concurrent changes in microbial diversity and community composition, and metabolites. We first use a series of standard regression models and then high dimensional regression analysis with variable selection and validation to build predictive models. We capitalize upon an established and well-characterized, large cohort with far greater variability in diet and microbial communities than studies in cohorts on only Western diets. The proposed project will substantially transform current understanding of the intersection of diet, gut microbiota, host metabolism and cardiometabolic disease."
"9330772","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         With more than one million Americans affected, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), consisting of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, causes significant morbidity and can progress to colon cancer. While multiple predisposing factors have been identified, the cause or trigger for IBD remains unknown. Current treatment regimens for IBD are selected from an assortment of immunosuppressive agents, which can be complicated by multiple side effects and expense. In the search for new therapeutic options, including studies in vitro, in mouse models, and in a prospectively collected cohort of adult patients with UC, our human serum profiling data indicate that eotaxin-1 may be a biomarker of disease activity in UC. Eotaxin-1 (CCL11) is a chemoattractant for eosinophils. When the cytokine and chemokine profiles in this cohort of 40 controls and 137 UC patients were defined, there were 13 tissue cytokines and chemokines that were significantly elevated in the UC versus control patients, but out of a panel of 42 analytes, there were only 3 that were elevated in the serum: eotaxin-1, G-CSF, and GM-CSF. Of these, eotaxin-1 was the only analyte increased in both serum and tissue at all levels of disease severity. Increased eotaxin-1 has been shown in pediatric UC tissues, and has been linked to eosinophilic inflammation, but has not been previously investigated in a large, prospective adult UC cohort. Due to the novelty of this observation, studies of the role of eotaxin-1 in mouse models of colitis and colitis-associated carcinogenesis are the focus of this proposal. Along with the increased serum and tissue eotaxin-1, there is a significant increase in colonic tissue eosinophils in UC patients versus controls, and eosinophil counts correlated with tissue eotaxin-1 levels. Eotaxin-1 has been shown to be increased in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis by my collaborator, and we now show for the first time that eotaxin-1 is upregulated in: 1) Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis tissues; 2) T cell transfer-induced colitis tissues; 3) tumor induced in the azoxymethane (AOM)-DSS model of colitis-associated carcinogenesis; and 4) macrophages or colonic epithelial cells activated with C. rodentium. However, eotaxin-1 is not increased in mouse Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis tissues, indicating that this is not a non specific component of inflammation. Hypothesis: Eotaxin-1 is a key mediator of colitis and colitis-associated carcinogenesis via effects on macrophages and epithelial cells. The Specific Aims for this project are: 1. To determine the role of eotaxin-1 in the modulation of experimental colitis. We will utilize the C. rodentium infection model of colitis that involves immune activatio and the T cell transfer model of colitis that involves immune activation and epithelial damage. We will compare wild-type (WT) and eotaxin1-/- mice in the C. rodentium model, as well as eotaxin1+/+Rag2-/- and eotaxin1-/-Rag2-/- mice, with and without adoptive transfer of CD4+CD45RBhi effector T cells in the T cell transfer model. In each model of colitis the following will be assessed: clinical parameters, the colonic and systemic innate immune response focusing on macrophage phenotype and function, as well as epithelial function. 2. To determine the role of eotaxin-1 in the modulation of chronic colitis and colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC). Our preliminary data shows for the first time that colitis-associated tumors in the AOM-DSS model have increased eotaxin-1 levels. We will utilize the AOM-DSS model in WT and eotaxin1-/- mice to establish whether modification of the inflammatory response caused by deletion of eotaxin-1 can decrease the risk for CAC. In both chronic colitis (mice treated with multiple cycles of DSS) and colitis-associated tumorigenesis (mice treated with AOM followed by multiple cycles of DSS) the following will be assessed: clinical parameters including tumor size and multiplicity, colonic and systemic innate immune responses focusing on macrophage phenotype and function, as well as epithelial function, including in tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into the role of eotaxin-1 in IBD and associated carcinogenesis."

"9320763","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with chronic medical conditions are at risk of compromised bone strength and increased fracture susceptibility. Recently developed reference data have enabled clinicians to identify children 5 to 20 y with compromised bone mineral status (low bone density for age) and optimize their medical care. A glaring deficit is the inability to evaluate bone health of young children < 5 y due to lack of appropriate bone density reference data, although numerous clinical conditions (e.g., prematurity, gastrointestinal and neuromuscular disorders) threaten bone health in this young age range.  Early childhood differs from other developmental stages. In older children, the need to account for growth status and lean mass when interpreting bone measurements has been demonstrated, but in early childhood, these effects are unknown. Pronounced changes in gross motor skills, locomotion and physical activity also occur in early childhood. Mechanical loads on the growing skeleton promote bone mineral accrual. Understanding the impact of growth, body composition, motor skill development, and physical activity on bone accrual in young children is critical for interpretation of a clinical bone mineral status measurement. These characteristics are often affected in young children with chronic medical conditions.  The long-term goal of this study is to optimize bone health of young children. The objectives of this longitudinal study are to develop regional and total body bone mineral content (BMC) and density (aBMD) reference data for children ages 1-5 y to aid identification of young children with bone deficits, and identify factor that influence bone accrual in this age group. The aims of this longitudinal study are: (1) test fo sex and ancestry differences in BMC and aBMD at multiple skeletal sites in healthy children ages 1 to 5 y, and create appropriate reference curves; (2) assess the influence of growth and body composition, and (3) gross motor skills and physical activity on bone mineral status and bone mineral accrual, and (4) determine the degree of tracking of bone status in young children. Hypotheses to be tested are: males will have greater BMC and aBMD than females; Blacks will have greater BMC and aBMD than non-blacks; bone mineral status and bone accrual will be greater in children with greater growth status and more lean tissue, more advanced gross motor skills, and higher physical activity levels; and BMC and aBMD z-scores will be positively correlated over 3 y. The study is unique since no previous studies have addressed these issues in children 1-5 y. It is clinically relevant as findings will facilitate medcal care of children with chronic medical conditions that threaten bone health, and it will develop and validate novel methods for bone and body composition assessment in this age range. It will also add generalizable knowledge to enhance understanding of the growing skeleton, and its relationship to motor and somatic development. Since poor bone mineral accrual can have lifelong consequences, this study addresses the major public health concern of osteoporosis."
"9351493","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AKI is defined as a reduction in kidney function of abrupt onset that is characterized by a fall in glomerular filtration rate usually detected by a corresponding rise in serum creatinine. AKI is among the strongest risks for increased morbidity and mortality observed in acutely ill, hospitalized patients, and may also be an important risk factor for development and progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease. While AKI has long been known to be associated with high short term morbidity and mortality, it has traditionally been thought to be a self-limited disease process, with no long term clinical sequelae in survivors. This view has been dramatically altered in recent years, as accumulating data strongly suggests that survivors of AKI are at enhanced risk of developing progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) with associated risk of further progression to end stage renal disease. Moreover, both AKI and CKD may be independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease events. Though short-term consequences have been extensively studied, there have been no studies prospectively examining long-term outcomes in survivors of AKI relative to at-risk controls. There is a great need for rigorous prospective assessment of the natural history of AKI with careful longitudinal follow up and with robust biosample collection to further inform disease mechanisms. In response to these concerns, in 2008, the NIDDK initiated the prospective Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae of Acute Kidney Injury (ASSESS-AKI) Study to enroll hospitalized adults and children with and without AKI. The overarching goals of ASSESS-AKI are to delineate the natural history of AKI, the impact of varying severity of AKI on renal, cardiovascular and other clinical and patient-centered outcomes, as well as to identify predictors of adverse events after an episode of AKI. There is also a need for new molecular and genetic markers of risk for poor outcomes in AKI to identify patients who might benefit from more aggressive care or new therapies and to elucidate the underlying pathologic mechanisms responsible for this progression. This renewal application proposes to continue the University of Washington (UW) site as part of the ASSESS-AKI Consortium, to add new measurements of biomarkers relevant to key ASSESS-AKI outcomes, and to enhance planned genetic analyses. We have established a multidisciplinary investigative team with expertise in acute kidney injury, critical care medicine, bioinformatics, and techniques for genetic analysis. The UW site participation is a unique resource of great utility for the ASSESS-AKI Consortium."
"9360110","A central goal of neuroscience is to understand how learning is implemented by the nervous system. However, despite years of studies in animals and humans, our understanding of both the computational basis of learning and its implementation by the brain is still rudimentary. A critical gap therefore exists between the large amount of behavioral and neural data that has been collected during learning and a mathematical and biological understanding of the rules governing motor plasticity. This proposal will develop a unified mathematical theory for understanding how the brain learns complex skills. The theoretical framework will be implemented in software and will be applicable to and validated on a wide variety of sensorimotor data. The primary experimental validation system will be songbirds, which provide a physiologically accessible model system to investigate sensorimotor learning. Our objective in the songbird system is to understand sensorimotor learning of a single acoustic parameter ? fundamental frequency (pitch) ? which is known to be precisely regulated by the songbird brain. Our central hypothesis is that learning is implemented as a Bayesian inference, and that the stochastic sampling of motor commands from the current Bayesian a priori distribution of outputs is coordinated by a network of neurons in the forebrain. Drawing on a large quantity of both theoretical and experimental results, two specific aims will test this hypothesis. The first aim will introduce an innovative new class of computational model in which the brain uses an iterative process of Bayesian inference to reshape behavior in response to sensory feedback. The models will be validated using population-averaged animal behavior. The second aim will analyze data recorded from individual animals and single neurons in behaving animals to identify the biological mechanisms underlying sensorimotor learning. Throughout, we will design, test, and make public software that will allow other members of the community to apply our novel tools to their own data. Our approach is innovative because it will provide a unified framework for understanding the results of a wide variety of behavioral and neural studies across both tasks and species. These studies are significant because a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying sensorimotor learning could aid in the design of rehabilitative strategies that exploit the plasticity of complex behavior."

Of its 9 sub-districts (talukas/blocks) and 618 villages, 60 villages will be selected and randomized to the intervention, and 60 villages will be randomized to the control condition. The intervention group will receive the integrated suicide prevention intervention (implementation in schools in selected villages, community storage facilities in selected villages, and community health worker gatekeeper training in selected villages). We will compare outcomes (suicide rates, suicide attempts and suicide ideation) in villages that receive an intensive, integrated suicide prevention program to comparable control villages, stratified for demographic variables in order to keep the villages in both conditions comparable within the same district who are only exposed to ?usual care? as delivered by the existing primary and secondary health care system."
"9381688","Abstract  Carbenes are valuable reactive intermediates in organic synthesis capable of selectively targeting non- polar ?-systems and element?hydrogen bonds in the presence of common polar functional groups. The advent of transition metal catalysis has greatly expanded the utility of carbene transfer reactions, tempering the reactivity of free carbenes and enabling high levels of chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity to be achieved under catalyst control. Current methods for catalytic carbene transfer have predominately relied on the extrusion of N2 from diazoalkanes as a central strategy for generating metal carbenoid intermediates. Despite the synthetic utility of these approaches, many state-of-the-art methods are restricted to a relatively narrow scope of diazoacetates, and their derivatives, due to the requirement for stabilizing electron-withdrawing substituents. The overarching goal of this proposed research program is to design a new class of reductive carbene transfer reactions that use readily available and indefinitely stable 1,1-dichloroalkanes as carbene precursors. The primary impact of this work will be to enable catalytic transfer reactions of non-stabilized carbene equivalents, providing direct access to novel synthetic building blocks and facilitating challenging bond constructions.  Our central hypothesis is that the elementary steps of transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions can be re-purposed to enable carbene-type reactivity. Specifically, the oxidative addition of a 1,1-dihaloalkane at a low-valent nickel catalyst is proposed to generate catalyst-bound carbenoid equivalents that can be used in broad range of transformations. Under this general catalytic manifold, we will pursue reductive cyclopropanations, methylene cyclopropanations, multicomponent cycloadditions, cyclooligomerization reactions, C(sp2)?H bonds insertion reactions, and heteroatom?H insertion reactions. In tandem with the development of synthetic methods, mechanistic studies will be conducted to highlight the unique properties of nickel-bound carbenoids. Collectively, the methods described in this proposal will enable the synthesis of novel biologically active compounds by providing rapid access to privileged substructures."

The COC will manage the existing library of 8000+ extracts and continue to acquire new extracts via collections, while efficiently distributing these to collaborators for screening in assays relevant to the U.S., low and middle-income countries (LMICs), and the island nations of the South Pacific. Assays will target the following disease areas: i) infectious disease, ii) neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) iii) cancer, and iv) neurodegenerative, CNS, and psychoactive disorders. Hit prioritization will be evaluated via potency, bioactivity spectrum, cytotoxicity and chemical novelty based on LC-MS de-replication, genomic and taxonomic novelty emphasizing understudied species and ecotypes, and chemical ecology data. Our industrial partners Cubist Pharmaceuticals and Eisai Inc. will also assist with prioritization based on issues of efficacy, mode of action, and medicinal chemistry properties. The COC will also coordinate legal agreements, contracts, and permits required for domestic and international research activities and oversee the safe transfer of extracts, fractions or bulk samples from the CDDC in Fiji to the COC in Atlanta, as well as coordinate collecting trips to Fiji and the Solomon Islands in collaboration with the CDDC.  The COC has considerable experience with the above issues. To date, its personnel have organized 8,496 extracts that have been screened in a variety of cell and molecular target-based assays to produce 221,805 assay results that have thus far lead to the identification of 121 bioactive natural products, including 48 novel compounds from marine algae, 7 from marine-invertebrates, and 33 from microbes."
"9323803","Project Summary/Abstract  Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) inhibits HIV replication and decreases morbidity and mortality, it does not cure. Interruption of ART is routinely followed by viral rebound springing from a small but durable reservoir of latently infected, long lived, memory CD4 T cells. New chemical-, immune- and gene-and cell- based therapies are now being developed that will be aimed at eradicating this reservoir (difficult to achieve) or reducing its size and boosting boosting antiviral immunity sufficiently that ART can be safely stopped without high level viral rebound (functional cure). The search for curative therapies would be greatly facilitated by the availability of a set of robust biomarkers that can accurately predict whether a specific therapeutic is effective or not. Such biomarkers could help ensure that only the most promising candidates advance to analytic treatment interruption??the current gold standard for clinical testing of cure therapeutics. ATI studies need to be minimized because they are inherently costly, logistically challenging and create potential risks for patients during viral rebound. These biomarkers might also provide key insight into what biological processes are most promising for attacking the reservoir and achieving the desired delay in time to rebound. We hypothesize that highly robust virus-specific and host?specific biomarkers can be identified in blood that accurately predict the duration of viral remission after treatment interruption as well as impending viral rebound.  To pursue identification of both virus- and host-directed biomarkers, blood samples from 125 HIV infected subjects (both treated during acute and chronic infection) obtained before ATI and after viral rebound will be analyzed by three different approaches: (1) Resting blood CD4 T cells will be tested with a novel digital droplet PCR assay (IPDA) that selectively detects intact proviral DNA in the reservoir??these intact viruses represent the key small fraction of the proviruses in the reservoir that are replication competent and thus able to drive viral rebound. Low IPDA results prior to ATI could be associated with long times to viral rebound; this assay can be performed in 6 hours and only requires the equivalent of a 20 ml blood draw; (2) RNA from both CD4 T and non-CD4 T cells will be subjected to RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq analyses to identify patterns of gene expression associated with markedly delayed or accelerated times to viral rebound and (3) Measurement of pyroptotic inflammatory markers in cells and plasma as biomarkers predicting rapid loss of viral control or impending viral rebound during ATI. The complex data sets generated by RNA-Seq will analyzed with the help of the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics core. This project will also closely interface with both Projects 1 and 2 where complementary approaches will be pursued searching for biomarkers in blood cells and in plasma or circulating extracellular vesicles. By careful execution of this comprehensive virus- and host-directed search, our project team should be strongly positioned to discover a robust set of new biomarkers that could truly galvanize future HIV cure research."

The development of these  enteroids has provided an exciting opportunity to advance our understanding of how pathogenic  as well as beneficial microorganisms, many of which can prevent or lessen the severity of  pathogen-induced diarrheal illness, interact with and induce responses from the intestinal  epithelium. Therefore, the long range objectives of the Human Enteroid Core are to (1)  characterize and compare human enteroids generated from three regions of the small intestine  (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and colon, from different patients to establish their use as models  of human diarrheal diseases, (2) test new approaches to improve the enteroids as a relevant  model of normal intestinal epithelium, and (3) to provide these enteroids and specialized growth  reagents for use in the other projects (Core C, Projects 1, 2, and 3) proposed in this application.  The goal of the Human Enteroid Core is to provide a centralized facility to meet the enteroid  needs of all of the investigators involved in the NAMSED proposal. The specific functions of the  Core will have two functions: a Service component, which will (1) Produce enteroid cultures  from our existing bank for all projects (2) Establish enteroids from select new patient samples  (3) Maintain frozen stocks of all enteroids (4) Passage and differentiate enteroids per requests  (5) Maintain WNT, noggin, and r-spondin producing cells lines and standardized conditioned  media for enteroid culture (6) Routinely test the enteroid lines for differentiation status (7)  Technology transfer through training group members; a Development component, which will (1)  Develop and standardize physiological measures as indicators of enteroid responses (2) Modify  enteroids to enhance or deplete the presence of specific cell types or genes (3) Co-culture with  mesenchymal cells to test for substitution of growth factors and develop novel structural  components (e.g., inversion of the enteroids such that the apical surface faces outward) (4)  Incorporate immune cells to improve the relevance of the enteroid model. The Core will be  responsive to needs of the individual Projects, which may change as the research projects  proceed, as the overall field evolves and as new platforms are engineered in Project 3. New  activities will be developed to meet the needs of our and other NASMED project investigators.  Our goal is complementary and collaborative in these exciting efforts to develop the enteroids  as models to study enteric disease."
"9324999","MOUSE METABOLIC PHENOTYPING CENTER (MMPC)  AT THE  UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS (UCD) ABSTRACT (OVERALL) This application from the University of California Davis (UCD) seeks base funding to continue operations of its Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center (MMPC) and to expands its gut microbiome research and development program. The mission of the MMPC-UCD is to advance medical and biological research by providing the research community with standardized, high quality metabolic and physiologic phenotyping services to validate and characterize mouse models of diabetes, diabetic complications, obesity and related metabolic disorders. Our Center is made up of an Administrative Core, an Animal Care Core, and 3 Phenotyping Cores: Endocrinology and Metabolism Core, Body Composition, Thermoregulation, and Food Intake Behavior Core, and Complications and Pathology Core. Over the last 5 years, our Center has provided over 27,500 services to more than 90 clients resulting in 53 publications and program income of over $700,000 that has been reinvested into the Center to expand and enhance service offerings to clients. In this renewal, our Center intends to extend and leverage past successes (e.g, bariatric surgery models, microbiome characterization, analysis of cognitive decline, dietary manipulation of body composition, etc) to continue to focus on clinically relevant and translatable mouse models. In response to input from the research community, we seek to provide phenotyping tests that will contribute to new, precision-guided paradigms of disease diagnosis and therapy. Our Center will offer services to measure physiologic parameters (e.g., cognition and brain metabolism), assess environmental influences (e.g., host-gut microbiome interactions), and determine the impact of mitigating factors (e.g., exercise) in client's mice or in mouse models we make for clients. Our overall goal is to conduct resource-related research, develop and transform technologies into new services, and train the next generation of researchers using mutant mouse models for the study of diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic disorders. To achieve these goals, we will 1) provide users with validated and high quality fee-for- service tests, and to develop important new tests in endocrinology, metabolism, body composition, thermoregulation, cardiovascular disease, cognition, and exercise; 2) establish a Microbiome Research and Development Program incorporating projects that uncover the role of the microbiome in host metabolism, physiology and function, define the impact of the microbiome on disease prevention and pathology, and explore interactions between the microbiome and its metabolites; and 3) raise awareness among current and new users of the availability, accessibility, and usefulness of products and services unique to UCD, especially surgical models, phenotyping procedures, and de novo mouse models, and training in research tools to investigate mechanisms of metabolic disease. Achieving these goals will translate research in mice that advances the understanding of diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic disorders to improve diagnostics, therapeutics, and prevention strategies in humans."
"9334280","Overall Project Summary Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (H/I) remains a major health issue with limited therapeutic approaches. The life long consequences to both infant and caregivers demands we increase our knowledge regarding the origins, consequences and prevention of brain damage around the time of birth. Clinical evidence increasingly points to the cerebellum as a region that is profoundly but more diffusely impacted by neonatal H/I and this damage reverberates as additional damage ensues to the regions with which it shares reciprocal connections. Yet the cerebellum has been largely ignored in preclinical models of neonatal H/I. This proposal models H/I in the term human infant, a time of heightened sensitivity for the cerebellum. Insults that occur during narrow sensitive periods can have enduring effects by derailing dynamic developmental processes that can never be reset. Often neonatal H/I is compounded by earlier, and perhaps undetected, neuroinflammation. Thus we propose to conduct an in-depth first-of-its-kind analysis of the developing cerebellum after neonatal H/I with and without prior inflammation. We attack the question with three Specific Aims. SA1: Develop an animal model of term H/I with and without prior inflammation that has construct validity for clinical evidence of cerebellar damage in newborns. SA2: Integrate neuroanatomical, metabolic, signal transduction and behavioral endpoints relevant to cerebellar damage in this animal model. SA3: Test the neuroprotective effects of agents that inhibit neuroinflammation, restore metabolism and/or prevent dysregulated signal transduction and thereby create a preclinical foundation for translation in the immediate future. These aims will be achieved via four independent projects and synergy assured by provision of animals, histology and behavioral testing from the Animal and Behavioral Core (Core B). Each project is headed by an expert PI. Project I (McCarthy) - microglia as the brain's innate immune system and their role in normal cerebellar development and impact on damage, Project II (McKenna) - metabolism and its response to and role in damage, and Project III (Bearer) - lipid rafts as essential signaling elements disrupted by H/I and inflammation. Project IV (Waddell), an R03 pilot project, explores the novel use of eye blink conditioning, a well known cerebellar controlled learning paradigm, to assess the cognitive impact of neonatal H/I. Microglia both respond to and produce inflammation which can, if not arrested, become a run away and enduring pathological response. Metabolism and energy use is an important determinant of damage following H/I, with high energy areas at greater risk, including the cerebellum. Use of MALDI-MSI imaging will provide detailed high resolution relevant to lipids, neurotransmitters, oxidative stress and metabolism. Lipid rafts are critical components of neural development yet they have been largely unexplored in the context of H/I. All experiments include equal numbers of males and females. Together these projects will highlight new therapeutic targets that can be easily implemented in current clinical practice."
"9324264","CORE A SUMMARY The broad objective of the Animal Resources Core (Core A) is to enable the goals of the Program by providing the four Projects with the mice, DNA, and sperm samples necessary to successfully complete their aims. The Core will achieve this goal through several specific aims: 1) Breed and disseminate to Project A the mice used for determining the allele specificity of PRDMS by genetic crossing over; 2) Provide knock-in animals for determining allele specificity of double strand break formation in Project A; 3) Provide knock-in mice to Projects B, C, D for all of their measurements; 4) Carry out crosses to generate mice for Project A for studies of allelic preference; 5) Generate and provide mutant mice with impaired KRAB and SET domains to Project D; and 6) Provide mice to the Cell Biology Core (Core B) for preparations of germ cells from knock-in and mutant strains.

"9360051",". ABSTRACT As all Center components will use genetically engineered mice, a central Animal Breeding Core (AB-Core) will be used to meet the animal needs of all Center Projects and Pilots and provide cost-effective, uniformly bred and monitored use of CSORDA animals. Additionally, the Core is a resource, particularly for mice which are mutant in opioid-genes, for providing animals for Pilots and research outside of CSORDA at UCLA, as well as many other institutions. The AB-Core was established in 2006 and developed a set of standardized procedures to accomplish this goal. The functions of the AB-Core are as follows: 1. The AB-Core will coordinate with each Project, Pilot and the TA-Core to provide the required cohorts of  male and female mice as needed. Planning, prioritization and sharing of animal breeding will be an  agenda item at Steering Committee meetings. 2. The AB-Core will maintain each line under optimal breeding management practices. 3. Since multiple CSORDA research components utilize cross-bred lines, the AB-Core will ensure all lines  are correctly maintained as congenic on the C57BL/6J background. 4. The AB-Core will follow the correct breeding strategies to ensure wild-type and mutant mice are bred as littermates. 5. The AB-Core will verify that correct patterns of expression are achieved following cre-mediated deletion  in both males and females. 6. The AB-Core will coordinate mouse sharing, with a major role of the transfer of breeding pairs between  CSORDA performance sites at UCLA and Dr. Kieffer at the Douglas Institute in Montreal."
"9326340","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this research program is to determine whether kappa opioid receptor antagonists have the potential to be developed as rapidly acting antidepressants. There is a clear medical need for new drugs that would expand the options for treating comorbid depression and anxiety, especially for the substantial number of patients refractory to current medications. Kappa opioid receptors and their endogenous ligand dynorphin are thought to be involved in the production of dysphoria and depression accompanying exposure to stress. Kappa opioid receptor antagonists can produce antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in animal models, but the pharmacological profile of existing compounds make them unsuitable for clinical development. The proposed studies would evaluate the effects of two novel kappa opioid receptors, LY2456302 and LY2444295, as potential antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs using animal behavior tests. Studies will determine whether the kappa opioid receptor antagonists produce their effects more rapidly than established antidepressants and similar to ketamine on tests such as the forced swim test, novelty-induced hypophagia and on acutely reversing the effects of chronic mild stress on anhedonia and anxiety. The mechanism of action of kappa opioid receptor antagonists will be confirmed using mice with constitutive deletion of kappa opioid receptors. Additional studies will identify the neural circuitry involved in producing these behavioral effects. Taken together, these experiments will strengthen a basic foundation for considering the development of a novel kappa opioid receptor antagonists as rapid acting antidepressants for eventual therapy in treatment-resistant depression."
"9376631","Project Summary Sickle cell disease is a progressive vasculopathy stemming from decreased red blood cell (RBC) deformability. Vascular disease is at the heart of both acute and chronic sickle disease, including pain crisis, acute chest syndrome, stroke, skin ulcers, and pulmonary hypertension. However, the mechanisms linking decreased RBC deformability to chronic vasculopathy are multifactorial and poorly characterized. Nitric oxide (NO) is the key mediator linking blood mechanics to vessel tone and vascular remodeling. NO bioavailability is diminished in SCD because decellularized hemoglobin and arginase, released during hemolysis, scavenge NO and lower endothelial NO production. Recent evidence suggests that 50% of bioavailable NO is synthesized within RBC, themselves, through a shear-activated eNOS enzyme. RBC NO is primarily converted to nitrite and nitrosylated hemoglobins when tissue oxygenation is high, but deoxygenated hemoglobin converts these species to nitric oxide under hypoxic conditions. Thus, RBC generated NO appears to be a vital mediator of oxygen supply and demand and its role in sickle cell vasculopathy is unexplored. Early results from our lab suggest that tissue oxygenation is dependent on RBC deformability at high shear. Deformation of healthy and SCD RBC increases NO production to a similar degree, while basal NO production is higher in SCD RBC. With the addition of nitrite to fully oxygenated SCD RBC basal production of NO is increased whereas it did not change in healthy RBC. Our overall goal is to demonstrate that nitrite and NOS contribute to RBC NO production, which in turn plays a significant role in the vascular health of normal healthy subjects and patients with sickle cell disease, a human model of diffuse vasculopathy. This research proposal leverages our current work in sickle cell disease vascular function assessment and novel laboratory methods in RBC nitric oxide production. Multimodal characterization of the different vascular beds will lead to improved phenotypic categorization and pathophysiological links to the underlying RBC biophysical/biochemical derangements. We continue to explore whether RBC-generated NO has the ability to decreases platelet aggregation. The studies proposed in Aim I and II will separate the effect of basal and shear-mediated NO production allowing us to determine control mechanisms in healthy and SCD patients. We know that a paradox exists whereby tissue oxygenation is low in non-transfused SCD subjects, while microcirculatory flow is increased. This may be due to changes in nitric oxide production due to nitrite reduction from hemoglobin S deoxygenation, shear-mediated changes in NO production or both. Our overall design, which performs Aims I/II simultaneously with studies in Aim III, should resolve this paradox. The K23 mechanism represents the natural extension my career development to date, combining my previous laboratory and patient-oriented research expertise with the specific clinical research training necessary to conduct large translational studies of novel targets in vascular dysfunction."
"9309117","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are at least nine inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) domain in the respective disease proteins, including Huntington's disease (HD) and several spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) disorders. Although all polyQ disease proteins are expressed throughout the brain and body, they selectively affect neurons and a few other types of cells in an age-dependent manner. In addition, different polyQ lengths cause different symptoms in juvenile and adult patients, indicating that polyQ repeats can induce cell-type specific and age-dependent pathology. Understanding how the expanded polyQ-containing proteins mediate the selective pathology is critical if we are to develop effective therapeutic strategies for treating these polyQ diseases.  Although we know that protein context modulates the toxicity of polyQ expansion seen in polyQ diseases, the mechanism behind the repeat length dependent selective pathology remains unknown Protein context confers the selectivity of polyQ toxicity because it determines protein-protein interactions, half-life and stability, and subcellular localization. However, the length of polyQ also can modulate the selectivity of polyQ protein toxicity. The strong evidence is that in HD, polyQ repeats larger than 60 glutamines cause juvenile cases that show symptoms different from those in adult HD patients. Similarly, expansion of the polyQ tract (>42 glutamines) in TBP induces clinical symptoms in SCA17 patients. However, when polyQ repeats are more than 63Q, mutant TBP causes juvenile-onset SCA-17 cases with retarded growth, progressive clinical symptoms, and early death as well as marked muscle weakness, which are different from those in adult-onset SCA17 patients.  We hypothesize that polyQ repeat length determines differential pathology via its effect on protein interactions in cell- or tissue-dependet manner. To test this hypothesis, we will use SCA17 mice that express mutant TBP containing different polyQ repeats in neuronal or muscles cells. SCA-17 is an excellent model for us to investigate the mechanism behind the differential pathology in polyQ disease as the function of TBP is well characterized. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will characterize the cell type-dependent pathology in SCA17 knock-in mice. In Aim 2 we will use SCA17 knock-in mice and AAV vectors expressing TBP containing different polyQ repeats to investigate polyQ repeat length-dependent pathology in neuronal and muscle cells. In Aim 3 we will explore the mechanisms underlying specific effects of polyQ lengths by examining the effects of different polyQ repeat lengths on the interactions of mutant TBP with transcription factors in neuronal and muscle cells. These studies will provide new insight into the differential pathology and phenotypes caused by different polyQ repeat lengths in juvenile and adult polyQ diseases."
"9320513","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project has two objectives which will be implemented in three African countries (Uganda, DRC, and Ethiopia) which are endemic for onchocerciasis. The proposed project for Objective 1 will seek to measure the impact of    onchocerciasis control and elimination programs. More specifically we seek to evaluate the    evolution of biomarkers of onchocercial infection as mass drug administration (MDA) progresses,    and to evaluate the performance of diagnostic tools for onchocercial infection in areas that are    approaching the interruption of transmission. Recruitment of respondents into the study will be via convenience sampling. For Objective 1 we seek to recruit 1,500 participants, and for the second objective, 3000 participants, in conformance with the instructions in the request for proposals. Participants will be subjected to physical, oral and serologic examinations. Information generated from collected data will serve to inform policy makers so as to effectively promote and strengthen NTD elimination efforts. The project for Objective 2 seeks to measure the impact of onchocerciasis control and elimination programs using mass drug administration (MDA) on coendemic lymphatic filariasis (LF). More specifically the project seeks to develop a standardized protocol to evaluate the status of LF in the areas of onchocerciasis and LF overlap; evaluate the impact of mass drug administration of ivermectin for the control of onchocerciasis on reducing the prevalence and transmission of lymphatic filariasis (LF); and in LF implementation units (district), compare prevalence of LF between communities that have received ivermectin MDA with those that have not received it. Recruitment of respondents into the study will be via convenience sampling in the selected implementation units. Physical, oral and serologic and microscopic examinations will be performed on respondents. Information generated from collected data will serve to inform policy makers so as to effectively promote and strengthen NTD elimination efforts, with a possibility of calling for integration of onchocerciasis and LF."
"9318523","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translation efforts based upon the successful Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) have shown that this behavioral lifestyle intervention model is effective in a variety of diverse community settings. Despite the fact that physical activity isa key part of the DPP lifestyle intervention as one of the two intervention goals, activity change in the DPP, and/or the resulting translation studies modeled after it, has never been verified with an accurate objective measure. In addition, previous research has shown that, in many subgroups of the general population, moderate/vigorous (moderate+) physical activity is non-existent. These same individuals may have a difficult time increasing their levels of moderate+ intensity physical activity due to either limited function or lack of motivation. For these individuals, interventions attempting to increase planned bouts of moderate+ intensity activity may not be as effective or as beneficial as trying to decrease time spent sitting. The goal of this proposal is to understand the impact of movement, specifically physical activity and sitting time, in community lifestyle intervention efforts. Aim #1 addresses an important remaining gap in the prevention literature; does objectively measured activity improve as a result of the existing intervention that is being used in DPP-based translation efforts and does this change in activity have an impact on weight change? Aim #2 examines the impact of replacing the conventional physical activity goal of increasing planned and relatively brief bouts of moderate+ physical activity with one focusing on decreasing sedentary time within the framework of a successful translation lifestyle intervention adapted from the DPP, the Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program. The study design is a prospective, six month delayed-control intervention in which 321 subjects (age 50 and older with a BMI of e24 kg/m2 and with prediabetes and/or metabolic syndrome) will be recruited from community centers and randomly assigned to one of three groups: the standard GLB program which includes the conventional moderate+ activity goal (GLB-MOD), the GLB program with a focus on decreasing sedentary behavior (GLB-SED), or delayed intervention. Subjects assigned to GLB-MOD and GLB-SED will each be compared at 6 months to the delayed-control group after which time, the delayed group will be randomly assigned to either GLB-MOD or GLB-SED. Participants will complete baseline, 6, and 12 month assessment visits. Change in weight, objectively measured activity, and time spent sedentary are the primary outcomes with secondary outcomes including change in self-reported physical activity, HbA1c, fasting glucose, lipids, blood pressure, waist circumference, quality of life and physical function. It is hypothesized that physical activity assessed by accelerometry in GLB-MOD will significantly increase (mostly moderate intense activity) and that there will be a significant decrease in weight, which will partly be related to change in activity levels. The 2nd hypothesis is that the GLB-SED intervention will significantly decrease time spent sitting as measured by accelerometry and that this change will also be related to a significant decrease in weight. The information that will be gained from this entire effort is important, innovative, and wll allow us to obtain a complete and accurate understanding of both ends of the physical activity/inactivity spectrum and their impact in community prevention intervention programs. If shown to be effective, the innovative, modified sedentary-focused translation intervention program would provide a valuable future translation option."
"9301788","Research in my laboratory has made critical findings related to the molecular, cellular, and genetic basis of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), a complex and poorly understood hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) failure syndrome. The complexity and heterogeneity of MDS, and the lack of mouse models, remain as major obstacles to understanding and effectively treating this disease. Overexpression of immune-related genes is widely reported in MDS, and chronic innate immune pathway activation, primarily via Toll-like receptors (TLRs), increases the risk of developing MDS. Multiple independent mechanisms contribute to hyperactivation of TLR signaling in MDS, which converge on the central complex involving IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6. Based on our published and preliminary data, IRAK1 and IRAK4 (IRAK1/4), a dual kinase complex is activated in MDS patients. Moreover, the importance of the IRAK1/4-TRAF6 complex in primary MDS comes from our recent observation that describes genetic and pharmacologic approaches to inhibit IRAK1/4 as effective agents to suppress TRAF6 and the MDS clone. Collectively, these molecular and genetic alterations clearly implicate IRAK1/4-TRAF6 signaling as a pathogenic driver and druggable complex in MDS. Therefore, we hypothesize that small molecule dual inhibitors of IRAK1 and IRAK4 will suppress MDS-propagating cells. We derived a novel chemical series of potent dual IRAK1/4 inhibitors. The lead compound shows potent inhibition of IRAK1 and IRAK4 in MDS, efficacy at suppressing MDS cell viability and function in vitro, and promising pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties in vivo. As such, the objective of this proposal is to optimize and evaluate our candidate dual IRAK1/4 inhibitors in human MDS cells in vitro (Aim 1), and in mouse and human MDS models in vivo (Aim 2). The specific aims will provide necessary preclinical information on the therapeutic potential of rationally designed dual IRAK1/4 inhibitors for future human MDS trials."
"9354250","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases of the glomerulus, the filtering unit of the kidney, account for over 60% of all cases of end-stage renal disease, which represents a major health problem worldwide. Among them are Goodpasture's (GP) disease, Alport syndrome and diabetic nephropathy that damage the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) through pathogenic mechanisms involving collagen IV scaffolds. This proposal focuses on the collagen IV scaffolds with the overall goal to gain a deeper insight into fundamental mechanisms of molecular recognition, at the atomic level, that underlie normal assembly, function and dysfunction of the scaffolds. Our recent discoveries reveal a GP autoantigen complex that plays a central role in GBM function and in the pathogenesis in GP and Alport diseases. This complex now serves as the cornerstone for four Specific Aims that target an understanding of the chemistry and pathology of each component. The knowledge gained will provide a framework for development of new forms of therapy. Aim 1: To determine the molecular structure of GP epitopes of ?345 collagen IV network and role of GP antibody in pathogenesis. We identified four homologous hotspot regions within ?3NC1 and ?5NC1 monomers that are key for GP antibody binding and have cloned first human GP monoclonal antibody. We hypothesize that the full epitopes are formed upon the change in antigen conformation and that epitope-specific GP mAbs will induce renal failure. Aim 2: To determine the impact of PXDN dysregulation on ?345 collagen IV networks. We discovered that PXDN catalyzes ?121 sulfilimine crosslinks, requires Br, makes HOBr, and anti-PXDN antibodies occur in GP sera. We hypothesize that PXDN crosslinks ?345 collagen IV through an enzyme-substrate complex, and that perturbation of this complex creates oxidative protein modifications on collagen IV. Aim 3: To determine whether GP epitope formation requires phosphorylation by GPBP. GPBP has emerged as a nonconventional kinase that binds and phosphorylates the GP autoantigen and influences the assembly of collagen IV networks. We hypothesize that GPBP phosphorylation alters the presentation of Ea and Eb epitopes and promotes autoantibody binding to ?3NC1. Aim 4: To determine the NC1-mediated mechanism for assembly of the collagen IV ?345 network. We discovered that NC1 domains of collagen IV function as assembly recognition modules. We hypothesize that NC1 domains mediate the assembly of protomers and networks by distinct mechanisms, which are disrupted in disease."
"9286560","Project Summary/Abstract Suicide rates are on the rise, and recent investments in treatment and intervention have done little to turn the tide. While studies have identified cross-sectional predictors of suicidal ideation and behavior (e.g. age, gender, psychiatric diagnosis), the processes that underpin episodic suicide risk ? that is, episodes of suicidal ideation and behavior as they occur in the real world ? remain poorly understood. Neuroimaging studies examining structural and functional alterations present in individuals with suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB) have implicated elements of a fronto-striato-amygdala circuit underlying executive control and emotion processing as conferring suicide risk. This circuit involves key regions of interest (ROIs) including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), ventral medial PFC (vmPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and projections to the thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, caudate, and frontotemporal-striatum. This neural circuit may moderate emotional response through an opponent process model of reactivity to, and regulation of, emotional experiences. Specifically, initial reactivity to emotion involves bottom-up information processing from sensorimotor inputs to the amygdala and, ultimately, to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and associated ROIs. Conversely, regulation of emotional experiences involves top-down information processing, effortful control, higher cognition, and executive functioning, originating in the PFC and associated ROIs. Our team (1R01MH095786), is developing an emotion reactivity translational endophenotype for suicide integrating genetics, psychophysiological monitoring coupled to an emotion reactivity task (i.e. Paced Audio Serial Addition Task), and real-world symptom and experiential sampling via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Preliminary findings suggest that participants who have made a suicide attempt (SA) show greater anger reactivity during the most stressful part of the PASAT as compared to participants with SI; this response may represent a novel emotion reactivity marker of suicide risk. We believe that an important next step in understanding emotion reactivity in suicide is to examine the fronto-striato-amygdala top-down/bottom-up information-processing model using functional neuroimaging in association with laboratory-based and real-world measures (i.e. ecological momentary assessment) of emotion reactivity and regulation."
"9316630","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Photoreceptors and bipolar cells of the retina and hair cells of the auditory and vestibular systems signal sensory stimuli as graded changes in neurotransmitter release. To do so, these cells have evolved synaptic ribbons, proteinaceous structures that tether large numbers of synaptic vesicles near release sites. The molecular machinery underlying synaptic ribbon function is poorly understood. A handful of proteins have been localized to the synaptic ribbon and the importance of these individual molecules as well as how they contribute to the unique functions of the synaptic ribbon remains elusive. Of these proteins, the most abundant is Ribeye, a protein unique to the synaptic ribbon and thought to constitute most of the synaptic ribbon and hypothesized to form the core of the synaptic ribbon. Ribeye arises from an alternative start site of the transcriptional corepressor CtBP2. The precise role of Ribeye remains unknown and the long-term goal of this proposal is to determine the functional role of Ribeye in the synaptic ribbon. To study Ribeye function, we will employ a combination of molecular biology, genetic and electrophysiology primarily using zebrafish as a primary model system. In Aim 1 we generated and characterize zebrafish with targeted mutations in both ribeye genes. In Aim 2, we the effect of one or both Ribeye gene products on the structure of photoreceptor and hair cell ribbons. In Aim 3, we will look at the effect of Ribey removal on the distribution and localization of other synaptic ribbon proteins. In Aim 4, we will investigate the effects of Ribeye loss on exocytosis and calcium current in neuromast hair cells. Understanding synaptic ribbon function at the molecular level will ultimately aid in understanding how visual and auditory information is processed and communicated. In addition, it may provide clues to help understand diseases that specifically affect vision and hearing. In addition, the fundamental understanding of presynaptic processes in these specialized neurons will have broader implications for neuronal communication in general and thus, may contribute to our understanding of various aspects of mental health and neurological disorders."

This includes collecting and organizing all patient demographic, clinical and immunology data, arranging for appropriate testing to be done based on IRB approved protocols. Core A organizes the research blood testing and obtaining samples for the laboratories of the participating investigators to be sent to the participating investigators so that these can be used maximally, and under appropriate IRB protocols and consents. It is important that Core A organizes its work to maximizes research testing while not disrupting the clinical care of any subject. Core A also coordinates the visits of patients pertinent to this program, who are traveling to Mount Sinai or the Rockefeller Hospital so that blood or other samples can be shared with the investigative team. This Core also arranges for the submission of cells or other materials obtained, to the facilities of Core B, for cell phenotyping and/or cell isolation, and the establishment of RNA, DNA, cell pellets and cell lines as needed. Core A is also responsible for maintaining and updating all IRB protocols, consents approvals, and to obtain patient consents for all procedures. This Core will therefore continue to support Projects 1-4 in this ongoing Program Project. Relevance: Patient Core A is required to coordinate patient recruitment and materials, while not impeding clinical care. This duty demands that research work is carried out under correct IRB protocols, confidentiality is maintained, and Project Leaders and other involved investigators and laboratories are aware of the availability of samples, or patients coming for clinic visits in a timely manner. Core A is involved in the medical needs of the patients while coordinating the collection and distribution of all materials obtained during clinic visits in order to maximize the use of all samples.

The ideal treatment would be one that could be administered at least 24 hrs after exposure as a pill or injectable. A major obstacle to designing such a pharmaceutical is the lack of a molecular pathway to specifically target. A recent high-throughput screening (HTS) discovery project of small-molecule libraries uncovered a family of promising radiomitigators possessing a nitrophenylsulfonamide (NPS) core. Unfortunately, their mechanism of action in mitigating radiation toxicity is unknown. Serendipitously during an unrelated study on glutathione (GSH) efflux from irradiated cells via multidrug resistance transport (MRT), it was realized that inhibitors of MRT share the NPS chemical structure found in the screened radiomitigators. Because active efflux of GSH and GSH-conjugated molecules is a critical determinant of cell death, a novel idea arose connecting one study with the other. The hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that inhibition of MRT mediated GSH efflux following IR will rescue cells from death, mitigating acute radiation toxicity. The radiomitigating NPS drugs selected from the HTS and known MRT inhibitors will be used to investigate the following specific aims: 1) Establish importance of GSH efflux and cell death kinetics post-IR, 2) Establish MRT as a mediator of IR-induced cell death and as a target for mitigation, 3) Optimize administration of GSH efflux/MRT inhibitor 24h or more after irradiation, and 4) determine differential effects of GSH efflux/MRT inhibitors on hematopoietic and gastrointestinal tissues to target mitigation of organ-specific radiation syndromes. The milestones will be the identification of a link between MRT-mediated GSH efflux and radiation-induced death, discovery of a set of unique tissue-specific targets for mitigating acute radiation toxicity, and establishment of a basis to develop accessible pharmaceuticals for wide dispersal during a catastrophic radiological event."
"9313647","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S., Latinas report high rates of inactivity and related conditions (obesity, diabetes). Effective interventions that leverage state-of-the-art theory and methods are needed to address such health disparities. We recently conducted a randomized controlled trial of a culturally/linguistically adapted, print-based, mail- delivered physical activity (PA) intervention for Latinas (Seamos Saludables, R01 NR011295), in which participants (N=266) received either individually tailored PA intervention materials based on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, or printed wellness materials. Changes in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) were significantly greater in the intervention arm from baseline to six months (1.87 min/week to 73.37 min/week) than the control arm (3.02 min/week to 32.98 min/week). These increases were maintained at 12 months and mediated by changes in psychosocial constructs targeted by the intervention. A renewal of R01NR011295 is proposed to replicate these findings in Mexican Americans (who comprised only 5% of the original sample but most of US Latino population), explore its clinical potential in preventing and managing chronic disease, and to improve the intervention's effectiveness by incorporating participant feedback (desire for increased interactivity and accountability), further targeting SCT constructs that were overall not influenced by the original intervention yet improved amongst the most successful participants (social support and outcome expectancies), and responding to changing trends and technology use in the Latino population (adding text messaging). In the proposed study, 250 Mexican American women will be randomized to either 1) the original, empirically supported Seamos Saludables tailored print intervention or 2) the technology and theory-enhanced version of the Seamos Saludables intervention. Data will be collected at baseline, 6 months (post-treatment), and 12 months (maintenance) using well-established objective (accelerometers) and subjective (7 Day PAR) PA measures, as well as a comprehensive set of psychosocial questionnaires. We hypothesize that at the end of treatment (month six) the Enhanced Tailored Intervention participants will report significantly more minutes/week of MVPA than the Original Tailored Intervention participants. We will also examine changes in cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, HS-CRP), maintenance of treatment effects at 12 months, costs of delivering the enhanced vs. original intervention programs, potential mediators and moderators of the intervention- physical activity relationship, and will also compare the efficacy of the original Seamos Saludables program in Mexican American women to results in the original population (who were mostly Dominican, Colombian, and Puerto Rican). Such high-reach, low-cost strategies for promoting physical activity have great potential for adoption on a larger scale and could have a large impact on reducing health disparities."
"9258150","Summary / Abstract Breast milk is associated with protection against both early childhood illness and lifelong risk of disease in offspring, but the mechanisms by which human milk bestows these protective effects are largely unknown. Intriguingly, the microbiome may represent a key link between breastfeeding practices and disease outcomes, as breastfeeding is independently associated with 1. shifts in the infant gut microbiome and 2. protection against diseases for which the microbiome has been implicated in pathogenesis. For example, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an often fatal inflammatory disease of the neonatal gut, is strongly associated with shifts in the neonatal gut microbiota prior to disease onset, and breastfeeding provides protection against NEC. This suggests that human breast milk may provide protection from disease in part by structuring the infant gut microbiota. Our long-term goal is to characterize bioactive components of breast milk that significantly alter infant gut microbial community structure and bestow protective properties on the infant gut microbiome. The goal of this project is to characterize the impact of two understudied components of breast milk: the milk microbiome and maternal immunoglobulins (IgA). Breast milk contains many putative probiotic species, but its origin and its role in structuring the offspring microbiome have not been well characterized. Additionally, breast milk contains an abundance of maternal IgA which is well-known to provide protection against infections, but its impact on gut microbial structure has not been explored. Our central hypothesis is the maternal microbiome and IgA delivered to the infant via breast milk play a critical role in shaping the infant gut microbiome. We will test this hypothesis in the following three specific aims: 1. characterize the role of maternal diet and gut microbiota in structuring the milk microbiome by using highly-controlled dietary and probiotic intervention studies coupled with culture-independent profiling of the microbiome, 2. characterize the role of the milk microbiome in establishing the gut microbiome of term and preterm infants by comparing the microbiome of breast milk and infant stool samples from mother-infant pairs, and 3. determine the influence of maternal IgA on the offspring gut microbiome using IgA-SEQ, a novel methodology that allows for high-throughput, global characterization of IgA-bound bacterial taxa in the infant gut. Completion of these aims will yield several important findings with implications for early childhood health. Currently, infant formula preparations are not supplemented with probiotics or immunoglobulins, and this research represents a first step in elucidating the importance of these components for establishment of the human microbiome. Overall, the studies proposed herein will provide insight into the importance of breast milk in early development of the microbiome and may eventually inform the design of novel probiotic therapeutics."
"9325059","Abstract Biological processes are sensitive to externally applied forces and internally generated forces that sculpt the cytoarchitecture of cells. Myogenesis and myofiber remodeling are critical to normal physiological processes such as development, injury repair and hypertrophy in response to chronic load changes in myofibers. These processes follow complex signaling pathways requiring mechanical cues. Dysfunction of myogenesis and remodeling is involved in many muscle pathologies. Ideally, one would want to monitor the stress on different structural proteins and mechanical domains directly during myogenesis and remodeling without perturbing the mechanics of the system. Our focus here is to study muscle differentiation in vitro and to measure the forces in different structural proteins using the genetically coded optical force probe cpstFRET. A major impediment to quantifying the sensitivity of FRET based stress probes are variable expression levels using transient transfections, sharing of stress with different levels of exogenous proteins, temporal expression patterns due to developmentally regulated expression, and large structural proteins that are difficult to manipulate genetically outside of its host. We will use CRISPR-Cas targeted gene cleavage and homologous recombination to introduce the probe into host proteins that include both constitutively expressed genes like laminA, actinin, filamin, and plectin, and developmentally regulated genes such as dystrophin.  We will narrow our focus to the C2C12 myoblast cell line and monitor stress changes during development into myotubes on flexible micropatterned PDMS substrates. We will determine the stress changes on the proteins listed above at different developmental stages and during application of various uniaxial and isotropic forces."
"9354498","Project Summary  The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and regulation of the calcium pump (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, SERCA) in the heart. SERCA clears cytosolic Ca2+ in cardiomyocytes, thus playing a central role in Ca2+ regulation in the heart. SERCA is regulated by phospholamban (PLB), a 52-residue phosphorylation-regulated membrane protein that inhibits the activity of the pump. A key molecular dysfunction in heart failure (HF) involves impaired Ca2+ transport during diastole, usually associated with insufficient SERCA expression and unaltered PLB levels, thus yielding lower SERCA activity due to PLB inhibition. Therefore, there is an urgent need for time-resolved, atomistic characterization of SERCA activation and SERCA-PLB regulation to understand the molecular basis of Ca2+ dysregulation, and to design appropriate approaches to HF. These mechanisms are complex, requiring structural changes and interdomain allosteric communication pathways that are difficult to determine experimentally. Since complete experimental characterization of these changes is likely to remain an intractable problem, we propose to use molecular simulations as a complementary approach. The central hypothesis of this project is that molecular simulations at appropriate spatiotemporal scales are uniquely suited to provide a time-resolved detection of SERCA mechanisms and regulation at a level of resolution currently inaccessible through experiments alone. The high-resolution mechanistic information from these studies can be directly used for computer-aided discovery of hits that activate SERCA through specifically targeting the SERCA-PLB interaction. To verify and consolidate these hypotheses, we have developed a robust battery of computational biophysics and virtual high-throughput screening approaches to SERCA and SERCA-PLB. Three Specific Aims will be pursued: (1) Map ligand-induced structural changes associated with SERCA activation. (2) Determine the molecular mechanisms for PLB regulation of SERCA. (3) Perform a structure-based search of hits that activate SERCA. For this project, we focus on skeletal SERCA1a because crystal structures have been obtained only for this isoform, but the structural results from our simulations are directly applicable to cardiac SERCA2a because there are no significant differences in the kinetics and function of both isoforms, including regulation by PLB. The simulation work will be closely coupled to experimental studies through collaborations; the combination of structural and functional data will provide the experimental tests necessary to verify our simulations and refine our structural models. Activation of SERCA is a widely pursued therapeutic goal in heart failure, and this project has great potential for pushing important frontiers in our understanding of SERCA function and regulation, ultimately enabling a more rational approach to address a critical problem in human health."
"9241963","Emerging virus infections are a substantial global public health threat, in part due to the difficulties in responding to contain or treat previously unknown or uncharacterized pathogens. These emerging viruses can cause a diverse variety of disease phenotypes, ranging from mild subclinical infections to severe, highly lethal clinical manifestations such as hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The broad range of illnesses underscores the need for a framework enabling both rapid diagnosis and prognostic considerations to inform subsequent clinical and epidemiological strategies. Systems biology approaches complement classical methods for investigating emerging pathogens that depend on cultivation of the etiologic agent. By developing diagnostic and prognostic measures based on host responses to known and emerging pathogens, we can avoid issues associated with rapidly developing a robust experimental model for a new virus and substantially hasten the development of informed therapeutic strategies. Through close collaboration with other investigators in the center we plan to develop a reliable, comprehensive, and versatile platform for using host response signatures as diagnostic and prognostic tools. We plan to first use established disease models that are themselves based on emergent viruses, including both cell culture and animal models. Using signatures developed by computational integration of multiple datasets from models, we will apply these methods to newly emerging viruses. Finally, we will use our findings to mine existing drug databases to identify therapeutics that can be repurposed quickly and efficiently for treating these emerging diseases. In each of our Specific Aims, we will use high-throughput transcriptional profiling and novel non-linear geometric as well as machine learning computational methods to define genome-wide gene-activity biomeasures diagnostic of severe disease, prognostic indicators of disease outcome, and identify new potential host therapeutic targets for inducing antiviral effects and/or attenuating disease severity. In addition, we will garner new knowledge related to common and distinct mechanisms of pathogenesis and the host responses that determine eventual disease outcome."
"9326280","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension and diabetes are the principal cause for chronic kidney disease (CKD). In both diseases, a high percentage of patients show activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Renin is the rate-limiting enzyme in the activation of the RAS. Thus, understanding the mechanism and proteins involved in the release of renin may offer alternative targets for hypertension and CKD. Renin is stored in dense-core granules in juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, located at the pole of the renal afferent arteriole, in the kidney cortx. In hypertension and diabetes, reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are enhanced in the kidney cortex. We found that hydrogen peroxide stimulate renin release from JG cells. However, the enzymes responsible for production of hydrogen peroxide in JG cells have not been identified. Hydrogen peroxide is mainly a product of superoxide dismutation or enzymatic formation by NADPH oxidases (NOX1-5). The NOX4 isoform preferentially produces hydrogen peroxide and its expression in the renal cortex is enhanced in diabetes and hypertension. Our preliminary data shows that NOX4 is expressed in renin granules in JG cells, suggestive of intragranular production of H2O2. However it is not known whether NOX4 produces the pool of hydrogen peroxide that stimulates renin release from JG cells; and whether NOX4/H2O2-induced renin release contributes to increase blood pressure and kidney damage in diabetic nephropathy. In addition the mechanism by which H2O2 stimulate renin release is unknown. In other cells H2O2 induces signaling by oxidation of protein thiols. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that the NADPH oxidase isoform NOX4 produces hydrogen peroxide in juxtaglomerular cells and stimulate renin release, thereby increasing blood pressure and contributing to glomerular damage. We will also explore the protein targets by which H2O2 stimulates renin release. In Aim 1 we will use primary cultures of juxtaglomerular cells, isolated afferent arterioles and Akita mice to test the role of NOX4-derived hydrogen peroxide in renin release in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2 we will use a proteomics approach and subcellular fractionation of renin granules, to identify proteins that are oxidized by hydrogen peroxide in juxtaglomerular cells. This approach will allow us to collect critical preliminary data for an RO1 submission and focus on new protein targets of hydrogen peroxide that mediate renin release."
"9335725","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Discovering novel natural products that can serve as drugs or drug leads is of critical importance to human health. Our recent work has identified that bacterial symbionts of insects represents a rich, diverse, and largely untapped source of novel compounds. This ICBG focuses on identifying novel natural products from symbiotic bacteria associated with fungus-growing ants and other social insects in Brazil. We will also determine their potential to treat fungal pathogens, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and cancer of the blood. In AP3, we will contribute to the overall goals of this ICBG in a number of ways. Working closely with AP1, we will conduct intensive sampling of bacterial symbionts from insects collected from a range of biomes in Brazil. Strains will be catalogue and their 16S rRNA sequenced. Using multilocus sequence typing, we will examine the diversity and host specificity of strains. For 500 strains per year identified to be of highest interest, we will determine both their secondary metabolite potential as well as the ecological context associated with their ability to produce natural products. To do this, we will perform ecological assays between bacterial symbionts and fungal antagonists associate with their insect host, conduct genomic sequencing and analyses, and do in vivo imaging mass spectrometry. Finally, we will provide training to young biologists in fieldwork on bacterial symbionts of insects, tropical microbial ecology, and bioinformatics. Training will include hosting Brazilian students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, as well as training students from US labs on conducting field research in Brazil."

"9352883","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs), also known as 'cavernous angioma' or 'cavernoma', are common vascular abnormalities found in ~0.3 - 0.9% of the population, exposing patients to a lifetime risk of hemorrhagic stroke, seizures, and other neurologic sequelae. Approximately 12% of CCM lesions present with clinically overt hemorrhage, and these cases have great likelihood of rebleed in the subsequent 5 years. There are both inherited and sporadic forms of CCM disease, and both forms are caused by somatic mutations in one of three CCM genes. The familial form of the disease is associated with multiple CCM lesions that continue to form throughout the patient's life. There is no drug treatment or cure for CCM. The current standard of care is observation of lesion number and size by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) until one or more bleeds, often disabling, necessitate surgical intervention. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of disease, and the CCM mutation results in over- activation of the Rho signaling pathway that regulates the endothelial cell cytoskeleton and cell- cell adhesions. There is strong proof of concept in the scientific literature (mainly from the co- applicants on this grant) that Rho kinase inhibitors will be effective in treating CCM disease. BioAxone has developed a proprietary Rho kinase inhibitor with greater specificity for ROCK2, the form of Rho kinase that is highly expressed in brain and in brain endothelial cells. Our preliminary safety data indicate that BA-1049 has a much better safety profile than Fasudil, the nonspecific ROCK1/ROCK2 inhibitor used as a research tool to explore treatment of CCM by inhibiting Rho kinase. Our goal is to test and develop BA-1049 to treat CCM and decrease the burden of disease."
"9312351","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy characterized by elevated blood pressure, proteinuria, and endothelial dysfunction involving multiple organ systems. Worldwide, preeclampsia is the largest cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality, and accounts for nearly 16% annually of maternal deaths in the United States alone. African American women are disproportionately affected by preeclampsia in the United States, with a 1.5 to 2 fold increase in incidence over white or Hispanic women. Strikingly, the mortality rate for preeclampsia-associated deaths is up to 4-fold higher in African American women. Several factors have been attributed to this disparity, including higher incidence of comorbidities, delayed detection of symptoms, misdiagnosis, and differences in socioeconomic and insurance status. Moreover, 60% of preeclampsia-related deaths were found to have been preventable. Currently, there is no approved diagnostic test to predict which patients will develop preeclampsia. Patients with preeclampsia require hospitalization and continuous monitoring of the mother and fetus, thus, there is an urgent and unmet need for a diagnostic test that can identify those patients at risk for preeclampsia.  Significant efforts are underway to detect preeclampsia prior to disease onset. Recently, it was demonstrated that glomerular visceral epithelial cells (i.e. podocytes) are shed into the urine of preeclamptic patients and can be detected in the second trimester, prior to preeclampsia diagnosis, with high sensitivity and specificity. Methods to detect podocytes currently rely on overnight culture and sedimentation of cells onto collagen-coated slides, which is time consuming and susceptible to contamination, or the Cytospin technique, which is prone to high false-positive rates due to contaminating red blood cells (RBCs) or casts (mucoprotein secretions). Inconsistencies in the method of podocyte detection, and lengthy overnight incubations followed by immunofluorescence weaken the utility of podocytes as a rapid diagnostic marker of preeclampsia. To this end, Affinergy is developing a point-of-care device that will capture, isolate, and allow rapid quantification of diagnostic podocytes. Such a technology will improve the quality of podocyte capture and lead to significant cost savings by minimizing time and need for expensive equipment. In this Phase I application, we will focus on developing optimal peptide-modified magnetic beads for isolating podocytes."
"9163876","Project Summary/Abstract Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) mediated by autoreactive immune cells that initiate myelin destruction, which leads to motor and sensory function loss. During remyelination, damaged axons acquire a myelin sheath and recover lost function. Clinically, this process occurs early on and requires the generation of new oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cell of the CNS, from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs); however remyelination gradually fails as MS progresses. Despite many advances in the treatment of MS, currently there is not an approved therapy aimed at protecting or restoring the CNS to promote patient recovery. Cytokines and their receptors are expressed physiologically in CNS cells and are critical for proper brain and spinal cord development. Further, immune cells, specifically T cells, are required for nervous tissue sparing and repair in models of CNS injury. In addition, we and others have shown that glia exhibit a degree of heterogeneity between regions of the adult brain and respond differently to cytokines. Although OPCs are known to exhibit regional heterogeneity during development and are known to respond to a variety of cytokines, how OPCs differ in the adult CNS and how specific T cell cytokines impact OPC development and CNS repair remains unclear. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to determine the impact of cytokines on OPC differentiation and how the immune response affects repair following demyelination in various regions of the adult CNS. Currently, we are establishing 1) the effects of cytokines expressed in the CNS during MS on OPC and astrocyte co-cultures to determine their responsiveness in vitro and 2) an in vivo murine model of MS in which both the hindbrain and spinal cord are targeted by myelin-specific T cells. Once the independent phase of my research begins, I will continue to use the in vitro culture system and novel murine model to dissect the cellular and molecular components of the immune response that impact the migration, proliferation and differentiation of OPCs as described in this K22 research proposal. Aim 1 will elucidate how cytokines impact OPC function directly or indirectly, through astrocyte-mediated support. We will also identify specific OPC and astrocyte gene networks that are impacted by cytokine treatment and use these targets to assess in vivo relevance in Aim 2 as we dissect OPC regional heterogeneity during CNS autoimmunity. While this K22 proposal advances my longstanding interest in OPC biology and MS, it will also begin to shift my focus to the interface between the immune and nervous system. In addition, I am fortunate enough to have the support and guidance from an established group of neuroimmunologists, Dr. Robyn Klein, my current mentor, Dr. John Russell, our collaborator, and Dr. Caroline Whitacre, my graduate mentor, to provide scientific guidance, advice on transitioning to an independent position, oversee my scientific progress and guide my career development. Overall, the long-term goal of my future research, as established by this K22 proposal, is to strengthen the appreciation of the neuroimmune connection during CNS autoimmunity and understand how we can utilize these communication schemes to enhance repair and facilitate recovery in MS patients."
"9284505","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) due to hypoxia-ischemia is a major public health concern as it occurs in 6/1000 live term births and has devastating consequences. Many affected neonates suffer lifelong motor disabilities and epilepsy, but increasingly the high prevalence of cognitive and behavioral disabilities is becoming appreciated. In hypoxia-ischemia there is a decrease in blood and oxygen delivery, followed by reperfusion with transient energy recovery. What follows is a window of opportunity where excitotoxicity and associated increased cerebral metabolism eventually lead to secondary energy failure and irreversible cell death. In this window, therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is currently the only treatment available with proven efficacy. TH acts primarily by decreasing cerebral metabolism, thus preserving energy stores. Although the current gold standard for brain injury detection is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MRI is impractical as a screening tool and cannot provide bedside monitoring to optimize individual responses to therapies. Commercially available continuous wave (CW) near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) systems provide bedside measures of cerebral oxygen saturation (SO2) but SO2 alone cannot assess oxygen metabolism, as oxygen delivery is not taken into account. What is needed is a bedside tool that can monitor cerebral metabolism to detect elevations in metabolism that suggest evolving hypoxic-ischemic injury, and decreases in metabolism that suggest response to therapy. Cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) is a direct measure of cerebral metabolism and therefore we propose to measure an index of CMRO2 at the bedside using the innovative combination of Frequency Domain Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (FDNIRS) and Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS). Our initial studies show that CMRO2 is elevated in neonates with MRI evidence of perinatal brain injury, and confirm that neonates on TH have significantly lower CMRO2 than normal controls. Following these exciting results, and in response to the RFA PAR-10-230 Innovative Therapies and Tools for Screenable Disorders in Newborns we now propose a feasibility study to determine if FDNIRS-DCS can screen for involvement, assess response to treatment, and predict outcomes in one of the largest neonatal populations requiring early screening and immediate intervention: neonatal encephalopathy. To assess early outcomes we propose an innovative combination of advanced neurobehavioral testing, regional FDNIRS-DCS measures and quantitative MRI analysis using MRIs obtained without sedation. If our hypotheses prove true, we will be poised to determine if bedside indices of CMRO2 provided by FDNIRS-DCS can optimize TH for individual neonates, thereby improving neurodevelopmental outcomes. Success at this stage will also allow exploration of the potential for FDNIRS-DCS to determine the additional benefits of emerging new treatments for NE and to screen for other treatable neonatal disorders."
"9312432","Project summary Platelet activation by sub-endothelial collagen is crucial not only for hemostatic plug formation but also for thrombotic events leading to heart attack and stroke. Whereas several signaling cascades downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins that regulate platelet functional responses have been characterized, little attention has been paid towards the signaling cascades that involve monomeric small G proteins. We have previously published that the small GTPase RhoG selectively regulates GPVI signaling events in platelets and functional responses. However, the mechanisms of RhoG activation and regulation are not known in platelets. We have strong preliminary data indicating that multiple Ras family small G protein pathways are activated by GPVI receptors and that they play an important role in the regulation of GPVI pathways and hence platelet function. We bring together our expertise with platelet biology and small G protein biochemistry to understand the functional roles of small G protein pathways in platelet function. In this project our overall hypothesis is that some Ras family monomeric small G protein pathways specifically regulate GPVI pathways. Our specific aims are as follows: 1) Evaluate the Role of ELMO1 in the regulation of platelet functional responses. We have identified that a small G protein, RhoG selectively regulates GPVI pathways. We propose that RhoG regulates GPVI signaling through an associated protein, ELMO1, in platelets. We will evaluate the function of ELMO1 in platelets using murine platelets deficient in ELMO1. Our preliminary data show that platelets express ELMO1 and CRP-induced platelet secretion and aggregation are potentiated in ELMO1-null mice. We will test the hypothesis that ELMO1 negatively regulates RhoG activity in platelets through GAPs (GTPase activating proteins), by identifying associated GAPs and by evaluating the function of Arl4, known associating GTPase of ELMO1, using knockout mice. 2) Investigate the functional roles of TC21/R-Ras2 in platelets. TC21 has been shown to be involved in integrin activation, but the full effects and mechanisms are poorly characterized. We have found that TC21 is expressed in murine and human platelets, is activated by GPVI agonists, and that TC21 is required for integrin activation and platelet function downstream of the GPVI receptor. We hypothesize that TC21 potentiates GPVI receptor signaling to regulate integrin ?IIb?3 activation in platelets. We will investigate the roles of TC21 in GPVI signaling, integrin activation and platelet function using ex vivo platelets and in vivo thrombosis models, in human platelets and in platelets derived from mice deleted for TC21. 3) Delineate the mechanisms of activation of TC21/R-Ras2 and RhoG in platelets. We will utilize ex vivo human platelets to investigate the mechanisms of TC21 and RhoG activation. We will test the hypothesis that TC21 regulates RhoG activation through PI3kinase/PIP3/GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) pathways. Our preliminary data identified four GEFs that associate with PIP3 in platelets. The studies proposed in this application will enhance our understanding of the signaling networks and their regulation of functional responses in platelets with a special emphasis on collagen signaling."
"9344769","PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT) Aging and diabetes, as well as many neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, spina bifida, stroke, and spinal cord injury (SCI), can result in loss of voluntary voiding of urine and require intermittent bladder catheterization for voiding. Catheter use is associated with increased incidence of health problems, predominately repeated urinary tract infections, sepsis, urethral trauma and hospitalization. A short-acting, effective, and safe product that induces ?on-demand? voiding would provide a paradigm shift in the management of neurogenic bladder and could reduce or eliminate the need for intermittent catheterization. Dignify Therapeutics is developing a novel drug treatment, DTI-100, to provide an ?on-demand, rapid-onset, short-duration, drug-induced, voiding therapy? for those who cannot void voluntarily. When administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) to rats, dogs, and minipigs, DTI-100 rapidly induces bladder voiding. However IV and SC routes of administration may be impractical for the multiple daily dosing that will be required by individuals with neurogenic bladder. Therefore, intranasal (IN) and orally-disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulations of DTI-100 are being developed. Preliminary studies have shown that efficacious plasma concentrations and dose-dependent bladder contractions can be achieved using both ODT and IN formulations. Phase 1 of this fast-track SBIR proposal will use repeated dosing and measurements of voiding efficiency in conscious minipigs, a species with subcutaneous, nasal, and oral tissues similar to humans, to identify the preferred formulation and route of administration (IN or ODT) for use in future clinical studies. In Phase 2, this formulation will be optimized and manufactured according to FDA regulatory guidelines. The optimized final formulation will then be used for preclinical in vivo testing in minipigs and rats to characterize the pharmacological mechanism of action, as well as for mandatory general toxicity studies required for submission of an investigational new drug (IND) application and the initiation of studies in humans. With proper support, our product could be available as a therapeutic agent with the next five to seven years."
"9410897","Project Abstract There is strong evidence of human immunodeficiency virus infected (HIV+) children being more at risk for hearing loss. Identification of permanent hearing loss is important because hearing loss can impact speech and language development in children. The primary goal is to collect hearing sensitivity data from South African children who were perinatally infected with HIV (PHIV+). Children will be recruited from two ongoing studies in Cape Town, South Africa: the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral Therapy (CHER) trial and the P1104s study of the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trial (IMPAACT). Hearing data will be obtained in PHIV+, HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU), and HIV-unexposed and uninfected (HU) children using a hearing examination protocol. The hearing protocol includes: 1) otoscopy, to evaluate the ear canal and tympanic membrane; 2) tympanometry, to evaluate middle-ear function; 3) pure-tone air- and bone-conduction audiometry, speech audiometry, dichotic digits testing (together with measures of neurocognitive function), to evaluate the entire auditory system; 4) distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), to evaluate cochlear function within the inner ear; and 5) auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), to evaluate auditory neural function to the level of the brainstem. Advanced multimodal neuroimaging techniques, including structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for morphometry, task based and resting state functional MRI (FMRI) to assess auditory cortex function and network connectivity, and diffusion tensor imaging, will be used to evaluate the effects of HIV on the different components of the central auditory system in a comprehensive way. Speech audiometry measures will also be used to determine the impact of HIV on communication. Using DPOAEs, ABRs, and imaging in one protocol will allow for an examination of how specific auditory stimuli are processed from within the cochlea, along the auditory neural pathway to the brainstem, and finally to targeted components of the auditory cortex. These measures will contribute to a better understanding as to which portions of the auditory system are more vulnerable to HIV. There are two advantages of this proposal. First there is an existing collaboration with researchers in Cape Town and there is a new collaboration with neuroimaging experts in Cape Town; the continued support from CHER and P1104s researchers will allow for access to extensive demographic data and HIV disease and treatment data since childhood. Second, the extensive hearing protocol paired with an extensive neuroimaging protocol will provide the first of its kind data in HIV-infected children. These data will impact both the HIV and hearing literatures."
"9323531","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Contemporary research in neuroimaging and neuroscience depends heavily on technical quantitative expertise in the areas of study design, statistical modeling and inference, and computation. The inclusion of a Design and Analysis Core is motivated by the need to provide access to COBRE investigators, and the neuroimaging research community at Brown, to the diverse set of tools and expertise required to conduct work in this area. Having a core with faculty and staff from the fields of statistics, neuroscience and physics will obviate or minimize the need for COBRE project leaders to seek these resources on their own.    The primary mission of the DAC will be collaboration with COBRE investigators on issues related to design, analysis, and computing. We will work with investigators on standard aspects of design and analysis, and provide access to technical staff needed for acquiring and formatting image data, using computer clusters, implementing data analyses on various software platforms, and archiving project data (including image data) on servers. Several projects will demand development of new methodology, and the faculty configuration of the core is designed to respond to those demands and indeed to generate synergy in methods development.    The core will coordinate and facilitate access to computational resources available to investigators. These resources include hardware (e.g., computing clusters, data archiving platforms), software (specialized programs such as AFNI, SPM, Brain Voyager; more general tools such as Matlab and R, and tools developed at Brown for visualization and analysis), and technical personnel with expertise in programming and software operation.    The core will organize a regular working group and seminar series, providing a venue for the active exchange of ideas on design, statistical analysis and methodology, computation, software, and related issues between neuroimaging researchers both within and outside of Brown."
"9381512","This application defines the mitochondrial quality control (QC) network in the lung as a therapeutic target during acute lung injury (ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome; ARDS), a major critical illness caused by injury to the alveolar-capillary barrier. The proposal is based on recent developments from our laboratory on the role of mitochondria in the mechanisms of ALI resolution. ALI is caused by severe damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier, leading to an exudative phase of protein-rich edema and cellular debris resulting in physiological shunt and refractory hypoxemia. Severity is such that the abundant cuboidal alveolar type II (AT2) cell, the source of surfactant production/recycling, is also thought to be necessary to regenerate type I cell epithelium and restore epithelial integrity. Accordingly, if the proliferative phase is controlled, the resolution of alveolar barrier integrity and liquid clearance gradually occurs. The AT2 cell also supports various non-surfactant alveolar functions from sodium transport to host defense that require ATP, and hence are enriched in mitochondria. These mitochondria are maintained by a sentinel genetic mitochondrial QC network, which is also required for cell proliferation and possibly for alveolar regeneration. Our preliminary data shows that the transcriptional program that regulates the mitochondrial QC network becomes highly activated in the lung AT2 cell during experimental Staphylococcal aureus pneumonia/ALI in mice. The resolution of ALI depends on the inducible heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; Hmox1) system in the AT2 cell and is regulated by and regulates antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent genes. Specifically, the DNA-binding transcription factor NRF-1 (Nuclear Respiratory Factor-1), a partner of the PGC-1? co-activator, is critical not only to maintain bioenergetic function, but for the AT2 cell to serve as an AT1 cell progenitor. We propose that the AT2 cell mitochondrial QC program is necessary for AT1 proliferation and the full resolution of alveolar epithelial damage in ALI. This idea is not just novel; it is amenable to therapeutic intervention. Thus, targeted pharmacological interventions may shorten the course of ARDS. Therefore, using molecular methods with a pre- clinical approach in mice and cells, we will rigorously test transcriptional activation of mitochondrial QC in the AT2 cell as a critical factor in ALI resolution through enablement of AT2 cell proliferation, trans-differentiation into AT1 cells, and control of inflammation, all of which are necessary to restore epithelial barrier function. We will test our novel ideas with three Specific Aims: Aim 1) Measure and localize oxidant damage in lung parenchyma and AT2 cell mitochondria (specifically mtDNA oxidation) in ALI/pneumonia in mice and its impact on mitochondrial QC regulation by HO-1/CO and a) AT2 cell apoptosis, b) resolution of alveolar inflammation and c) alveolar barrier dysfunction. Aim 2) Test how HO-1 induction of the mitochondrial QC network a) activates mitophagy b) accelerates AT2 cell proliferation and trans- differentiation into type I epithelium, and c) prevents necroptosis after ALI/pneumonia. Aim 3) Demonstrate whether strategies that activate mitochondrial QC will reverse loss of lung protection in ALI/pneumonia in mice with conditional knockout (CKO) of a) HO-1 or b) NRF-1 in AT2 cells using the approaches of Aim 1."
"9305094","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although overall obesity rates are declining in the US, severe obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m2) is still increasing; rates are as high as 36% in some US ethnic minority populations. Bariatric surgery is the most promising treatment for weight loss in the severely obese, resulting in much higher excess weight loss (75% vs. 11%) than traditional behavioral methods. The most frequently used bariatric procedures (bypass and gastric sleeve) have clear evidence for durable weight loss, however, even within the same procedure type, weight loss varies substantially. For example, 25% - 50% of RYGB patients regain some of their initial weight lost within 3 years. We propose a unique, mixed methods, prospective cohort study to understand why some patients experience better weight outcomes than others. The healthcare setting for this work, Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), performs ~3,500 bariatric surgeries annually; a larger target population for prospective research than any other single institution. Using socio-ecological, self-regulatory, and social cognitive theories fo the basis of our study design, we propose to collect electronic medical record data and self-report surveys in 1,800 patients before surgery and at 12, 24, and 36 months post-operatively to examine demographic, behavioral, psychosocial, and perceived environmental predictors of weight loss/regain. We will also purposively select cross-sectional samples from 12-, 24- and 36-month survey respondents who do or do not achieve successful weight loss to participate in interviews and focus groups. We will test the following two main study aims and one exploratory aim: Aim 1. Over a 3-year follow-up period, determine how demographic, behavioral, psychosocial, and perceived environmental pre-surgical factors, and post-surgical behavioral and psychosocial factors predict a) the weight loss trajectory and b) weight loss success (defined as achieving and maintaining > 50% excess weight loss); Aim 2. Understand the variability in weight loss using qualitative methods in cross-sectional samples of post-operative survey respondents and use these findings to inform mediational models addressing Aim 1; Exploratory Aim 3. Over a 3-year follow-up period, study the development of adverse psychosocial consequences and determine how they relate to a) overall weight loss and b) weight loss success. Our study is designed to provide results that will move the science forward in two key areas: 1) optimizing patient selection in real-world settings for bariatric procedures using a better understanding of pre-operative predictors; and 2) program development for maximizing the benefits from surgery for the greatest number of people, using the knowledge we gain from studying mediators of post-operative weight loss."
"9328078","This application is to request a MERIT Award extension. Our progress validated our hypothesis that globin gene expression and heme biosynthesis are interlinked through GATA-1-dependent mechanisms. Aim 1. To distinguish between models for how heme amplifies GATA-1 activity to coordinate hemoglobin biosynthesis and erythroid cell development/function. We will test whether heme permits or enhances the GATA-1-dependent subnuclear transition that expels target loci from the nuclear periphery (Model 1) or enhances GATA-1 activity subsequent to the transition (Model 2). If heme enhances the GATA-1-dependent subnuclear transition of Bach1-sensitive genes, we will analyze the relationship between Bach1 and other factors/coregulators that drive locus relocalization. As the relationship between subnuclear transitions and chromatin looping remains elusive, we will determine whether heme and Bach1 regulate GATA-1-mediated looping. If heme enhances activation subsequent to the transition, we will dissect late mechanistic steps. Aim 2. To assemble activation and repression matrices and use these unique resources to elucidate how the GATA-1/heme circuit establishes a critical sector of the erythroid cell transcriptome. We hypothesize that GATA-1 target gene cohorts requiring unique ensembles of factors (including heme) and coregulators share common mechanisms/pathways. We assembled first-gen. matrices illustrating relationships between target gene expression and factor/coregulator requirements. Considerably expanded second-gen. matrices will be developed. Unraveling the mechanisms/pathways will yield vital insights into hemoglobin synthesis and erythroid cell development/function. Aim 3. To use a synthetic biology approach involving cis-element engineering to ascertain how GATA-1-binding cis-elements control heme biosynthesis and erythroid biology. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we will rewire the cis-element circuitry controlling heme biosynthesis to determine why the Alas2 intron1 GATA-1-binding cis-element is much more important than the intron8 GATA-1-binding cis-element. We will test the hypothesis that the difference reflects intrinsic differences between the elements, or distinct flanking sequences render the elements differentially active at endogenous loci. We will generate G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells in which the cis-elements are swapped to determine if they retain or adopt new attributes at the ectopic chromosomal site. Concepts will be validated in primary erythroblasts and in vivo. These studies will establish rules governing cis-element function in erythroid cells, which will inform GATA factor-dependent mechanisms, biology, and pathologies. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The proposed studies shall provide fundamental insights into mechanisms underlying disorders of hemoglobin synthesis, including thalassemias and anemias and diseases associated with aberrant heme biosynthesis, including porphyrias. Moreover, the work shall provide a conceptual framework for the design and implementation of translational and therapeutic strategies for these disorders."
"9319296","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of people undergo traumatic experiences annually. While acute distress is a normative response to trauma, a small percent of the people who have undergone traumatic experiences continue to exhibit severe stress reactions long after the trauma. The posttraumatic reactions may include intrusive memories, hypervig- ilant arousal, impaired concentration, depression, emotional detachment from others, and disengagement from aspects of life that provide meaning and self-fulfillment. In functional assessments these recurrent reactions seriously impair intrapersonal, interpersonal, and occupational functioning.  Despite these ramifications, post-traumatic stress disorders are under-reported, and in many cases go completely undetected. Barriers to help-seeking include: lack of knowledge about predisposition symptoms, the unavailability of appropriate remedial/prevention services, the fear of the social stigma of mental illness, lack of social support, or assumptions that the mood changes are a part of the overwhelming nature of post-crisis life. In recent times, many crisis rehabilitation efforts have recognized these challenges, and have incorporated access to mental health services in their intervention and support programs. However, treatment efforts, that typically comprise medication, therapy, or both, are more successful with early intervention; in fact, the likelihood of achieving full recovery decline as the illness lengthens.  Social media such as Twitter and Facebook are increasingly serving an important role in crisis situations: aggregating and disseminating information, while providing opportunities for reflection and discussion of collective grief and trauma. These platforms thus provide an opportunity to investigate if post-traumatic stress and anxiety can be detected on a macro scale by studying the affective responses of crisis-inflicted populations. Due to social media's archival record, reactions to societal crisis and traumatic happenings can be tracked longitudinally.  We propose to mine behavioral data from these platforms to better understand the range of responses of people to crises. By applying state-of-the-art techniques from text and social network analytics, we will go be- yond population-level estimates of crisis behavior, to gauge the social, psychological, emotional, and linguistic attributes of specific crisis-laden communities, and the relationship of these behavioral attributes to key mental and public health outcomes in a crisis context. Specifically, we will accomplish the following research aims:  1. Design data mining techniques that can intelligently filter social media posts for crisis-relevant content, incorporating statistical correction methods that can extract population representative samples.  2. Use linguistic signals and social network metadata to identify key communities in the crisis-laden population.  3. Develop behavioral measures from the activities of these communities that reflect the extent of their risk to stress disorders from the crisis situation. Ths will include measures that automatically expand and refine existing technologies to match community-specific language and dialects, which can vary dramatically in social media writing, as well as factor in the unique context of crisis events.  4. Perform a longitudinal study of the behavior of crisis-embroiled communities, identifying the factors that indicate especially high-ris groups.  If successful, this research will (a) bring to the fore variables related to the exacerbaton of (or even predisposition to) PTSD, (b) enable new mechanisms to identify at-risk communities in a near real-time fashion, and (c) lend a complementary perspective on current research around trauma diagnosis, which relies typically on laboratory studies and surveys. On a practical note, a potential link between behavior manifested in social media in the context of a crisis, and anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptomatology can also augment traditional efforts in providing valuable interventions as a part of disaster response.  This work is a close collaboration with computational linguist and faculty of School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology, Dr. Jacob Eisenstein, who is an expert in the discovery of social relationships latent in linguistic data, and Dr. James Pennebaker, a social psychologist and faculty in the Department of Psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, whose expertise is in the area of psychological interpretation of language cues."
"9371162","Project summary This career development proposal has been engineered for the training of the principle investigator (PI) into an independent physician-scientist. The PI has prior basic and translational research experience including a PhD in molecular genetics and cell biology (Dr. Stephen J. Kron) and postdoctoral fellowship in lipoprotein metabolism and macrophage cholesterol efflux (Dr. Daniel J. Rader), culminating in first-author publications at each phase of training. The prior studies of the PI in macrophage cholesterol metabolism have motivated interests in the basic role of macrophages in heart failure due to myocardial infarction, a major public health problem. The PI is a heart failure transplant cardiologist and Clinical Instructor who trained in Internal Medicine (Massachusetts General Hospital), Cardiovascular Diseases, and Advanced Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplantation fellowship (both at University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Kenneth B. Margulies). Both prior clinical and research experiences of the PI motivated the formulation of this 5-year career development program to provide formal training in macrophage immunology and further laboratory training in coronary injury and animal models of heart failure. The main hypothesis of the research proposal is that augmenting the macrophage lysosomal machinery will prevent heart failure due to myocardial infarction. Preliminary studies from the PI indicate that macrophage-specific overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of the autophagy- lysosome pathway, prevents myocardial remodeling after experimental myocardial infarction. The PI will explore this hypothesis and confirm the preliminary results by detailed cardiac phenotyping and assessment of myocardial function in male and female mice (Aim 1), detailed analysis of the myocardial inflammatory response (Aim 2), and investigation into basic subcellular mechanisms by which TFEB may improve macrophage survival and augment anti-inflammatory responses (Aim 3). Completion of the aims will provide the PI necessary training to achieve scientific independence, including further training in cardiac injury models (Aim 1), and macrophage immunology (Aims 2 and 3). Dr. Abhinav Diwan, an expert in modeling lysosome biology in heart failure, will serve as the primary mentor, while Dr. Gwendalyn Randolph, a leading expert in macrophage immunology, will serve as the co-mentor. The PI will benefit from this mentorship team and the tremendous basic and translational resources available at Washington University, a premier academic institution, with an exceptionally strong commitment to training physician-scientists. In addition, during the course of this award, the PI will complete graduate courses in immunology, travel to scientific meetings, and benefit from the input of a career advisory committee composed of the Drs. Diwan and Randolph, as well as Dr. Douglas Mann, a recognized expert in heart failure, Dr. Stuart Kornfeld, a lysosome biologist who has trained over 100 graduate student and postdoctoral fellows, and Dr. Marco Colonna, an internationally-regarded expert in immunology. This application fulfills the immediate training objectives of the PI to acquire expertise in the immuno-biology of heart failure, and the long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist focused on cardiovascular disease research."
"9310233","Project Summary/Abstract Current pre-operative and intraoperative margin assessment techniques fail to adequately guide breast cancer surgeons to remove all cancer during breast conserving surgeries. As a result, more than 30% of lumpectomy patients have unrecognized tumor left in the tumor bed during the initial surgery. This residual tumor is only discovered when the pathologist evaluates the resection margins one week later and finds a positive margin. The majority of patients with positive margins (~87%) require a second surgery, which increases health care costs along with patient anxiety and discomfort. To address this unmet need, Lumicell has developed an intraoperative imaging system consisting of a molecular imaging agent (LUM015) that emits fluorescence after activation by cancer associated enzymes, a compact hand-held imaging head (LUM 2.6 Device) that captures the fluorescence emission of the agent and software that detects and displays invasive carcinomas (80% of the breast cancer cases) in real-time to guide the surgeon. Our collaborators at the Massachusetts General Hospital are conducting a feasibility study in breast cancer patients under an FDA-approved IDE. The first part of the feasibility study has been completed with no adverse events observed in 15 patients. Initial results from the feasibility study show no false negatives (100% sensitivity) with ~10% false positives. During this study, Lumicell developed an approach for detecting the much smaller foci of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; 20% of breast cancer cases). As the first aim of this proposal, we will develop and implement software for real- time detection of DCIS. Our next proposed aim is a two arm, multi-institution pivotal clinical trial in support of our PMA application to measure the efficacy of the LUM Imaging System. The primary endpoint of the study is the reduction in positives margin rates for surgeries in which the LUM Imaging System is used versus standard of care (SOC) treatment for breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving lumpectomies. The secondary endpoint is a reduction in the rate of second surgeries due to positive margins when the LUM Imaging System is used. The device arm will consists of 300 patients, while the control (SOC) arm will consists of 100 patients. In the SOC arm, patients will undergo a routine lumpectomy procedure. In the device arm, patients will undergo SOC treatment followed by imaging of the lumpectomy cavity with the LUM Imaging System. Additional therapeutic cavity shaves will be removed from regions that Lumicell's detection algorithm determines to contain cancer."
"9386244","Project Summary Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation has profound effects upon skin and generates systemic consequences from fever to immunosuppression to vitamin D production. As UVB only penetrates the epidermis, a major question in photobiology is how UVB-treated skin sends systemic signals. Recent studies have indicated that small membrane-bound vesicles known as microvesicle particles (MVP) released from cells in response to various stressors can act as potent signaling agents due to their ability to carry nuclear and cytoplasmic components. We have demonstrated that UVB generates MVP release from epithelial cells and skin, which could provide a potential mechanism for UVB-mediated systemic signaling. Our group and others have demonstrated that UVB radiation generate high levels of the lipid mediator Platelet-activating factor (PAF) produced enzymatically and PAF-receptor (PAF-R) agonists produced non-enzymatically via reactive oxygen species. Recent studies using antioxidants and PAF-R-expressing/null cell lines have implicated involvement of PAF-R signaling in UVB generated MVP (UVB-MVP). Two aims are designed to test the hypothesis that UVB generates MVP in human skin in a PAF-dependent manner and transfers systemic effects via their carried potent signaling molecules. Aim 1 will determine if MVP are released from human skin following UVB and if this process is PAF-R dependent. We plan three complementary approaches. First, we will use human skin explants to induce multiple suction blisters with the blister fluid as source of MVP, and test effects of PAF-R antagonists/antioxidants. Second, we will induce suction blisters on human subjects with/without systemic antioxidants, and treat the blister roof with UVB. Finally, we will assess circulating MVP in vivo using paired blood draws (before/after phototherapy) from human patients undergoing whole body UVB treatment. Aim 2 will determine the bioactive agents in UVB-MVP. Both MVP and cells will be tested for three classes of agents: lipid mediators, protein cytokines and microRNAS. Successful completion of this project will (i) address an important question in photobiology as to how a keratinocyte-specific stimulus can generate systemic signaling effects, (ii) offer pharmacologic mechanisms to block UVB systemic effects."
"9281909","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Gene expression studies have fully described the transcriptional cascades involving the Olig family of bHLH proteins that are required for neuronal stem cells to choose first the glial, and then decide between the oligodendrocyte or astrocyte cell fate; and yet, a gap persists in our understanding of how terminal glial cell identity is maintained and how glia cell function is regulated. This gap in our knowledge presents a critical barrier to our ability to manipulate glial cells to facilitate growth and recovery from injuries to the central nervous system. It also hinders our ability to design effective treatments for glia-associated diseases, including mood altering disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Olig ortholog HLH-17 is strongly and predominantly expressed in the astrocyte-like cells of the cephalic sheath (CEPglia), but is not required for CEPglia specification or differentiation. We hypothesize that HLH-17 is required for the maintenance of CEPglia cell identity, and consequently, for CEPglia to direct normal animal behavior. We can uniquely test this hypothesis in C. elegans because loss of glia cells is not lethal and because neural development, neural connectivity, and neurotransmitter-mediated behaviors all have been thoroughly characterized. These studies will allow us to address overarching goal, which is to determine what distinguishes one glia subtype from another, and to determine how that identity is maintained throughout the life of the organism. The objectives in this pilot application are to (Aim 1) identify glia enriched and subtype-specific transcripts of the C. elegans glia and correlate the glia subtype-specific expression of HLH-17 with the unique molecular signature of that glia; and (Aim 2) demonstrate that manipulation of glia integrity can be directly correlated with animal behavior. The impact of study will be an improved understanding of the mechanisms (1) by which glia can affect mood disorders associated with dopamine signaling and (2) by which manipulation of Olig and other terminal transcription factors can lead to improved recovery from injury to the CNS. This understanding may ultimately lead to novel therapeutic approaches."
"9217548","The flaviviruses are mosquito-borne viruses that are associated with significant worldwide morbidity and mortality. The dengue viruses (DENV) are members of this group associated with dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). These viruses are endemic in most of the tropical and sub-tropical world, and roughly one-third of the Earth's populace lives in areas at risk for dengue transmission. A second member of the flaviviruses. West Nile virus (WNV), is a neurotropic virus; infection can result in encephalitis/meningitis and subsequent long-term neurologic complications or death. Despite this threat, no specific therapy exists for either virus. Treatment is largely supportive, and in the case of DHF and DSS or neuroinvasive WNV, generally requires hospitalization. In this application, we propose to identify and develop small molecule inhibitors of these viruses. We will emphasize the development of molecules that show broad-spectrum activity against multiple flaviviruses, and potentially members of other virus families as well. Initial screening of multiple compound libraries comprising >100,000 compounds will be carried out in collaboration with the Southern Research Institute (SRI). In additional arms of this proposal, the same libraries will be screened for activity against other virus families, including influenza, alphaviruses, and coronaviruses. Therefore, the overall proposal has the potential to identify compounds that are not only active against flaviviruses, but other medically important viruses as well. Multiple techniques will be used to characterize mechanisms of action and targets of antiviral compounds. We will focus on compounds that target one of the following important enzymatic activities of the flavivirus NS5 protein: the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is essential for replication of the viral RNA genome, and the 2'-0-methyltransferase, which is required for the virus to avoid the host innate immune response. Compounds with activities targeting these enzymes will be further developed through the synthesis of structural analogs, analysis of structure activity relationship (SAR), and testing in in vivo (mouse) models of virus infection."
"9335477","Summary: AP4 This associate program of PMS-ICBG will test natural products identified in AP3 for their pharmaceutical potential in treating several important diseases. We have selected our disease targets by considering:1) unmet needs in human health; 2) health needs in the Philippines; 3) assays that have a strong tie to our eco-rationale and symbiosis studies in AP2; 4) that provide a mix of innovative and conservative approaches to drug discovery. Our assays target conditions that involve neuronal receptors, ion channels, and other proteins; pancreatic cancer; glioblastoma; pandrug-resistant ESKAPE infections; and apicomplexan parasite infections, with a focus on Crytosporidium and Toxoplasma. Further, we have formed interactions with appropriate entities that have further assays available and that are well suited to help us translate discoveries into products that will have a positive impact on human health. A particularly innovative focus of this AP is our use of the recently invented constellation pharmacology method, which provides a method for high-content screening against naturally differentiated mammalian cell types. Preliminary data show that this method is very promising in finding ligands for very challenging targets, and here we will take that further by screening natural products. This and other innovative methods proposed are reinforced with time-tested approaches to drug discovery to provide a relatively comprehensive screening of our library. Finally, we have developed strategies to validate hits and to determine their translational potential early on in studies. Promising candidates will be further investigated as part of this program. To achieve these goals, we plan to:  1) Screen priority extracts from AP3;  2) Employ constellation screening for neurological and cancer drug discovery;  3) Employ novel assays for antibiotic discovery;  4) Employ novel assays against parasites;  5) Identify molecular targets and further develop compounds."
"9336832","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a worldwide problem that is a common consequence of trauma. PTSD is often comorbid with depression. Despite the availability of medications and psychotherapy, many persons with PTSD experience persistent symptoms. Veterans frequently use Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) interventions to augment their traditional care and to address their social and spiritual needs. The proposed controlled randomized trial will assess whether a novel CAM intervention, Loving-kindness Meditation (LKM), is not meaningfully inferior to another group-based PTSD treatment , Cognitive Processing Therapy (Cognitive Only version; CPT-C) for reductions in PTSD and depressive symptoms. Promising results from an open trial of LKM completed in our laboratory with male and female Veterans with PTSD suggest that LKM is feasible and safe Veterans with PTSD, and is associated with significant improvements in PTSD symptoms and depression, as well as enhanced self-compassion. In the proposed project 170 Veterans with PTSD will be randomized to LKM or CPT-C. Comprehensive assessments will be performed at baseline as well as at the end of the 12-week interventions and 3 and 6 months later. PTSD symptoms, depression, posttraumatic maladaptive cognitions and self-compassion will be assessed weekly during the treatment phase to assess temporality of change and to assess mediators of outcomes. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Evaluate if LKM is non-inferior to CPT-C in producing reductions in PTSD symptoms among Veterans with current PTSD. Aim 2: Evaluate the non-inferiority of LKM and CPT-C in producing reductions in depressive symptoms among Veterans with current PTSD. Exploratory Aim: Evaluate potential mediators of response to LKM and to CPT to provide preliminary information regarding whether they are consistent with the mechanisms of change conceptualized by each intervention to be associated with improvement in PTSD and depression. Design: A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing LKM to CPT-C. Participants: 170 male and female Veterans with current PTSD. Intervention: 12-week group-based LKM or CPT-C. Hypotheses and Analyses: Veterans randomized to LKM will report mean reductions in PTSD and depressive symptom severity that are not meaningfully worse than CPT-C. We further hypothesize that reductions in posttraumatic maladaptive beliefs will more strongly mediate PTSD and depressive symptom improvement for those assigned to CPT-C than those assigned to LKM. Implications: If improvement in outcomes for LKM are non-inferior to CPT-C, the findings of this trial would support offering LKM as an additional group-based treatment for Veterans with PTSD."
"9355180","PROJECT SUMMARY Elucidating mechanisms that regulate gene expression in red blood cell production is fundamental to understanding cellular differentiation, and to developing new therapies for red cell disorders. Transcriptional enhancers determine cell identity by directing spatiotemporal gene expression. Recently, we and others have identified erythroid-specific enhancer elements through genome-scale profiling of chromatin features. Further analysis has uncovered GATA1-interacting coactivators and their combinations as candidate drivers of enhancer function. These studies established a comprehensive catalog of erythroid enhancer elements, yet the molecular composition and in vivo function of the vast majority of these enhancers remain unknown. Given that enhancers are frequently targeted by disease-associated genetic variations, it is imperative to fill this gap in knowledge. The objective of this project is to determine the protein complexes and long-range DNA interactions responsible for enhancer assembly and function in situ during erythropoiesis. The central hypothesis is that erythroid enhancers are assembled by specific combinations of lineage-regulating transcription factors such as GATA1 to recruit transcriptional coactivators and to initiate long-range chromatin interactions for gene transcription. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of our preliminary studies of an erythroid-specific super-enhancer comprised of three individual enhancers that regulates the SLC25A37 gene, a mitochondrial iron transporter essential for iron metabolism and heme synthesis, and an innovative approach to identify macromolecules associated with a single genomic locus using the endonuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) and single guide RNA (sgRNA) components of the CRISPR system. Guided by these preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify and characterize SLC25A37 enhancer-associated proteins in situ by dCas9 affinity purification, followed by quantitative proteomic analysis and validation studies. 2) Determine SLC25A37 enhancer long-range DNA interactions using dCas9-mediated chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end sequencing (dCas9-ChIA-PET). By comparing the frequency and location of chromatin interactions between individual SLC25A37 enhancers and their temporal changes during erythropoiesis, these analyses will establish functional links between chromatin looping and enhancer function. 3) Define the functional requirement of 41 erythroid disease-associated, evolutionarily conserved super-enhancers using an engineered dCas9-LSD1 repressor complex in a dCas9 knockin mouse model. Together these studies will not only elucidate the mechanisms for the genetic control of a principal regulator of erythroid iron metabolism, but also provide new tools for in situ analysis of enhancer- regulating components. Such results are expected to advance our understanding of the composition and function of enhancers in coordinating erythroid gene expression. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform the design of therapeutic strategies to target non-coding regulatory elements in red cell disorders."
"9287430","Project Summary/Abstract Dysphagia is a difficulty in swallowing which is observed in 20% of the elderly and several forms of muscular dystrophy patients and causes malnutrition and potential life threatening effects such as choking or pneumonia by aspiration of food; however, no cure or therapeutic treatment exists. Tongue and pharyngeal muscles are essential for proper swallowing and prevention of food/water aspiration into the lungs yet the cellular mechanisms that underlie changes in tongue and pharyngeal muscle function with age and with diseases, such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), are unknown. OPMD is a late-onset, autosomal dominant muscle disease with prominent dysfunction of the eyelid, tongue and pharyngeal muscles; however, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the muscle-specificity of this disease. Muscle stem cells (satellite cells, SC) of craniofacial muscles have unique myogenic properties such as chronic high levels of proliferation and fusion with the myofiber in the absence of injury. Despite high and constant levels of myonuclear addition into myofibers by chronic satellite cell fusion, a constant number of myonuclei per myofiber is maintained, implying a high level of myonuclei turnover is occurring. This unusual myonuclear homeostasis may make craniofacial muscles more vulnerable to specific diseases and age.  We propose 3 lines of experimentation addressing the cellular mechanisms underlying myonuclear homeostasis of craniofacial muscles. These studies will help identify mechanisms involved in the specificity of affected muscles in OPMD and provide potential targeted therapeutic strategies for dysphagia. Aim 1: To compare the effect of fibroadipogenic progenitor cells (FAPs) on satellite cell fusion with myofibers between craniofacial and limb muscles. We will determine whether muscle-specific FAP differences influence satellite cell (SC) proliferation or differentiation at different ages in mice using assays in vitro and in vivo. Aim 2: To quantify myonuclear turnover in craniofacial muscles and examine autophagy as a mechanism for myonuclear turnover. We will apply BrdU labeling methods to measure myonuclear turnover of craniofacial muscles and compare to the level of myonuclear addition with aging. Autophagy, which has a role in cellular homeostasis, will be examined as a potential mechanism for myonuclear turnover in craniofacial muscles. Aim 3: To determine the mechanism of impaired myonuclear addition in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) and whether myonuclear turnover is also altered. We will test whether the intrinsic myogenic potential of SC or the extrinsic effect of FAPs on the SCs influences impaired nuclear addition in craniofacial muscles in OPMD. In addition, we will measure the myonuclear turnover of craniofacial muscles in OPMD mice and determine whether augmentation of autophagy signaling affects myonuclear turnover and pathology in OPMD."
"9321530","ABSTRACT (Core C: Mouse Core) The overall goal of this Core laboratory is to provide the infrastructure, materials, animals, technical expertise and support that will facilitate the use of humanized immunodeficient mice in studies that examine HIV reservoirs in vivo. Recent advances have enabled the use of mice that lack their own immune system mice to be implanted with human tissue. Human tissue capable of developing into human immune cells is placed in the mice where it undergoes development into multiple types of human immune cells. The human tissue used in these studies is capable of a high degree of manipulation and experimentation in the mouse and the human cells, versus the mouse cells, are further susceptible to infection with HIV. This provides a powerful model to examine human blood cell development, to study the effects of HIV infection on human cells, and examine ways to purge HIV from immune cells. The generation of these humanized mice is a highly specialized procedure, due to the requirement for immunodeficient mouse strains, human hematopoietic tissue, infectious material, specialized facilities, and the necessary skill and knowledge to perform experiments in this system. This new core would represent a unique and valuable resource for this program, as the director of the Core has greater than 24 years of experience with humanized mouse models and the staff of the core have helped pioneer various novel techniques and findings in these models. In order for us to accurately assess and compare our results, standardization of the mouse model becomes absolutely critical. Thus, it is essential for this program, in order to draw the proper conclusions, that the studies involving humanized mice be standardized between laboratories. The central purpose of this core is to provide the specialized services and resources needed by all 3 projects in this program in the standardized fashion necessary to generate consistent and reliable data."
"9431267","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) has been illustrated as an important transcription factor in a variety of cellular processes and the NF-?B signaling pathway has provided a focus for pharmacological intervention. NF-?B is responsive to genotoxic threats such as DNA damaging chemicals and ionizing irradiation. Moreover, the NF-?B signaling pathway has emerged as one of the most important mediators of the cellular responses to genotoxic stress, and considerable progress has been made during the past decade to understand DNA damage responses; that said, the ''nuclear-to-cytoplasmic'' NF-?B signaling pathways following various genotoxic stresses remain less defined, in particular the upstream signaling cascade that networks nuclear DNA damage and cytoplasmic NF-?B activation. Our recent study revealed that Sam68 (Src-associated substrate during mitosis of 68 kDa) is critical for the DNA damage-triggered NF-?B activation and regulates    genotoxic stress-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). This project aims to elucidate the mechanisms how Sam68 functions in the DNA damage-initiated signaling pathway, and to assess the pathophysiological significance of Sam68-dependent NF-?B signaling in primary cell cultures, whole animals, and human cancer cells. We will determine the role of Sam68 in genotoxic stress-initiated NF-?B signaling pathway in Aim 1 and elucidate the mechanism(s) how Sam68 regulates PARylation following DNA damage in Aim 2. Furthermore, we will assess the role of Sam68 in genotoxic stress-induced NF-?B signaling and activation in mouse primary cells, whole animals, and human cancer cells in Aim 3. At the conclusion of these studies, we will elucidate novel molecular mechanisms on DNA damage-initiated upstream signaling cascade that leads to NF-?B activation, thus advancing our fundamental understanding of this important nuclear-to-cytoplasmic NF-?B signaling pathway. It may also lead to novel targets that may aid rational drug development for the genotoxic stress- and NF-?B-associated diseases."
"9335945","ABSTRACT Kawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children of the developed world. It presents as an acute self-limiting illness with fever and inflammation of the skin and mucous membranes. In KD, the immune system triggered by a so far unknown extrinsic factor induces multisystem vasculitis including the coronary arteries. Even following current therapeutic guidelines, 30% of children with KD will have coronary artery dilation (CAD). Patients with CAD may face permanent and potentially devastating complications, such as coronary vasculopathy, myocardial infarction and even death. Currently there is no available treatment or prevention of CAD in children with KD. In the acute phase of KD, activated macrophages and lymphocytes in the wall of the coronary arteries induce matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) that is responsible for elastin degradation causing CAD and aneurysm. Doxycycline (a common antibiotic and a known inhibitor of MMP-9) was shown to decrease MMP-9-mediated coronary elastin breakdown and improve coronary outcome in animal models of KD. Doxycycline administration was also demonstrated to reduce MMP-9 activity in the aortic wall of adults with abdominal aortic aneurysm. Our preliminary and published data demonstrates that pro- MMP-9 is a sensitive biomarker to detect inflammation in children during the acute phase of KD when CAD occurs, and doxycycline may prevent the progression of CAD in children with KD. Based on these data, we will test the following two hypotheses: 1) doxycycline administration in children during the acute phase of KD will decrease the circulating level of MMP-9; and 2) doxycycline treatment during the acute phase of KD is safe and effective to prevent the progression of CAD and aneurysm formation in children. Specific aim 1: To characterize the change in circulating pro-MMP-9 and MMP-9 levels in response to a 3- week oral administration of doxycycline in children during the acute phase of KD, by the quantification of pro- MMP-9 and MMP-9 levels (measured by ELISA) in serum samples of children before and after a 3-week course of doxycycline treatment, and comparing the changes to controls of children with acute KD and no doxycycline treatment. Specific aim 2: To assess the change in coronary artery diameter in response to a 3- week oral administration of doxycycline in children during the acute phase of KD, by assessing the size of coronary arteries using established echocardiographic standards during 4 time-points in the acute phase of KD and comparing to controls of children with acute KD and no doxycycline treatment. Based on the results of this pilot study, we will develop a prospective, multi-center, blinded controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of doxycycline treatment in the prevention of CAD and aneurysm. If doxycycline proves to be beneficial, we will propose a change of the currently accepted treatment protocol of children with KD to include doxycycline for the prevention of coronary artery aneurysms and potentially fatal complications."
"9357414","Core 1: Biospecimen and Pathology Core (BiPC) SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Biospecimen and Pathology Core (BiPC, Core 1), a biorepository and multi-faceted research resource led by experienced neuropathologists and cell biologists with ongoing active research expertise, will provide critical support for the translational prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic studies proposed in the UCLA SPORE in Brain Cancer. Working closely with the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Data Management Core (BBD, Core 3), BiPC will maximize optimal biospecimen collection/storage and efficient disbursement of consented, clinically annotated, and molecularly characterized biospecimens. This Core will support all four SPORE projects with 24/7 tissue procurement, clinical and family history annotation, and molecular characterization of tissues, plus research support in gliomasphere/neurosphere cultures, tissue microarray, and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX). The Biospecimen and Pathology Core Co-Directors and Investigators have a long collaboration history with each other and with all the SPORE Project Leaders, as shown in joint publications, grants, and consortia. In addition to an excellent program for the collection, processing, storage, and dissemination of important biospecimens in support of the proposed SPORE research projects, the BiPC agenda goes well beyond these core functions to the innovative development of new scientific approaches for the maximization of rare/sparse specimen collection and the development of new animal models for therapeutic drug discovery. As part of this core, brain cancer cells grown in animals will be specially adapted to have a fluorescent label so that growth or shrinkage of the tumor can be serially followed in vivo when experimental treatments are given to the animals. The BiPC will develop and provide these materials, resources, and information to SPORE investigators and others, both inside and outside of UCLA. An outstanding team of experienced, accomplished, determined, and productive investigators has been assembled for this Biospecimen and Pathology Core. It also has strong institutional commitment in an excellent collaborative environment, which will help to ensure the success of the overall goals of this SPORE proposal."
"9285813","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studies of non-human mammals show that androgens, particularly testosterone (T), during early development play a major role in sexual differentiation of the brain, with long-term consequences for behavior. Research on clinical populations suggests that prenatal T exposure has similar effects in humans, increasing male-typical behavior and reducing female-typical behavior. Almost nothing is known, however, about the impact of early T exposure on the structure of the human brain. In addition, the brain mechanisms underlying T-related behavioral changes are unknown. This project will study brain structure and behavior in individuals with one of two disorders of sex development (DSD, also called intersex conditions) that are characterized by androgen abnormality beginning prenatally: 1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which causes overproduction of adrenal androgens; and 2. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), which involves an inability to respond to androgens, and so an effective lack of androgen exposure. CAH affects both males and females, and 35 men and 35 women with CAH will be compared to 35 male and 35 female controls. Individuals with CAIS are XY females, and 35 females with CAIS will be compared to 35 male and 35 female controls. State-of- the-art imaging technology will be used to map brain structure. Also, aspects of behavior, known to show substantial sex differences, and for which there is evidence of a relationship to prenatal T exposure, will be assessed. Specifically, these are mental rotation ability, targeting ability, and propensities to physical aggression (where men score higher than women), and verbal fluency, fine motor ability and empathy (where women score higher than men). The information obtained will provide convergent evidence regarding the influence of T on human brain and behavior. Convergent evidence is important because ethical considerations preclude experimental manipulations of T during early human development. Instead, naturally occurring conditions that involve T excess or deficiency will be studied. Each condition involves consequences in addition to T abnormality. Therefore, confidence that testosterone caused any brain or behavior differences is strengthened when data from both conditions suggest this conclusion. For instance, prior research indicates that, with respect to physical aggression, men score higher than women, and females with CAH score higher than other females. If XY females with CAIS resemble women rather than men in regard to physical aggression, confidence that T is the responsible agent will be increased. The information obtained will enhance understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in sexual differentiation of human brain and behavior, and so will be relevant to the many psychological disorders that differ by sex. It will also be relevant to clinical management of individuals who have experienced T abnormality before birth, for any of several reasons, including genetic disorders, such as CAH or CAIS, or other disorders of sex development, maternal treatment with hormones during pregnancy, or contact with environmental endocrine disruptors."
"9401980","PROJECT SUMMARY Adherence is a major problem for the approximately one-third of Americans over the age of 20 who suffer from Hypertension (HTN). Hypertension can be controlled through medication adherence and lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise). However, nearly 50% of those with HTN report poor adherence to their antihypertensive medications, lifestyle changes, or both as the primary reason for failing to control their blood pressure. Currently, behavioral interventions are limited to providing education or reminding individuals to take better care of themselves by starting and adhering to a proper diet and exercise program. Given the lack of adherence reported, education and reminders alone may not be sufficient to promote health behavior change. Interventions that appeal to individual's internal drive may be more effective, given that behavior adoption and maintenance are usually associated with intrinsic motivation and volition. Mindfulness practice is an intervention that shows promise in changing lifestyle behaviors. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of UCLA's Mindful Awareness Program (UCLAMAP) on promoting self-management behaviors, specifically adherence to medication, diet, and exercise among those with HTN. We will randomize 52 individuals between the ages 40 to 64 who have difficulty with adherence to antihypertensive medications and lifestyle changes to the intervention group or the attention-control group. The intervention includes six sessions of the mindfulness training through UCLA's Mindful Awareness Research Center (MARC). The Cohen's d metric will be used to determine the effect size of UCLAMAP on adherence to medication, diet, and exercise. Quantitative measures of adherence to UCLAMAP, program satisfactions scores, and frequency of daily mindfulness practice will be assessed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the UCLAMAP. The findings will establish effect size and feasibility of mindfulness as an intervention for improving health behaviors in patients with HTN, and provide evidence as to whether such an approach should be pursued in a comprehensive study."

"9407945","P7. Abstract This project aims to site-specifically characterize transient interactions between HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and its binding partners by solution NMR and to investigate the effects of such interactions on the dynamics of the interacting system. Solution NMR studies of RT and complexes thereof are challenging, given the size of the RT heterodimer. This necessitates developing and applying new methodological approaches suited for investigations of large molecular complexes. While the current RT X-ray structures provide important insights into how RT interacts with drugs and substrate, they are static snapshots of a subset of conformational states captured through crystallization. These structures do not inform on the motions within the protein or complex, which are critically connected to its functions. In this project, we will fill the existing knowledge gap and determine the functionally important dynamics in RT. Specifically, we will i) identify which domains and residues of RT are involved in the interaction with Integrase (IN); ii) delineate specifically the intermolecular contacts on RT and determine the RT/IN dynamics; and iii) determine the biological significance of structural or dynamics changes in RT upon IN and nucleic acid binding. To accomplish the specific aims of this project, we will employ a multi-pronged approach encompassing solution NMR as well as enzymology and virology studies. We will combine the complementary expertise of the PCHPI investigators and collaborators and work in close synergy to tackle the important questions concerning the role of dynamics in RT for HIV infection."
"9324039","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Membrane  protein  complexes  remain  the  last  major  challenge  in  biochemistry  and  molecular  biology. Although major advances have been made crystallizing selected membrane proteins and complexes, many membrane proteins of unknown function remain to be studied. This is even truer for complexes in the membrane.  Here  we  propose  to  tackle  this  problem  by  an  integrated  analysis  of  membrane  protein  complexes  in  E.  coli,  not  only  a  major  microbial  model  system  but  also  the  only  species  in  which  the  topology  of  all  membrane  proteins  has  been  determined  experimentally.  In the course of this project, we will purify most or all membrane protein complexes of E. coli and analyze their composition by mass spectrometry.  We have successfully carried out such an analysis in yeast and thus predict to obtain several hundred protein complexes. Independently, we will screen all cytoplasmic domains of E. coli membrane proteins for interactions using multiple yeast two-hybrid systems. In addition, we will map interactions of membrane proteins using a bacterial two-hybrid system to ensure in vivo assay conditions. These studies will allow us to map the topologies of membrane protein complexes and link those proteins to soluble proteins in the cytoplasm. Finally, we will focus on uncharacterized membrane proteins found in the aforementioned screens, especially transporters, and analyze their in vivo interactions and functions in detail using mutations and specialized assays to determine their activities (such as transport) using high throughput protocols. Bioinformatic analysis will assist all of the three subprojects. To our knowledge no such integrated study of this scale has been attempted before. The results of this project will have a broad impact on membrane protein biology in both microbes and eukaryotes, including biotechnological and medical applications. For instance, membrane proteins are common targets of antimicrobials and this project will identify new targets but also elucidate the moleculr function of many of these (hitherto uncharacterized) transmembrane proteins."

"9290052","PROJECT SUMMARY  The overarching objectives of this proposal are to investigate whether existing urinary mRNA and metabolite profiles, which are diagnostic and prognostic for early renal allograft injury in adults, can be validated in pediatric kidney transplant recipients.  Children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a life expectancy at least 20 years shorter than children without renal disease. During their lifetime, most children with ESRD will require several kidney transplants to prolong duration and quality of life. Each transplant incurs new surgical and immunological risk. Despite substantial gains in improving short-term allograft outcomes through improved immunosuppressive regimens, the half-life of a kidney transplant is still only 10-12 years. Thus, there is a critical need to prolong allograft survival. A major hindrance to advancing long-term outcomes is the inability to reliably detect early allograft injury before clinical manifestations arise. Early allograft injury results from acute cellular or antibody- mediated rejection or early emergence of viruses, primarily BK virus which leads to BK virus nephropathy.  This project?s specific aims are: 1) to validate highly sensitive and specific adult urinary cell mRNA signatures to diagnose and predict acute cellular rejection (ACR) in pediatric recipients, 2) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of urine metabolite profiling to diagnose and prognosticate ACR in pediatric recipients and to validate the sensitivity and specificity of a combined adult kidney allograft urinary mRNA and metabolite signature for ACR in pediatric recipients and 3) to investigate if BKV-VP-1 mRNA levels in urinary cells are diagnostic of BK virus associated nephropathy, and if urinary cell levels of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 mRNA and serum creatinine, predict future graft failure. These aims will be achieved through the collaborative effort of key pediatric kidney transplant programs across the United States and Canada, supported by two outstanding labs at Weill Cornell Medicine and Stanford. This study?s results will advance the ability to identify and characterize early allograft injury in pediatric kidney allograft recipients through non-invasive immune surveillance. By doing so, we will create opportunities to better inform clinical decision-making, improving practice paradigms to promote positive long-term graft outcomes."
"9405117","The Pacific Island Countries (PICs) are classified as Low to Middle Income Countries. Recently depression and suicide have emerged as pressing public health concerns in PICs. The suicide rate in these countries is twice that in neighboring Australia, and in Fiji, a leading PIC, the suicide rate is one the highest worldwide. Further, there are only 15 ? 20 qualified psychiatrists to serve a more than 11 million people in the PICs. Since training qualified psychiatrists is expensive and lengthy, the government of Fiji is wishes to use their Community Health Nurses (CHNs) as the front line in providing mental health services. Since CHNs receive very little training in mental health, it wants to urgently develop mobile health (mHealth) systems to improve CHNs performance for early identification of depression and suicide risk. However, a barrier to the efficacious design of mHealth tools is that very little research has been done that directly examines the nature of the cognitive processes underlying diagnostic screening and management for mental health disorders, taking into account technology, use of evidence- based guidelines, and socio-cultural factors. An overarching goal of our research is to find more efficient and effective ways to deliver mental health care by CHNs by understanding the nature of their decision-making in screening and managing of mental health disorders with and without clinical guideline support. Specifically, we will elucidate the cognitive mechanisms, including the use of knowledge and the strategies underlying CHNs performance in diagnostic and management tasks. We will investigate the differences in these mechanisms for CHNs under three conditions: 1) Current standard of care, using existing training and texts, 2) Using paper-based screening tools; and 3) Using step-by-step algorithmic screening guidelines on smart phones. We will also gather data on CHNs acceptance, usability, and perceived workload when using smart phones. Results of this research will lead to a better understanding of cognitive mechanisms underlying use of mHealth technologies by CHNs, leading to an actionable and generalizable framework for design and development of effective mHealth systems for early identification of depression and suicide risk in the PICs. In addition, we will enhance mHealth research capacity in Fiji through development of a conceptual framework and specific strategies to improve research competencies and skills. We propose to use a ?train the trainers approach? resulting in a cadre of researchers in Fiji capable of performing rigorous mHealth research sensitive to socio-cultural factors and help bridge the gap between research and practice."
"9345789","ABSTRACT  Despite the importance of maternal meiotic errors to the etiology of human chromosome abnormalities, we know very little about chromosome dynamics during human female meiosis, and remain ignorant of the reasons why the process is so error-prone. Further, we have little understanding of the basis of the sex-specific differences in meiotic error rate or recombination patterns in our species. The studies that comprise this renewal application will directly examine meiosis in human oocytes and spermatocytes. By combining this approach with molecular and quantitative methodologies, we will answer fundamental questions about meiosis in humans. We will examine and compare the way in which homologous chromosomes find and synapse with one another during meiotic prophase in the human female and male and ask how synaptic patterns influence the formation of crossovers. In addition, because the placement of crossovers established during the fetal stages of oogenesis affects chromosome segregation in the adult female, we will combine the data obtained from human studies with studies in the mouse to test different models proposed to explain the relationship between recombination and nondisjunction. Finally, we will examine the contribution of chromatin structure and interference to sex-specific differences in recombination rates.  The clinical implications of the basic information obtained from these studies are considerable: Aneuploidy is the most common cause of miscarriage and birth defects in our species. Understanding the mechanics of the meiotic process in humans and sex-specific differences not only provides a crucial first step in the development of therapeutic approaches to prevent or at least minimize errors, but also critical information for the development of systems for producing gametes in vitro to treat human infertility."
"9263022","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High frequency deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) dramatically ameliorates most but not all symptoms of Parkinson's disease. STN DBS exerts a powerful influence over two nuclei that regulate ocolumotor and skeletomotor control (substantia nigra pars reticulata and globus pallidus internus). As such, STN DBS should influence eye-hand coordination. There is also mounting evidence that STN DBS can impair performance of occulomotor and skeletomotor tasks that require using memory and use frontostriatal circuits, especially when bilateral STN DBS is used. As such the long-term objective of the application is the study of the positive and negative effects of STN DBS using tasks designed to probe neural circuits involved during visually and memory guided movements. We will pursue 4 specific aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that bilateral STN DBS improves the performance of visually guided eye movements (Aim 1A) and visually guided hand movements (Aim 1B) more than unilateral STN DBS or being off STN DBS. In this aim, there are no memory requirements since targets for both eye and hand moments are always visible. We will also study the effects of STN DBS voltage level on visually guided eye-hand coordination by testing 2 fixed voltage settings. Fixed voltage settings will allow us to determine whether it is the magnitude of the voltage or bilateral stimulation itself tht causes any performance decrement. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that unilateral STN DBS can improve selected measures of performance of memory-guided saccades (Aim 2A), and memory guided movements (Aim 2B) more than bilateral STN DBS or being off STN DBS. The idea is that bilateral STN DBS adversely affects dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and this interferes with both occulomotor and skeletomotor performance. We will again study the effects of STN DBS voltage level on memory-guided eye-hand coordination by testing 2 fixed voltages. Aim 3A tests the hypothesis that the surgical lesion itself causes improvements in eye and eye- hand coordination measures compared to while being off medication prior to the surgery. Prior to surgery, Aim 3B tests the hypothesis that medication will improve eye and eye-hand coordination measures compared to while being off medication. Aim 3C compares the optimal medical treatment state prior to surgery and the optimal surgical treatment state after surgery. Aim 3C tests the hypothesis that medication will improve selected memory guided eye and eye-hand coordination measures more than bilateral stimulation. Aim 4 tests the hypothesis that three years of chronic stimulation will improve movement speed but not coordination of eye-hand movements. The outcome of the studies will meet a critical need in clinical neurology and basic neurophysiology by assessing the extent to which unilateral STN DBS, bilateral STN DBS, and dopaminergic medication affects eye-hand coordination in PD in the short and long term."
"9486259","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is an increasing need to develop strategies for pulp regeneration therapy to overcome tooth injury due to caries, restorative procedures, or trauma. Currently, there is a significant gap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating reparative dentinogenesis. Our long-term goal is to gain fundamental knowledge on the human dental pulp cellular niche and to apply that knowledge to lessen the burdens of tooth injury due to caries, restorative procedures, or trauma. The objective for this application is to elucidate how the interactions between ephrinB1 and IGF-1 in the dental pulp niche induce dentinogenesis in vivo. The overarching hypothesis is that IGF-1 regulates cells of the tooth pulp niche, and induces dentinogenesis via ephrinB1. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following two specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanism by which ephrinB1 controls the number of odontoblast progenitors, their proliferation, and differentiation in the tooth pulp. And Aim 2: Determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IGF-1 regulates ephrinB1 expression in vivo using mouse models and ex vivo using human DPSCs and human oral mucosa stem cells. An already-generated odontoblast-specific ephrinB1 knockout mouse lines (using cre driven by the DMP1 or osteocalcin promoters), and mouse lines of IGF-1 receptor (DMP1-IGF-1RKO) and the hepatic IGF-1 transgenic (HIT) line will be used to achieve the two aims. Importantly, initial characterization of our models indicates that both IGF-1 and ephrinB1 involved in dentinogenesis in vivo. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because we show, for the first time, the interactions between ephrinB1 and IGF-1 during dentinogenesis in vivo. Further, we offer a direct approach to determine these interactions using unique mouse models, as well as primary human dental pulp cell cultures. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance the field of regenerative endodontic procedures and will impact the overall effort to retain the natural tertiary dentin formation process following injury."
"9217574","Abstract  A reduction in disease severity is the most likely indicator that an RSV vaccine is effective in young infants, the  highest priority target population. However, we don't have precise markers to objectively assess RSV disease  severity, which has made the evaluation of RSV vaccines in infants challenging. By applying a systems  immunology approach our goal is to define the immune profiles, serum antibody responses, and RSV NS  variants in infants with mild RSV infection, who represent the ideal model of a desirable vaccine induced  outcomes. Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that robust interferon (IFN) and innate immune  responses, related in part to viral NS1 and/or NS2 variants, result in optimal B-cell activation, antibody  responses (measured in Core C), and improved clinical outcomes in RSV infected infants. Identification of the  ?safe and protective? profile to natural RSV infection will inform the selection of vaccine candidates (develop in  Projects 1,2,3) in cotton rats (Core B) that should induce similar (or improved) profiles. In addition, these  prototype profiles will serve as surrogate markers for the ?safe and protective? response in future vaccine trials  testing the live attenuated RSV vaccine developed in this P01. We will test our hypothesis with the following  specific aims: 1) Define the blood transcriptional signatures that correlate with mild RSV infection; 2) Define  quantity and neutralizing activity of specific RSV antibodies associated with acute and long-term protection  from severe RSV infection; 3) Identify the RSV NS1 and NS2 gene haplotypes that best correlate with disease  severity."
"9357415","Core 2: Neuro-Imaging Core (NIC) SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The extremely poor prognosis and lack of effective treatments for glioblastoma (GBM) remains a significant public health issue. While traditional MRI techniques are valuable in determining GBM response to common anti-neoplastic therapies, novel treatments including immunotherapies, anti-angiogenic agents, or therapies that alter tumor metabolism may result in radiographic changes that are challenging to differentiate from non- responsive or growing tumor. Therefore, the primary goal of the Neuro-Imaging Core (NIC) will be to provide advanced MRI and PET imaging support with established reliability and consistency to SPORE project investigators for their respective projects. Specifically, the NIC will use quantitative ?MRI and ?PET for pre- clinical imaging (Aim 1) and state-of-the-art MR and PET imaging acquisition, advanced post-processing, and novel analysis tools for clinical imaging of patients in novel clinical trials (Aim 2). Hence, this Core will add value to the overall SPORE by helping investigators to better understand the in situ metabolic, physiologic, and traditional radiographic changes within the brain and tumor in order to address specific objectives of each of the UCLA Brain Cancer SPORE projects. Another main goal of the NIC is to understand the link between metabolic and/or physiologic imaging and tumor biology in order to reliably delineate treatment response versus recurrent tumor (Aim 3), which in turn will facilitate the direct translation of new MR-PET companion biomarkers/techniques to the clinic for the evaluation of treatment response in ongoing and new therapeutic clinical trials resulting from the SPORE projects and cores."
"9321089","PROJECT SUMMARY ? Clinical Core The Clinical Core (CC) supports and promotes research that advances the ADC's goal of understanding the complex determinants of cognitive impairment and dementia in diverse older adults. The Core recruits and maintains a large (410 active case) longitudinal cohort (LC) that is ethnoracially and demographically diverse, that has been followed longitudinally for many years, and that is richly characterized with measures that include sophisticated neuropsychological tests and state-of-the-art neuroimaging. This cohort supports multiple R01s and has provided the basis for over 200 papers. The features of the cohort are closely linked to the four scientific themes of the ADC. In accordance with our interest in studying preclinical disease and diagnostic transitions (Theme 1), most cohort participants (60%) were enrolled when cognitively normal and 31% of the overall cohort has transitioned to a more impaired diagnostic status. Cognitive decline, even in the cognitively normal, has been readily measurable. Thus, the LC provides an excellent resource for studies of change and trajectory. Due to community recruitment, the LC is highly diverse (>40% Hispanic or African American, >20% with under 12 yrs. education) and provides excellent heterogeneity in lifecourse factors that may influence cognitive reserve and resiliancy (Theme 2). The cohort has representative prevalences of the common vascular risk factors and most cases have multiple pathologies at autopsy, providing a valuble resource for studying mixed pathology (Theme 3). The CC works closely with the OR Core on recruitment and retention of the LC. The CC consents, evaluates participants annually, and obtains autopsy pre-consents. The CC supports recruitment for funded research projects, including ADC pilot studies. The CC maintains a Clinical Trials Unit that conducts industry and academic sponsored treatment trials. The CC provides reliable and valid diagnoses. It provides a broad set of measures, extending well beyond the UDS, which are collected on a standardized schedule and selected to support the scientific themes. It collaborates with the Neuropathology Core to obtain DNA, serum and plasma samples (supporting Theme 4 on Biomarkers), facilitate brain procurement/autopsy, and to present monthly Clinical Pathological Conferences. The CC coordinates with the Neuroimaging Core to obtain serial structural MRI/resting state fMRI, and molecular imaging PET studies. The CC works closely with the Administrative Core to plan subject recruitment and data collection protocols; with Data/Biostatistics to promptly transfer CC data into the database and maintain quality control; and with REC to educate/mentor AD researchers. RELEVANCE: The CC supports many research projects relevant to advances in the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of dementia. The CC aims to advance our understanding of how various risk and protective factors affect cognitive trajectories across the spectrum of cognitive aging in our ethnically-diverse cohort. Understanding the factors (biological and lifestyle) which accelerate or protect against cognitive decline could foster healthy brain aging and have a major impact on the public health."
"9437627","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein acetylation is the most ancient and common form of posttranslational modification, and the vast majority of the human proteome is acetylated. Protein acetylation is mediated by protein lysine acetyltransferases (KATs), which are grouped into Histone ATs (HATs) and non-histone ATs, and protein N-terminal ATs (NATs). In mammalian cells, KATs acetylate thousands of proteins, spanning a wide class spectrum, including transcription factors, kinases, ubiquitinligases, ribosomal proteins and metabolic enzymes, and mediating a broad range of cellular activities, including cell cycle control, DNA damage check-points, cytoskeleton organization, endocytosis and metabolism. The posttranslational and cotranslational process of N-terminal acetylation by NATs occurs on ~85% of human proteins and is also involved in numerous biological processes including cellular apoptosis, enzyme regulation, protein localization, rDNA transcriptional regulation and protein degradation. Aberrant AT activities have also been associated with several diseases including solid and haematological cancers, rare genetic disorders, and metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders, thus implicating ATs as attractive drug targets for therapy. Despite the importance of ATs, mechanistic information is largely limited to the isolated catalytic AT domains, and the critical role played by AT cofactor and auxiliary proteins in mediating AT-regulated cellular pathways are largely unknown. In addition, potent, selective and cell permeable AT inhibitors as molecular probes for AT-mediated pathways and as lead molecules for therapy are generally not available. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanisms of protein acetylation by HATs, non-histone KATs and NATs, with a particular focus on addressing the following unresolved and important questions and goals in the field: (A) How are HATs regulated by cofactor proteins for substrate-specific acetylation? (B) What are the unique AT properties of non-histone KATs? (C) How do auxiliary proteins and ribosome association contribute to NAT function? (D) Can we leverage mechanistic and structural information to develop potent and selective protein AT inhibitors?"
"9253672","A substantial amount of effort has been devoted to the identification of host factors that might allow prediction of clinical outcomes in patients with bacterial infections, and sophisticated models and scoring systems have been developed for this purpose. These models, however, do not account for possible differences in virulence between the bacterial strains causing the infection. It stands to reason that if some strains within a particular bacterial species are more virulent than others, patients infected with these strain would be at increased risk for poor outcomes. We have used the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) as an example to investigate these questions. We used a mouse model of bacteremia to measure the 50% lethal dose (LD50) values of 100 PA isolates from patients with bloodstream infections. These LD50 values differed by three orders of magnitude. We then sequenced the genomes of all 100 PA isolates and used comparative genomic approaches to identify 15 accessory genomic elements (AGEs ? DNA sequences found in some strains within a species but not others) over-represented in the highly virulent isolates. We individually deleted each of these15 AGEs and compared the virulence of the parental and deletion strains in the mouse model of bacteremia. We found that 13 of the 15 AGEs contributed to virulence and thus encoded factors important for pathogenesis. Our hypothesis is that AGEs such as these serve as biomarkers for PA strains capable of causing especially severe infections in people. To test this hypothesis, we will determine whether PA AGEs that cause increased virulence in mice are also associated with worse outcomes in people. We will also perform a second approach that does not depend on mouse model results but relies only on outcomes in patients. In this unbiased comparative genomics approach, we will identify all AGEs in a large collection of PA isolates from patients with bacteremia and determine which of these AGEs are associated with increased mortality. Findings from both approaches will be confirmed in the second cohort of patients with PA bacteremia. Completion of this proposal will yield a set of AGEs that are associated with PA strains capable of causing especially severe infections associated with high mortality rates. Such information will be useful in identifying patients at high risk for poor outcomes and will allow clinicians to target these patients with particularly aggressive therapies."
"9262751","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          ABSTRACT Progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a progressive increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) related nonfatal and fatal events as well as of all-cause mortality. In patients free of CKD, elevated concentration of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC and LDLc), triglycerides (TG) and low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) are associated with increased risk of CVD events and death. Consequently, one of the main interventions used in cardiovascular prevention is lipid lowering drug therapy, namely use of statins. High dose statins are recommended in high-risk patients based on strong study evidence. In CKD, the benefit and risk of high dose statin is not well documented. In addition, previous studies have suggested that with progression of CKD, the association between TC and LDLc with CVD events or mortality is weakened and that statin therapy is less effective, but this has not been sufficiently documented. Niacin and fen fibrate have been used for cardiovascular prevention in addition to statins in patients free of CKD with questionable results. They have never been used in treating patients with CKD, but there are reasons to believe that their use in these patients might result in clinical benefit. Furthermore, previous studies have documented differences in risk, outcome associations and disease development between race, age, and other demographic and comorbidity subgroups of CKD patients. Studies in CKD patients of racial-ethnic, age and other differences in associations of lipids and lipid altering drugs with outcomes are not available and are necessary.  The applicant is proposing to study these associations in over half a million VA patients. This large cohort will  enable separate study of each stage of CKD progression as well as each one of the subgroups. Basing the guidelines on solid epidemiological data from large cohorts could lead to a unifying concept for use of lipid modulating drugs and indicate direction for future clinical trials.  The main training objective of this proposal is to provide Dr. Streja with experience and expertise in clinical research while expanding her knowledge in statistics, nephrology and lipidology. The scientific objectives of this career development award project are 1) to establish the associations between lipid and clinical outcomes in CKD patients 2) to do so in different stages of CKD progression, 3) to analyze the effectiveness and safety of statin therapy in moderate and high dose in all stages of CKD, 4) to analyze these associations in various demographic subgroups, and 5) to analyze the potential benefit of lipid lowering drugs other than statins in CKD patients.  The proposed application is the first comprehensive study in clinical lipidology applied to non-dialysis dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) in a large cohort which should result in an authoritative answer in this unexplored area of physiology and therapeutics. The study should lead to a new rational paradigm in lipid management in NDD-CKD and to improve veterans' outcomes throughout the nation.  This CDA project will be conducted in a supportive multi-disciplinary environment with a group of mentors who are renowned experts in different aspects of this proposal, including VA staff physicians and scientists. The mentorship and comprehensive training program proposed in this application are designed to build on the training and expertise that the applicant has acquired so far in her career. Furthermore, this novel and promising proposal will pave the way for future studies supported by VA Merit Awards, which examine the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in the veteran patient population. Hence, the proposed project will also prepare and transition the applicant to a career as an independent investigator in the VA Healthcare System."

"9360616","SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time. Thus, we will be able to localize and measure the activity of thousands or millions of individually active neurons in large volumes of cerebral cortical tissue."
"9534355","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mediators of DNA damage, such as ionizing radiation, are frequently used for cancer therapy. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and severe form of brain tumor that is unfortunately resistant to most DNA damaging modalities, though they remain the standard of care. Here, in an attempt to define genetic determinants of therapeutic resistance in brain tumors, we have identified a novel mechanism of resistance to DNA damage that tumors employ that depends on the overexpression of a metabolic enzyme that we hypothesize is involved in regulating DNA and chromatin dynamics. The enzyme, spermidine/spermine-N1- acetyltrasferase 1 (SAT1), is a rate-limiting regulator of the catabolism of polyamines, ubiquitous positively charged small molecules that have been found to promote condensation of chromatin. By overexpressing SAT1, tumors are better prepared to repair deleterious double strand DNA breaks which require opening of chromatin to perform repair. In this application, we propose to 1) determine the mechanism of regulation of DNA repair by SAT1, 2) investigate the role of SAT1 as an epigenetic regulator of DNA repair related gene expression, and 3) determine the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting SAT1 expression in human tumors xenografted in mice. The overall goal is to determine if the polyamine pathway provides a novel target for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma, while simultaneously revealing a previously unappreciated aspect of DNA repair regulation that depends on polyamine metabolism and chromatin remodeling."
"9335990","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anterograde mitochondrial transport in neuronal axons is mediated by a primary motor/adaptor complex which includes motor protein KHC (kinesin heavy chain), and two mitochondrial adaptors milton and Miro (Glater et al., 2006). In the current model, Miro, an outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein, binds to milton which in turn binds to KHC, to recruit mitochondria to motors and microtubules (Guo et al., 2005, Fransson et al., 2006, Glater et al., 2006). During my postdoctoral training, I discovered that two PD proteins PINK1 and Parkin target Miro for degradation to promote damage-induced mitophagy (Wang et al., 2011). This is consistent with our preliminary observation conducted in my own laboratory that mutant Parkin fibroblasts from one PD patient are failed to degrade Miro after mitochondrial damage and are impaired in mitophagy. The most common genetic form of hereditary PD is caused by a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain Ser/Thr kinase with unknown functions and unconfirmed substrates. Surprisingly, we found that Miro is also retained on damaged mitochondria in fibroblasts from one PD patient with LRRK2G2019S. In addition, we have preliminary evidence that in LRRK2G2019S iPSC (inducible pluripotent stem cells)-derived neurons from two PD patients, damaged mitochondria fail to stop and to undergo mitophagy, reminiscent of those found in mutant PINK1 or Parkin rodent models (Wang et al., 2011). Therefore, LRRK2G2019S, just like PINK1 or Parkin mutations, prevents Miro protein from degradation on damaged mitochondria, disrupting mitochondrial motility and mitophagy. However, there has been no evidence directly linking LRRK2 to Miro and mitochondrial transport. What is the mechanism underlying the same phenotype caused by distinct PD mutations? In this proposal, we aim to unravel this puzzle. We hypothesize that LRRK2 and PINK1/Parkin operate in parallel pathways but eventually converge on the common substrate Miro. In an alternative model, LRRK2 may not directly phosphorylate Miro, but rather it could genetically or physically interact with and regulate PINK1 or Parkin to control damaged mitochondrial transport and clearance by influencing turn-over of Miro. The molecular mechanism we will define in this research proposal will provide insight into LRRK2-related PD pathogenesis, especially for patients with LRRK2G2019S, which represents about 5-6% of the total cases (Bonifati, 2006). In addition to its relevance to PD, we also expect our results elucidating the mechanisms underlying neuronal mitochondrial transport and clearance to illuminate basic principles of mitochondrial biology and neurobiology. Thus, we propose to use a combination of Drosophila genetics, cultured cells, and even PD patient fibroblasts and derived neurons to pursue the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: To determine the mechanism by which LRRK2 influences the turnover of Miro. Aim 2: To determine the physical relationship between LRRK2 and Miro. Aim 3: To dissect the relationship between LRRK2 and the PINK1/Parkin pathway."
"9327797","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposed research is to generate a genetic architecture of brain development. We aim to achieve this goal in two solid steps. We first utilize our existing brain MR imaging measurements (traditional MRI volumetry, brain connectivity, resting state activity) of 235 individuals, 125 with autism and 110 typically developing subjects, to build a data structure of brain regions of interest that have at least 50% estimated heritability for typical brains, sorted first by size and then by components of structura-functional variability. In our next step, we interrogate whole-exome and whole-genome sequences and network analysis of molecular pathways by state-of-the-art molecular genetics methods in reference to this data structure. We expect that this detailed analysis of variability and extremes in brain imaging phenotypes in autism will result in the discovery of new genetic associations that reveal new biological pathways and advance our understanding of autism neuropathology and its severely impairing clinical manifestations. Our results will thus change imaging genetics in autism research."
"9328147","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major cause of death and disability in the United States. Current treatments target bronchospasm and inflammation of airways with the goal to reduce symptoms and prevent exacerbations. However, other than smoking cessation, no treatment has been found that modifies the progression of this disease. Moreover, COPD is a heterogeneous disease involving remodeling of both lung parenchyma (emphysema) and airways (chronic bronchitis). Research in mice exposed to cigarette smoke implicates TGF-beta signaling as a mediator of apoptosis that leads to emphysema. The development of emphysema can be prevented by blockade of the angiotensin-1 (AT1) receptor with drugs such as losartan. A pilot study of losartan in patients with COPD showed no overall improvement, but patients who had the emphysema phenotype demonstrated no progression of emphysema at 1 year compared to placebo treated patients who increased the percent of lung occupied by emphysema. These results did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06) but were strongly suggestive of a benefit in COPD patients with emphysema. The aim of this proposal is to conduct a definitive randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial to test whether administration of 100mg/day of losartan to patients with radiographic evidence of emphysema will slow progression of their disease compared to comparable individuals given placebo. Emphysema progression will be measured by high-resolution computed tomography using standardized procedures. The trial is designed to be a highly-focused pragmatic trial with sparse data collection that can be accomplished in community as well as academic settings."
"9385929","ABSTRACT Asthma affects boys more than girls, but gender-switch occurs after puberty and asthma is more common in women than men. This research proposal investigates gender effect(s) on asthma severity. The long-term goal of our studies is to identify sex related differences in genetic risks and biological pathways of severe asthma. Our analyses of large databases reveal that severe asthma exhibits a bimodal peak in young boys and middle age women [1, 2], which pointes to sex hormones in mechanisms of asthma severity [1]. Preliminary data of sex hormone levels in participants with asthma from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP I&II; 2001- 2012) shows that men with both low progesterone and low testosterone and women with low testosterone and high estradiol have the most severe airflow limitation. Additionally, our genome-wide association analyses of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) x sex interaction and candidate gene analyses of European American adults with asthma in SARP I & II shows sex-specific genetic associations with percent predicted FEV1, a marker of severe asthma. Based on the findings, we hypothesize that risk of severe asthma is gender dependent due to variation in levels of male and/or female sex hormones over the lifecourse and the consequent interactions of sex hormones with asthma risk variants that result in a bimodal peak of severe asthma in boys and women. In aim 1, we will assess SNP × sex interactions across the whole genome using genome wide interaction study (GWIS). We will also use a candidate gene approach, which will determine SNP x sex interactions in previously described asthma severity gene loci, such as lung function and immunity pathway genes. In aim 2, we investigate the effect of variations in sex hormone levels on the risk for severe asthma differentially in males and females. Equally important and parallel to the research plan, the career development plan is constructed for didactic coursework, one-on-one education and career guidance from strong mentors and collaborators expert in asthma, endocrinology, and analytical genetics. This research will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. Erzurum, Lerner Research Institute (LRI), Cleveland Clinic, and will be advised by experts in genomics and biochemical pathways unique to asthma. The LRI offers the ideal intellectual and research environment for success. The proposed research is innovative and significant as it may lay the groundwork for the care of patients with severe asthma in a personalized, gender specific way. Altogether the award will provide the candidate the knowledge, hands-on experience, expertise and productivity to develop into an independent physician-scientist focused on patient-centered mechanistic research."
"9360067","Project Summary The School of Medicine at UCR proposes to create a research education program to facilitate transfer of students into Biomedical and Behavioral science majors, with the ultimate goal of increasing participation of underrepresented minority groups in research-oriented careers in these areas. Many underrepresented minority (URM) students have less access to high quality science instruction, resources and enriching opportunities at all stages of public education. African Americans, Chicano/Latino, Native Americans, Hawaiian and Alaskan Natives, Pacific Islander or socio-economically disadvantaged students make up a small percentage of science teachers in K-12 as well as higher education, and are even more underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral science fields requiring post-graduate degrees. The proposed program, Riverside Bridges to the Baccalaureate (Riverside B2B) will be established between Riverside City College (RCC) and the University of California Riverside (UCR) to identify students committed to pursuing a career in science and facilitate their transfer and successful completion of Baccalaureate degrees in STEM majors, with a specific focus on biomedical and behavioral science-related research. The program contains interventions and support services designed to substantially improve the overall two-year graduation rate for RCC Bridges Scholars, to help them achieve graduation in a normative two-year window following matriculation at UCR, and to address the causes of URM attrition in STEM programs. Specific program components include: compensated research experiences to stimulate greater awareness of career options in the biomedical and behavioral sciences and to reduce the necessity of working in non-academic jobs; peer and faculty mentoring that begins before RCC Bridges Scholars transfer to UCR; and a summer ?boot camp? to familiarize incoming students with UCR's course structure and student support services. By creating a program that bridges the community college and four-year university education and provides adequate preparation before and mentoring after transfer, we believe we can overcome these disadvantages and improve the success and persistence of URM transfer students in biomedical and behavioral sciences at the University of California, Riverside."
"9407943","P5. Abstract Retroviral replication depends on integration of reverse transcribed viral DNA into a host cell chromosome. This process is catalyzed by integrase (IN) in the context of a stable synaptic complex, known as the intasome. The intasome is the target for IN strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), the only class of HIV IN antagonists currently approved to treat HIV/AIDS. Recent years saw characterization of the intasomes from several retroviral species, collectively elucidating the conserved intasomal core assembly (CIC) responsible for integration. We have now established the first lentiviral intasome model based on maedi-visna virus (MVV), which affords detailed structural studies of lentiviral integration in the absence of solubilizing or hyperactivating mutations in IN. The preliminary study of the MVV intasome by single particle cryo-EM in the Cherepanov laboratory revealed that it is much larger than its non-lentiviral counterparts, comprising a hexadecamer (tetramer-of-tetramers) of IN. In the proposed project we take advantage of the new system to study lentiviral DNA integration into chromatin and the role of the host cell factor LEDGF/p75 in this process. As a translational component of this project, we will develop a lentiviral intasome model for structural studies of INSTIs and the mechanisms of drug resistance."
"9253590","ABSTRACT Host immunity plays a major role in development of Tuberculosis disease. Tuberculosis infected individuals respond by formation of granulomas, which contain bacilli. However, organisms within granulomas are protected from the full scope of immune-mediated defenses. We hypothesize that modulation of destructive immune-mediated pathology, while preserving essential immune responses, will allow more effective immune control. The goal of these studies is therefore to assess bioactivity of novel recombinant human lactoferrins for use as an immune modulator to ameliorate granuloma pathology. Our aims are to determine lactoferrin's ability to limit destructive pathology, and to evaluate its immune modulatory effects an infectious challenge model of granulomatous response. To accomplish our goal, mice will be challenged with Mycobacterium tuberculosis treated with novel recombinant (CHO-derived) human lactoferrin by oral (gavage) administration. Models are set to look at both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. Lung tissue will be evaluated 28 days post challenge for changes in histology, immunopathology and inflammatory mediators. Spleen and liver will be monitored for organism dissemination. Change in lung pathology will be evaluated to assess lactoferrin's ability to alter delivery of antimycobacterial therapeutics to regions of infectivity within tissue. The proposal also includes production and safety/toxicity studies to validate the clinical utility of rhLF as a therapeutic, expressed in stable CHO (DG44) cells under GMP protocols. Our objectives include scale-up production of GMP quality of rhLF using a stable CHO cell line and assessment of safety using pre-IND, single and repeat day dose toxicology protocols in rats. Overall, these studies will (1) evaluate bioactivity of oral delivered novel recombinant mouse lactoferrin for use as a preclinical research tool in a mouse infectious challenge system to alter granuloma pathology to tuberculosis-related factors. This approach represents a novel therapeutic strategy for potential treatment of tuberculosis disease."
"9319741","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Objective: The goals of this Phase II SBIR proposal are to evaluate longer-term patency and safety of a novel hemodialysis access graft design (ePTFE treated with textured microporous silicone exterior layer) and complete the necessary development steps to prepare the device for clinical evaluation. The Phase I feasibility study demonstrated markedly superior patency and reduction of neointimal hyperplasia compared to untreated ePTFE controls through 12 weeks in a sheep model. Significance: The need for frequent treatments (at least 3x per week) makes maintenance of reliable vascular access for hemodialysis patients extremely challenging. As a result of high maturation failure in autogenous arteriovenous (AV) fistulas (the preferred vascular access option) and a reluctance to use AV grafts (the safest alternative) due to longer-term patency concerns, more than half of all first-year hemodialysis patients, and more than 20% longer term, are treated via unsafe last-resort infection-prone catheters. Loss of patency by AV grafts is primarily due to development of neointimal hyperplasia at the venous anastomosis, which causes progressive narrowing of the lumen, leading to unstable low flow followed by thrombosis failure. Successful clinical introduction of an AV graft overcoming the hyperplasia problem would increase access options, and especially, enable a significant reduction in the use of high-risk catheters. Innovation: A number of factors, including surgical trauma at time of implant, graft-vein compliance mismatch, and unfavorable hemodynamic shear stress patterns are known to contribute to neointimal hyperplasia. But the underlying root cause of the problem that causes synthetic AV grafts to fail is the self-reinforcing death spiral feedback loop (hyperplasia causes low flow, which upregulates the advance of hyperplasia). By treating ePTFE grafts with an exterior biointerface that prevents the formation of a fibrous perigraft tissue capsule, the usual mechanical constriction effects are eliminated. The retained natural dynamic compliance of the perigraft tissue permits greater freedom for elastic and vibratory motion of the graft wall. This reduces compliance mismatch and provides more favorable stress conditions at the ePTFE-neointima interface. It also changes the usual flow effect of hyperplasia. An increase in stenotic resistance is compensated via a mechanism that widens the upstream hydraulic diameter. This appears to replace the pathologic feedback loop with a more favorable self-stabilizing feedback loop. The promising Phase I results suggest that this approach can lead to a major leap in AV graft clinical performance and reliability. Approach: Specific aims are 1) evaluating long-term patency, 2) demonstrating cannulation safety, and 3) completing requisite function and reliability testing. The proposed R&D steps will support a subsequent IDE application for a First-In-Human Early Feasibility Study for this Class II device. Project success would offer a safer and more reliable treatment option for a large fraction of the dialysis patient population."
"9260149","Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries. In 2010, annual mortality from illness due to ETEC was estimated at 157,000 deaths (9 percent of all deaths attributed to diarrhea) and approximately 1 percent of all deaths in children 28 days to 5 years of age. ETEC cause disease by colonizing the small intestine with colonization factor antigens and cause secretory diarrhea through the actions of heat-labile (LT) or heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins. Development of natural immunity to ETEC requires years of recurrent infections, which raises the question as to what about this organism prevents the development of immunity. LT is highly immunogenic and induces antibodies to itself when given to human volunteers. On the other hand ST is a small non-immunogenic secreted peptide. We have recently begun to investigate the contribution of ST on ETEC pathogenesis. Our preliminary data indicate (1) ST expression is higher in defined 4AA media as compared to LB, sta1 gene (encoding STh) is up-regulated under anaerobic conditions, as could be found within the host intestinal tract, and iron-depletion decreases ST expression (2) ST binds both iron and iron- sulfur (FeS) clusters under these anaerobic conditions, in vitro (3) iron-bound forms of ST elicit less secretion than native ST in an in vivo model and less cGMP from intestinal epithelial cells in cell culture than native ST, and (4) ST suppresses fecal IgA and Th17 immune responses against ETEC H10407 (whole cell and O78- LPS). Based on the preliminary data, the hypotheses are that (1) sta1 is up-regulated in response to anaerobic conditions by specific cis and trans factors (2) ST can bind iron and FeS clusters, which regulate its toxicity, and (3) ST suppresses mucosal immunity to ETEC antigens thereby maintaining susceptibility of the host to recurrent infections by the same organism mediated by iron sensing. The specific aims are 1) Determine the environmental conditions that regulate transcription of genes encoding ST, 2) Characterize the iron and iron- sulfur cluster binding properties of ST and how this controls ST enterotoxicity, and 3) Determine how ST modifies mucosal immune responses to ETEC antigens. At the conclusion of these studies, growth conditions that result in enhanced ST expression and secretion will be elucidated. In addition, the role of iron and FeS clusters on ST toxicity will be clarified. Lastly, mechanisms concerning ST-mediated suppression of mucosal immune responses to ETEC antigens will provide compelling evidence for why it takes years of recurrent ETEC infections to develop natural immunity and inform vaccine development."
"9344830","Project Summary: This application will address the unmet need for superior treatment outcomes for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and will develop the tools needed for personalized treatment to allow a more expanded use of the unique anti-cancer drug called L-asparaginase. Unlike pediatric ALL, a disease with a cure rate of >90%, the cure rate of adult ALL is <40%. One significant difference between the treatment of pediatric and adult ALL patients is that only the pediatric regimen always includes the drug L-asparaginase. Indeed, it was shown that cure rates are highly dependent on using this drug, and for the patient being able to complete the full course of treatment. Unfortunately, the side effects of L-asparaginase treatment often require prematurely stopping use of this drug. These L-asparaginase side effects can be traced directly to the bacterial origin and properties of all current FDA-approved L-asparaginases (and not to the anti-cancer asparagine depletion effect of drug). Being bacterial enzymes, currently approved drugs are highly immunogenic. Although a portion of this clinical problem has recently been addressed by pegylating the enzyme, the other source of side effects, the L- glutaminase co-activity of these bacterial enzymes, still remains. We propose a strategy that would address both the immunogenic and L-glutaminase-related side effects, in which the bacterial enzymes are replaced by human-like L-asparaginases that are devoid of L-glutaminase co-activity. The more similar a biologic is to a human sequence, the less likely it would be immunogenic. In our work to date, we identified a mammalian L-asparaginase (referred to as gpASNas1) that is 70% identical to the human enzyme (as compared to the mere 25% identity of the bacterial enzymes), and we have increased that percentage identity to 85% by employing a genetic screen and structural information. In our proposed work here, we have identified a path that will increase this percent identity to >95%. As importantly, gpASNase1 is devoid of the toxicity-causing L-glutaminase activity, so as a drug, it will also lack those side effects that are caused by glutamine depletion. Critically, in a mouse xenograft model of human T-ALL and B-ALL, we observed a potent anti-cancer effect of these human-like L-asparaginase drugs, which serves to demonstrate that the L-glutaminase activity is not required for killing the cancer cells. Moreover, as compared to the L- glutaminase containing FDA drug, our L-asparaginase version without this co-activity has exhibited reduced toxicity. Thus, the L-asparaginase variant that will be developed by the proposed work will have a high impact on ALL therapy, especially for adults, and thus with special relevance for veterans. In addition to impacting ALL treatment, our vision is to expand the use of L-asparaginases to other malignancies. A main factor that currently prevents the expanded use of L-asparaginases (in addition to aforementioned side effects that will be largely reduced by our variants) is the lack of a method to identity patients who would most benefit from this drug. To remedy this deficiency and to promote personalizing medicine, we will first identify the factors that determine whether a cancer cell is sensitive or resistant to L- asparaginase, and then use this understanding to develop a predictive screen for L-asparaginase. Success in the proposed work will be transformative, as it will expand the use of L-asparaginases beyond ALL to other blood cancers, through the combination of a drug that is safer (by being less immunogenic and by lacking L-glutaminase co-activity) with a companion biomarker that can predict a patient's response to this drug."

Healthy cells that line the nasal passages normally emit significant levels of nitric oxide (NO), a potent and natural antimicrobial molecule that stimulates mucociliary clearance and reduces bacterial biofilm formation. Reduced levels of NO in the exhaled nasal breath of CRS patients suggest that boosting local NO concentrations within the sinuses may be quite beneficial. In Phase I of this project, NOTA Laboratories, LLC, clearly demonstrated that a naturally occurring and inexpensive NO releasing agent, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), can be incorporated into a typical saline/bicarbonate sinus rinse solution and generate adequate levels of NO to significantly reduce levels of live bacteria counts for two biofilm forming CRS microbes (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa). In these experiments, the bacterial biofilms were grown on the surface of human upper airway epithelial cells. We further demonstrated that the levels of GSNO and concomitant NO released do not harm the underlying human cells, as assessed by monitoring the levels of a toxicity-associated cytokine (IL-8). In addition, NOTA demonstrated that the release rates of NO from GSNO can be enhanced by the presence of ascorbate (Asc; vitamin C) and that the resulting powder formulations of GSNO/Asc can be stored for more than 6 months (at 37 °C) while retaining >80% of their NO release capability. Via Phase II SBIR funding, NOTA will: 1) Further optimize the concentration of the GSNO/Asc mixture within an isotonic NaCl/NaHCO3/EDTA solution and frequency of application for the in vitro disruption of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa biofilms formed on human upper airway epithelial cells over 3 d test periods; 2) Explore a commercial packaging process (in polymer film lined aluminum pouches) and test the resulting 1-year stability of a dry packaged GSNO/Asc/NaCl/NaHCO3/EDTA mixed powder that will be reconstituted in plastic sinus flush bottles with 240 mL of pure water immediately before use by patients; 3) Conduct animal studies in rabbits to determine if NOTA's reconstituted RSNO/Asc/NaCl/NaHCO3/EDTA formulation, given as an aerosol spray twice daily over a 7 d period, significantly decreases bacterial counts in the sinus cavities of infected rabbits (with CRS) vs. controls (only NaCl/NaHCO3/EDTA); and 4) Begin the regulatory process by obtaining expert assessments of the role of the FDA in approval of the new GSNO formulations as a potential over-the-counter product for the CRS market. The completion of these efforts during Phase II will enable NOTA to plan the first human subject clinical trials at the University of Michigan Sinus Center as part of Phase III studies."

"9312309","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Posttranslational modification by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein is essential for protein quality control. Defects in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis are pathogenic to various cardiac diseases including desmin-related cardiomyopathy (DRC) and myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, little is known about the importance of ubiquitin-like proteins such as NEDD8 in cardiac myocytes (CM) physiology and pathophysiology. Preliminary data in this application reveal a novel and underappreciated role of NEDD8 in the CM and form the basis of our long-term goal: to understand how NEDD8 signaling can be modulated to regulate CM function and ultimately cardiac disease. Conjugation or deconjugation of NEDD8 to target proteins (neddylation or deneddylation) is dynamically regulated by a family of enzymes. Neddylation regulates a variety of essential cellular processes including proteolysis. Our preliminary data reveal a striking increase of neddylated proteins in the hearts from animal models of cardiac diseases, as well as in human failing hearts with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. The buildup of neddylated proteins is functionally significant, as the mice deficient of a NEDD8 deconjuation enzyme develop severe cardiomyopathy through impairing proteolysis. Attenuation of neddylation by multiple means protects CMs from cell injury. These findings collectively indicate that the excessive neddylated proteins impairs proteolysis and are toxic to CMs, and that strategies to prevent/normalize neddylated proteins promote CM survival and function. NUB1L is a negative regulator of neddylation. NUB1L expression reduces neddylated proteins, enhances proteasomal function, and prevents stress-induced CM cell death. Therefore, the goal of the current project is to define the role of NUB1L in regulation of neddylation and protein degradation in the heart. We will test our central hypothesis that NUB1L reduces neddylated proteins and protects the heart against proteotoxic stress. Aim 1 will determine how NUB1L regulates neddylation and the impact of diminished neddylation on cardiac structure and function, using a novel transgenic mouse model. Aim 2 will test whether NUB1L expression enhances cardiac proteasomal function using a transgenic reporter, and determine whether suppression of neddylation regulates the removal of misfolded proteins in the heart and alters DRC progression. Aim 3 will determine the efficacy of suppression of neddylation, by both pharmacologic inhibitor and NUB1L expression, on myocardial I/R injury. Strategies to reduce neddylation may be effective therapeutic strategies to treat DRC and ischemic cardiomyopathy. The translational outcomes of this proposal include the preservation of muscle in myocardial infarction and prevention of heart failure, key missions of the NIH. The proposed studies are the first to target protein neddylation in models of cardiac diseases and will employ an innovative approach using genetically modified mice and pharmacologic intervention."
"9360625","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amblyopia is a developmental disorder of vision that affects 3-5% of children in the US. The goals of our work are to identify the neural mechanisms underlying the visual deficits and to evaluate specific hypotheses for the neural disorder. We study a nonhuman primate model for the human visual system so that we can directly assess the neural correlates of developmental visual disability without compromising the visual welfare of any child. The proposed work aims to evaluate the neural disorder of amblyopia with a series of matched behavioral and neurophysiological studies. Since amblyopia is predominantly a disorder of spatial vision, we plan to target the ventral visual cortical pathway. The framework for the research is to contrast two mechanistic hypotheses: 1) amblyopia is a disorder arising primarily at the first stages of cortical processing that is then passed along through subsequent levels of processing, essentially unmodified, or 2) amblyopia results from a cascade of deficits that emerge from a series of changes in cortical processing as signals traverse the ventral pathway. The planned experiments will directly evaluate neural activity as it relates to amblyopic performance deficits in ventral stream cortical areas V1, V2, and V4. We will use tasks ranging from low-level to higher-order to capture the range of individual losses in these three areas: Monocular and dichoptic contrast masking, second order contrast discrimination, naturalistic texture discrimination, and Gabor contour integration, as well as basic characterization of the first-order spatial deficit. The same stimuli will be employed for behavioral and neurophysiological testing in individual subjects. The recordings will be conducted in awake, behaving amblyopes with multi-electrode Utah arrays placed in the three ventral stream areas simultaneously. The goal is to record single and multi-unit activity simultaneously in foveal representations of the three target visual areas; we will also separately assess responses in the parafoveal visual field representation of V4. We will use population decoding and correlational analyses to compare behavioral performance and neural activity between the eyes of amblyopes, between amblyopes and controls, between different visual areas, and across specific visual tasks. The results will be used to evaluate and refine the current views on the neural disorder in amblyopia. In addition, we will learn about the neural mechanisms underlying form perception in normal individuals. Our research will ultimately inform efforts to treat and prevent amblyopia development in children."
"9307232","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Specific configurations of the gut microbiome have been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but how gut microbes, their metabolites, and their interactions with the immune system potentiate colorectal carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a Gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, is a normal constituent of the human oral microbiome; however, numerous studies now demonstrate that F. nucleatum (Fn) is enriched in human colorectal adenomas and CRC compared to healthy colonic tissues. While our group has been involved in several of these studies under the aegis of this award; exactly how Fn promotes colonic tumorigenesis has not been fully elucidated. Clarifying the mechanisms by which Fn shapes the colonic tumor microenvironment will provide important insight for embarking on a multipronged approach to use Fn as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in CRC prevention and treatment. Based on the findings from our first funding cycle for this competitive R01 renewal, we formulate the overarching hypothesis that Fn is an oncomicrobe that through its effects on the CRC tumoral microbiota, via its oncometabolites, and by its direct interactions with intratumoral immune cells contributes to CRC growth and progression. Leveraging our knowledge and expertise with Fn, meta'omics, and mouse models, we will address how Fn potentiates colorectal carcinogenesis in its role as an oncomicrobe, via its short-chain fatty acids (oncometabolites), and in its interactions within the tumor immune microenvironment (oncoimmunology)."
"9273276","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma exacerbations are the most common health-related cause of lost school and work days and contribute substantially to the more than $50 billion dollars spent on asthma annually.1 Therefore any systematic reduction in asthma exacerbations will have a large public health impact. Asthma is a heritable disease2,3 and although a number of molecular determinants have been identified4, much remains to be understood about how these variants impact the severity of disease. Metabolic profiling, the systematic analysis of all metabolites, has been used successfully to identify new biomarkers for several diseases. Metabolites have the distinct advantage of being more proximal markers of disease processes than are transcriptional, translational or post-translational changes. Metabolic profiling is also able to capture the history of relevant past exposures such as hypermethylation and response to hypoxia, both of which are highly relevant for asthma. To date, metabolomics studies have been limited in size and scope for asthma.5,6 The metabolome remains an untapped resource and has the potential to comprehensively characterize many aspects of asthma, including the severity of disease.7,8 The over arching hypothesis of this proposal is that key metabolites will elucidate our understanding of asthma severity through the use of metabolomic profiling and the integration with other forms of molecular data. We will 1) identify individual metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with asthma severity in both untargeted and candidate approaches; 2) Integrate metabolomics data with genome-wide genetic (i.e. SNP) and genomic (i.e. gene expression) data 3) identify metabolomic signatures that accurately predict asthma exacerbations and differentiate asthma severity through the integration of environmental, clinical, genetic, genomic, and metabolomics data. This will represent the largest metabolomics study in asthmatic patients to date and enable the identification of important distinctions between individuals with varying asthma severity, potentially motivating specific therapeutic and primary prevention approaches for exacerbations."
"9368526","Summary Pneumonia resulting from inhaling spores of the opportunistic mold Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) remains a life- threatening complication of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and other conditions with compromised innate antifungal immunity. CGD is a heritable immunodeficiency arising from inactivating mutations in the phagocyte NADPH oxidase that generates superoxide (O2-).1, 2 Lack of microbicidal O2--derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. CGD patients are also prone to excessive and detrimental inflammation. Aspergillus pneumonia in CGD is associated with pyogranulomatous inflammation that complicates treatment. After conidia are inhaled, host receptors for fungal pathogen- associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) trigger inflammatory mediator production and activate killing by macrophages, neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMN) and other leukocytes, which rapidly eliminates AF from normal hosts. Failure to do so results in AF pneumonia. Although patients with CGD and mice genetically engineered with similar mutations (CGD mice) are among the most susceptible, our understanding of how NADPH oxidase ROS control AF and its associated inflammation in the lung are ill- defined. To address this question, we developed new mouse models in which the NADPH oxidase is selectively deleted in PMN or resident lung alveolar macrophages (AM). Our preliminary data show that mice lacking only PMN NADPH oxidase ROS exhibited a phenotype similar to CGD mice, and were susceptible to both AF pneumonia and hyperinflammation following challenge with sterile fungal cell walls, despite intact NADPH oxidase activity in other cells. In contrast, mice lacking NADPH oxidase in AM, but with residual oxidase activity in most PMN and monocytes, resembled WT mice in these studies. We propose to determine how the PMN NADPH oxidase is crucial in the early innate responses to AF, including an unexplained role in regulating fungal PAMP-induced inflammation. In Aim 1, we will assess whether PMN ROS play a non- redundant role in the initial response to AF that is critical to prevent lung infection, although it is possible that other sources of oxidase ROS or non-oxidative mechanisms could suffice at low inocula. In Aim 2, we will determine how PMN NADPH oxidase regulates fungal PAMP-induced inflammation. We hypothesize that lack of PMN ROS leads to excessive release inflammatory cytokines, including PMN chemoattractants produced by PMN themselves. We will examine the response of oxidase-deficient PMN to sterile fungal PAMPs both in vitro and in the lung to determine how loss of PMN ROS exacerbates inflammation independent of active infection. We will investigate the impact of blocking specific inflammatory mediators after fungal cell wall challenge. If effective, we will evaluate this approach in CGD mice as a means to reduce excessive inflammation and improve control of AF. The proposed studies will provide novel insights into incompletely characterized factors that contribute to life-threatening infection with AF and guide new therapeutic strategies."
"9231038","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Despite advances in treatment of prostate cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains fatal: in the U.S. alone, over 30,000 patients die yearly from mCRPC. The developmental mechanism of mCRPC is unknown.  The goal of this project is to explain the role in DNA repair of a previously unstudied gene, FAM35A. I have evidence that FAM35A is a novel tumor/metastasis suppressor in prostate cancer, and that its depletion in BRCA1-deficient cancer confers resistance to camptothecin. Based on my data, I predict that FAM35A is involved in development of resistance in mCRPC. The mechanism of FAM35A involvement in metastasis and resistance is completely uncharacterized; however, clarification of FAM35A's specific role in DNA repair is of great import to effective cancer treatment. Specific Aims: The overall hypothesis is that FAM35A participates in end-joining (EJ). Aim 1. Determine the function of FAM35A in double strand break (DSB) repair  a) Confirm FAM35A participation in EJ by random plasmid integration and EJ5-GFP reporter assay.  Expected results: Results from these studies should confirm FAM35A participation in EJ.  b) Determine the specific pathway of EJ involving FAM35A by comparing the sensitivity of alt-NHEJ  mutant cells infected with Fam35a shRNAs vs control after treatment with DNA damaging agents.  Expected results: Fam35a shRNA depleted Polq-/- MEF is more sensitive to DNA damage than control. Aim 2. Mechanism of chemoresistance in FAM35A-depleted BRCA1-deficient cells  a) Monitor the response to DNA damaging agents in FAM35A-depleted BRCA1-inactivated cells. Method:  Colony-forming assay. Expected results: FAM35A depletion in BRCA1 mutant cells will confer  resistance to PARPi. Furthermore, FAM35A depletion in LNCaP cells (prostate cancer cell line) will  also generate resistance to camptothecin and PARPi.  b) Determine whether FAM35A inhibits resection by counting RAD51 foci and monitoring ssDNA formation.  Method: Immunohistochemistry and fluorescence activated cell sorting. Expected results: FAM35A  functions alongside 53BP1, RIF1 and REV7 to inhibit resection of the 5' ends of DSBs. In total, our preliminary findings support FAM35A as a new target for cancer treatment and substantiate its involvement in the EJ pathway of DNA repair. Results from these (and future) studies are expected to advance mCRPC etiology, elucidate acquisition of metastasis and resistance in PCa and, most importantly, to facilitate discovery of therapeutic and prognostic targets for both chemotherapy and radiation therapy.    "

"9371460","PROJECT SUMMARY Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a rapidly progressive, fatal lung disease with a median survival of less than three years post diagnosis, is more prevalent in aging population. Glycolysis, a critical pathway in glucose metabolism plays an important role in regulating host responsiveness to fibrotic lung injury. Recent studies reported that IPF patients exhibit higher glycolytic activity in fibrotic areas represented by high [18F]-2-fluoro-2- deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. We have demonstrated that fibrosis development is enhanced with aging and that increased glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-dependent glycolysis contributes to enhanced fibrogenesis in aged lung. Identifying the downstream and upstream mechanism by which GLUT1 regulates fibrogenesis is essential next step. For downstream mechanism we have shown that non-canonical TGF?1 signaling may be the pathway by which GLUT1-dependent glycolysis contributes to lung fibrosis. For upstream mechanism we have illustrated that age-dependent proteasome dysfunction might underlie enhanced GLUT1 protein expression. In this proposal we hypothesized that decreased proteasome function contributes to impaired GLUT1 degradation, which in turn activates signaling pathways to reinforce or modulate downstream cellular responses and thereby contribute to increased GLUT1- dependent glycolysis and fibrogenesis in aged lung. Aim 1 will investigate the upstream regulation of GLUT1 expression and age-dependent lung fibrosis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) by using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to inhibit UPS in our two murine fibrosis models (bleomycin-induced lung injury and TGF?1 overexpression model). Aim 2 will investigate the downstream mechanism of GLUT1-dependent glycolysis and fibrosis development in lung. We will compare the extent of lung fibrosis observed in wild type, GLUT1 knockout, and GLUT1 overexpressing mice during bleomycin- and TGF?1-induced fibrosis models. Aim 3 will use human IPF cohort to define the levels of GLUT1 expression and their roles as a biomarker in patients with two distinct IPF phenotypes. This may translate into information useful to understand the complex interaction between GLUT1-dependent glycolysis and fibrosis, and provide a potential explanation for why older people are more susceptible to fibrotic lung disease. Results from our current studies may support the development of therapies for IPF based on targeting GLUT1 and/or its upstream/downstream regulators."
"9335384","PROJECT SUMMARY Preeclampsia is the medical condition characterized by hypertension and proteinuria in pregnant women. It occurs in 5 to 8% of all pregnancies (as common as breast cancer) and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for both the mother and the unborn child. Surprisingly, epidemiological studies have shown strong evidence that women associated with preeclamptic pregnancies have almost 50% reduced rate of breast cancers decades later. However, due to ethical and practical reasons, direct evidence from long-term follow up in human population is lacking. Moreover, the underlying mechanism to explain the lasting effect of preeclampsia remains unknown. Here we propose an alternative and integrative omics approach to investigate the molecular links between preeclampsia and breast cancer risks later in life. We will conduct a nested case control study to investigate the epigenome, RNA-Seq transcriptome and proteomics differences in the placenta and matched maternal blood DNA samples associated with preeclampsia. The de-identified samples will be collected through the Hawaii Biorepository (HiBR), and they reflect the unique multi-ethnic population of Hawaii. We will construct bioinformatics pipelines to analyze all three types of omics data individually, and develop new computational methods for omics data integration. We will identify coherent genes, modules and biological pathways as the biomarkers of preeclampsia. Moreover, we will compare our data with the DNA methylome, RNA-Seq transcriptome, and proteomics data of the breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Through such comparison, we will uncover the cancer-related genes, modules and biological pathways within the preeclampsia samples. This will provide direct molecular-level evidence to link preeclampsia and breast cancer risks later in life, which is practically impossible using the approach of population follow-up. It will also identify biomarkers of breast cancer susceptibility as early as a child's birth, for the purpose of cancer prevention."

"9362809","Abstract International efforts to characterize cancer genomes now provide us with an initial view of the mutations and copy number alterations that occur in human cancers. These efforts have expanded our knowledge of known oncogenic pathways and have identified new classes of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, it is now also clear that most epithelial cancers harbor hundreds of genetic alterations as a consequence of genomic instability, which complicates efforts to identify mutations critical for tumor maintenance and drives tumor heterogeneity. Moreover, it remains unclear which of these alterations confers on the tumor cell the ability to evade the immune system. The emerging clinical success of checkpoint blockade is tempered by the observation that most patients do not respond to immunotherapy. New immunotherapy targets are needed to improve tumor responses and guide rational combination immunotherapy to overcome resistance. Identifying genes that are essential for tumor survival and immune evasion will accelerate the development of new molecularly targeted therapeutics.  Over the past several years, we have developed and deployed high throughput genetic and bioinformatics approaches to identify and credential cancer targets. Specifically, we have performed genome scale loss of function and gain of function screens in large sets of human cancer cell lines and patient-derived models and have identified new oncogenes and synthetic lethal interactions. The scale of these experiments has allowed us to overcome the inherent heterogeneity of cancers and to classify cancer dependencies and their context, which is essential for the initiation of drug discovery efforts.  In this application, we propose to use these studies as a foundation for a new Dana-Farber Cancer Institute CTD2 Center. This Center will focus on the identification of and credentialing cancer targets, developing the means to rationally define combination therapies, and the identification of genes that modulate the response to immunotherapeutics, all through the use of novel in vitro and in vivo HT genetic and bioinformatic approaches. We will continue to make the outputs of these studies readily available to the scientific community and to participate in CTD2 Network activities. We anticipate that this Center will provide the cancer research community with information that will facilitate the prioritization of targets based on both genomic and functional evidence, inform the most appropriate genetic context for downstream mechanistic studies and facilitate the translation of this information into therapeutics and diagnostics."
"9316509","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein aggregates are present in age-associated degenerative disease, including debilitating myopathies and muscular dystrophies. They form when proteins misfold, self-assemble and elude degradation. Protein chaperones, or heat shock proteins (HSPs), protect against the toxic misfolding and aggregation of proteins. Hence, mutations or deficiencies in the chaperone network lead to disease. Recently, we found that DNAJB6, an HSP40 co-chaperone, is mutated in a dominantly inherited inclusion body myopathy (IBM) also named limb- girdle muscular dystrophy type 1D (LGMD1D) (1). LGMD1D is a progressive late onset muscular dystrophy. This proposal will utilize a multidisciplinary approach that synergizes studies mammalian cell biology, and yeast models to understand the role of DNAJB6 mutants in a degenerative myopathy. The goals of this proposal are to 1) define the role of DNAJB6 in skeletal muscle and model LGMD1D; 2) explore the role of LGMD1D mutations in DNAJB6 on prion and prion like aggregation in yeast and mammalian cells and 3) define the molecular mechanism of LGMD1D mutant dysfunction and screen for potential modifiers. The co- investigators are well suited and will complement each other these innovative studies on the mechanism of LGMD1D."
"9364897","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Non-healing wounds in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and are increasing at an alarming rate. The factors controlling macrophage function and how these cells transition from an inflammatory to a reparative phenotype in wound tissues are not understood; leaving a large deficit in our ability to prevent and treat these wounds. Our laboratory is investigating novel epigenetic changes, induced via post-transitional modifications of histones, as mechanism(s) to regulate the macrophage phenotype during wound healing. We present data that the cytokine environment established in wounds following injury induces the expression of specific epigenetic machinery in macrophages that control gene transcription, and hence, function. Using human cells and our experimental murine model of wound healing, we have identified that interferon-beta (IFN?) induces the expression of SETDB2, an epigenetic-based lysine methyltransferase that is responsible for setting a suppressive histone mark that results in the silencing of inflammatory and metabolic genes. This sequence of events is beneficial in normal wound healing, allowing for the transition from an inflammatory to a reparative macrophage phenotype needed to promote healing. We hypothesize that during the evolution of normal wound healing, IFN?-mediated induction of SETDB2 in wound macrophages represses NFKB-mediated inflammatory and metabolic genes resulting in decreased wound inflammation and enhanced wound repair. We further postulate that this process does not occur in diabetic wounds where SETDB2 is not induced in wound macrophages, resulting in increased inflammation and non-healing wounds. This hypothesis will be investigated via the following specific aims: 1) Elucidate the regulation of NFkB-mediated gene expression by SETDB2 in normal and diabetic wound macrophages; 2) Determine the IFN?-mediated mechanism(s) that upregulate macrophage-specific SETDB2 expression in normal and diabetic wound tissue; and 3) Establish the role of SETDB2-regulated uric acid on normal and diabetic wound macrophage phenotypes during healing."
"9503111","Abstract American youth spend more time with media than in any other activity. Almost a third of this time is spent simultaneously engaging with (or switching between) multiple media streams (`media multitasking'; MMT). The rapid rise in MMT has generated considerable scientific and societal interest in determining whether, and if so how, MMT impacts cognition, psychosocial health, academic achievement, and brain structure and function. Given the prevalence of MMT in children and young adults, there is urgency to understand the neurocognitive profiles of media multitaskers. Mounting evidence (including new behavioral and neural findings generated in our exploratory grant R21MH099812) points to consistent MMT-related differences in attention and memory, yet the nature and extent of these cognitive differences, their neural underpinnings, and their emergence across the lifespan remain largely unknown. The proposed multi-modal research program will examine the neurocognitive differences associated with chronic MMT, and will explore how and when differences onset. In young adults (18-24yr), we will leverage sensitive behavioral paradigms, scalp EEG, and concurrent EEG-fMRI to test hypotheses about the nature and neural underpinnings of MMT-related attention and memory differences, and we will relate these cognitive and task-based neural differences to functional and structural connectivity in frontoparietal networks of attention and cognitive control. In children (7-12yr), we will use a large-sample, longitudinal design and a novel multi-domain cognitive assessment tool to measure working memory (WM), selective and sustained attention, and inhibitory control; we will relate these cognitive measures to MMT behavior and to EEG measures of attention- and memory-related neural function. We also will obtain measures of academic achievement for both age groups. Our aims are to: (Aim 1) delineate the nature of the WM and long-term memory (LTM) decrements associated with heavier MMT, and (Aim 2) test the hypothesis that increased attentional lapses and diminished attentional control contribute to these decrements; (Aim 3) test the hypothesis that the large-scale frontoparietal structural and functional networks that support attention and cognitive control vary with MMT; and (Aim 4) determine how and when MMT-related cognitive and neural differences arise in children (7-12yr), at the time when younger populations begin to engage in MMT. The proposed research will (a) delineate how memory, attention, and cognitive control, and their underlying neural systems, vary with MMT and relate to academic achievement in young adults and children, as well as (b) begin to shed light on whether chronic MMT is a cause or consequence of neurocognitive differences. Moreover, by leveraging an individual differences approach, we will advance mechanistic understanding of the interactions between four R-DoC cognitive constructs (attention, cognitive control, WM, and declarative memory) and their dependence on large-scale frontoparietal structural and functional networks."
"9217551","Both the emergence and subsequent human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV in 2002-2003, and ofthe highly virulent human coronavirus HCoV-EMC in the Middle East and Europe in 2012-2013 exemplifies CoV movement potential and transmissibility, and underscores the urgent and critical need for a broadly efficacious therapeutics. The overall goal of Project 2 is to identify inhibitors of two highly conserved CoV processes, replication fidelity and RNA capping, that are essential for SARS-CoV virulence and survival in vivo. Multiple viral proteins and enzymatic activities are critical for these processes, including CoV 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (fidelity; nsp14-ExoN) and 2'-0-methyltransferase (capping; nsp16-0MTase) activities. Consistent with the importance of these processes, we have shown that decreased replication fidelity and ablation of RNA capping through genetic inactivation of either ExoN or OMTase, respectively, results in replication competent viruses that are profoundly attenuated in vivo. In Aims 1 and 2, we will work with the Screening Core (Core B) and the Medicinal Chemistry lead Development Core (Core C) to identify, characterize, and optimize small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV fidelity and RNA capping. Once active compounds are identified, we will define their mechanism of action, test for the development of virus resistance, and determine their activity across the CoV family. In Aim S, we will work with Core C to chemically optimize and test the in vivo efficacy of lead compounds in progressively tiered models of SARSCoV disease severity, and assess the development of drug resistance in vivo. The complementary expertise ofthe Denison and Baric Labs, extensive preliminary datasets, state-of-the-art technologies, and the expertise of SR in the areas of medicinal chemistry, high-throughput screening, and drug development will contribute significantly to the successful identification, confirmation, and in vivo testing of lead compounds. Ultimately, inhibiting these two conserved and distinct pathways required for in vivo pathogenesis will allow for the treatment of endemic and emerging CoVs and potentially reduce the emergence of viral resistance."
"9321912","The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), the largest professional, scientific and medical society established to bring together clinical and laboratory-based scientists who are involved in the study of bone and mineral metabolism, has had a successful history of conducting annual topical meetings funded by single year NIH R13 grants since 2002. This application seeks funding for a three year R13 grant to advance the field of skeletal diseases by focusing on three specific areas of scientific research: 1) skeletal genomics (?Bone-omics?Translating Genomic Discoveries into Clinical Applications?); 2) bone fragility (?Current Concepts in Bone Fragility: From Cells to Surrogates?); 3) skeletal contributions to the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of osteoarthritis (?Skeletal Contributions to Joint Degeneration and Osteoarthritis?). These three areas cover a range of topics that collectively contribute to a majority of the clinical morbidity and mortality of skeletal disease. The overall objective of this R13 is to stimulate further advances that will result in improved patient care for skeletal diseases by bringing together the best researchers for each of the three symposia that will be held in conjunction with the annual meetings of the ASBMR. Each of the three symposia will review the state of the art in each topic area, exchanging ideas with attendees, and stimulating the interaction between young and established researchers. For each of the three symposia, attendees will be encouraged to attend the subsequent ASBMR Annual Meetings for additional opportunities to interact with bone researchers. Agendas for all three years have been developed by an organizing committee with committed speakers for the first two years. The agendas include established and young investigators, men, women and underrepresented minority speakers. At the end of each meeting, a ?dine-around? evening is planned to allow direct interaction between young investigators and more senior speakers at the meeting. In 2016, the symposium will appraise the latest contributions of the field of genomics to the understanding of skeletal disease mechanisms, ranging from basic molecular biology to animal models and bidirectional translation to humans, particularly within the scope of precision medicine and targeted treatments. The 2017 symposium will discuss the latest research on the mechanisms underlying skeletal fragility and state-of-the-art methods to assess fracture risk. In addition, new data supporting the use of surrogate markers for fracture will be discussed. The 2018 symposium will promote interaction among basic, translational and clinical researchers in skeletal and osteoarthritis research, with a focus on recent data emerging on cartilage-bone structure and physiology within articulating joints."
"9241958","The Translational Core is designed to support CRDD projects by collecting and supplying well characterized specimens from humans, domestic animals and wildlife with infectious diseases, and providing access to CLIA laboratories at the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center (NYSDOHWC) and New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) that are staffed with public health personnel who have specific expertise in optimizing and validating diagnostic assays for clinical use. All CRDD projects?whether focused on direct detection of microbial genomic targets or of host transcripts or antibodies that provide indirect evidence of infection and of insights into host response?require specimens for discovery and diagnostic assay development and validation. Through membership in regional, national and global laboratory networks, Translational Core investigators Christina Egan (NYSDOHWC), William Karesh (EcoHealth Alliance), Lipkin (Cll) and Jay Varma (NYCDOHMH) enjoy unique access to a wide range of samples and isolates to support discovery and diagnostic aims. Application of new clinical assays requires validation using specific criteria and diverse specimen matrices. In New York State, assays must be validated by the NYSDOHWC. The validation application and approval process is comprehensive and comparable to and supportive of moving the assay through the FDA approval process. By engaging NYSDOHWC and NYCDOHMH from the outset, the Translational Core is poised to expedite translation of basic research in diagnostics into products that will be used in public health and clinical laboratories and enhance the prospects for commercialization."
"9352365","The primary cilium is an ancient, conserved organelle that has garnered significant attention in recent years. This is in part because of our expanding appreciation for its role(s) in a host of key cellular processes and in part because of the identification of genetic lesions that affect ciliary structure and function in >100 human genetic disorders. Our aspirational goals have been to understand ciliary functions; to improve the diagnostic and prognostic value of genetic variation in ciliopathies; and to inform rational therapeutic design for a group of disorders bereft of treatment options. During the previous funding period, we made significant progress on several fronts. These included a) the implementation of in vivo signaling assays to decipher the pathogenic potential of newly-discovered alleles, which in turn assisted the cloning of ciliopathy loci; b) the demonstration that ciliopathy loci contribute to the genetic burden of complex traits; and c) the description of the phenomenon of cis-complementation, wherein species-specific alleles can shield the pathogenic effect of missense variation in the same protein. Most poignantly, several basal body proteins regulate proteasomal function, in part through the regulation of the composition of proteasomal subunits. These data led to the realization that numerous paracrine pathways are affected by ciliary dysfunction through the mis-regulated degradation of key effector molecules. In parallel, and in departure from our long-term work in cloning genes that contribute and/or exacerbate ciliopathy phenotypes, we used the amalgam of our in vitro and in vivo tools to design screens that would identify suppressors of ciliary dysfunction that thus offer an alternative approach to rational therapeutics. Through a genome-wide RNAi screen for bbs4-induced deficient signaling, we identified and validated in vivo 11 suppressors. Among these was the ubiquitin specific peptidase USP35, suppression of which in cells and CRISPR-mediated deletion in zebrafish embryos could rescue bbs4-induced pathologies such as rhodopsin aggregation in photoreceptors and renal convolution defects. Based on these observations, we propose to extend our studies on the suppressor potential of USP35 by testing whether (and when) ablation of this locus in ciliopathy mouse models can rescue or ameliorate key ciliopathy pathologies such as retinal degeneration and renal function. Moreover, given that the 11 discovered suppressors are natural candidates for harboring protective alleles in humans, we will merge next-gen analysis in our extensive ciliopathy cohort with systematic allele functional testing to ask whether we observe an enrichment of deleterious alleles for these candidates in individuals with mild ciliopathies or no disease at all. Finally, we will develop tools to perform efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ciliopathy suppressor screens in patient-derived cells as a means to both identifying new such molecules and developing scalable tools of broader utility. Together, our studies will inform the largely unknown genetic properties of genetic suppressors; will contribute to the more systematic identification of such genes; and will potentially lead to the development of rational therapeutic antagonists."

"9320949","ABSTRACT Current efforts to improve speech intelligibility in hearing aids using signal processing algorithms are hampered by the need to reinvent realtime processing tools across research labs. Intellectual property rights and monetary considerations prevent the open sharing of processing tools from commercial companies and limit the usefulness of commercially available hearing aids in research. As a result, many academic innovations that could potentially improve hearing health care are not being tested and evaluated. Furthermore, when closed, proprietary devices are used in academic research, it becomes difficult to assess the impact of the findings when pertinent details of the subsystems in the signal processing pipeline are not known. In this proposal, we aim to develop an open, reconfigurable, non-proprietary, wearable, realtime speech processing system that uses processing and data collection approaches not available in existing hearing-aid technology that Audiologists and hearing aid researchers will be able to easily use to investigate new hearing aid algorithms in lab and field studies. Using novel speech processing algorithms, this open-access tool specifically designed for audiologists and hearing aid researchers will help accelerate hearing health care research studies and facilitate translation of technology advances into widespread clinical use."
"9278162","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In fact, nearly 1 in 3 deaths in 2011 was due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), most of those due to coronary heart disease and 34% of the deaths occur before age 75. The need for improved noninvasive methods to detect early disease and to help manage patients with chronic disease has therefore never been as critical. Technical advances in noninvasive cardiovascular imaging have resulted in increasing use over recent years. Nuclear cardiology and echocardiography are mature technologies that are commonly used in clinical practice. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), computed tomographic angiography (CTA), and positron emission tomography (PET) are playing a growing role in the clinical assessment of CVD and are relatively new to cardiovascular training programs. The number of physicians who have in-depth expertise in the physics, engineering, and molecular applications in all 5 major cardiovascular imaging modalities remains limited. The University of Virginia (UVA) is one of a handful of centers in the U.S. that have high-level clinical, physics, engineering, and molecular expertise in all cardiovascular imaging modalities, as well as a track record of training physicians in research. Over the past decade, trainees have been highly productive in terms of publication and the majority have gone on to academic careers in outstanding institutions around the U.S. Two former trainees joined the UVA faculty and both are funded by K23 awards. The purpose of this grant renewal proposal is to continue and further develop the training program that provides comprehensive training in cardiovascular imaging research. The program provides trainees with outstanding opportunities to interact closely with imaging physicists and engineers who together offer the promise of improvements in both the clinical applications of these newer technologies and further development of and applications of translational imaging. Trainees have dual mentorship from a PhD imaging scientist and a MD clinician investigator. The goal of the training is to develop the next generation of academic investigators in cardiovascular imaging who can interact across disciplines. Trainees undergo a rigorous 2-year research training program following a 2-year clinical cardiovascular training program completed at the UVA or a 3-year program completed at another institution. Two fellows per year enter the program such that there are up to 4 fellows enrolled at any one time. A complete didactic program is offered including instruction in imaging physics and engineering, biostatistics, epidemiology, clinical research methodology, and medical ethics. Fellows receive training in clinical CMR, CTA, and PET. Research training is comprehensive and combines clinical and basic cardiovascular imaging research for each trainee with any of the modalities."

"9340111","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions);  Collaborative interactions between Investigators in the Section of Nephrology and the Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology at Yale have historically provided much of the experimental evidence that underlies our current understanding of normal kidney function at the cellular, tubular and whole organ level. And yet, at a time when the development of increasingly sophisticated cell and molecular biology techniques has afforded scientists the ability to manipulate the genes and proteins that control these physiologic, processes, many of the investigators involved in these studies have not acquired the technical skills necessary to identify the mechanism(s) that underlie the phenotype that they uncover. The mission of the Yale O'Brien Kidney Center Renal Physiology and Phenotyping Core (Core A) is to utilize our unique expertise in the rigorous study and understanding of renal physiology to provide highly specialized phenotypic analysis of rodents at the systemic, whole kidney and/or individual nephron segment levels. By providing expertise and training in techniques such as tubule micropuncture, in vitro and in vivo microperfusion, determination of glomerular filtration rates and renal perfusion, and continuous blood pressure measurements. Core A is designed to allow investigators to accurately define the site, mechanism and impact of genetic and/or pharmacologic manipulations on cellular, organ, and whole animal physiology. To achieve this, the Yale O'Brien Kidney Center Renal Physiology and Phenotyping Core takes advantage of 2 major strengths: 1) the specialized equipment needed to provide phenotyping .services at the systemic, whole kidney, and individual nephron segment levels, and 2) experienced and skilled personnel capable of using that equipment to generate reliable and reproducible data that are required for thorough, accurate phenotypic analysis. During the previous funding period, this Core was heavily utilized by Investigators with 19 distinct services provided to more than 40 Investigators supporting studies in 32 manuscripts."
"9323800","Project Summary/Abstract The overall success of the proposed BioMark project team depends on an efficient and highly organized Administrative Core that effectively coordinates the team's efforts. The central mission of the proposed BioMark project is to identify a robust set of biomarkers predicting time to rebound following treatment interruption in HIV infected patients. This core will sek to remove or reduce the obstacles that might impair the team from achieving its experimental goals. Keys to success are the orchestration of lively and informative team meetings and the nucleation of the team in a manner that promotes synergistic rather than additive scientific collaboration. The Administrative Core is organized around three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To provide a sound, effective administrative structure for the BioMark team that maximizes scientific productivity, promotes free and open communication among members, allows for strategic planning on a regular basis, ensures the implementation of sound fiscal practices to maximize resources and productivity, and promotes the appropriate sharing, collation, and analyses of the scientific data generated. Specific Aim 2: To conduct an annual scientific review of progress of the BioMark team by a Scientific Advisory Board comprised of three members (beginning in year 3). Specific Aim 3: To regularly evaluate internally the performance of all scientific projects and cores and, based on need or performance, to reallocate resources in a manner that best serves the overall goals of the BioMark team. Dr. Warner Greene will serve as Director of this Core. This core will be based at the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology (GIVI), an institution widely recognized for the excellence of its administrative services. Additional administrative staff participating in BioMark will include Julia Roudabush (Gladstone Grants and Contracts) and Robin Givens (Senior Executive Assistant, Office of the Director, GIVI). The Administrative Core will schedule biweekly videoconferences of BioMark's Executive Committee (Greene chair, Pillai, Roan, Siliciano) alternating with videoconferencing meetings of the entire BioMark team for review of results and discussion of future experimentation. The Executive Committee will function as the principal decision-making body within the program. The Administrative Core will also organize an annual strategic planning process and be responsible for launching BioMark's website to include public and private portals, the latter facilitating data exchange among team members. In Year 3, a Scientific Advisory Board will be assembled with plans to invite a bioinformatician, HIV immunologist, and an HIV clinical trialist to join as members and to conduct an annual review of the entire program. The Administrative Core will also take the lead on ensuring smooth specimen acquisition for the four different collaborating ATI trial sites and ensuring a smooth interface between the three projects and the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core."
"9407937","X-ray Core Abstract Crystallization is prerequisite for using single crystal X-ray diffraction to derive detailed information on protein structure and interactions at the atomic level. Crystallization of large multi-protein complexes is challenging, and, even if successful, the resulting crystals are usually small and delicate and present multiple challenges including problematic diffraction, which may be low resolution or/and anisotropic. To meet these challenges, a number of new technologies and methodologies for high throughput crystallization, sample cryo-cooling, diffraction quality screening, data collection, and data analysis are necessary to tackle difficult projects. The X- ray core will carry out extensive high-throughput screening to determine the best conditions for crystallizing HIV and/or host factor complexes that are identified by the Interactions Discovery Core and produced by the Protein Core. To obtain crystals of multi-protein complexes of sufficient quality for structural studies, it is often necessary to test a large number of different crystallization conditions and screen numerous crystals to locate even a single specimen that adequately diffracts X-rays. Recent efforts towards improving sample ?crystallizability? using techniques such as alanine scanning mutagenesis or the use of chimeric proteins to promote/improve crystal packing has led to structures of highly relevant targets. However, less effort has been spent on visual evaluation and optimization of crystallization. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is an ideal approach for this purpose. The PCHPI has implemented the use of TEM as a tool to: 1) discover nanocrystals from crystallization screens and 2) analyze and guide the process of crystallization. Structures will be determined using state-of-the-art post-crystallization handling, data-collection and processing strategies."
"9321094","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT ? Research Education Component There are substantial gaps in our knowledge of how to improve timely diagnosis and support of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their family caregivers, particularly those from racially/ethnically diverse populations. This translates into a public health imperative for research to understand and ultimately prevent cognitive decline in an increasingly diverse older population and the best strategies to deliver effective services to older adults with cognitive impairment and to support their family caregivers. The Research Education Component (REC) supports the mission of the UC Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center by continuing to develop resources and expanding the research education opportunities of junior investigators, with an emphasis on recruiting individuals from historically underrepresented groups. There is a strong need for new, creative, and diverse junior investigators to address the diversity and complexity of cognitive impairment in diverse populations. Towards this end, the goals of the REC are to (1) Outreach, recruit and select a cadre of junior investigators from diverse personal and professional backgrounds who will conduct Alzheimer's disease-related research; (2) Develop and support a tailored mentoring and training plan for diverse junior investigators in the area of Alzheimer's disease, with a particular focus on strengthening and diversifying the research workforce; and (3) Monitor and evaluate research education progress of trainees. The UC Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center has an extensive mentoring and research education record that includes graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty with interests in Alzheimer's disease- related research. We will continue to build on this infrastructure with REC leaders ? Dr. Ladson Hinton and Dr. Oanh Meyer, as well as the Training Oversight Committee. REC will leverage existing resources and expertise from two NIH-funded centers here at UC Davis ? the Latino Aging Research Resource Center (UC Davis Resource Center for Minority Aging Research) and the Clinical and Translational Science Center to contribute to the research education of future leaders in Alzheimer's disease-related research. REC also will capitalize on the rich diversity of UC Davis and connect with programs such as the Center for the Advancement of Multicultural Perspectives on Science to ensure recruitment of underrepresented groups.

"9357417","Project 1: Active immunotherapy combined with checkpoint modulation for glioblastoma SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The lack of effective treatments for glioblastoma (GBM) patients remains a significant health problem and highlights the need for novel and innovative approaches. Immunotherapy is an appealing strategy because of the potential ability for immune cells to traffic to and destroy infiltrating tumor cells in the brain. Pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination for GBM have shown some promising results, but also some treatment failures. The broad overall goals of this research project are to investigate mechanisms of immune evasion following active immunotherapy, and to develop rational combinations of immunotherapeutic strategies to overcome the immunosuppressive milieu of the brain tumor microenvironment. Our new preliminary data strongly suggests that active immunotherapy with DC vaccination may create a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment that induces the immigration of immunosuppressive antigen presenting cells (iAPC), which express high levels of PD-L1 and IL-10. We show that these cells are phenotypically similar to the iAPC that dominantly influence the T-cell response to chronic viral infection, and may act to counteract effective T-cell responses induced by DC vaccination via a mechanism involving PDL1/PD-1. Furthermore, inhibition of iAPC using an anti-PD1 mAb (Nivolumab, BMS) or a CNS penetrant inhibitor of CSF-1R (PLX-3397, Plexxikon), in conjunction with tumor lysate-pusled DC vaccination (DC-Vax-L), resulted in significantly prolonged survival in tumor-bearing animals with well-established intracranial (i.c.) gliomas. We therefore postulate that clinically relevant anti-tumor immunity to glioblastoma (GBM) must have two cellular components: 1) significant infiltration of tumor-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL); and 2) blockade of immune-regulatory antigen presenting cell (iAPC) function within the tumor microenvironment. As such, our hypothesis is that the local cellular interactions between iAPC and T lymphocytes within the brain tumor microenvironment is a critical factor influencing the efficacy of immunotherapies in glioblastoma patients. A better understanding of the biology of these cellular interactions will provide insight into more effective ways to induce therapeutic anti-tumor immune responses for this deadly type of brain tumor. In Aim 1, we will study the mechanisms by which iAPC limit glioma- specific anti-tumor immune responses in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the efficacy of combining tumor lysate-pulsed DC vaccination (to induce T-cell infiltration into tumors) with immune checkpoint inhibition and other novel immunoregulatory targets (to block iAPC function) in pre-clinical syngeneic animal models of glioblastoma, and explore the use of a novel PET tracers as non-invasive imaging biomarkers of immune response. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop and validate predictive tumor, immunological and imaging biomarkers of response in recurrent glioblastoma patients enrolled in a Phase II clinical trial of DCVax-L +/- Nivolumab. These studies span the continuum of translational research in brain tumor immunotherapy, and will likely provided informative new insights for the development of new, rational immune-based strategies for brain tumor patients."
"9324258","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Despite the biological importance of mammalian meiosis, several of its significant features rema n largely unexplained. Recent discoveries by ourselves and others have shown that many of these features are controlled by the same protein, PRDM9. Our long-term objective is to determine how these controls are related, how they are achieved, and how PRDM9 fits into the larger network of proteins controlling meiosis progression. This will be greatly facilitated by the availability of multiple PRDM9 alleles in mice, each with its own regulatory specificities expressed in the most useful mammalian experimental model that we have. PRDM9 is an exceptional protein in the diversity of biological functions it carries out, in its unusual domain structure, and in its diverse molecular activities. The insights this study will provide extend beyond meiosis to major aspects of population genetics, as the location of hotspots determines patterns of inheritance; to genetic mapping studies identifying human disease genes; and to evolutionary biology, as allelic incompatibilities in PRDM9 can produce hybrid sterility. To address the relevant experimental questions, we have organized a coordinated effort among four projects representing diverse experimental approaches: genetics (Project A), protein chemistry (Project B), computational integration (Project 0), cell biology (Project D), and molecular biology (Projects A, B, C and D). Our Animal Resources Core will provide mice and new mutant strains. A Cell Biology Core will provide preparations of spermatocytes and assist in ChIP experiments. The Computational Core will perform data management and analysis. Our long-term objectives derive from the following overall program goals: a) Comprehensively define PRDM9's regulatory functions in recombination, transcription, and gametogenesis; b) Define the role of PRDM9 in regulation of meiosis by identifying and characterizing its interactions with genomic DNA, other meiotic proteins, and specialized meiotic structures; c) Define the overall role of PRDM9 in gametogenesis, hotspot activation, and transcription by using computational techniques to build an integrated model of its molecular functions; and d) Exploit the exceptional degree of variability in the Zn fingers (ZNF) of PRDM9 to clarify the complex nature of ZNF - DNA interactions, which are so ubiquitous in genomic regulation. Results of the program project will significantly increase the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate meiosis as well as their involvement in other important biological processes."
"9368022","PROJECT SUMMARY The deluge of sequencing-based functional genomic data profiling the transcriptome, regulome and epigenome in hundreds of diverse cellular contexts has spurred the development of powerful computational methods to learn integrative models of gene regulation. However, models learned on data from static cellular contexts only reveal correlative regulatory relationships. There is a paucity of tractable model systems and experiments profiling dynamic cellular processes and a corresponding lack of computational methods that can learn putative causal mechanisms controlling the precise timing and temporal order of changes in genomic chromatin state and gene expression. Here, we propose novel machine learning methods to learn dynamic models of transcription regulation in the context of cellular reprogramming. In Aim 1, we propose deep learning frameworks with new interpretation engines that can integrate dynamic chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to reveal networks of cis regulatory elements, transcription factor binding complexes and cascades of trans-acting regulatory factors that control cell fate. In Aim2, we will apply our modeling framework to investigate early dynamics of nuclear reprogramming of human fibroblasts to pluripotency. We will leverage a powerful heterokaryon cell fusion model system to generate global chromatin and gene expression profiles over a two day timecourse. In Aim 3, we perform perturbation experiments using RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to validate hypotheses generated by our models and test the effectiveness of predicted pluripotency factors and regulatory elements in inducing reprogramming. The validation experiments will be further used to iteratively refine the computational models. We will integrate the time-course data generated in our model system with data from large reference compendia of functional genomic data such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Roadmap Epigenomics Project. Our analyses will reveal molecular mechanisms crucial to early and transient stages of nuclear reprogramming, providing novel contributions to our fundamental knowledge of regenerative medicine. Finally, the proposed end-to-end integrative framework is highly generalizable and will be of broad utility to learn dynamic models of transcriptional regulation from time-course datasets in other model systems."
"9326988","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). But, the evaluation process for a kidney transplant is lengthy, time consuming, and burdensome to the patient. Also, race disparities exist in rates of transplant evaluation completion, transplantation, and LDKT. Our previous and ongoing NIDDK-funded research indicates that cultural factors (i.e., perceived discrimination in health care, religious objection to LDKT), transplant knowledge, and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, education, income) independently and significantly predict time to complete transplant evaluation. In December 2012 our transplant center implemented a one-day streamlined evaluation process, dubbed Kidney Transplant Fast Track (KTFT), but it has not been evaluated for efficacy or cost effectiveness. Thus, we propose a quasi-experiment to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the KTFT (n=1030) compared to historical controls (n=1140) who were recruited for our current NIDDK study to increase transplant rates. At the same time, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeting vulnerable patients with the educational component of the TALK intervention (Talking About Live Kidney Donation) to increase LDKT. For both components of the application, we will target vulnerable populations because they are most at risk for extended evaluation times and lower rates of LDKT. Using CONSORT standards, participants will be randomly assigned to TALK (n=515) versus no-TALK (n=515) conditions and undergo two interviews at pre-transplant work-up and at completion of transplant evaluation in order to: (1) test whether KTFT and TALK will reduce transplant evaluation time, and increase rates of transplant and LDKT in members of vulnerable groups; (2) determine whether engaging in a streamlined and coordinated-care evaluation experience within the transplant center reduces negative perceptions of the healthcare system; and (3) test the cost effectiveness of the KTFT with TALK relative to standard practices. The results of this two-pronged approach will help pave the way for other transplant centers to implement a Fast Track system at their sites, improve quality of care by transplanting a larger number of vulnerable patients, and may help address stark race/ethnic disparities in rates of LDKT."
"9349410","The development of an effective vaccine is the most plausible approach to eliminate the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The detection of broadly neutralizing antibody (bNABs) responses is critical for vaccine development. In this grant application, we propose to develop a novel sensitive method for bNAB detection and quantification ? An HIV Rev-dependent, A3R5-derived, reporter cell line, Rev-A3R5 (NanoLuc/HaloTag). A3R5 is a T lymphoblast that expresses physiologically relevant levels of the HIV receptors, CD4 and CXCR4/CCR5, and is highly susceptible to X4 and R5 viruses. A3R5 has also been shown to be the optimal cell line currently available for bNAB detection. We plan to engineer A3R5 to carry two highly sensitive reporters: NanoLuc, the most sensitive luciferase currently available, and HaloTag, the most flexible fluorescent reporter. Both reporters are engineered to exclusively depend on HIV and Rev for expression, eliminating non-specific noises from environmental stimuli. This novel system will provide unmatched specificity and sensitivity, providing a new standard for NABs detection and quantification. We plan to carry out two specific aims in the phase I stage. Aim 1 will be to create a high-sensitivity, A3R5-derived, Rev-dependent reporter cell line, Rev- A3R5, for bNAB detection. We will first construct the Rev-dependent vector, pNL-NanoLuc-HaloTag- RRE, for assembly into lentiviral viral particles, which will be used to transduce A3R5 cells. Subclones will be selected for optimal performance in NAB detection. Aim 2 will be to characterize and validate Rev-A3R5. We will test the specificity of the reporter cells. Additionally, Rev-A3R5's susceptibility to primary viral isolates will be tested. We will also perform bNAB screen using a panel of antibodies and patient sera to optimize the system for Phase II development. We aim to develop the system into a standard assay product for academic and industry laboratories for bNAB screening and validation."

The P/F program is primarily designed for young investigators who desire to pursue a career in nutrition research. While we do not exclude applications from more established investigators who propose to move into the area of nutrition research or to explore new directions within nutrition research, these applications are typically looked upon less favorably. The P/F program offers modest funding (up to $20,000 per year) for a limited period of time (l year, renewable for a second year if sufficient progress is made and the request is judged to be well justified). The Colorado NORC provides funding for pilot and feasibility projects for investigators who meet one of the following: 1. New investigators with a project relevant to Nutrition who have no independent NIH (or  comparable) funding 2. Established investigators with a project relevant to Nutrition who have not previously worked  in the field of nutrition 3. Established nutrition investigators who propose a project significantly different from previous Over the past 20 years we have funded 39 pilot projects. Of those who have completed their projects, 92% are still in obesity/nutrition research, 74% remain in our research base, and 65% have been successful in securing independent research funding. The PF program has been one of the most successful parts of the Colorado NORC."

"9321312","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with type two diabetes (T2D) frequently lead sedentary life styles which are not only a risk factor for diabetes, but can also exacerbate the disease. Recommending increased physical activity is therefore a cornerstone of T2D prevention and management. Historically, increasing activity was synonymous with exercise; however, we now know that even much more modest activity levels (e.g., simply walking) or merely decreasing the proportion of sedentary time may be sufficient to improve health outcomes. Some interventions designed to increase activity have shown promise; others have been less successful. The availability of inexpensive pedometers, and, more recently, low cost triaxial accelerometers, has now made it much easier to monitor activity levels and provide feedback to users. These devices are ideal for capturing activity associated with walking, the most popular and acceptable form of exercise for patients with T2D, but only if patients actually wear them. Thus, there is a need to develop pragmatic approaches that encourage patients to not only wear these monitoring devices, but also to motivate them to increase their activity. The overarching goal is of this proposal is to develop new practical, affordable, and easy-to-use approaches to increase activity among patients at risk for developing T2D and those already diagnosed with T2D. To achieve this goal we will test MapTrek, an m-health game or our own design that uses low cost triaxial accelerometers to encourage patients to walk more, and we will test this m-health intervention against a control group using the accelerometers alone. The data we generate will help inform a larger pragmatic trial to investigate long-term clinical outcomes and costs."

"9340113","PROJECT SUIWMARY (See instructions): Genetic and genomic approaches have been highly productive in identifying new biology that underlies human health and disease. Advances in the last 5 years have been dramatically accelerated by the development, with support of the O'Brien Center, of exome sequencing, a method for rapiidly and inexpensively sequencing all the protein-coding genes in the genome. Success in disease gene discovery requires diverse skill sets and effective collaborations among clinicians, basic scientists, and biostatisticians. Necessary tools include expertise in clinical medicine, knowledge of the regulatory environment to permit development of appropriate HIC protocols, expertise in study design to ensure that studies are adequately powered, technological expertise to ensure that lab-based approaches remain at the cutting edge of the field, and first-rate biostatistical analysis of results to ensure that findings are valid and robust. Yale has developed expertise in each of these areas and as a consequence Yale investigators have been at the forefront of this endeavor with leaders in gene finding for Mendelian disease and complex traits across diverse disciplines. In the last 5 years, projects fostered by the Yale O'Brien center have led to discovery of new disease genes for a wide array of kidney diseases, with many more discovery projects underway with leading investigators from the NIDDK community. This core will continue to provide key infrastructure support for all steps along the path to discovery, including development of HIC protocols, patient recruitment, tools production and analysis of next generation DNA sequencing and other large data sets. This core will provide effective training for students, fellows and faculty and will help engage new investigators in translational research."
"9369761","PROJECT SUMMARY Purinergic (P2X) receptors are trimeric, non-selective cation channels activated by ATP that play important roles in cardiovascular, neuronal and immune systems. Despite their central function in human physiology and as potential targets of therapeutic agents, the molecular mechanisms for P2X receptor antagonism are unclear, especially for non-competitive antagonists where almost nothing is known. The study of P2X receptors has been handicapped by a paucity of small molecules that serve as selective high-affinity agonists and antagonists against the various receptor subtypes. Very recently, the applicant published atomic resolution structures of human P2X3 (hP2X3) in an apo/resting state, an agonist-bound/open-pore state, an agonist- bound/closed-pore/desensitized state and two competitive antagonist-bound states, identifying a novel cytoplasmic domain that he hypothesizes plays a pivotal and unique structural role in receptor activation and desensitization. The aims of this grant are designed to build off that work in order to firmly establish the principles of P2X receptor antagonism, determine the structural role of key cytoplasmic residues involved in P2X receptor activation and desensitization, and identify novel small molecule competitive and non-competitive antagonists directed at homo-trimeric P2X1 and P2X3 receptor subtypes and hetero-trimeric P2X2,3 receptors, utilizing ligand binding assays and electrophysiology to study function and X-ray crystallography and cryo electron microscopy to study structure. This research will be carried out by an applicant with excellent training in membrane protein biochemistry and a strong publication record. The training for this proposal will occur at the Vollum Institute of Oregon Health and Science University under the mentorship of Dr. Eric Gouaux, a world leader in the structural biology of ion channels and transporters who has previously transitioned numerous post-doctoral trainees to independence. To prepare the applicant for a successful transition to independence, Dr. Gouaux will oversee the candidate's structural biology training in cryo electron microscopy and continued growth in X-ray crystallography. In addition to Dr. Gouaux, an institute of established investigators supports the applicant with expertise in membrane protein biochemistry, ligand-receptor interactions/binding assays, and the electrophysiology of ion channels. This training will be essential for the candidate to become an independent investigator focused on studying the structure and function of purinergic receptors in order to develop pharmacological agents for the treatment of cardiovascular conditions such as angina, hypertension, and platelet aggregation."
"9233915","The overall objective of this Shared Resource Core is to enhance the capacity of the project investigators of  this cooperative research center to determine the novel molecular mechanisms contributing to innate  immune recognition of a variety of viral pathogens by contributing to the following center goals: 1) to  investigate the role novel Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRR) as authentic receptors of viral nucleic acid  which affect subsequent human innate immune responses to viral pathogens and (2) to capitalize on unique  biochemical capabilities to quantify the ligand-binding functions of PRRs that are technically-challenging.  The core will provide center investigators with purified innate immune signaling proteins as well as  specialized assays of their biochemical activities that are relevant to signal transduction. The Core will  capitalize on the expertise of Dr. Duncan in recombinant protein production and characterization,  biochemical reconstitution of signaling pathways, and specific work in the field of innate immune signaling in  order to provide this support. The core will generate these proteins and assay the ATP binding, ATP  hydrolysis, and binding to virally derived nucleic acids of each protein in order to ensure biochemically active  properly functioning protein is available for the studies proposed by center investigators. The inclusion of the  Protein Purification and Biochemistry Core in this U19 application will provide a common source for  recombinant signaling proteins, several of which are utilized in multiple projects. Because the production and  characterization of these proteins is not routine and requires specific assay technologies for nucleotide  binding and hydrolysis as well as nucleic acid binding, a single Shared resource Core will allow for efficient  availability these reagents to multiple laboratories and the use of robust standardized methodologies in order  to assess nucleic acid sensing functions by these proteins. Overall, this core will provide tools for each  project to understand the mechanisms of viral nucleic acid detection and better assess the potential for these  signaling systems to be used to develop novel anti-viral strategies based on host signaling pathways."
"9453612","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In vitro studies have established that airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells exhibit phenotypic plasticity in response to inflammatory events mediated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing has emerged as an regulator of gene expression and studies of miRNA function in ASM hold promise for the development of novel miRNA-based tools for prognosis and therapy. The long-term goal of our studies is to identify the miRNA-mediated gene- silencing mechanisms determining ASM cell phenotype in asthma. Our laboratory was the first to characterize miRNA expression in ASM following a pro-inflammatory stimulus and identified miR-25 as a target of the inflammatory response that regulates plasticity of ASM cells. This proposal will test the hypothesis that expression of miR-25 attenuates allergic asthma pathogenesis by altering ASM phenotype. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether miR-25 expression in a mouse model of allergic inflammation attenuates hyperreactivity, remodeling and alters ASM contractile force using a unique transgenic mouse model of smooth muscle-targeted miR-25 expression. These mice will be used to assess the effects of miR-25 on AHR, remodeling and ASM contractility following acute and chronic models of ovalbumin-sensitization and challenge. In Specific Aim 2, we will study the effect of smooth muscle-targeted miR-25 expression on increased ASM mass in vivo following acute and chronic ovalbumin-sensitization and challenge by assessing proliferative markers and mitogenic signaling pathways to address the molecular mechanisms underlying this miR-25 function. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine whether miR-25 affects the phenotype of asthmatic ASM cells using gain and loss of miR-25 function studies, as well as effects on identified targets of miR-25 mediated gene-silencing. This unique experimental approach, coupled with correlations in human diseased cells, will provide mechanistic data describing miR-25 function in the lung and be an essential step towards developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting miRNA in asthma."
"9407527","PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic psychotic disorders (CPDs) such as schizophrenia occur world-wide and cause significant burden, reduced quality of life, functional impairment and premature mortality due to suicide and other causes. Stigma and persistent disability, which usually begin early in life, profoundly and negatively impact people with CPD as well as their families and communities. Lower and middle income countries (LMICs) experience disproportionate burden due to poor adherence with evidence-based medication treatments, pervasive stigma, and lack of workforce capacity to adequately assess and treat CPD.  Written in response to PAR-14-331 ?Global Brain and Nervous System Disorders Across the Lifespan,? the proposed project will develop a person-centered CPD care approach that will be practical and effective in Tanzania, generalizable to other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and develop research capacity for future efforts in CPD burden reduction. The proposed study includes investigators from Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences and Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Ohio, USA, and builds upon a successful behavioral + medication approach for high-risk individuals with CPD developed at CWRU.  This proposed 3-phase/3-aim project will: 1) Conduct a mixed-methods (quantitative + qualitative) needs assessment regarding barriers and facilitators to CPD care in Tanzania; 2) Refine a brief, customized adherence enhancement (CAE) approach to improve antipsychotic medication adherence and mental health outcomes in Tanzanians with CPD, and 3.) Lay groundwork that establishes a clinical trials infrastructure, adequately trained staff, and data tools/procedures preparatory to implementation of a CPD adherence enhancement trial. In Phase 1/Aim 1, the mixed-methods analysis will involve 100 individuals with CPD to better understand antipsychotic adherence, adherence barriers and adherence attitudes. Phase 1 methods will include evaluation of adherence barriers and reasons for non-adherence, as well as stakeholder input regarding preferred approaches to deliver adherence promotion interventions. In Phase 2/Aim 2, a successful CPD adherence enhancement approach will be adapted for the Tanzanian setting, based upon findings from Phase 1. In Phase 3/Aim 3 appropriate outcome measures will be selected, staff will be trained in study and measure implementation, and the intervention will be finalized for delivery by healthcare workers. Finally, in a training/proof-of-concept exercise, the healthcare workers will implement adapted Customized Adherence Enhancement (CAE) in a high-risk sample of Tanzanians with CPD"
"9266198","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People with Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) are at high risk for problematic alcohol use. Compared to people without SAD, people with SAD are between two and three times more likely to develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). SAD and alcohol problems each contribute dramatically to psychologically impairment and economic costs, but together, the co-occurrence of SAD and AUD is associated with greater impairment than either condition alone. This highly comorbid relationship has been studied broadly, but there is substantially less research on the etiology and maintenance factors that help explain the link between SAD and alcohol use. Of the research available, methodologies have been almost exclusively limited to global questionnaires and laboratory experiments that offer little information about daily patterns of antecedents and consequences of alcohol use. Surprisingly, no study to date has examined daily processes related to alcohol use for people with SAD. The proposed investigation aims to fill this gap. The overarching aim of this study is to illuminate temporal sequences of alcohol use and how particular contextual features moderate the relationship between alcohol use and social anxiety. This objective addresses NIAAA's mission of promoting research on the causes and consequences of alcoholism and alcohol-related problems and devising effective methods to do so. Specific aims of the study are fourfold. First, we will conduct the first daily diary investigation of drinking motives for people with SAD and collect identical data from healthy adults. Data generated from this study will offer a descriptive picture of daily alcohol use (including level of alcohol consumption, frequency and degree of motivations to drink) and allow for important comparisons between people with and without SAD. Second, we will evaluate how the presence of SAD alters the relationship between drinking motives and alcohol consumption and severity of drinking-related problems per drinking episode. Third, we will evaluate how motives for people with SAD differ across social situations. Based on prior research indicating that certain circumstances of social situations affect how people with SAD function, we want to test how naturally occurring social situations influence motivations to consume alcohol. Fourth, as an exploratory aim, we will evaluate how daily SAD symptoms predict daily drinking motives among people with SAD to address mixed findings explaining the SAD-AUD link. Information generated from this study has the potential to contribute substantially to theory and treatment development for SAD, AUDs, and their co-occurrence. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a training plan aimed at developing expertise in alcohol use, SAD, and advanced research methodology. The training plan includes completion of relevant courses, individual supervision and mentorship by experts in the field, attendance at relevant workshops, and scientific writing and dissemination experience."

"9329537","The need for the development of new strategies for treatment of bladder cancer (BC) has experienced a palpable increase in the last few years. While several options are currently under investigation, many if not all remain suboptimal. This is critical as it is estimated that in 2015 there were ~450,000 new cases and over 115,000 deaths from BC worldwide. In the US alone there were ~74,000 new cases and over 16,000 deaths from BC. This makes BC the 6th most prevalent and 9th deadliest cancer worldwide. While various treatment options currently exist, a number of issues have been reported including the high cost of treatment, patient discomfort, complications, incomplete treatment, procedural invasiveness and poor efficacy among others. With a 5yr survival rate for BC patients ranging from 6 to 65% yielding a reported ~115,000 deaths in 2015 alone (far above prostate or breast cancer), there is an ever growing urgency and compelling need for the development of new strategies and devices to treat BC. The intent of this project is to develop a new cystoscopic based thermo-molecular treatment strategy and catheter system (FrostBite-BC) for the treatment of BC employing a minimally invasive trans-urethral outpatient procedure. The prototype unit and preliminary data collected to date strongly support the potential of this approach. The major goals of this Phase 1 proposal are the following: (1) Develop the FrostBite-BC catheter system and bench test it using non tissue engineering models. (2) Test this new treatment protocol in a homogeneous and heterogeneous cell population BC tissue engineered model (TEM). (3) Test the ability of an adjunctive nutraceutical compound, Vitamin D3, to sensitize BC cells to freeze injury (cryosensitization) thereby making cryoablation more effective while protecting normal cells and (4) conduct a pilot in vivo study to validate development. Phase 2 will include (1) optimizing the catheter, device and procedure, (2) conducting pre-clinical in vivo studies and (3) determining the potential role of FrostBite-BC launching a whole body immune response against metastatic disease in vivo. The successful completion of this project will lead to a new minimally invasive cystoscopic compatible trans-uretheral approach for the treatment of bladder and other urogenital cancers. Once completed, this project will provide for an effective, minimally invasive treatment for patients afflicted with BC as well as other urologic based cancers resulting in improved patient survival, quality of life, and mitigating risk factors for cancer diagnosis."
"9403031","Summary/Abstract American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are one of the most at-risk racial/ethnic groups in the United States for adverse cardiometabolic (CM) and behavior health (BH) outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, obesogenic behaviors and alcohol and other drug (AOD) use problems. Urban AI/ANs constitute over two-thirds of the total AI/AN population and represent a highly disenfranchised and marginalized population who may be at particular risk for CM and BH problems, but they have been significantly under-represented in health studies. Adolescence is a critical developmental period for understanding the emergence of CM and BH problems in vulnerable populations, as behavioral health risk factors often begin in adolescence and early onset of CM dysregulation and BH problems can set the stage for widening health disparities that continue long into adulthood. Sleep is an important but understudied risk factor that may contribute to CM and BH problems in adolescents, but no prior studies have investigated the role of sleep in contributing to health disparities in urban AI/AN youth. The current proposal builds on our team?s extensive experience conducting research with urban AI/AN youth and provides a comprehensive, mixed method approach to investigate the role of sleep disturbances in contributing to health behaviors and clinically relevant health outcomes in a culturally sensitive, community-informed, and integrated framework. Specifically, this project incorporates a longitudinal assessment of objectively and subjectively measured sleep, multiple dimensions of BH problems, including tobacco, caffeine, and alcohol and other drug use, physical inactivity and electronic media use, measured CM risk factors, and qualitative methods to better understand the social and cultural context of sleep in urban AI/AN youth and the influence on downstream BH and CM problems. Outcomes from this work will address several key knowledge gaps, which are crucial to better understand pervasive health disparities among urban AI/AN youth, to identify which youth are most at risk, and to inform a future novel and culturally- sensitive intervention within this underserved community."

"9330449","Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal of all cancers. As such, new therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. We and others have shown that metabolic reprogramming is a key feature of GBM to accommodate the heightened energetic, nutrient and redox requirements to support tumor growth and survival. The most prominent characteristics of this metabolic reprogramming are a shift to high glucose metabolism. Recent evidence suggests that oncogenic signaling regulates glucose utilization in GBM. Accordingly, inhibition of oncogenic signaling can disrupt glucose metabolism, leading to reduced metabolic intermediates for cellular energetic and anabolic processes. However, the therapeutic potential of targeting oncogene-regulated glucose metabolism in GBM remains enigmatic. We present compelling preliminary data demonstrating that acute inhibition of EGFR ? the most frequently altered oncogene in GBM - can rapidly and potently attenuate glucose uptake and consequently glucose metabolism in patient-derived GBM models. As a result of this ?altered? metabolic state, GBM models show synergistic intrinsic apoptosis to pharmacological p53 activation. We also demonstrate that 18F-flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) can be used as a rapid (within hours), non-invasive biomarker that may predict sensitivity to this new rational combination. In this revised R01 application, we extend on these exciting preliminary studies and investigate in Aim 1 the precise signaling and metabolic mechanisms whereby EGFR inhibition sensitizes GBMs to p53 activation. In Aim 2, using established BH3 profiling technology, we propose to characterize the pro- and anti-apoptotic signatures resulting in p53- dependent lethality following inhibition of EGFR-regulated glucose metabolism. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine whether combined targeting of oncogene-regulated glucose metabolism (e.g., with EGFRi) and pharmacological p53 activation (in collaboration with Roche) is efficacious in direct-from-patient orthotopic GBM xenografts. We will also evaluate whether 18FDG PET can serve as a robust non-invasive biomarker for quantifying rapid changes in glucose metabolism with EGFRi via a pilot clinical trial in molecularly enriched recurrent GBM patients. The studies proposed in this application present a new combination strategy, coupled with a non-invasive predictive biomarker, aimed for specific manipulation of metabolism and apoptotic pathways in malignant glioma and have the long term potential to shift current approaches in glioma therapy."
"9357420","Project 4: Novel epigenetic treatment of IDH mutant gliomas SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 are found in several cancer types, including the majority of low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas (GBM). Although their survival is relatively prolonged relative to patients with wild-type IDH, patients with IDH mutant gliomas still almost invariably succumb to their disease. Mutant IDH causes the aberrant production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). How 2HG contributes to glioma formation is not well-understood, but it is postulated that 2HG interferes with a number of ?-ketoglutarate dependent enzymes, including those involved in DNA demethylation. A number of lines of evidence indicate that inactivation of the demethylator TET2 could result in the DNA hypermethylation observed in many IDH mutant tumors. Treatment with selective inhibitors of mutant IDH have shown promise in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but results of pre-clinical studies in glioma have been mixed. Our preliminary data indicate that the transcription factor OLIG2 may be responsible for downregulating TET2 mRNA which, in combination with 2HG, potentially renders TET2 activity virtually non-existent in IDH1-mutant gliomas. As such, inhibition of mutant IDH alone would be insufficient to recoup TET2 function. It is our fundamental hypothesis that IDH mutant gliomas are dependent on repression of TET2 expression and function, and that a combined approach of inhibition of the enzymatic function of mutant IDH along with the suppression of OLIG2 will have a beneficial effect on the treatment of IDH mutant gliomas. In Aim 1, we will validate the importance of OLIG2 in IDH mutant gliomas, using CRISPR-based gene editing in vitro and in vivo. These experiments will also determine whether IDH mutant gliomas with different background mutations, e.g., P53 mutation or 1p/19q deletion, will have different dependency on OLIG2. In Aim 2, we will then determine whether disruption of OLIG2 alone and in combination with inhibition of mutant IDH1 function -- using the investigational compound AG-881 (a novel brain-penetrant pan-IDH mutant inhibitor) -- disrupts TET2 function and inhibits tumor growth. Since direct small molecule inhibitors of OLIG2 have not been developed, our clinical strategy will focus on the use of the FDA-approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat to downregulate OLIG2. In pre-clinical studies, we will test the effects of panobinostat and other HDAC inhibitors with and without AG-881 on OLIG2 expression and TET2 function, as well as on growth of IDH mutant tumors in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 3, we will then proceed with a 2-stage clinical study. In the first stage, we will perform a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic clinical trial to verify the effects of panobinostat on OLIG2 expression in patients with IDH mutant tumors. In the second stage, we will conduct a Phase II randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of AG-881 plus panobinostat versus AG-881 alone on tumor response rate and progression-free survival (PFS). By the end of the project period, we will have verified whether our therapeutic strategy is a viable option for patients with IDH mutant glioma."

"9318423","PROJECT SUMMARY  The major goal of in vivo studies core (Core B) is to provide support to activities undertaken by Research  Projects 1-3 and Core C, by carrying out in vivo studies in small and large animal models utilizing the 4 novel  HIV envelope based vaccine platforms developed as part of this HIVRAD proposal. In addition to providing  samples for analysis, Core B will also perform immunological assays to characterize the immune responses to  vaccination and perform and monitor a repetitive low dose rectal challenge with pathogenic SHIV in non-  human primates. Animal models in vaccine research play an important role in helping test the efficacy and  safety of potential vaccine candidates as no in vitro system exists that can accurately reproduce the cellular  and humoral responses that occur in a mammalian system. The in vivo studies Core B will address 3 specific  aims. In Aim 1 we will perform iterative immunogenicity studies in inbred mice using prototype vaccines from  each of the 4 vaccine platforms (Years 1 and 2). Core B will supply samples to Core C for the analysis of gene  expression profiles, and Project 3 for B cell repertoire analysis and test for Env-specific antibodies to help  identify potential candidates to move forward for further testing. In Aim 2 we will test optimized vaccines and  vaccine regimens in the novel, genetically modified, VelocImmune® mouse and in the rabbit model (Year 3).  Here we will focus on analyzing the HIV neutralization activity induced by vaccination as well as identify unique  gene expression profiles and analyze Env-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in conjunction with  RP2. Based on the data generated from inbred mice, VelocImmune® mice and rabbit studies, Aim 3 will test  our 2 optimal pre-clinical candidates for evaluation in a non-human primate study (Years 4 and 5). The non-  human primate model provides the best system to investigate responses to our novel vaccines. Their immune  system is remarkably similar to that of humans and is therefore considered a valuable comparative model to  test vaccine efficacy and safety. Here we will monitor and supply samples for Env-specific cellular and humoral  immune responses (RP2) gene expression profiles (Core C) and Env-specific B cell repertoires (RP3) following  vaccination, then conduct a mucosal SHIV challenge experiment to test vaccine efficacy. Core B has  considerable experience in performing numerous small and large animal studies. They are more than capable  in coordinating and performing all the animal studies outlined in this proposal, in addition to being highly  proficient at performing all immunological assays and animal procedures required in this proposal."
"9363697","Abstract Influenza virus is a major public health burden that is currently controlled by yearly vaccination. Protection is largely conferred by antibodies. However, public health officials fear that such immunizations might miss newly emerging viruses or those with novel subtypes of hemagglutinin or neuraminidase proteins, with the potential to lead to a pandemic. Moreover, the costs of the current approach represent a major burden to society. Recently, hope has arisen that it may be possible to formulate a universal vaccine, capable of conferring resistance to numerous subtypes. Rare monoclonal antibodies targeting the stem region of influenza virus can be broadly neutralizing, illustrating the possibility of raising a universal influenza virus vaccine, but also indicating that the natural response is limited or natural influenza antigens do not stimulate the immune system in an appropriate way. Broadly neutralizing human antibodies reactive to the stem of influenza usually use VH1-69 with moderate numbers of mutations, but have few other features in common. The VH1-6+D3-3 broadly neutralizing antibody class targets the stem in a distinct way and has been seen in independent patients. In this RO1 project, we propose to study existing and new knock- in mice carrying germline human VH1-69 or VH1-6+D3-3 targeted to the physiological loci for their responses to influenza vaccine candidates. We shall isolate new rationally designed immunogens by evolving HA variants or scaffolds with affinity for germline- reverted broadly neutralizing VH1-69 and VH1-6+D3-3 class antibodies. These novel immunogens will then be tested for the ability to stimulate B cells using germline VH1- 69 or VH1-6+D3-3 in vivo, using novel mouse strains generated for the purpose. Finally, we will assess the ability of these immunogens alone or together with boosting immunogens for the ability to confer broad neutralizing protection. Our long-term goals are to understand the limitations of the natural influenza antibody response, to learn how to optimize immunogens, and to identify candidate universal vaccine immunogens suitable for human trials. "
"9383978","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Rapid control of emerging and re-emerging pathogens is essential to reduce transmission, morbidity and cost. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) ? which disproportionately affect low-income individuals, racial and ethnic minority groups, and women ? place a tremendous burden on the health of the public, as these infections are associated with increased risks of cancer, infertility and HIV. The ongoing, high level of STD transmission suggests that if a novel STD pathogen emerged, it could spread efficiently through established sexual networks. Among male STD patients in Columbus Ohio, we have identified an ongoing outbreak of urethritis caused by a distinct, novel clade of non-groupable Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) belonging to the pathogenic sequence type (ST)-11 clonal complex. Since January 2015, 20% of infections initially thought to be caused by the endemic STD pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng, the cause of gonorrhea) were ultimately determined to be caused by Nm. Nm is a Gram-negative diplococcus that normally colonizes the oropharynx (OP). Whereas Nm has been reported as an occasional urogenital pathogen for decades, the incidence of Nm urogenital disease is very low and suggests that sexual transmission of this pathogen is typically inefficient. However, preliminary analyses of urethral isolates from the Columbus outbreak reveal important genotypic and phenotypic changes in this Nm clade that may contribute to enhanced survival in the urogenital tract and sexual transmission. The proposed project has two aims. Aim 1 will define the clinical epidemiology of this distinct, novel Nm clade among STD clinic patients. At the same clinic where the outbreak was detected, we will screen all adult patients for urogenital Nm infection over a two-year period. Those reporting recent receptive anal or oral sex will also be screened for rectal and OP Nm infection, respectively. Patients infected with the outbreak Nm clade (index cases) and their Nm-infected and Nm-uninfected sex partners will be followed monthly for six months. All participants will provide detailed sexual behavior data and undergo monthly Nm screening at multiple anatomical sites. We will elucidate who is infected, how and where they are infected, and the spectrum of symptoms they experience. We will also determine response to treatment, assess self-clearance in the absence of treatment, characterize the sexual network, and estimate both the risk of Nm acquisition by sex partners and the risk of reinfection of index cases. Aim 2 will define the molecular epidemiology and genetic characteristics of the Nm clade that is causing the Columbus outbreak. Using whole genome sequencing, we will continue to define the genomic profile of the outbreak clade, link isolates? genetic characteristics to clinical outcomes and other factors, and determine how the genotypic features of this clade have evolved over the course of the outbreak. Through innovative characterization of a pathogenic organism that appears to have acquired enhanced capacity for sexual spread, our project has great potential to impact a significant, specific public health threat."
"9325555","Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Antonio Pedro Ramos graduated with a PhD in Political Science in 2015 and an MS in Statistics in 2014, both from UCLA. His dissertation investigated the effects of recent democratization waves on infant and child mortality among the poor in developing countries. In his graduate work, health indicators were used as a tool to test political economy theories, and thus were not the main focus of his analysis. This fellowship will allow Dr. Ramos to obtain the demographic, statistical and health policy expertise to transit from being a political scientist to become a health scholar working with health inequality.  One fundamental dimension of social inequality is inequality in early-life survival. To date, most studies on early-life mortality analyze between-group comparisons, such as income groups within the same country, and they have documented large disparities. While between-group differences are informative they mask important disparities in the mortality risk within groups. Dr Ramos' proposed project is to develop methodologies that (1) can measure inequality in early-life mortality among all births and (2) improve policy targeting by identifying small cells of high risk births that are nested within and across large groups of births.  During the K99 phase, with supervision from his mentors, Dr. Ramos will develop the methodologies that can be used to characterize and explain inequality in early-life mortality across all births and identify high risk births. His methods will be tested on a data set he already acquired that includes records on 5.5 million births from 50 developing countries. In his R00 phase, he will implement large-scale analysis by combining data from multiple sources to produce globals maps of health inequality and high risk births, as well as examine the impact of health policies on reducing child mortality.  UCLA is the ideal place for Dr. Ramos' training and research in public health and applied statistics because of its unique combination of expertise. This includes Dr. Ramos' mentoring team, several other scholars that work on similar topics in various academic centers, classes, seminars, and computational and technical resources that are available at UCLA.  Dr. Ramos is contributing to research and policy practice by developing a methodology that will allow re- searchers and policymakers to measure inequality in early mortality across births and to identify high risk births regardless of their large group membership. By doing so, this project will be the ?rst to: 1) draw a time-varying map of total inequality in early mortality across the developing world; 2) identify major correlates of these dispar- ities; and 3) develop more cost effective public health policies."
"9357418","Project 2: Targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in glioblastoma SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal of all cancers. As such, new therapeutic strategies are desperately needed. We and others have shown that metabolic reprogramming is a key feature of GBM to accommodate the heightened energetic, nutrient and redox requirements to support tumor growth and survival. The most prominent characteristics of this metabolic reprogramming are a shift to high glycolytic flux. Recent evidence suggests that oncogenic signaling regulates glycolytic flux in GBM. Accordingly, inhibition of oncogenic signaling can disrupt glycolysis, leading to reduced metabolic intermediates for cellular energetic and anabolic processes. However, the therapeutic potential of targeting oncogene-regulated glycolysis in GBM remains enigmatic. We present compelling preliminary data demonstrating that acute inhibition of EGFR ? the most frequently altered oncogene in GBM - can rapidly and potently attenuate glucose uptake and, consequently, glycolytic flux in GBM. As a result of this ?altered? metabolic state, GBM models show synergistic lethality to pharmacological p53 activation. We also demonstrate that 18F-flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) can be used as a rapid (within hours), non-invasive biomarker that may predict sensitivity to this new combination approach. In this proposal, we expand on these exciting preliminary findings. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether combined targeting of EGFR-regulated glycolysis (e.g., pulsatile Erlotinib) and p53 activation (e.g., Idasanutlin) is efficacious in straight-from-patient orthotopic GBM xenografts. We will also determine whether 18F-FDG PET can serve as a robust predictive biomarker for sensitivity to this drug combination. In Aim 2, we propose to interrogate the underlying mechanism of the unexpected role of p53 in eliciting apoptosis under pharmacological glycolytic attenuation. Finally, in Aim 3, we propose a clinical trial to test whether EGFR inhibition combined with a novel p53 activator (Idasanutlin, provided by Roche?) is safe and efficacious in recurrent GBM patients. Incorporated into this trial is the evaluation of 18F-FDG PET as a non-invasive and early predictor of efficacy to this new approach to targeting GBM metabolism. The studies proposed in this application present a new combination strategy through specific manipulation of metabolism and apoptotic pathways in malignant glioma and have the long-term potential to shift current approaches in glioma therapy."

"9407947","Abstract for Technology Development Program 2 - MAS NMR It has become clear that dynamics within protein molecules comprising HIV-1 assemblies play critical roles in regulating viral infectivity, including uncoating and maturation. Current progress in the field is hampered by the paucity of structural-biological methods that yield atomic-level information into structure and dynamics simultaneously, particularly when large-amplitude conformational rearrangements take place. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR is uniquely positioned to yield such information and, when integrated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, provides dynamic information inaccessible by any other means. While MAS NMR is a very powerful technique, it currently suffers from three major drawbacks: i) inherent low sensitivity, resulting in long measurement times; ii) high spectral congestion for large assemblies due to numerous overlapping signals; and iii) extensive and time-consuming data analysis for large systems (resonance assignments and structure calculation), hampering the widespread use of the method. We propose to develop a new methodological framework for atomic-level structural, dynamic, and mechanistic characterization of HIV-1 protein assemblies by MAS NMR, which will overcome the main roadblocks, limited sensitivity and resolution, as well as long data analysis time. To accomplish this goal, we will integrate high magnetic fields (17.6?28.2 T) with ultrafast MAS frequencies, proton detection, streamlined data acquisition, processing, and analysis. We will also employ dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-based experiments for analysis of low-concentration species as well as for investigations of the conformational space accessible to the dynamically disordered states. We will develop new experiments suitable for studies of large assemblies of HIV-1 proteins and their complexes with host proteins and small-molecule interactors, in a fraction of time and with a small fraction of material that is required for conventional experiments. The dramatic sensitivity and/or resolution enhancements foreseen to become attainable through the combination of proposed MAS NMR and DNP methods will greatly expand the range of systems amenable to in-depth characterization. The streamlined data analysis through the integration of experiment and computation will dramatically improve the throughput of MAS NMR and make the technique accessible to a very wide cohort of researchers. The technologies developed for the analysis of HIV-1 assemblies through the proposed studies will be broadly applicable to other biological assemblies. Finally, we envision that the proposed methodological framework will pave the way for the atomic-resolution structural and dynamics characterization of viral proteins in the context of intact viruses."
"9468040","PROJECT SUMMARY: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by Fmr1 gene silencing, is the most common heritable form of intellectual disability and is often comorbid with autism and seizures. In both FXS and autistic patients, the auditory cortex is of particular interest because of its crucial role in auditory processing, communication, and language development, all of which are hallmark deficits in FXS and autistic patients. Interestingly, Fmr1 knockout mice, the FXS mouse model, have both impaired plasticity during the auditory cortex critical period and altered auditory processing, suggestive of dysregulated auditory circuitry that may contribute to FXS symptoms. The auditory-specific phenotypes in both FXS patients and Fmr1 knockout mice are indicative of excitatory- inhibitory (E-I) imbalance and plasticity deficits. E-I imbalance within neural circuits is thought to underlie aspects of intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy. E-I regulation is crucial during the critical period of development, a time of experience-dependent plasticity linked to the maturation of neurotransmitter signaling systems. Perturbations during this time can have permanent effects, and several developmental disorders are linked to impaired critical periods. Changes in ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptor expression and function, the primary mediators of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, are pervasive in disorders that cause altered synaptic excitability and plasticity. My data thus far indicate that Fmr1 knockouts have significant changes in GABAA and AMPA receptor subunit expression during key ages in auditory cortex development, both in patterns suggestive of an accelerated maturation of these subunits. Despite the characterized hyperexcitable responses and plasticity deficits within the auditory cortex in FXS, the role of ionotropic receptors in auditory cortex development in FXS is unknown. Therefore, a major premise of this proposal is to evaluate the hypothesis that in the auditory cortex of Fmr1 KOs there is a precocious functional maturation of ionotropic receptors that precedes ear canal opening. My proposed project will integrate histological and electrophysiological approaches to evaluate the development of the auditory cortex in an animal model of intellectual disability, autism, and seizures. Aim 1 will determine whether GABAA receptors in Fmr1 mice have an accelerated functional maturation during the auditory cortex critical period, identifying both regional and synaptic differences across development. Aim 2 will determine whether lack of Fmr1 alters the maturation of NMDAR-only silent synapse to functional AMPAR- and NMDAR-expressing synapses within the auditory thalamocortical connections to identify these receptors' contributions to plasticity. Collectively, the results of my work will determine whether altered developmental functional maturation of ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors can contribute to E-I imbalance and impaired plasticity within the auditory cortex to elicit the auditory-related phenotypes in FXS."
"9468747","?     DESCRIPTION:  New Photostable Nanoprobes for Real-time Imaging of Single Live Cells.  Different types of cells express trace amounts of distinctive sets of receptors, enabling them serve as biomarkers for cell identification. Binding of a few ligand molecules with its receptors on single live cells can initiate dynamic cascades of cellular signaling pathways, alter cellular functions and cause diseases.  Multiple types of ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions typically work together to regulate and alter the cellular functions. Such signaling pathways can take minutes, hours or days. Thus, it is crucial to simultaneously visualize different types of receptors on single live cells with single-molecule sensitivity in order to quantify various types of receptor molecules, to directly capture how L-R interactions work together to achieve given cellular functions, and to effectively detect rare subsets of single live cells. Currently, fluorescence microscopy using fluorescence imaging probes is the primary workhorse for live cell imaging. Unfortunately, fluorescence probes (fluorophor, fluorescence protein, QD) suffer intrinsic photobleaching, making them unable to continuously capture the dynamic events of single live cells over hours. Photobleaching also makes quantitative analysis over time difficult. Separation of different excitation and emission of various fluorophores leads to complex and expensive instrument and restricts their capacity of multiplexing study of multiple types of molecules simultaneously. All fluorescence imaging methods including conventional, confocal and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy suffer these same fundamental limitations. In this proposal, we aim to develop a novel molecular imaging platform including photostable multicolored and multifunctional single molecule nanoparticle optical biosensors (SMNOBS) and far-field photostable optical nanoscopy (PHOTON) for real-time study of functions of single live cells. To demonstrate the-proof-of-concept, we will use them to quantitatively image and molecular characterize roles and functions of multiple types of the receptors on rare subsets of ovarian cancer stem cells (oCSCs) in highly heterogeneous tumor cell populations and to study their differentiation mechanisms. These powerful new tools are expected to address a wide range of pressing biochemical and biomedical questions about molecular and real-time characterization of functions of single receptor molecules on single live cells and their related signaling pathways  in real time. The proposed study will enable us to create an interdisciplinary educational environment for students; expose them to leading-edge biomedical research program; involve more students in biomedical research activities; enhance and strengthen institutional biomedical research program and infrastructure."
"9321068","Exposure to chronic stress can activate the neuroinflammatory system in the brain, including microglial cell  that may then produce the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1? (IL-1?), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF?). One possible regulator of this inflammatory response is Orphanin FQ/nociceptin (OFQ/N), a neuropeptide that contributes to a variety of physiological regulatory processes, including inhibition of anxiogenic and/or depressive-like behaviors. Indeed, OFQ/N has been implicated in the regulation of systemic immunological and inflammatory processes, and in preliminary data, it was found that 14 days of chronic unpredictable stress produced a significant and augmented elevation in hippocampal IL-1?, but not TNF?, in mice lacking the precursor polypeptide for OFQ/N (ppOFQ/N). We therefore hypothesize that OFQ/N is necessary to attenuate stressor-induced activation of the brain neuroinflammatory system, including microglial activation and the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1?. Two Specific Aims will test this hypothesis. In Specific Aim 1, chronic stress will be imposed on mice deficient for either ppOFQ/N or the OFQ/N receptor, NOP-1. Wildtype mice (stressed and non-stressed) will be used as controls. Measures of protein and mRNA for IL-1?, IL-6, and TNF?, as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF? will be obtained in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus. In addition, immunohistochemistry will determine whether there is genotype-dependent activation and cytokine localization to microglial cells, as well as stress-dependent changes in NOP-1 expression. Finally, 2-photon ex vivo hippocampal slice imaging of microglial activity will be performed on OFQ/N and NOP-1 KO and WT mice expressing eGFP in microglia to assess genotype- and/or stress-dependent effects on microglial morphology and dynamics. These biochemical and cellular observations will be complemented by behavioral analysis in Specific Aim 2. The ppOFQ/N and NOP-1 KO and WT mice will be exposed to chronic stress and then subjected to behavioral testing to assess learning and memory, as well as anxiety-like behavior. A major focus is to use a working memory version of the hippocampal-dependent T-maze spatial learning task. Excessive deficits in these behaviors in stressed KO mice, but not WT mice exposed to stress, will suggest that OFQ/N limits the neuroinflammatory response during stress in order to maintain behavioral stability. If the data lead to this interpretation, the role of IL-1? will be tested using IL-1 receptor antagonist administration in stressed and non-stressed KO and WT mice. These experiments will establish the importance of the OFQ/N ligand-receptor system as an anti-inflammatory mechanism for maintaining behavioral resilience in the face of persistent stress. Further, this will create new developments in understanding the cause and treatment of stress-related mental health disorders, and indicate that the failure of correction systems (such as OFQ/N) may result in impaired adaptation to chronic stress."
"9366229","PROJECT SUMMARY There is a critical gap in our understanding of mechanisms that underlie spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) in non-Hispanic (NH) black women. Preterm delivery (<37 weeks gestation) is the leading cause of mortality among non-anomalous neonates; survivors are at increased risk for lifelong intellectual, physical, and social disabilities compared with their term counterparts. NH black women are twice as likely as women of other races to deliver preterm. 17-alpha hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) prevents recurrent SPTB in some women, but is less effective for NH black compared with NH white women. The reasons for this variable responsiveness are poorly understood, and represent a critical knowledge gap. The long-term goal of this research is to identify NH black women at risk for 17P non-response, provide them with alternate therapies, and thereby reduce the risk of recurrent SPTB. The objective here is to quantify the role of nitric oxide (NO) pathways in the pathophysiology of recurrent SPTB among NH black women receiving 17P. Our central hypothesis is that aberrations in the NO pathway predispose NH black women to 17P non-response for the recurrent SPTB prevention. This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data and published literature showing maternal genotype, maternal blood-derived and placental-derived proteomic profiles, and DNA methylation in the NO pathway differ among women destined to be 17P non-responders. Furthermore, our studies show strong race-disparity in NO pathway genes. The rationale for this work is that it will provide new insight and increased understanding into the pathophysiology and biologic mechanisms of non-response to 17P for SPTB prevention among NH black women, a group at disproportionately high risk of 17P treatment failure. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Aims: (1) Determine which genes in the NO pathway are differentially expressed in the mid-trimester among women destined to be 17P non-responders, (2) Establish which NO pathway genes display differential CpG methylation in the mid-trimester in 17P non-responders, and (3) Quantify conservation of gene expression and epigenetic markers between mother and offspring. These aims will be assessed using longitudinal samples from 300 NH black women. This approach is innovative, because this project will examine epigenetic and expression changes in maternal circulating blood and in fetal- derived tissues in response to 17P, shedding light on acute changes that occur in response to 17P. The proposed research is significant because as methylation and gene expression patterns are recognizable in the second trimester, they may provide the basis for development of diagnostic tests to identify women at risk for recurrent PTB despite 17P prophylaxis. This project is directly aligned with the mission of the NIMHD, and will provide immediate and sustained clinical and public health impact to reduce disparities in PTB outcomes in NH black women and infants, thereby reducing neonatal mortality and lifelong morbidity."
"9313185","Abstract Approximately half of the two million infections acquired at hospitals in the US are associated with implanted medical devices. Bacterial colonization of implanted medical device surfaces is a major cause of device failure and usually requires device removal coupled with long term antibiotic treatment. Risks of morbidity/mortality from surgery and prolonged hospitalization make early detection critical. However, detection is challenging at early stages prior to development of systemic symptoms of infection when bacteria localized to inaccessible regions of the implant. We will develop a novel medical imaging technique, X-ray excited luminescent chemical imaging (XELCI) to non-invasively detect and monitor bacterial biofilms on modified implant surfaces. Our long term goal is to develop a sensor to detect and monitor in vivo infection. The approach is innovative because no other imaging technique provides surface-specific chemical information at high-resolution through thick tissue. XELCI is a type of scanning optical microscopy wherein a narrow X-ray beam irradiates a radioluminescent film on the implant surface creating a local luminescent spot with pH -dependent spectra. Although the luminescence scatters and blurs as it passes through the tissue in the ?far field,? the spectrum depends upon the local pH at the luminescence source, and image resolution is defined by the X-ray beam width. We will apply the technique to detect acidosis beneath biofilms in order to detect and monitor infection. Our two specific aims are to 1) Refine and validate XELCI sensors in vitro and ex vivo; 2) Use XELCI to Assess pH Changes during Healing and Infection in a Rabbit Model. The proposed research is significant because it develops a non-invasive method to detect, monitor, and study biofilms in situ with the ultimate potential for reducing morbidity, mortality and associated cost from implant infections."
"9323802","Project Summary A variety of therapeutic strategies are being pursued to try to eradicate or constrain the latent HIV reservoir such that high-level viral rebound does not occur when antiretroviral therapy is discontinued. Testing the efficacy of these strategies currently requires analytical treatment interruption (ATI), during which a suppressed patient is taken off ART and carefully monitored for viral rebound. Having reliable biomarkers that could accurately predict the effectiveness of the therapeutic approach as assessed by time to rebound after treatment interruption would greatly accelerate the pace of HIV cure research, reduce the number of costly and logistically challenging ATI trials, and provide greater protection to patients participating in these trials. From a translatable perspective, these biomarkers should be readily detectable in blood and not require tissue biopsies. Although viral reservoir size is a predictor of time-to-rebound post-ATI, it is not a robust biomarker. Currently, there are no known immunological biomarkers at the time of ATI that can predict the duration of viral control. In this project, biomarkers predicting shorter or longer times to rebound will be identified in well-suppressed HIV-infected patients undergoing treatment interruption. Specifically, mass cytometry, or cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), will be used to identify phenotypic and functional biomarkers predicting time to viral rebound. Blood samples obtained at the time of ATI, from patients who were treated during chronic as well as acute infection, will be analyzed by CyTOF deep-phenotyping for immunological signatures of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, monocytes, neutrophils, conventional DCs, plasmacytoid DCs, and NK cells that predict time-to-rebound. Seven panels of ~40 parameters each will be used. These signatures will include not only cellular phenotype but also the functional activity of these cells in response to ex vivo stimulations including treatment with latency reversal agents (LRAs). Correlations will be analyzed by the Citrus algorithm that identifies features of cellular subsets that significantly associate with disease outcome, in this case time-to-rebound. Finally, productively infected cells in these patients at the time of viral rebound will be characterized to help chart the latent reactivatable reservoir in these patients. The aims in this project will take advantage of the powers of high-dimensional CyTOF phenotyping and its analysis tools to identify novel biomarkers predicting time to viral rebound after treatment interruption. Such biomarkers might ultimately prove helpful in the evaluation of various cure therapies."
"9334641","ABSTRACT: This application is seeking funding specifically for Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) of scale-up production of long acting atrial natriuretic peptide (dANP) and its protected graft co-polymer (PGC) excipient for use in heart failure (HF) treatment. The extrinsic merit of this project will be the availability of cGMP grade PGC for use in prolonging the half-life of various peptide drugs that are in preclinical development by other companies. Our product goal at the end of this project is cGMP grade PGC-dANP. Additional funding for Toxicology and Phase 1 Clinical Trials from a private investor will be made available at delivery of cGMP grade PGC-dANP. ANP has a long history of efficacy in HF patients and those treated by 2-3day continuous infusion have shown smaller infarct size and lower incidence of readmission to hospital than controls. However, sustained ANP infusion for 2-3 days in hospital setting has a very high health care cost and longer treatment is impractical. PGC-dANP is a product that can be administered subcutaneously at home and can be continued for several months to further reduce future cardiac events, improve long term outcomes, and reduce overall health care costs. At this stage we can consistently produce 35g batch of PGC in our laboratory and we want to scale it up to 500g in a cGMP facility. We already developed the analytical requirements needed for lot release and stability testing but we need to define the widest range that will provide no significant difference in PK/PD profile. This is important to reduce risk of unnecessary cost of lot rejection especially for big batches worth several $100K. The Aims are: to establish the widest acceptable range of values that measure Quality, Integrity, Purity, Potency and Sterility (QIPPS) as lot release indicators required by the FDA and transfer the analytical methods to the appropriate GLP facilities; to scale up PGCs synthesis from our 35g process to 500g and produce 500g cGMP grade PGC; and to formulate PGC-dANP in a cGMP manner, with stability testing using QIPPS analysis in a GLP facility.

"9323183","PROJECT SUMMARY This project seeks to surmount current limitations in our understanding of early infant immunity through longitudinal genomic and cellular studies of immune development and primary responses to routine two-month vaccines. Infants and young children are more susceptible to invasive infections than adults owing to overall reduced competency of protective immune responses, including to vaccines, which require administration of multiple doses over several months for adequate long-term protection. While immunization programs have dramatically decreased the global morbidity and mortality caused by infections, it remains that infectious diseases are the most frequent cause of death in infants and young children. The cellular, molecular and genomic mechanisms that contribute to this vulnerability are largely unknown. Ever more powerful tools in genomics and systems biology offer exciting opportunities to resolve these knowledge gaps through detailed analysis of the transcriptomic, epigenomic and functional signatures of infant immune cell populations. However, such studies have been limited by the difficulty in accessing clinical samples from infants, the incompatibility of many genomic technologies for use in small-volume samples, and the lack of bioinformatic tools for integrating and interpreting complimentary yet complex datasets. This proposal will capitalize on our experience studying the infant immune response, our access to infant populations, and our expertise in developing immunogenomic assays for use in human blood-derived immune cells (PBMCs). Specifically, we propose a longitudinal analysis of PBMCs from infants i) at 2, 6 and 12 months, to establish the baseline cellular, phenotypic and genomic signatures of immune development (Aim 1), and ii) at key time points over the course of routine two-month vaccinations, to identify the cellular, phenotypic and genomic signatures associated with primary immune responses to vaccines (Aim 2). We will use an innovative immunogenomic Profiling and Analysis Pipeline (iPAP) we developed that allows us to extract maximal transcriptomic (RNA-seq), epigenomic (ATAC-seq), isoformic (SMRT-seq), cytometric (50-parameter flow cytometry) and immunophenotypic (CyTOF) information from a single infant blood sample, and to integrate these distinct datasets for unparalleled depth of insight into the correlated cellular and genomic signatures of immune development and vaccine responsiveness. Our approach is unbiased, multifaceted and highly technology-driven, combining many of the most cutting-edge genomic and quantitative cell-based technologies with our deep experience in applying these technologies for use in human infant immune cells. In line with the goals of this RFA, this project will yield a comprehensive dataset from infants that can be used to identify fundamental mechanisms and pathways associated with immune development and primary responses to vaccines, and will set the stage for future studies aimed at designing new interventions that induce more potent and protective immune responses for young infants."
"9321197","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable refinement in immunosuppressive regimens over the last 25 years and decreased rates of acute rejection following kidney transplantation, long-term transplant outcomes have not improved at the same rate and have remained stagnant. Furthermore, there has been a relative paucity in the development of new immunosuppressive strategies to minimize acute and chronic injury. Maraviroc is a CCR5 inhibitor that may have a novel role in modulating the immune response following transplantation. An ideal setting to test its impact on the alloimmune response is in HIV infected patients undergoing kidney transplantation as maraviroc has known anti-retroviral qualities. This is particularly relevant in that unexpectedly high rejection rates (2-3 fold higher than HIV uninfected recipients) have been reported following kidney transplantation in HIV positive recipients. We hypothesize that CCR5 blockade will minimize immunologic graft injury and improve long-term kidney function. This hypothesis leads to the primary aim, which is to determine the impact of a CCR5 inhibitor (maraviroc) on improving long-term kidney graft function following kidney transplantation in HIV infected recipients. Secondly, some evidence suggests that inhibition of CCR5 could reduce the size of the HIV viral reservoir during long-term antiretroviral therapy in people with HIV. We hypothesize that CCR5 blockade in combination with immunosuppressive therapy used following kidney transplantation will reduce HIV persistence in CD4+ T lymphocytes. Thus, we aim to determine the impact of maraviroc on HIV persistence. Lastly, We hypothesize that the high rate of kidney transplant rejection in HIV+ patients is be due to high frequency of heterologous memory donor-reactive T cells that arise in response to chronic infections in this population which include HIV and a multitude of other co-pathogens such as CMV, EBV, HCV, and HBV. Thus, transplantation in HIV+ patients may provide a unique opportunity to determine the importance of heterologous immunity to transplant outcomes in humans. This leads to the third aim, which is to assess the alloimmune status of HIV+ transplant patients and impact of CCR5 blockade on their alloimmune profile. To achieve these three aims, we propose a prospective, multi-center, double-blind phase II study of kidney transplantation in HIV+ individuals assessing the safety and efficacy of a maraviroc-based antiretroviral regimen given post-transplant. Subjects will be consented and enrolled until 120 eligible subjects are randomized. We will perform mechanistic analysis of the study subjects by testing collected blood samples at defined time points. The R34 grant will allow the investigators to finalize all facets of the clinical trial protocol, procedures for specimen collecion, banking and tracking, for confirming all participating centers, and preparing all necessary study documents and processes."

"9336853","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as anhedonia and amotivation, signal an absence of typical hedonic and motivational outputs, and may reflect underlying alterations in the way the brain processes rewarding stimuli. Recent advances in basic neuroscience are providing novel insights into reward-related neural circuitry that, when perturbed, could contribute to negative symptom manifestation. In particular, impairments in prefrontal-striatal connections may confer higher-order reward processing deficits in schizophrenia, such as deficits in how rewards are represented and valued, as well as in the motivation and execution of goal-directed behaviors that optimize reward seeking. Several fMRI studies have reported that reduced striatal brain activations to rewarding stimuli relate to worse negative symptomatology in schizophrenia patients. In addition, recent findings show that in healthy individuals reward availability enhances functional activity in regions, such as the lateral prefrontal cortex, that drive cognitiv control. Ostensibly, normative control-related brain responses are amplified by incentivized contexts in order to increase behavioral output and thereby maximize reward attainment. Together, these literatures suggest that to better understand the extent to which dysfunctions of the brain's reward system contribute to the real world deficits in goal pursuit and attainment associated with schizophrenia, it will be necessary to consider not only initial brain responses evoked by rewarding stimuli, but also how these more basic reward signals interact with higher-order cognitive features that drive motivated behaviors. Accordingly, this CDA study will examine basic features of evoked brain responses to rewarding stimuli, as well as the interaction of reward incentives on cognitive control functioning in young adults with recent-onset schizophrenia. The training plan will further develop the PI's expertise in psychiatric neuroimaging through a tailored combination of formal coursework, methodological workshops, seminars, and collaboration with established investigators in schizophrenia, reward neurobiology, and the integration of functional neuroimaging methods. More specifically, the proposed work will combine neuroimaging modalities (fMRI and EEG) to characterize neurobiological mechanisms underlying putative reward processing deficits in schizophrenia, as they relate to clinical features of avolition and anhedonia. Major project objectives are to inform understanding of the neurobiology of reward through: i) assessing brain functioning during passive anticipation, receipt and loss of monetary rewards in schizophrenia and ii) determining whether reward-related modulation of brain functioning during cognitive control deviates in schizophrenia from healthy control patterns. By providing information about both spatial and temporal features of brain activity, combination fMRI and EEG will enable a more comprehensive assessment of the aspects of reward-related brain activity that are the focus of the proposed work. Negative symptoms are strong predictors of poorer social and occupational functional outcomes in schizophrenia, suggesting that effectively intervening on this symptom class could demonstrably improve clinical prognosis. Findings from this CDA project could provide valuable insight into the pathophysiology of reward processing anomalies in schizophrenia, which may in turn, inform intervention efforts relevant to treating motivational and hedonic deficits."
"9386495","Project Summary Although the advent of biomedical big data has produced opportunities for researchers to study and reveal genetic patterns with the potential for curing human health related diseases, there is a lack of programs focused on the unique needs and continuous training of underrepresented researchers, both students and faculty/staff, in big data science and its applications to biomedical research. Educating underrepresented groups for wealth NIH biomedical big data is important to central Indiana and to the nation. To meet this need, in partnership with The Ohio State University (OSU) we propose to develop a program (BD4ISU) for training underrepresented undergraduate students at Indiana State University (ISU) with the knowledge of big data computation and analysis in biomedical research. The program is also designed to enhance the ISU?s faculty/staff knowledge base in big data science and extend their didactic and professional skills in biomedical research by injecting novel instructional methods. The BD4ISU program has three specific aims. The first aim is to recruit and prepare underrepresented students for research careers in Biomedical Big Data Science. Three cohorts of five selected underrepresented students will be placed into a four-year math/data science BS program with an emphasis in biomedical data science to learn biomedical data knowledge by taking classes during academic years and attending summer workshops. The second aim is to offer hands-on research experience on biomedical big data manipulation for underrepresented students. Students will participate in a 10-week research- intensive summer program on the OSU campus and will participate research in faculty?s labs. Through OSU/ISU faculty mentored, yet student-oriented research experience, students will learn hands-on skills in manipulating and analyzing biomedical big data. The third aim is to enhance and expand big data knowledge to ISU faculty/staff. ISU faculty/staff will be guided under the mentorship of OSU faculty to create innovative and/or improve existing big data based curricula to better train students for research in biomedical data science. It is the ultimate goal of BD4ISU program to build a path of underrepresented students into graduate studies and career settlement in the biomedical research field."
"9301687","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epidemics of tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV) infection converge with the greatest intensity in Sub-Saharan Africa where both the incidence and the prevalence of TB increased as the HIV epidemic swept through the continent. In Africa today, TB may affect up to 30% of co-infected persons and is the leading cause of death among HIV seropositive persons. Although proper treatment of both infections may limit morbidity and mortality of the co-infection, treatment may not alter the underlying dynamics of the HIV and TB epidemics, so new approaches are needed that target transmission and prevent infection in the first place. The overall goal of the proposed training program is to build sustainable capacity at Makerere University in molecular and computational epidemiology by training Ugandan scientists in these new and emerging methods so that they may be applied to study the complex and interacting transmission dynamics of HIV and M. tuberculosis in Kampala. The program will achieve its goal by training 2 pre-doctoral students in molecular or computational epidemiology, 2 post-doctoral trainees, and 5 non-degree trainees in technical skills relating to computational epidemiology and bioinformatics. To supplement this training based at UGA, the program will put on a series of short courses in Uganda relating to network sciences and their application in Epidemiology, molecular biology and bioinformatics. The proposed training program builds on the 25 year collaboration between the Ugandans and the PD and extends the five-year collaboration between Makerere University and the University of Georgia on HIV and TB. The training will be embedded and integrated into ongoing, research projects designed to examine transmission patterns of M. tuberculosis within social networks in the context of a mature HIV epidemic. The program will be directed by Dr. Christopher Whalen, at UGA, with a co-director Dr. Moses Joloba at Makerere University."
"9357736","Summary In 2014, the outbreak of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted the need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other emerging viruses. Several groups had previously performed high throughput screens in 2013 and identified FDA approved drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene) with in vitro growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. We used these compounds to create a computational pharmacophore to identify additional compounds to test in vitro. In addition, data from a published large scale high throughput screen performed by SRI International and Texas Biomedical Research Institute was used to create machine learning models and then subsequently used to score clinical compounds for testing. We have published on how these combined methods identified 3 compounds for testing which were ultimately found to be nM in vitro. One of these compounds is an antimalarial approved in Europe called pyronaridine. We propose to characterize the ADME and PK properties of this compound prior to determining its efficacy in a mouse model of the Ebola virus infection. Therefore the Aims of this R21 proposal will fill some of the gaps inherent in the published data on pyronaridine so far: Aim 1. Perform preclinical in vitro characterization of pyronaridine. Aim 2. Formulate pyronaridine and perform PK studies in mouse. Aim 3. In vitro characterization of pyronaridine against multiple EBOV strains and in vivo efficacy in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection. The results of these aims will determine go/no go criteria for pursuing larger animal studies in non-human primates prior to clinical studies. In the light of a recent paper in the New England Journal of Medicine showing a clinical observation that EBOV patients treated with artesunate-amodiaquine had a 31% higher survival rate than those treated with artemether- lumefantrine 2, there will be considerable interest in evaluating antimalarials against Ebola. Our proposal to consider testing the efficacy in the mouse EBOV model using pyronaridine (which is used as artesunate- pyronaridine (Pyramax) and would be readily accessible in the clinic), presents a rapid approach to leverage the aforementioned clinical observations with a more potent compound. Pyronaridine also has additional benefits of tolerability which may be important in this patient population."
"9376875","ABSTRACT Pathologic fibrosis of the heart or lung results in fatal organ failure with no current cure, short of transplantation. In order to successfully ameliorate cardiac and pulmonary fibrotic disorders, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of organ fibrosis is vital. Fibrogenesis among organs exhibit both common and unique features. Among these, myofibroblasts are key common, fibrosis-effector cells. It has long been known that the response to changes in the mechanical properties of the surrounding tissue/matrix, along with active TGF-?, are critical drivers of myofibroblast differentiation. Although integrins and other receptors participate in cell-matrix interactions, the specific mechanosensor driving myofibroblast has remained elusive. We have recently identified TRPV4 as the critical mechanosensor for driving both myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in the lung. TRPV4 is a stretch-activatable, plasma membrane cation channel in the transient receptor potential, vanilloid family (TRPV4). Moreover, TRPV4 drives myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis at levels of matrix stiffness that are directly biologically and clinically relevant to cardiac and pulmonary disease. We have confirmed recent observations demonstrating TRPV4's importance to cardiac myofibroblast differentiation, and our novel preliminary data further suggests that both the heart and lung pro-fibrotic signals depends on TRPV4's signal pathway interactions with the ?-isoform of PI3K. Based on this data, we have formulated the novel hypothesis that the TRPV4-PI3K? signaling axis mediates mechanotransduction that drives myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in both the heart and lung. Intriguingly, the details of how TRPV4-PI3K? interact to drive fibrosis appear to quite different and organ-specific. Two coordinated specific aims will determine the mechanism whereby TRPV4-PI3K? mechanosignal transduction pathways mediate myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in the heart and lungs, respectively. These aims will use gain and loss function experimental designs with both genetic and pharmacologic approaches to determine the key TRPV4-PI3K? pathway interactions that drive myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis. TRPV4-PI3K? axis will be interrogated using hierarchical experimental systems at the cellular level, at the level of established experimental murine models, and at the level of human disease. When complete, we will have a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the precise mechanism by which the TRPV4-PI3K? axis mediates cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis. As several small molecule, selective inhibitors of both PI3K? and TRPV4 are in various phases of development, the knowledge gained from this ?proof of concept? study could rapidly translate into novel therapeutic approaches for both cardiac and pulmonary fibrotic disorders."
"9324262","PROJECT C   PRDM9 is a multi-functional protein, expressed uniquely during meiosis, that regulates meiotic  recombination, transcription, and gametogenesis. We know that PRDM9 has the capacity to create  transcriptionally activating histone H3K4me3 chromatin marks, possesses potentially repressive KRAB and  SSXRD domains, and physically binds to recombination hotspot sequences; but we do not understand how  these molecular functions cooperate to achieve PRDM9's diverse biological roles.   The overall goal of this project is to delineate the molecular networks of PRDM9's transcriptional and  H3K4 trimethyltransferase activity through high-throughput sequencing, and to analyze these data in  conjunction with other Program Project data to construct a computational systems biology model of F'RDM9  function.   In Aim 1, we will determine PRDM9-dependent gene expression changes and histone H3K4me3 mark  changes throughout a meiotic germ cell time course. We will analyze these data in conjunction with the  PRDMS-DNA binding data of Project B Petkov and the characterization of PRDMS-SET and -KRAB domain  mutants of Project D Handel, to distinguish direct from indirect transcriptional targets of PRDMS, and to infer  the likely mechanisms of regulation.   In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of allelic and dosage variation in PrdmQ by examining gene  expression and H3K4me mark profiles from germ cells isolated from an allelic series of mice. We will analyze  these data in conjunction with the characterization of these strains by Projects A Paigen and B Petkov to  associate each allele with downstream outcomes and to examine allelic interference or dominance patterns.   In Aim 3, we will develop and apply a statistical machine learning approach to computationally integrate  all Program Project data, including the RNA-seq and ChlP-seq data of this project, with high-throughput data  from the literature into a comprehensive model of PRDMS function. Our integrated model will be used to  predict novel PRDMS interactors and meiotic proteins, and will serve as a resource for the germ cell  community through a public, online visualization interface.   Ultimately, this project will determine the temporal and allelic dynamics of PRDMS's transcriptional and  chromatin modifying roles, and will place these data in the broader context of PRDMS's multiple functions in  recombination, meiosis, and gametogenesis."
"9318427","PROJECT SUMMARY  In this Project, we will leverage our novel Native Flexibly Linked (NFL) platform to generate super stable,  soluble and well-ordered South African clade C 1086 trimers for eventual particulate and membrane-  associated display based on our recently developed design strategies using other subtype C and B-derived  envelope glycoproteins (Env) to generate ?super stable? trimers. We present such design improvement in the  Preliminary Data of Aim 1. Alternatively, we will use other South African clade C Envs (i.e. CAP244) if  transplantation of these modifications to 1086 proves difficult. The subtype A, BG505-derived Env, forms highly  homogeneous, well-ordered native-like trimers by either the NFL or SOSIP design strategies. But since most  HIV infected individuals are located in sub-Saharan Africa, there is an unmet need to generate stable spike  mimetics of South African or other African origins as a starting point towards a vaccine designed specifically for  the major focus of the HIV pandemic. The NFL trimers derived from other HIV-1 Env sequences, such as JRFL  and 16055 (subtypes B and C, respectively) form NFL trimers to a lesser degree, requiring negative selection  to generate homogenous, well-ordered spike mimetics. These differences in trimer propensity formation  presumably emanate either from primary amino acid differences or post translationally related aspects, such as  distribution of N-glycans on the Env solvent-exposed surfaces. To improve the ?spontaneous? trimer formation  of NFLs derived from the clade B JRFL and C 16055 Envs, we performed both sequence and structural  alignments to identify BG505 trimer-derived (TD) sequence-specific residues that might increase the  propensity of the JRFL- and 16055-derived Env to more efficiently form well-ordered trimers. By this process,  having identified key residues at the gp120-gp41 interface, as well as in the variable regions, we further  stabilized these trimers by engineering an intra-protomer disulfide linkage in the pre-bridging sheet (201-433).  This disulfide locks the gp120 in the pre-fusion state and prevents CD4 induced-conformational  rearrangements. Both the TD mutations and the 201-433 disulfide linkage increased well-ordered trimer  formation and thermostability. Here, we will expand this approach to 1086 (Aim 1) and then in Aim 2 we will  generate cysteine-linked Env liposomes to create virus-like particles (VLPs). This strategy may overcome the  low levels of Env incorporation that occurs using natural HIV Env and Gag sequences to generate VLPs. We  will design and develop liposomal nanoparticles displaying high-density HIV Env NFL clade C (1086) spike  mimetics, covalently link the trimers to the liposomes and analyze them by binding kinetics and negative  staining followed by cryoEM. We will then cross-compare them to other means of particulate or membrane  display described in other components of this P01. We will also generate the trimers for bulk or single B cell  sorting and point mutant variants in Aims 3 and 4. The merging of well-ordered clade C trimers and particulate  display represent a promising lead toward the development of a more effective HIV vaccine."

"9448589","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender people are a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. They express their gender-variant identity in various ways and through a multitude of self- labels, both within and outside of binary conceptualizations of sex/gender as either male or female, man or woman, masculine or feminine. While public awareness of this diversity has grown, our understanding of transgender people's experience is limited by a lack of systematic research on their identity development. Health inequities documented among the U.S. transgender population include depression (44%), suicidal ideation (54%) and attempts (31%), anxiety (33%), smoking (36%), and HIV infection (12% based on self- report; 28% on testing). Social stigma attached to gender nonconformity has been proposed as a major contributing factor to these health inequities. Previous research found that the vast majority of transgender individuals experienced discrimination. Much of the data, however, is limited by the use of small convenience samples of transgender women with a history of sex work, recruited from AIDS and social service agencies. The goal of this study is to move beyond these limitations by using purposive, venue-based sampling to recruit a broad, diverse sample of transgender people in 3 U.S. cities--New York, San Francisco, and Atlanta-and enroll them into a mixed-method longitudinal study to test an adaptation of the minority stress model, investigating vulnerability, risk and resilience in the context of identity development. The aims of the study are: (1) To describe the process of transgender identity development based on qualitative lifeline interviews with a sample of 90 transgender individuals ages 16 and older, and identify periods of acute vulnerability and characteristics of resilience; (2) Informed by findings from Aim 1, to refine a model combining identity development, minority stress, and resilience, and to develop/adapt measures to assess the model's key constructs; (3) To test the model of resilience in a cohort of transgender individuals (N = 480) stratified by city, gender, and age, and follow them over time (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow up interviews); and (4) To triangulate qualitative and quantitative data on identity development and minority stress processes in order to inform the future development and testing of intervention strategies aimed at fostering resilience and reducing stigma and discrimination. By achieving these aims, this study will make a significant advance in scientific knowledge about gender identity development, minority stress processes (enacted stigma, felts stigma, concealment, shame and their impact on health and psychosocial adjustment), minority coping (on an individual as well as community level), and the development of resilience over time. The study is innovative in its focus on an understudied minority population, the application of the lifeline interview method to this population, and the adaptation and testing of the minority stress model within the context of transgender identity development."
"9479750","ImmuNext has identified and developed a putative lead anti-VISTA monoclonal antibody (mAb) that we aim to bring to the clinic for the treatment of human autoimmune disease. VISTA is a member of the highly successful negative checkpoint regulator (NCR) family of drug targets, whose members have demonstrated proven efficacy in inducing long-term remissions in human cancers. We contend that antibodies that suppress immune function by enhancing VISTA?s function will prove effective in a broad array of human autoimmune diseases. The unique nature of VISTA to regulate both lymphoid and myeloid cells suggests that its modulation will be best suited toward the treatment of SLE, where defects in both subsets have been identified. With a strong patent position, state-of-the-art approaches and a skilled, experienced drug development team, we will develop a first-in-class NCR-targeted therapeutic for the treatment of autoimmune disease. In Phase 1 we will identify a cynomolgus cross-reactive lead and a backup mAb through functional screening of an anti-VISTA human antibody library. We currently have a human CD3-activated T call assay for our primary screen. Our choice of the best functional antibody and a backup will come from: 1) using in vitro assays, 2) by confirming activity using a human-VISTA knock-in (hV-KI) mouse strain and 3) with two models of autoimmune inflammation, concanavalin A induced hepatitis and, following selection, a graft vs. host disease model. After selection of the best antibody and a backup, we will advance into Phase 2 with lead optimization and preclinical development. The constant region of the lead antibody will be engineered through Ig isotype and FcRn engineering, and we will choose the best one to develop as the final lead molecule. This lead will be assessed for immunogenicity and manufacturing liabilities, and will be used to study the mechanism of action (MOA) in hV-KI mice. Additionally, we will examine the potential for this new therapeutic to induce immunological tolerance using transplant models. PK/PD relationships will be measured and rodent toxicity investigated. We will also develop PD biomarkers to inform future clinical plans using a variety of approaches, including examining tissues and cells by Phosflow and RNA-seq in drug-treated settings. By examining VISTA and the lead MOA in SLE human patient samples compared to healthy controls, we will potentially identify VISTA biomarkers for future clinical trials. With a qualified lead in hand, we will commence cell line development and non-GLP PK/PD and toxicological assessment in cynomolgus non-human primates. We have convened a panel of experts that will help collect, analyze and process the data generated from these studies to outline a clinical strategy and an IND-enabling GLP tox study. The first-in-class anti-VISTA mAb will ultimately provide patients with a unique checkpoint regulator drug to not only treat their symptoms, but also to provide them the opportunity to reset their immune system back to a healthy homeostatic state."
"9372902","Abstract Significance: Donor tissue shortage remains a critical problem in lung transplantation. Recent advances in tissue engineering have allowed for the possibility of generating bioengineered lungs from decellularized organ scaffolds. These scaffolds, created from the donor?s tissue, become functionalized after recellularization with a patient?s own cells. However, translation of whole-lung decell/recell technology to the clinic has been hampered by the lack of sophisticated tissue growth technologies (e.g. bioreactors) that are capable of providing precise feedback and control of the microenvironment within the scaffold. Innovation: One specific feature that all bioreactors currently lack is a way to noninvasively image the developing organs within them, or quantitatively assess the seeding and growth of cells over time. Currently, these parameters can only be evaluated destructively by histology or by rudimentary input/output assays that have no spatial sensitivity. Therefore, we propose a novel bioreactor that will provide a new layer of information and feedback to the user based on 3D contrast-enhanced ultrasound/photoacoustic (USPA) image data. USPA is a new functional imaging modality that utilizes a light source to generate ultrasonic waves throughout a tissue volume. This approach can provide noninvasive high-resolution images of cellular distribution and cellular metabolism in 3D. Team: SonoVol, Inc., a company specializing in 3D robotic ultrasound imaging, will partner with a team of tissue engineer (UMN), photoacoustics (Johns Hopkins), and medical image analysis (Kitware) experts to build a specialized bioreactor with integrated noninvasive molecular imaging feedback. Hypothesis: The USPA enabled bioreactor will improve whole-organ engineering research by providing real time quantitative feedback on cellular distribution and metabolism. This will accelerate the experimental feedback loop as compared to conventional histology, as well as reduce costs. Approach: During Phase I we will demonstrate feasibility within a mouse lung. During Phase II we will scale the system up for use in translational-sized porcine organs, and perform the commercial R&D necessary to deliver our first calibrated and validated systems to customers. Impact: This technology will be the first commercially available bioreactor of its kind, specifically designed for noninvasive molecular imaging and nondestructive assessment of the 3D organ constructs. Initially its commercial impact will be primarily focused at academic research institutions, however as lung bioengineering technologies mature, the technology could eventually serve a critical role in biotech after bioengineered lungs are approved for clinical use."
"9320878","The Data Generation Core will focus on measuring the effect of drug combinations and individual drugs on  cell types associated with hepatic toxicity, cardiac toxicity and peripheral neuropathy adverse events  observed at the organism level. These are all serious adverse events that alter drug usage and  development. A novel feature of our experimental design is our selection of drug combinations. Most  Americans take multiple drugs. Exhaustively testing all potential drug combinations is intractable due to the  combinatorial explosion of possibilities and has not been done by any previous large scale effort. Our  preliminary data based on analysis of serious drug adverse events as reported in FAERS has revealed 120  drug combinations involving 130 individual drugs whereby addition of a second drug significantly mitigates  the serious toxicity induced by the first drug. We will use a panel of human cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes,  and neuronal cell lines from primary/established lines, as well as those derived from human induced  pluripotent stem cells. The total of number of cell lines is 18. The experimental data will be high-throughput,  producing greater than 1 million data points per year. It will be on the genome-wide whole cell level and  include changes in mRNA levels (microarray) and changes in protein levels (mass spec). We expect that a  combination of mRNA and protein level data will synergize in signature generation. Our use of established  yet cost effective methodologies is desirable since it enables immediate production and facilitates more  widespread uptake and reproduction. These data together will be used to develop cellular signatures for the  drugs or drug combinations in the Data Analysis and Signature Generation Core. The signatures will  highlight key pathways that inform targeted, medium-throughput measurements of protein states by  microwestern array. These targeted measurements will characterize dose and dynamic responses of  biological states relevant to our drugs and drug combinations. Throughout we focus on careful annotation  and quality control for dissemination of these data to the community, and also are open to community  feedback in altering our preliminary plan."
"9352829","PROJECT SUMMARY ? Pilot and Feasibility Program The Pilot and Feasibility grant program at the Chicago Center for Diabetes Translation Research (CCDTR) supports new areas of inquiry in diabetes-related translation research, with a special focus on vulnerable populations. The main aim of P&F program is to provide funding for investigators to explore novel hypotheses and to obtain preliminary data in order to secure long-term support from conventional funding mechanisms. Funding from the P&F program has supported new investigators who are seeking to become fully independent scientists in diabetes translation research and established investigators who are seeking to initiate diabetes- related research. Since its inception in 2011, the CCDTR P&F program has received 20 applications and has awarded 11 grants. Thus far these pilot grants have led to 15 abstract presentations, 4 peer-reviewed publications, and 10 grant applications submitted, with subsequent funding of 6 grants from the NIDDK, NHBLI, and AHRQ. The P&F program has made a difference for many investigators and has launched the careers of several investigators in the fields of diabetes translational research. Our breadth of funding is demonstrated in the number of institutions and types of interventions funded. About 40% of grantees are from outside the University of Chicago. The grantees' areas of study have included assessments of sleep interventions to improve diabetic outcomes, improving care of patients with pre-end-stage kidney disease, community health worker interventions, mobile phone interventions on sedentary behavior, and outcomes of women with type 2 diabetes and breast cancer. Looking forward, we plan to continue our successful P&F program, which has been an integral part of the CCDTR in fostering collaboration and has led to important research findings, and further expand its scope. We are requesting continuing support at the level of $50,000 per year. The Dean of the Biological Sciences Division, Kenneth Polonsky, MD, will continue his support by providing $50,000 in matching funds per year towards the P&F program. This supplemental funding will allow us to grant four awards of $25,000 per year. We also plan to diversify the areas of translation research funded by encouraging applications that study diverse types of interventions (e.g. interventions to improve population health), the populations studied (e.g. Asian American populations and LGBTQ patients), and the fields of expertise of the grantees (e.g. environmental science, breadth of clinical specialties and subspecialties). The success of our P&F program to date is a reflection of the interdisciplinary nature of our center and the strong research base it provides. Through a renewal of the CCDTR, the P&F program will be able to continue to provide necessary funding support to a new generation of innovative and diverse diabetes translation researchers and increase their chances of securing long-term funding in the future."
"9314079","SPIRIT Project Summary Many suicide prevention interventions have demonstrated efficacy individually, but are not implemented or translated into meaningful care outcomes that can be implemented across multiple contexts. Researching the implementation process is a key to determine whether an integrated intervention is sustainable when implemented on a wider scale. This project aims to close the implementation gap by implementing an integrated suicide prevention intervention in a rural area of Gujarat and assess the success of the intervention in changing behavior of community recipients of the intervention leading to reduced suicides, suicidal behavior using RE-AIM framework. The second aim of the study is to train professionals to conduct implementation research and generate knowledge about key factors that enhance or hamper scaling-up our approach in order to make recommendations for spread to other regions and states in India and in the neighboring country of Bangladesh. A final aim of the project is to empower regional policy makers to integrate evidence generated from implemented research on suicide prevention in policy making in Gujarat. The project proposes that the integrated intervention will be implemented as a cluster randomized controlled trial, in one district (Mehesana) of the state of Gujarat, which has a population of about 2.03 million, with 74% of the district?s population classified as living in rural areas. The components of the intervention include (a) developing a complex multi-level, multi-disciplinary, multi-population suicide prevention intervention for the state of Gujarat (b) assess reach, effectiveness, adoption, and consistency and cost effectiveness of this intervention (c) train public health workers to conduct implementation research for recognizing suicidal ideation and behaviors, and in building the capacity of health workers to provide initial support, including strategies for building resilience and fostering coping strategies, and referring community members to services. The ultimate outcome is reduction in suicides and attempted suicides among adults and in addition, reduction in suicidal behavior among adolescents."
"9462443","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our long-term goal is to understand how cardiovascular tissues are targeted for attack in the context of systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In this proposal we focus on macrophages, a key inflammatory cell type. Although the presence of macrophages in inflamed cardiovascular tissues in patients with these diseases has long been recognized, the tools to dissect their precise role in disease pathogenesis have only recently been developed. We propose to employ these powerful new tools to study how macrophages contribute to cardiovascular inflammation in the setting of systemic rheumatic diseases. We have recently described the occurrence of cardiac valve inflammation in a mouse model of autoimmune arthritis. Valvular carditis in this model is similar to that seen in rheumatic diseases in humans. The cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17) and immune complexes interacting with activating Fc receptors are critical for carditis to develop. Importantly, macrophages are the predominant inflammatory cell type in this model. Macrophages are characterized broadly as M1 (classical/pro-inflammatory) or M2 (alternative/anti-inflammatory). Our preliminary data suggest that both of these populations may contribute to valvular carditis. We propose to study essential aspects of macrophage biology in this model system: entry into the cardiovascular tissue, activation, and effector function. First, we will determine how macrophages enter the cardiac valves, focusing on the cell surface receptor VLA-4. Next, we will explore how IL-17, activating Fc receptors and TLR4 drive macrophage activation toward M1 or M2 phenotypes. We will then dissect the relative contributions of the M1 and M2 macrophage populations to disease severity, by interfering with the differentiation of these cell subsets or with their key molecular products. Using recently-developed conditional gene knockout animals in conjunction with more traditional methods will allow us to interrogate the pathogenic mechanisms employed by macrophages in this system. Immune complexes, IL-17, and macrophage infiltration are hallmarks of many human autoimmune diseases. We propose to use our novel animal model system to begin to understand how these molecules and cells interact in vivo to provoke tissue pathology, with specific attention to the cardiac valves. The knowledge that we gain is expected to lead to new therapies to reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and related autoimmune conditions."
"9407137","Project Summary/Abstract People with mobility restrictions and limited to no upper extremity use depend on others to position the objects that they rely upon for health, communication, productivity, and general well-being. The technology developed in this project directly increases users? independence by responding to them without another person?s intervention. The independence resulting from the proposed technology allows a user to perform activities related to self-care and communication. Eye tracking and head tracking access to speech devices, tablets, or computers requires very specific positioning. If the user?s position relative to the device are not aligned precisely, within a narrow operating window, the device will no longer detect the eyes or head, rendering the device inoperable. Auto-positioning technology uses computer vision and robotic positioning to automatically move devices to a usable position. The system moves without assistance from others, ensuring the user has continual access to communication. In a generalized application, the technology can target any area of the user?s body to position relevant equipment, such as for hydration or a head array for power wheelchair control. Research and development of the automatic positioning product will be accomplished through user-centered, iterative design, and design for manufacturing. Input from people with disabilities, their family members, therapists, and assistive technology professionals define the functional requirements of the technology and guide its evolution. Throughout technical development, prototype iterations are demonstrated and user-tested, providing feedback to advance the design. Design for manufacturability influences the outcomes to optimize the product pipeline, ensure high quality and deliver a cost effective product. Phase 1 Aims demonstrate the feasibility of 1) movement and control algorithms 2) face tracking algorithms and logic to maintain device positioning and 3) integration with commercial eye tracking device software development kits (SDK). Phase 2 Aims include technical, usability, and manufacturability objectives leading to development of a product for commercialization. Software development advances computer vision capabilities to recognize facial expressions and gestures. A new sensor module serves as a gesture switch or face tracker. App development provides the user interface, remote monitoring and technical support. Design of scaled down actuators and an enclosed three degree of freedom alignment module reduces the form factor, allowing for smaller footprint applications. Rigorous user testing by people with different diagnoses and end uses will ensure the product addresses a range of needs and is easy to use. Testing involves professionals and family members to evaluate ease of set-up, functionality, and customization. Extended user testing will investigate and measure outcomes and effects on their independence, access and health. Prototype tooling and design for cost-effective manufacturing will produce units for user and regulatory testing, and eventual sale."
"9486384","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of Personalized Medicine is to implement advances in biomarker pharmacology, molecular diagnostics and genomics to improve public health. For the full benefits of this science to be realized, it is critical that scientific advancs made in experimental settings and on a small scale be extended to community practice and that a business case can be made to support such dissemination. It is important that key innovations be extended beyond individual hospital settings to large health care systems, especially those that include underserved populations. Many scientific advances bypass underserved populations, and as a result inequalities of care and cost inefficiencies result. In 2011, the Indiana Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM) was created to serve as an academic home for basic and clinical researchers committed to research in personalized medicine. A specific goal of the IPM is to move this science towards clinical practice. To that end, the purpose of this proposal is to pilot a genomic platform in a large safety-net health care system, and to measure the economic costs and clinical outcomes of doing so. Eskenazi Health handles over 1.2 million outpatient visits per year and > 15,000 admissions annually, with a payer mix that include 45% uninsured, 26% Medicaid and 18% Medicare patients. In this proposal, the IPM will partner with Eskenazi Health and the Regenstrief Institute to recruit a new Eskenazi cohort of genotyped patients. A multidisciplinary group of clinicians and information scientists will pilot an innovatie approach to the implementation of pharmacogenomic science. The Regenstrief Institute has a proven track record of innovation in medical informatics, and has created an ideal environment in which to assess real clinical outcomes. The specific aims of this proposal will be: 1) To test the hypothesis that a CLIA certified genotyping test targeted at 24 widely used drugs is associated with significant reductions in hospital and outpatient economic costs incurred over 1 year; and 2) To test whether such pharmacogenetic testing is associated with significant improvements in clinical outcomes over 1 year. Patients will be randomized either to an intervention arm, involving pharmacogenotyping, insertion of results in the medical record and dissemination of relevant results and decision algorithms to providers (n=2000 patients), or to usual care (n=4000 patients). This trial will be implemented in Eskenazi primary care clinics and 6 specialty clinics. Economic costs and clinical outcomes including clinic visits, hospital admissions, length of stay, adverse drug reactions, morbidity and mortality, will be followed prospectively and compared between the two groups. To sustain this effort, we will extend access to this testing to IU Health, and the affiliated NCI Simon Cancer Center and Riley Hospital for Children. Data from this study will allow for the first time the development of an objective business case for pharmacogenomic personalization based on real world costs and outcomes."
"9535646","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT We have identified a novel mode of high-level, broad-spectrum ?-lactam resistance in S. aureus that is not mediated by PBP2a, the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) that confers methicillin resistance. PBP4, a non- essential PBP, and GdpP, the only known phosphodiesterase (PDE) that mediates cyclic-di-adenosine-mono- phosphate (CDA) degradation, have critical roles in this type of resistance. Mutations that enhance PBP4's ability to make a highly cross-linked bacterial cell wall and loss-of-function mutations in GdpP are the genetic basis responsible for this uncanonical resistance. The highly cross-linked cell wall formation is driven either independently or cooperatively by two distinct biochemical features of PBP4, a) structural changes in its protein due to missense mutations and b) its overexpression due to mutations in its promoter region.  The loss-of-function mutations in GdpP result in elevated concentrations of CDA in bacterial cells. CDA is a newly discovered cell-signaling second messenger in bacteria which acts as an allosteric regulator by binding to its effectors (proteins and RNAs). CDA broadly affects gene expression and controls GdpP related ?-lactam resistant phenotypes in a concentration dependent manner, suggesting that it is the deterministic factor in resistance. However, the precise role(s) of CDA in mediating ?-lactam resistance as well as other vital processes of S. aureus is currently unknown.  These functional alterations of PBP4 and GdpP likely come at the cost of bacterial virulence due to depletion of cell wall associated proteins and attenuated production of cytolysins, respectively. This indicates a unique yin-yang relationship between two key pathogenic factors of S. aureus, ?-lactam resistance and virulence. We will investigate the fundamental basis of the functional changes in PBP4 and GdpP that lead to resistance and their impact on bacterial virulence. Aim 1: To determine the mechanism of PBP4-mediated ?-lactam resistance and the role of PBP4 in cell wall composition. The relative contribution of PBP4 missense and promoter mutations on cell wall synthesis will be evaluated biochemically and structurally. The mechanism(s) that control pbp4 expression will be investigated to identify regulator(s) and to determine how they confer PBP4-mediated ?-lactam resistance. PBP4's role on bacterial cell surface associated virulence factor expression will be determined. Aim 2: To define the role of cyclic-di-adenosine-mono-phosphate (CDA) signaling in S. aureus. A direct role of CDA in GdpP related ?-lactam resistance and virulence defect will be evaluated by creating point mutants that precisely abolish GdpP's PDE activity. Genetic and chemical proteomic approaches will be taken to identify CDA mediator/s in the bacteria that are responsible for ?-lactam resistance and virulence defect. Finally, our preliminary data suggest the presence of a novel CDA specific phosphodiesterase in S. aureus besides GdpP. We will identify this novel phosphodiesterase. The proposed research will advance knowledge of basic cellular processes in S. aureus."
"9307125","ABSTRACT  This proposal will characterize the influence of tick gut microbiota on the ability of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, to be transmitted from ticks to the vertebrate host. Our recent work (Narasimhan et al, Cell Host Microbe 15:58-71, 2014) demonstrated that tick gut microbiota modulate B. burgdorferi colonization of Ixodes scapularis. Our preliminary data suggest that normal gut microbiota facilitate efficient B. burgdorferi transmission to the mammalian host. This is a critical event in the context of human Lyme disease and understanding how tick gut microbiota influence Borrelia transmission to the mammalian host will reveal new ways to prevent Lyme disease transmission.  In Aim 1 we will characterize and determine tick gut bacterial profiles that are associated with decreased B. burgdorferi transmission to the vertebrate host. Further, we will also begin to assess the microbial compositions of nymphal ticks obtained from endemic regions in Connecticut to co-relate our observations on lab-reared ticks. Application of this knowledge to field studies in future efforts might provide new predictors/biomarkers of transmission risk in specific geographic areas.  In Aim 2 we will perform a transcriptome analysis of the tick gut to describe the molecular pathways of the tick that are influenced by gut microbiota during B. burgdorferi transmission. With a focus on up to 10 genes that are significantly altered by gut microbiota we will determine their functional consequence on B. burgdorferi transmission. Potential vaccine targets to impair Borrelia transmission may be identified from this functional analysis.  Finally, we will determine if dysbiosis might modulate the expression profiles of Borrelial virulence genes, and additionally influence spirochete transmission to the host. We will focus on the lipoprotein encoding virulence genes of B. burgdorferi and unravel a new understanding of how B. burgdorferi senses the tick gut environment to regulate the expression of virulence genes.  This research effort will move the field beyond a descriptive understanding of tick gut microbiota, and unfold a mechanistic understanding of the influence of tick gut bacteria on tick-pathogen interactions in particular, and on vector-pathogen interactions in general. Tick gut microbiota provides a new vantage point to understand the biology of B. burgdorferi transmission to mice and to develop new paradigms to explore the factors that contribute to the spread of Lyme disease."
"9364054","The 3D architecture of mammalian genome plays a key role in transcription regulation. Through DNA looping, non-coding cis-regulatory elements may regulate target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Because of this complexity, generating a comprehensive map of long-range DNA looping interactions will greatly facilitate our understanding of genome functions. Our previous work for the first time demonstrated that it is feasible to map the 3D genome in mammalian cells with 3~5 billion Hi-C reads, at a resolution of 5-10kb. At this resolution, interactions between individual cis-regulatory elements can be revealed. Recently, single cell Hi-C approach has also been tested to reveal cell-to-cell variability of chromosome structures. The fast growing field of 3D genome research calls for 3D genome maps in a variety of cell or tissue types under different physiological or pathogenic perturbations. In order to achieve broad applicability, 3D genome mapping technology must address the following challenges: (i) Ability to assay rare bio-samples; (ii) Generating high-quality library for deep sequencing at a level of several billion reads; (iii) The ability to analyze a large number of single cells for the analyses of complex tissue or cellular heterogeneity. However, the library quality from Hi-C and its derivatives is usually poor when the amount of starting material is small. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a simple and efficient 3C-seq method (Circularized Ligation Products sequencing, or CLP-seq) to generate high-quality libraries suitable for ultra-deep sequencing from a small number of cells. In contrast to Hi-C and its derivatives, CLP-seq is unique because it enriches ligation junction products through a series of enzymatic reactions without the need for biotin labeling and pull-down. From a pilot experiment, we estimate that this new method requires less than 1% of cells as starting material to reach sequencing depth at that level of a billion reads (over 100-fold improvement over Hi-C). Furthermore, because CLP- seq avoids biotin labeling and pull-down, it is amenable to the development of a one-tube single cell CLP- seq protocol (scCLP-seq) for massive scalable single cell analysis. In this project, we will establish and optimize these new technologies, and as proof-of-principle, also produce a significant amount of valuable data resources with these methods in the following three aims. In aim 1, we will optimize CLP-seq protocol to generate high-complexity libraries for ultra-deep sequencing from small cell populations or rare human tissues. In aim 2, we will develop a full-package CLP-seq data analysis pipeline to detect and visualize DNA looping interactions at kilobase resolution. We will generate kilobase-resolution 3D genome maps in a few difficult human tissues and perform preliminary functional annotation of non- coding GWAS SNPs in relevant human diseases. In aim 3, we will further develop a one-tube scCLP- seq protocol for simultaneous analysis of hundreds of single cells. As test cases, we will generate 3D genome data in hundreds of single cells from human islet tissues, and explore strategies to perform subpopulation analysis using clustering methods. We believe this technology advance will expand the field of 3D genome study and eventually benefit our understanding of genome functions and human diseases."
"9361993","Project Summary Zoonotic viruses, like filoviruses and coronaviruses (CoV), represent a continuous and growing threat to global public health because they unpredictably emerge causing devastating outbreaks of pandemic disease. In the 21st century, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged from zoonotic pools of viruses, causing severe disease in humans. MERS-CoV is endemic in camels in the Middle East with continuous new infections in humans. Although SARS-CoV is not currently a threat, several ?prepandemic? SARS-like CoVs have been isolated from bats that replicate efficiently in human cells and are resistant to existing therapies. With the unpredictable overlap of human and wild animal ecologies, the potential for novel CoV emergence into humans is highly probable. Currently, there are no approved antiviral therapies for any human CoV infection. Broad-spectrum CoV therapies that control known human and zoonotic CoV infections would address an immediate unmet medical need and could counter future pandemic episodes. In partnership with Gilead Sciences, we have demonstrated that the nucleoside prodrug, GS-5734, is highly efficacious in inhibiting multiple human and zoonotic CoV in vitro and SARS-CoV in vivo. The primary goal of our program is to accelerate the preclinical development of GS-5734 and promote IND licensure for the MERS-CoV indication. To thoroughly evaluate the breadth of antiviral activity and predict efficacy against future emerging CoV, we will also assess efficacy against a panel of CoV representative of family-wide genetic diversity, including prepandemic zoonotic strains poised for emergence. Focusing on the highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, our unique partnership integrates: i) metagenomics and recombinant virus synthetic genome recovery, ii) primary human lung cell models, iii) cutting edge virology and biochemistry, iv) robust murine and primate models of human disease and v) state of the art metabolic and pharmacokinetic analysis. In Aim 1, we refine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and breadth of GS-5734 through efficacy and metabolism studies in various primary human cells with a diverse array of human and zoonotic CoV and through the evaluation of in vivo efficacy in murine and non-human primate models of MERS- and SARS-CoV. In Aim 2, we select for resistance against SARS-CoV and MERS- CoV, and determine the effect of resistance on virus replication, fitness and susceptibility to treatment. In Aim 3, we determine if the mechanism of action of GS-5734 is a result of direct effects on viral RNA replication and/or alteration of antiviral immunity via deep sequencing and single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization of vehicle or drug treated infected cells and mice. We articulate a development strategy for broad- spectrum therapeutics that could be extended to a multitude of emerging viral pathogens threatening global public health."
"9330076","7. Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this application is to identify predictive markers for outcomes of natural infection and/or vaccination with influenza, markers that are perhaps applicable to other infectious agents defined in the RFA. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team composed of relevant infectious disease experts, clinical experts with access to appropriate patient samples, and experts in assay development, qualification, and validation. We will take advantage of a newly discovered predictive signature from the Khatri lab; unique clinical cohorts developed by the Dekker and Davis groups; Stanford?s Human Immune Monitoring Center (HIMC) for analysis of blood samples using Fluidigm, FACS and CyTOF; and expertise in multiplexed assay development by the Wang and Utz labs. Although beyond the scope of our application, the biomarker signature and the assays developed herein can be used to study other infectious agents and vaccine strategies that will be funded under this RFA mechanism. Our three specific aims will focus on the validation, application and translation of this signature. Specific Aim 1 is to validate a panel of biomarkers for their ability to predict response to influenza vaccination and recovery from wild-type influenza virus infection. Specific Aim 2 will characterize biological pathways identified in Aim 1 using well-established and previously described patient cohorts, and to compare the existing biomarker datasets that are available. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will develop a rapid, multiplexed assay for measuring transcripts using Giant MagnetoResistive (GMR) Sensors, with a long term goal to build a sensor capable of measuring multiple transcripts within minutes at point-of-assay. Our studies will enhance our understanding of the important biological processes involved in response to influenza and other pathogens, and will provide a clinically accessible immune metric for rapid or even real-time evaluation of patients and vaccines."
"9410935","The basilar papilla (BP) is the auditory organ of the chicken and houses sensory cells, known as hair cells, that are innervated by afferent and efferent neurons. Along the radial axis of the BP, the organization of hair cells and the pattern their neural innervation is such that on one side of the BP hair cells take on a tall morphology (tall hair cells) and are primarily innervated by afferents. On the other side of the BP hair cells take on a short morphology (short hair cells) and are primarily innervated by efferents. While many studies have examined the effects of axon guidance factors on innervation of the BP, it is currently unknown what factors drive this particular innervation pattern. Previous work has shown that Wnt9a overexpression in the developing BP results in an increase in hair cells that take on tall hair cell morphology and afferent innervation of those hair cells. RNA deep sequencing of control and Wnt9a overexpressing BPs has identified axon guidance genes, among other genes, that are downstream of Wnt9a and may be mediating the observed changes. This study proposes to examine the impact of three of these genes on neural innervation. The first and second aim will examine the role of Semaphorin-3F (Sema3F) and Contactin-6 (Cntn6), respectively, on the radial pattern of innervation. The third aim will examine the effects of Slit2 on Roundabout (Robo)-mediated activated ?-catenin (pY489-?-catenin) in the BP and statoacoustic ganglion (SAG). In these aims, in-situ hybridization will be used to determine the endogenous spatial and temporal expression pattern of these transcripts in cochlear ducts. In vitro and in vivo methods will be used to examine the effect of these genes on innervation. For in vitro experiments, SAGs will be cultured in the presence of purified axon guidance protein. For in vivo experiments, axon guidance genes will be overexpressed. Immunohistochemistry will be used to label neurites, hair cells, and downstream factors to detect responses to these manipulations. In Slit2 experiments, a TCF transcription factor reporter will be electroporated into the BPs to determine if pY489-?-catenin functions to activate transcription. The results from these experiments will provide insights into innervation of the BP. Genes are able to influence the radial pattern of innervation may be further studied for their ability to regenerate innervation in hair cells that have been damaged or destroyed. This knowledge will be foundational for the development of molecular therapies to treat hearing loss. This proposal will additionally provide training opportunities for the applicant in techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and in vitro culturing techniques, as well as experience in data quantification, data analysis, and scientific communication."
"9380066","Project Summary: Our limited ability to genetically access specific cell types within the nervous system constitutes a fundamental impediment in our efforts to probe brain function and intervene therapeutically, particularly in species lacking the well-developed genetic resources available in the mouse. Targeted payload delivery using recombinant viral approaches possesses a number of potential advantages, including anatomical specificity, ease of experimental implementation, and utility in a broad range of mammalian species. Moreover, the incorporation of endogenous cell-type-selective promoter elements has shown significant promise in targeting viral payload expression to distinct neuronal subsets. To date, however, this approach has not been pursued systematically or at sufficient scale, and the stand-alone cell-type-specificity of existing viral reagents remains relatively limited. Here, we propose to establish and validate a general strategy for the identification of cell-type-specific adeno-associated viral (AAV) drivers by exploiting recent epigenomic advances in conjunction with a novel application of single-cell transcriptome analysis. First, comparative epigenomic profiling between several major neuronal subclasses in the target tissue will be used to generate a library of over 1,000 gene regulatory elements (GREs) that is enriched for highly cell-type-restricted enhancers. This barcoded GRE library will be packaged into AAV and screened en masse in vivo for cell-type-specific activity through the use of single-cell RNA sequencing. This novel approach will allow us to simultaneously assess the specificity of individual GREs against the full complement of cell types present in the target tissue. Focusing initially on mouse cortex, we will seek to validate this approach by identifying viral drivers that are specific for six excitatory and four inhibitory neuronal subtypes. To this end, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Generation of a library of GREs enriched for neuronal cell-type-specific enhancers; 2) High-throughput screening for cell-type-restricted GRE-driven AAV reporters; and 3) Validation and in vivo characterization of newly isolated GRE-driven cell- type-restricted AAV vectors. The viral drivers developed for the ten neuronal cell types in the proposed study should prove of immediate utility for a variety of cell-type-specific applications, including monitoring neuronal activity, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation, axonal tracing, gene delivery, and genome editing. Moreover, it is likely that these AAV vectors will retain their cell-type-specificity across brain regions and in other mammalian species. Finally, it is our hope that the proposed studies will demonstrate the feasibility of this general approach as a portable methodology, applicable in a host of brain regions, for identification of cell- type-restricted viral drivers that will be useful in a variety mammalian species."
"9329453","Dietary fat ratio's influence on adolescent depression: A nonhuman primate model Summary Diets high in saturated fats impact metabolic function in children and may predispose them to the development of mental illnesses, such as depression and other affective (mood) disorders. This is suggested by the increased rate of depressive illness diagnoses in children that has occurred simultaneously with an increased incidence of childhood obesity and metabolic disorders. Several studies have linked consumption of excess saturated fats with alterations in cognitive performance, and decrements in social behavior, activity levels and reward processing, all common features of adolescent depression. Controlled mechanistic studies of the effects of fat intake on affect, however, have been difficult to conduct in human adolescents. Here we propose to use a small nonhuman primate, the common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, to study the relationship between dietary fatty acid ratios and key components of adolescent depression including problem solving, learning, social behavior, activity levels, and reward processing. We have previously shown that this family-oriented, cooperative breeding species shows improved glucoregulatory function with an increasing dietary ratio of unsaturated to saturated fats. We propose to expand these studies to test the hypothesis that increasing the amount of unsaturated fats (essential fatty acids) consumed in the form of healthy snacks will improve problem solving and learning, activity levels and positive social interactions in adolescent marmosets whereas increasing the amount of saturated fats will produce a negative effect on these measures. We will use 48 marmosets in 3 groups of 16 animals (8 males and 8 females per group) each. Groups 1 and 2 will be fed a 30% increase in fats over their standard, low fat diet and Group 3 will have no increase in fats. Group 1 will receive high saturated fat supplements, Group 2 will receive balanced saturated/unsaturated fat supplements, and Group 3 will receive nonfat snacks. We will address the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To determine the effects of three diets differing in fatty acid quantity and balance on neuroendocrine, behavioral, and brain functional responses to reward processing in adolescent marmosets. We will utilize a separation social support test to determine neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress with and without social support and functional MRI to examine activation of specific brain regions related to memory, reward, and social recognition via familial olfactory cues. Specific Aim 2: To determine the effects of three diets differing in fatty acid quantity and balance on social behavior, activity levels, and problem solving and learning. We will use behavioral observations, activity measurements, and a visual discrimination reversal learning task to evaluate these key components of adolescent mood disorders. Alterations in components of the metabolic syndrome and puberty-related changes in steroid levels will be taken into account. These studies will provide important new information on the impact of dietary fatty acid composition on mood disorders in a primate."
"9249114","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Respiratory complications account for significant morbidity and mortality in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) due to their inability to cough an clear secretions.  Consequently, they are dependent upon caregiver assistance for the application of manual suctioning, assisted coughing maneuvers or other methods of airway management.  These methods are cumbersome, generally uncomfortable and require trained personnel.  These individuals lack an effective cough mechanism due to paralysis of their expiratory muscles.  Since the spinal cord below the level of injury is intact in most subjects, th motoneurons of the spinal cord and peripheral neuromuscular apparatus remain functional.  Therefore, the expiratory muscles are amenable to functional electrical stimulation techniques.  In a single site, pilot study of 16 tetraplegics, we have recently shown that the expiratory muscles can be electrically activated by spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to restore an effective cough, a method which involves the surgical placement of disc electrodes through laminotomy incisions.  We demonstrated that this method is successful in achieving an effective means of expiratory muscle activation, as demonstrated by the generation of large positive airway pressures and expiratory airflow rates.  Importantly, this technique facilitates secretion removal, reduces the need for caregiver support, reduces the incidence of respiratory tract infections and improves life quality.  While successful, electrode placement requires an invasive and costly procedure.  Consequently, many individuals were unwilling to pursue this technique.  Based upon the results of animal and human studies, it is our hypothesis that comparable activation of the expiratory muscles can be achieved with wire leads which can be inserted percutaneously through a needle, eliminating the need for the invasive laminotomy procedure and can be performed on an out-patient basis.  This latter procedure would significantly shorten surgical time, lessen the degree of surgery, shorten recovery time, reduce costs, and thereby, increase patient and physician acceptance of this technique.  The purpose of this undertaking, therefore, is two-fold.  First, the safety of chronic SCS with wire electrodes utilizing the proposed stimulus paradigm will be assessed in an animal model of SCI.  Assuming a satisfactory safety analysis, the efficacy of SCS with wire leads will then be assessed in 16 subjects with SCI, in terms of the capacity of this method to activate the expiratory muscles, restore an effective cough mechanism and achieve significant clinical benefits related to secretion management.  Given the significant heterogeneity of this orphan population, subjects will serve as their own controls to evaluate the success of this technique.  If successful, the wire lead system will provide a minimally invasive method of restoring cough, and has the potential to significantly improve life quality.  Ultimately, restoration of an effective cough with SCS has the potential to significantly improve the morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory complications in persons with SCI.  This study will also provide the data necessary for a multi-center trial of this technique leading to eventual FDA approval."
"9281742","The goal of the Pilot Projects Core (PPC) of the Center for Indigenous Environmental Health Research  (CIEHR) is to expand the ability of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities nationwide to  evaluate environmental exposures and to use this information to formulate approaches to reduce associated  health disparities. AI/AN communities suffer from a myriad of adverse environmental exposures, including but  not limited to contamination from mining, fracking, oil spills, contamination of food items in subsistence/  traditional diets, and inadequate housing conditions. While AI/AN communities have significant concerns  about environmental contamination and the consequential health impacts, there is often limited infrastructure  available to evaluate these exposures. In addition, many academic research teams lack experience working  with the AI/AN population, and university objectives often do not match with those of the community. Without  this exposure information, linked with health risk assessments, tribal leaders and health departments may be  ill-equipped to protect their communities. Using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process  has proven effective in AI/AN communities. In addition, increasing community members' knowledge of  environmental exposures, such as strengthening environmental health literacy (EHL), significantly enhances  their ability to effectively respond, and the most effective interventions work within an individual and community  resilience framework. The PPC will assist communities in addressing environmental health disparities and  developing novel methods of integrating exposure assessment, improving EHL and strengthening community  resilience, and informing tribal policy through completion of the following specific aims: 1) Develop research  concepts and proposals based on CBPR principles; 2) Create combined community and academic teams to  carry out the proposed research; and 3) Engage community resilience, improve EHL and support policy  development. Anticipated outcomes of the PPC include: 1) formation of additional partnerships to conduct  research with AI/AN communities; 2) expansion of the breadth of environmental exposures being evaluated,  including social stressors, that may affect the health of AI/AN people; 3) development and testing of innovative  research models that integrate exposure assessment and AI/AN EHL and tribal resilience; and 4) development  of AI/AN policies and sustainable community programs aimed at reducing environmental health disparities."
"9350364","The long-term goal is to understand the structural and functional mechanisms that control cytoskeleton-membrane dynamics in health and disease. Here, we will determine the structural and functional bases for the activities of two types of cytoskeleton- organelle scaffolds, the Arp2/3 complex activator WHAMM and the microtubule- organelle linker Hook. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that WHAMM links actin polymerization through the Arp2/3 complex to organelle morphogenesis and transport during autophagy. WHAMM consists of an N-terminal membrane-binding domain of unknown structure and function and a C-terminal PWCA (Pro-rich, WH2, Central, Acidic) region responsible for actin polymerization by activation of Arp2/3 complex. Our initial studies support the hypothesis that WHAMM promotes actin polymerization to drive the segregation of membranous organelles from the ER during autophagosome formation. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that WHAMM contains a phosphoinositide-binding PX domain and a membrane-curvature sensing/inducing helical domain. To test these hypotheses, cellular studies will reveal the subcellular localization, function and binding partners of WHAMM and biochemical-structural studies will uncover the molecular architecture, lipid-binding activity, protein-protein and auto-inhibitory interactions that adapt WHAMM for its role in autophagy. Aim 2 will address the molecular mechanism for cargo tethering to the microtubule cytoskeleton by Hook isoforms. Three Hook isoforms function as specialized microtubule-cargo tethering molecules in mammalian cells. Hook contains an N-terminal microtubule-binding domain, followed by a coiled coil region and a variable C-terminal domain thought to mediate specific interactions with cargo molecules. Cellular studies have established at least 18 binding partners of Hook, with roles in processes such as endosomal sorting, receptor turnover, and centrosomal assembly. Yet, the molecular mechanism for Hook's function in cargo tethering is largely unknown. Our structural and biochemical studies will reveal the molecular bases for Hook interactions with microtubules and cargos, dimerization, autoinhibition and activation. Working with the other projects of this PPG, our approach is multi-disciplinary, spanning cell biology to atomic structure."
"9322343","PROJECT DESCRIPTION During the progression of glaucoma, the retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and their axons degenerate. An important target to this damage occurs in the optic nerve head (ONH), where the RGC axons leave the globe to form the optic nerve. Although RGC axonal damage can be caused by different type of insults, it is well- established that elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and stiffness in the peripapillary region (ppSC) are major contributors to this degeneration. It would seem logical to think that some kind of molecular regulation coordinating the anterior and posterior affected tissues would be of great benefit for a potential treatment of glaucoma.  Previously, we had identified Matrix Gla (MGP) as one of most highly expressed genes in the human TM. We had also found that MGP was altered in the TM by elevated IOP, TGF? and dexamethasone, and that calcification markers were increased in TM tissues from glaucoma patients and Mgp-KO mice. The gene transfer of a calcification inducer (BMP2) to the rat?s TM also elicited elevated IOP. Matrix Gla is a potent mineralization inhibitor secreted by cartilage chondrocytes and arteries? vascular smooth muscle cells. Mgp KO mice die at 5-6 weeks due to massive arterial calcification. Arterial calcification results in arterial stiffness and higher systolic blood pressure. In order to investigate the abundance of Mgp in the eye and its contribution to a potential regulation of stiffness in glaucoma in a living animal, we used mouse genetics. To determine the Mgp spatial/ temporal expression in the eye, we generated an Mgp-Cre Knock-in (KI) mouse, containing Mgp DNA fused to an IRES-Cre-cassette. Crosses of this mouse with R26R-floxed reporters (lacZ and td.Tomato) revealed, as expected, Mgp?s high specific expression in the TM region, but also, and surprisingly, Mgp was highly and specifically expressed in the sclera, in particularly the ppSC.  Based on these findings, we propose that MGP and its anti-calcification/ anti-stiffness function represents a sole mechanism that affects the source of two basic glaucomatous causes, elevated IOP and ONH damage. Thus, we hypothesize that MGP is a master key-mediator that prevents the occurrence of calcification/ stiffness in the targeted eye tissues, and as a consequence, controls the development and progression of glaucoma.  To develop and prove this hypothesis, we propose to investigate the response of Mgp to glaucomatous insults in vivo using the newly generated Mgp-Cre-reporter mice (SA#1), to override the early death of the Mgp KO by creating TM and ppSC specific conditional Knock-outs (cKOs) (SA#2) and to evaluate the impact of the specific ablations on glaucoma phenotypes (SA#3  Results to be obtained with the execution of this proposal will provide the mechanistic understanding and the knowledge needed to develop a combined TM-ppSC therapy which could potentially lead to a totally new treatment of glaucoma."
"9324367","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a competitive renewal for a unique study that measures the volume, function, and development of the striatum in children at risk for Huntington's Disease (HD). HD is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a DNA triplet repeat (CAG) expansion and manifests in cognitive, behavioral, and motor changes. Average age of onset is 40 yrs. The disease eventually affects most brain regions, yet the primary pathology is located in the striatum. Degeneration is a key component in the disease process, yet research in the past few years has supported the notion that a crucial component of the pathoetiology of HD is abnormal brain development. The grant was funded in 2009 to investigate this hypothesis by the study of children at risk for HD (those with a parent with HD). As HD is an autosomal dominant disease, each child has a 50% chance of inheritance. The at-risk participants are genotyped and those who are gene-expanded (GE) are compared to those who are gene non-expanded (GNE); a 3rd comparison group is healthy control children (HC) (no HD in family). Assessments include MRI and measures of motor function, cognitive skills, and behavior. The current proposal is designed to extend our studies by conducting a more thorough evaluation of the growth and development of the striatum. The original study evaluated volumes using structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) and white matter integrity using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Results (shown in progress report) indicate volume deficits in the striatum with relative sparing or enlargement of the thalamus and cerebellum; and abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) in multiple tracks. The new protocol will add: 1) evaluation of striatal resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), 2) Molecular measures of striatal integrity using (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and 3) the evaluation of developmental trajectories (growth between ages 6-18 years) of brain structure via an 'accelerated longitudinal' format. Compensatory mechanisms such as overgrowth of the cerebellum and thalamus will also be investigated. Functional assessment will include measures of cognition and motor skill. Information gained from this proposal could be key to identifying the earliest possible time-frame for neuroprotective interventions."
"9366415","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a severe inflammatory disease of childhood conferring significant risk for fatal complications including Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS). The phenotype and function of the key effector monocytes and macrophages in systemic JIA remains unclear. These cells adopt distinct polarization states based on specific activating signals, modified by microRNA to ?fine-tune? these transcriptional responses. Circulating monocytes in systemic JIA appear to display a unique mixed polarization phenotype, and little is known regarding how tissue resident macrophages are further altered during emergence of MAS. Notably, despite effective treatment children with systemic JIA remain at risk for MAS. Thus, there is a critical need to characterize the phenotype of monocytes and tissue macrophages in systemic JIA, and particularly how they contribute to emergence of MAS. In the absence of such knowledge, developing novel strategies to effectively prevent and treat MAS will remain a formidable challenge. The objective in this application is to define polarization-specific gene expression signatures and functional roles of microRNA in monocytes and macrophages from children with systemic JIA and a mouse model of systemic JIA/MAS. Our central hypothesis is monocytes from children with systemic JIA have a distinct polarized pattern which is regulated by microRNA, and further dysregulated during MAS. The research plan described in this application has three Specific Aims: to define polarization-specific and single-cell gene expression profiles in peripheral monocytes and bone marrow macrophages from systemic JIA and MAS patients (Aim 1), to identify specific molecular pathways targeted by microRNA that are essential for monocyte and macrophage polarization in these disorders (Aim 2), and to determine gene expression signatures and microRNA-mediated functions of polarized myeloid populations in a mouse model of MAS (Aim 3). These independent and complementary aims will utilize emerging technologies such as microRNA expression profiling and single-cell RNAseq to define the molecular control of polarization-specific transcriptional signatures in monocytes and macrophages in children with systemic JIA and MAS. Together these findings are expected to have positive translational impact, through providing new targets to modulate inflammation in systemic JIA and impact the risk for MAS.  Dr. Grant Schulert is currently an Instructor of Pediatrics in the Division of Rheumatology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Dr. Schulert's long-term goal is to develop an independent research career as a pediatric rheumatologist focused on the pathogenesis and novel treatment approaches for inflammatory disorders. In the completion of these proposed aims, Dr. Schulert will draw upon greater than 10 years' experience studying inflammation and innate immunity, but will also gain new skills and knowledge in the areas of functional genomics, microRNA biology and animal models of inflammatory disorders. Dr. Schulert and his primary mentor, Dr. Alexei Grom, have developed a comprehensive career development plan with four key components: laboratory experimentation; mentored oversight guided by his mentorship committee; leadership and skills building through the CCHMC Leadership Foundations Program and other workshops; and academic and professional development through scientific meetings, intramural conferences and the CCHMC ?K Club?. His career development will be guided by an interdisciplinary mentorship committee chaired by Dr. Grom. Additional members of Dr. Schulert's mentorship committee will facilitate the acquisition of new skills and knowledge throughout the award period, while serving as key collaborators for the proposed research aims.  The environment at CCHMC is highly supportive of Dr. Schulert's development in this key early stage of his research career. This institution offers a variety of resources both physical and intellectual to support his career development, and CCHMC has committed to protecting at least 75% of his time for research during the award period. CCHMC has been the home of the premier training and research program in pediatric rheumatology for several decades. The divisional research portfolio is quite diverse, spanning from genomic in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) to the discovery of organ-specific biomarkers for childhood-onset lupus to international clinical trials of new drug targets.  Collectively, completion of the proposed studies, aided by the mentoring committee and with the outstanding institutional environment including shared core facilities available at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, will provide the ideal environment for Dr. Schulert to achieve his career goal of becoming an independent investigator within Pediatric Rheumatology."

"9394070","Project Summary/Abstract  Natural biological circuits are far superior in regulated performance when compared to current synthetic designs, and this gap will always be wide without a much stronger set of theoretical rules. Though many designs and interesting functions have been demonstrated, there is a fundamental noise issue that prevents reliable, predictable performance of synthetic biological circuits ? and therefore use in any promising end applications.  Toward identifying fundamental noise control principles, the goal here is to build a synchronized circadian clock that can be coupled to other functions in gut bacteria, such as drug delivery. Cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is the simplest organism with a known circadian clock, which regulates many of the organism's functions in a 24-hour cycle. The molecular basis for this circadian clock is an oscillating phosphorylation cycle of protein KaiC. This cyanobacterial clock had been crudely transplanted in E. coli, a gut bacterium without a natural circadian system, but performed very poorly because of severe noise issues. To improve upon that effort, the circadian clock will be rebuilt in E. coli with its naturally robust control strategies of (1) protein-phosphorylation and (2) transcription-translation cycle control loops. Since some cyanobacterial parts are incompatible in E. coli and other therapeutic gut bacteria, some feedback strategies will be introduced in principle/behavior using other parts, such as heterologous repressors and relief to tune production amounts and timing of system components.  An oscillating function amongst cells, such as therapeutic bacteria secreting a given daily drug dosage, would be most effective with a synchronized population. While oscillator circuits have shown ?generational? synchronicity based on cell division cycles, those cells were not truly synchronized without regulating external stimuli, as may be the case in the human gut. The second main goal is to couple a quorum sensing system with an oscillator like the circadian clock. This further enhances the control theory platform by adding a cell-to-cell communication dimension, which has been largely underexplored for synthetic circuits.  Assembling these control circuits will serve as testing grounds for control theories and mathematical models, hopefully identifying general principles or fundamental rules for controlling biological noise that will be applicable to all synthetic circuits ? which will be a huge advancement toward creating mature engineered cells for real applications."
"9321532","ABSTRACT (Project 2) Antiretroviral therapy is effective in preventing HIV replication, however it does not eliminate all HIV proviruses, resulting in the presence of long-lasting reservoirs that re-kindle infection following cessation of treatment. Thus HIV infected individuals are required to remain on therapy for life, to prevent viral rebound. If we can control or prevent viral rebound, we may be able to provide patients a drug-free remission period, or a functional cure to HIV disease. Project 2 is designed to determine whether enhanced or genetically engineered immune cells can help to delay or minimize viral rebound. We will utilize cutting edge humanized mouse models, a novel barcoded virus reporter system, and several anti-HIV chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to accomplish 3 aims: 1) Evaluate the effects of engineered anti-HIV T cells on HIV rebound following cessation of ART; 2) Evaluate the effects of natural killer cells on HIV rebound following cessation of ART; 3) Determine if reduction of the latent reservoir influences viral rebound after cessation of ART. Together these aims should allow us to better understand factors controlling viral rebound and determine whether genetic enhancement of cellular immunity or manipulation of innate immune responses can affect viral rebound. If so, this may point the way towards a new adjunctive therapeutic approach for HIV disease."
"9356516","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain's control of our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors stems from neural circuits, which perform logical operations based on the temporal patterns of neural activity and the connectivity of the neurons as the circuit traverses the brain. Recent studies have produced many strategies for visualizing and controlling a circuit's neural activity. In some cases, specialized microscopy systems have enabled imaging of entire brain volumes on the timescale of neural activity and during behavior, enabling the reconstruction of neural circuitry at cellular resolution. However, recording neural activity from whole brain volumes to reconstruct neural circuitry is a significant challenge when working with larger brains, less specialized microscopes, or stimuli and behaviors that are not conducive to concurrent imaging. In these situations, strategies that enable permanent recording of neural activity during defined time windows for later readout would be highly beneficial.  In this proposal, we describe an approach for permanent recording of neural activity using Ca2+-dependent enzymatic activation of genetically encoded substrates. We focus our efforts on the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease because it does not have endogenous substrates in vertebrate systems, it has been employed in living neurons, it has been extensively re-engineered to record interactions between diverse binding partners, and its split fragments dissociate in the absence of reconstituting binding partners. We propose a strategy for engineering a Ca2+-dependent TEV protease that involves a split version of the enzyme with each half attached to the Ca2+-binding partners calmodulin and M13. These TEV fragments are designed so that in the absence of neural activity they will remain separate and inactive, but in the presence of neural activity and high Ca2+, the association of calmodulin and M13 will permit TEV reconstitution and enzyme activity. Once active, the split TEV protease can cleave a variety of genetically encoded substrates that link TEV protease activity with transcription of a desired gene or direct creation of a fluorophore. Thus, using this strategy will enable users to control neurons activated by a given stimulus or behavior (e.g., by expressing optogenetic tools in response to TEV activity) or to visualize neurons active during distinct epochs (e.g., by expressing a photoactivatable mOrange in response to one stimulus or behavior, photoconverting the mOrange, and then recording the second stimulus). Finally, the split TEV protease and substrate interactions can be controlled with modular optogenetics tools to provide precise temporal control over the time period of recording."
"9341950","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a lethal disease characterized by endothelial cell dysfunction and progressive inward vascular growth that leads to hypertension and ultimately right heart failure. Currently approved PAH therapies focus on dilating structurally-abnormal vessels for improved quality of life, however lung transplantation remains the only cure for advanced disease. PAH is associated with metabolic defects as patients demonstrate insulin resistance and impaired intracellular glucose metabolism. Here we seek to identify aberrant metabolic pathways associated with PAH as opportunities for therapeutic intervention, by profiling the metabolome of endothelial cells that have been implicated as the site of disease origin. In addition, we seek to understand whether an altered metabolome or post-translational modification status underlies the aberrant PPAR?-protein complexes associated with PAH. To investigate we will immunoprecipitate PPAR? from endothelial cells and apply metabolomic and proteomic analysis to identify bound small molecules and covalent protein modifications. Altered metabolites and aberrant metabolic pathways associated with PAH will be validated with chemical and genetic tools in cellular assays. The overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize the molecular underpinnings of PAH as a means to identify novel therapeutic strategies."

"9320656","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory has been dubbed the heart of intelligent behavior, and a core property of this critical cognitive system is its highly limited capacity. Working memory capacity limitations are reliably associated with individual differences in many basic forms of cognition (e.g., language and mathematical abilities), and working memory deficits have been observed in at-risk populations, including children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, and children born preterm. Given these influences, understanding the development of working memory capacity limits has broad implications and may be critical to intervention efforts with atypically developing children. This grant focuses on the development of a central type of working memory called visual working memory (VWM). VWM plays a key role in much of visual cognition, comparing percepts that cannot be simultaneously viewed and identifying changes in the world when they occur. Research has shown that VWM develops dramatically between infancy and 5 years old, and a recent dynamic neural field (DNF) model of VWM has formalized a candidate neural mechanism for how VWM capacity changes in early development and why such changes vary across tasks. A key goal of the grant is to test this theoretical account at neural and behavioral levels. In particular, we will conduct an accelerated longitudinal study from 6 months to 4.5 years. At each age, children will complete two functional neuroimaging sessions and a structural neuroimaging session. We will use these data to examine: (1) whether the DNF model captures individual developmental trajectories in VWM performance from 6 months to 4.5 years; (2) whether the DNF model predicts functional changes in the VWM brain network in early development; and (3) whether changes in DNF parameters over development are explained by localized changes in myelin content within the VWM network. Results from this grant will set the stage for extensions of our approach to examine longitudinal changes in at-risk populations. This work will also foster an innovative approach to individualized interventions guided by a neural process model of VWM that speaks to individual differences in both brain and behavior."
"9334286","Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (H/I) leads to rapid energy failure in cortical, subcortical and hippocampal regions due to lack of oxygen and glucose delivery to brain. This is followed by a transient normalization during reperfusion and a later secondary energy failure (~2-6 hours after H/I) that ultimately leads to brain injury, and poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Inflammation occurring prior to H/I can exacerbate injury. Acute alterations in metabolism and prolonged metabolic dysregulation after neonatal H/I leave the brain vulnerable and unable to support processes essential for normal development. We will use a well-characterized model of perinatal H/I at term (postnatal (PN) day 10 rat pup) with and without prior inflammation. The effects of H/I on cerebellum have not been carefully explored even though the rapidly developing cerebellum is particularly vulnerable to inflammation and perinatal injury. We will combine high field 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy of energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) determination of metabolites, lipids, proteins in specific layers of the cerebellum. Our studies will be the first determination of alterations in metabolism via astrocyte and neuron specific pathways and synthesis of glutamate and GABA in cerebellum after H/I. Molecular and metabolic alterations and long- term functional outcomes will determine the therapeutic potential of hypothermia and drug therapy. We hypothesize that neonatal H/I leads to energy failure in the cerebellum that contributes to impaired function of brain cells including acute and long-term alterations in energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis. We hypothesize that the combined effect of inflammation and H/I exacerbates cerebellar damage and dysregulated metabolism in male and female brain. Our Specific Aims test these hypotheses: 1. Determine the effect of H/I at PN10 with and without prior inflammation on energy metabolism in cerebellum of male and female rat pups. 2. Determine the alterations in neurotransmitters, metabolites, lipids and proteins in Purkinje, molecular and granule cell layers, deep nuclei and white matter of the cerebellum of male and female pups after H/I with and without prior inflammation. 3. Determine the protective effect of hypothermia, choline and ceftriaxone alone, and these compounds in combination with hypothermia against changes in neuronal and glial metabolism and specific molecular changes in the Purkinje, molecular and granule cell layers, deep nuclei and myelin. Novel, clinically relevant information about the timing and targets of injury and alterations in neuron and astrocyte specific metabolic pathways in brain and alterations of metabolites, nucleotides, membrane and signaling lipids, and proteins in cerebellar layers and deep nuclei will be obtained using the unique combination of 1H- NMR and 13C-NMR in conjunction with MALDI-MSI and LC/MS-MS for profiling the changes after H/I with and without inflammation, inflammation alone and response to neuroprotective therapy."
"9379682","ABSTRACT Our overall aim is to advance PfSEA-1 as a vaccine candidate for pediatric falciparum malaria by identifying broadly reactive, PfSEA-1 specific T follicular helper (Tfh) epitopes, which are critical for long-lived antibody responses. In previous R01 funded studies, We discovered Schizont Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1), a 244-kDa parasite antigen that is the target of antibodies which arrest parasites at the schizont stage. Active vaccination with rPbSEA-1 results in a 3-fold reduction in parasitemia and a 2 fold longer survival time after challenge with P. berghei ANKA parasites (P = 0.001). Children in our Tanzanian birth cohort (N=785) experienced a dramatically increased incidence of severe malaria during periods with undetectable anti-PfSEA-1 antibody levels (45 cases/23,806 child weeks) compared to periods with detectable antibody levels (0 cases/1,688 child weeks; adjusted OR 4.4; Type III fixed effects P < 0.01). In our cohort of Kenyan males (12-35 yrs old, N= 138), individuals with detectable anti-PfSEA-1 IgG antibodies had 50% decreased parasite density compared to individuals with undetectable anti-PfSEA-1 IgG antibodies (P < 0.04) over an 18-week high transmission season. This work has culminated in a comprehensive, full length Research Article in Science 1. A major obstacle to malaria vaccine development is the generation of high-titer functional antibodies with the induction of long-lived plasma and memory B-cells. In the past 10 yrs, Tfh cells have been recognized as essential for somatic hypermutation, isotype switching, germinal center formation, long lived plasma cell formation as well as memory B cell formation 2. Intriguingly, in the only report of Tfh cells in human malaria infection, inefficient activation of the CXCR3- subset of Tfh cells was observed during acute malaria infections in children, and this defect may be responsible for the poor anti-malarial antibody responses seen in early childhood 3. Based on the known function of Tfh cells and their role in generating protective antibody responses to vaccine antigens 4, 5, identifying Tfh epitopes is essential for malaria vaccine optimization. In the current application, we propose to map Tfh stimulating, MHC Class II T cell epitopes in PfSEA-1 using both recombinant protein as well as overlapping peptide approaches. We will initially identify all possible peptide specific epitopes in a cross-sectional sample of semi-immune adults. We will then relate antibody, cytokine, and T-cell subset responses to these epitopes with resistance to infection in a longitudinal cohort study conducted in 2-7 yr old children living in a holoendemic region of western Kenya. The deliverables from this study will be a list of validated T cell epitopes within the novel egress blocking vaccine candidate PfSEA-1 and a comprehensive, prospective analysis of the relationship between antibody, cytokine and T-cell subset responses to these epitopes and resistance to infection with P. falciparum. These data will allow us to enhance the immunogenicity of second generation rPfSEA-1A based vaccines by including broadly reactive T cell epitopes from the flanking regions, or increasing the copy number of T-cell epitopes within the aa 810-1083 region. In addition, these results will significantly increase our understanding of the role and kinetics of Tfh cell responses during pediatric malaria infections."
"9276683","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop an effective treatment for developmental prosopagnosia and to understand the mechanisms of treatment-related improvements. This is relevant to the National Eye Institute's mission to better treat visual disorders and understand mechanisms of visual function. The particular goal of this proposal is to build on our previous successes at improving face processing in developmental prosopagnosics (DPs) using cognitive training targeting holistic face processing. Our specific aims for this proposal are to: 1) Determine whether an improved, longer version of the holistic face training program is more effective at improving face processing and daily functioning in developmental prosopagnosics (DPs) than active control training; 2) To use functional MRI to characterize how core and extended face processing regions change after holistic face training compared to active control training; and 3) To characterize how event-related potential (ERP) signatures of face processing change after holistic face training compared to active control training. As an exploratory aim, we also seek to determine if face-selective white matter tracts in ventral occipito-temporal regions change after holistic face training compared to active control training. To achieve these aims, we propose to run a triple-blind (assessor, participant, and data analysis is blind to treatment), randomized longitudinal treatment study with 50 DPs. We propose to have 25 DPs complete 6 weeks of holistic face training and 25 complete 6 weeks of a matched active control training that uses the same faces. After screening, DPs will perform baseline cognitive and functional assessments as well as MRI scans (including fMRI and DTI) and ERP recording. Next, DPs will be randomized to either holistic face training or active control training and will train on a laptop computer at home or in the laboratory for 30 sessions (36 mins/session) over 6 weeks. During this time, a cognitive training coach will closely monitor their progress. Within one week of intervention completion, DPs will repeat the behavioral assessments, MRI scans, and ERP recording. To measure the longevity of training effects, DPs will also repeat all assessments after a 6-week no-contact period."

"9325089","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke are two of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among adults in North America and are strongly determined by levels of common CVD risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cigarette smoking, and dyslipidemia. Specific extracellular RNAs regulate key processes central to the pathogenesis of CVD and several small human studies have associated extracellular RNAs with specific forms of CVD. We postulate that the expression of plasma RNAs change over time and is influenced by the duration and intensity of exposure to CVD risk factors, relates to subclinical atherosclerosis phenotypes, and will therefore be useful predictors of incident CVD events. We intend to further explore and validate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of extracellular RNAs associated with CVD and preclinical CVD phenotypes in our community-based cohort study in a hospitalized sample with acute coronary syndromes.  To accomplish these aims, in the U2 phase of our study we will use an optimized non-commercial isolation method for high-yield plasma RNA extraction as well as high-throughput sequencing to identify known and as-yet undiscovered extracellular circulating RNAs, thereby developing a broad panel of plasma-derived extracellular RNA biomarkers (including miRNA, piRNA, noncoding RNAs) to screen 2914 participants in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Study (Offspring Exam 8). In the U3 phase of the application, we will further evaluate changes in circulating RNAs over time and in relation to incident CVD and disease progression, by screening the same individuals 5 years later (Offspring Exam 9). We will then examine associations between extracellular RNAs and CVD-related prognosis in ~400 participants of TRACE-CORE (Transitions and Research in Acute Coronary Events - Center for Outcomes Research and Education). We will perform exploratory analyses to determine if these methods can be extended to non-CVD populations. Last, we will partner with industry leaders to develop a quick and effective point-of-care test for extracellular RNA profiles associated with disease."
"9080630","Project Abstract Given the large impact of New Mexico?s food manufacturing industry, providing high equality inspections based on the scientific principles of food safety is paramount to protecting New Mexicans and consumers throughout the nation and world. Furthermore, the President has provided a significant level of focus on food safety nationally as has Congress with the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act. Similarly, within New Mexico we have found an added interest in food safety. The Bureau has experienced a substantial surge in the number of small local producers seeking to begin manufacturing foods. We identified that we were no longer able to keep up with the growing number of questions and requests to provide assistance and speak to various groups. As part of the MFRPS contract funding option, the Bureau requested funding to help answer these questions. The Bureau plans to hire two additional staff that will work solely on NM?s food manufacturing program, including the MFRPS and meeting the growing needs of inspection of food manufacturers. Beginning this endeavor is absolutely essential to meet the needs of the growing interest in adding value to agricultural commodities in NM. However, the State?s resources are currently not adequate to respond to the growing needs of producers and consumers across New Mexico. The Bureau anticipates participation in this cooperative agreement will result in significant enhancement in the quality of inspections and inspectors for NM?s manufactured food facilities. This will be obtained by the following:  ? The State will achieve and sustain significant to full conformance with the  Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS);  ? The State will actively engage through an annual face-to-face meeting and  participation in committees supporting MFRPS;  ? The State has and will collaboratively develop strategies and share those  strategies with other states;  ? The State will provide FDA the foundation for pursuing regulatory action based  upon the findings of State manufactured food regulatory programs; and  ? The State will seek to further enhance its capability to protect public health  through development and implementation of Standard Enhancement Projects. The goal of this project is to build a manufactured food program to protect consumers throughout the state and beyond. At minimum, absent major unforeseen difficulties, significant conformance will be attained with the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards."
"9301539","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bariatric surgery is a powerful tool for producing significant and durable weight loss. Yet, not all patients achieve initial weight loss success and many patients have weight regain as early as 1-2 years post-surgery. Suboptimal weight loss patterns not fully explained by surgical, demographic, and medical factors has led to greater emphasis on patient behaviors evidenced by clinical guidelines that focus on appropriate eating and physical activity. However, research to inform such guidelines typically has relied on imprecise measures or not been specific to bariatric surgery. There is also little understanding of mechanisms by which psychosocial factors influence outcomes. Thus, there is a need to: (a) measure behaviors and psychosocial factors thought to be related to surgical outcomes (particularly those emphasized in guidelines) using innovative strategies to maximize data quality, (b) determine which behaviors and psychosocial factors are related to outcomes, and (c) explore how psychosocial factors influence weight both directly and via influences on behavior. Our research team was the first to employ innovative mobile health (mHealth) technology within an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) framework to measure adherence to recommended behaviors at 6 months post-surgery. We propose to build on this work by using EMA to measure behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental factors over a much longer period to understand how they predict success and risk at key post-surgical weight loss phases-i.e. active weight loss (0-1 yrs), weight stabilization (1-2 yrs), and initial maintenance (2-3 yrs). An NIH-funded multi-sensor PiLR HEALTH platform will integrate objective sensor data measuring behaviors and the environments in which they are performed with self-report information collected via smartphone in real-time and in patients' natural environment. Participants (N=200) recruited from 2 ASMBS-designated centers of excellence will complete a 12-day EMA protocol pre-surgery and at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 months post-surgery to assess recommended behaviors [e.g., meal frequency, PA], psychosocial indicators with the most prior evidence of an association with surgical outcomes (e.g., mood/depression), and key environmental factors (e.g., type/quality of the food environment). Participants will also be weighed at the above time points and 36 months. Along with describing patterns in behaviors and their relation to weight loss, we will test causal models to understand how complex systems of behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental factors affect weight loss, and to identify optimal targets for intervention. This project has the potential to build a much more sophisticated and valid understanding of who is and is not successful after bariatric surgery and why. This new understanding will directly contribute to improved (i.e., specific, consistent, and validated) guidelines for recommended pre and postoperative behaviors, which could lead to improved surgical outcomes. The enhanced understanding will also inform behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental targets for intervention that are mostly likely to improve surgical outcomes."
"9539118","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) rates have increased 500% over the last three decades resulting in EAC being identified as the fastest increasing of all cancer types in the US. Esophageal cancer is an extremely deadly malignancy with 5-year survival rates consistently under 20%. The precise reasons for increasing rates of EAC are an active area of investigation. Persistent, symptomatic, reflux of gastric and duodenal contents, known as gastroesophageal disease (GERD), strongly correlate with EAC development and it's only known precursor lesion Barrett's esophagus (BE) via stimulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis resistance. Other EAC risk factors include obesity, animal-based diets and to a lesser extent tobacco and alcohol use. Plant-based diets have generally been associated with a reduction of risk for EAC. Thus, the long-term goal of this research project is to develop efficacious strategies for the prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma using a standardized proanthocyanidin rich cranberry extract (C-PAC). This preclinical research proposal stems from our published and preliminary unpublished results demonstrating that C-PAC decreases EAC cell viability by inducing cell death via apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis when apoptotic and autophagy machinery is defective. C-PAC treatment also induces an S-phase delay, causes G2-M cell cycle arrest, and significantly inhibits the growth of OE19 EAC xenografts in nude mice. Despite promising results supporting the chemopreventive application of C-PAC, substantial knowledge gaps remain with regard to the mechanisms of C-PAC-induced cell death. Studies proposed in this application will inform the signaling mechanisms involved in C-PACs cell death-inducing capacity, determine the in vivo efficacy of C-PAC for the prevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma utilizing a clinically relevant reflux-induced rodent model of EAC and test a novel imaging modality. Aim 1 will utilize a panel of authenticated esophageal cell lines that differ based on pathology, tumor suppressor gene status and acid sensitivity to dissect signaling pathways associated with C- PACs cancer inhibitory potential; the normal esophageal cell line (HET1A), Barrett's premalignant lines (CP- A,CP-B,CP-C,CP-D) and esophageal adenocarcinoma lines (FLO-1,JHEso-AD1,OE19,OE33) will be used to access cancer inhibitory mechanisms associated with C-PAC treatment. Aim 2 will focus on assessing the chemopreventive potential of C-PAC against EAC in the rat esophagogastroduodenal anastomosis (EGDA) model and improve our mechanistic understanding of C-PACs in vivo potential. Aim 3 will evaluate the use of a novel imaging technology, parallel frequency-domain optical coherence tomography (FDOCT), to detect early changes in nuclear morphology or sub-cellular structures linked with the development of preneoplasia, biomarker modulation and potentially to detect early chemopreventive efficacy. Positive outcomes of the proposed research will lay the foundation to rapidly translate these preclinical findings to clinical interventions in cohorts at increased risk for EAC, including BE patients or patients with esophageal dysplasia."
"9365968","Abstract: Joint pain in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represents a significant health burden. Although RA pain is often thought to result from inflammation, it often persists even after optimal control of inflammation with currently available therapies, indicating the involvement of other non-inflammatory mechanisms. Yet, such mechanisms are largely unknown. The formation of immunoglobulin G immune complex (IgG-IC) in the serum and affected joints is a key feature of RA. Despite extensive biological studies on the role of IgG-IC and its receptors (Fc gamma receptors, Fc?Rs) in RA pathogenesis, however, little is known about their contributions to RA pain. Ours and others' studies have revealed that, Fc?R type I (Fc?RI) is expressed not only in immune cells, but also in a subpopulation of primary sensory neurons. Moreover, Fc?RI crosslinking by IgG-IC directly induces neuronal activation in vitro. We have now generated preliminary data that peripheral IgG-IC/Fc?RI signaling also mediates in vivo hyperactivity of joint sensory neurons and joint pain, but not joint inflammation, in both naïve and arthritic states. The goal of this proposal is therefore to test the hypothesis that IgG-IC drives a noninflammatory component of RA-associated joint pain through direct activation of neuronal Fc?RI. In Aim1, we will define which subtypes of joint-innervating sensory neurons express Fc?RI. We will also perform in vivo electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging on DRG neurons in the intact mouse to determine whether IgG-IC excites and or sensitizes specific subtypes of joint sensory afferents and whether genetic knockout of Fc?RI diminishes such effects. We will also test whether IgG-IC is able to evoke acute joint pain through activation of Fc?RI under naïve conditions. In addition, we will generate a conditional Fc?RI knockout mouse line to specifically and unambiguously address the contributions of neuronal Fc?RI in this process. In Aim 2, we will test whether Fc?RI expression and function are upregulated in DRG in the setting of a murine model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). Using global and conditional Fc?RI knockout mice, we will also determine whether Fc?RI signaling, particularly in neurons, contributes in vivo to neuronal hyperexcitability and chronic joint pain in AIA and whether such any roles are dissociable from effects on inflammation. In Aim 3, we will identify candidate miRNAs that target Fc?RI and ask whether they regulate baseline noccieptive responsiveness to IgG-IC, whether they are downregulated in the setting of AIA, and conversely, whether overexpression of these miRNAs can reduce neuronal hyperexcitability and nociceptive behaviors by suppressing Fc?RI expression in the AIA model. These studies promise to illuminate a novel mechanism underlying RA-associated pain. If successful, they will significantly impact the field by defining a strong candidate therapeutic target for pain in RA and other autoimmune disorders involving Fc?RI that cannot be adequately controlled by anti-inflammatory treatments."
"9336368","Summary  A quantum based computational approach identified amongst existing molecules new antimalarial activity separately for both blood and liver-stages. Prominent amongst the liver-stage molecules was a near identical match to cethromycin, comprised of the well known antimalarial quinoline nucleus joined to the erythromycin scaffold. In a limited preclinical mouse liver-stage sporozoite challenge model, cethromycin reduced the malaria parasite load using a single lower than human-equivalent dose. In previous extensive clinical trials cethromycin was shown to be equivalent to existing pneumonia drugs with a good safety profile in more than 2000 persons treated for bacterial pneumonia.  The hypothesis is that human equivalent cethromycin dosing will be curative in the mouse liver-stage models and that cethromycin will demonstrate P. vivax hypnozoite activity in the in vitro primary human hepatocyte assay.  The specific aims are:  1. Synthesize gram quantities of preclinical grade cethromycin  2. Characterize mouse liver-stage cethromycin activity alone or in combination using  azithromycin as macrolide class comparator.  3. Perform in vitro P. vivax hypnozoite activity assays in collaboration with Medicines for Malaria  Venture on human primary hepatocytes  4. Pharmacokinetic measurements on rodent liver, lung and blood levels for pharmacodynamics analysis.  The broad long-term objective is a safe, effective malaria prophylaxis with weekly dosing and/or replacement of primaquine for cure of dormant P. vivax/ovale liver-stage parasites. These preclinical studies will supplement existing cethromycin preclinical pharmacologic data for the goal of a controlled human malaria infection phase 2 clinical trial. This quantifiable preclinical work will validate the quantum based modeling approach to identify repurposing drugs for clinical use."
"9352826","PROJECT SUMMARY - Outcomes Improvement and Implementation Science Core The function of the Outcomes Improvement and Implementation Science Core (OIC) is to serve as a resource to CCDTR investigators and the broader research community. We aim to strengthen and facilitate work in designing and carrying out translational studies and assessing real-world implementation and outcomes for patients with diabetes, and populations at risk. We aim to test novel methods for implementing evidence-based practice and guidelines in routine clinical settings, with extension to community sites and resources. The OIC provides specialized technical expertise to enhance the efficiency, productivity, and multidisciplinary nature of translational diabetes research conducted by CCDTR investigators and others in our region. The current proposal builds on the success of the Outcomes Improvement Core over the past five years and adds new resources in the disciplines of Implementation Science and Population Health Management. Outcomes Improvement refers to the measurement of and systematic clinical interventions to improve the health states of patients. The study of Outcomes Improvement focuses primarily on interventions arising from the healthcare system, some of which may also seek to connect patients to health resources within the community. Implementation Science teaches us how to implement and assess sustainability of health interventions in real- world settings. Key features include identifying questions of importance to stakeholders (e.g. clinicians, healthcare systems, payers, and patients), using existing networks and infrastructure to implement interventions in heterogeneous, real-world settings, and employing few exclusion criteria to assure generalizability. OIC comprises core personnel who bring expertise in key areas of methodology for translational studies involving behavioral sciences, health services research and quality improvement, implementation science, epidemiology, population health management, survey research and qualitative research, project management, and healthcare policy. Specific Aims: 1. To assist investigators in developing and studying ways to improve diabetes care and outcomes in real-  world practice, with a special focus on improving the care and outcomes of vulnerable populations in  resource-constrained settings, and reducing racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and LGBTQ disparities. 2. To build new partnerships between investigators and varied practice sites, and promote the development of  collaborative research relationships for the study of diabetes care and prevention. 3. To advance novel methods for delivering diabetes-related health care to diverse populations, and for  assessing the effectiveness of these methods."

"9340935","Sarcopenia is an age-related syndrome characterized by a decrease in muscle mass and associated with a loss of strength and power, diminished functional performance, and increased disability and mortality. It is associated with several pathological condition including chronic disease and myopathy. The prevalence of sarcopenia is approximately 25% of the U.S. population over 70 years of age, thus greatly increased government healthcare expenditures by an expanding elderly population. This could be even more burden for the VA healthcare because the Veteran population is older than the general population. One of the mechanism involved in skeletal muscle sarcopenia is loss or senescence of stem cells resident in the skeletal muscle. Satellite cells are stem cells located beneath the basal lamina in close contact with the muscle fiber and are the major players in postnatal muscle growth and regeneration after injury. Thyroid hormones act as pleiotropic factors in various tissues during development by regulating genes involved in growth and differentiation, including skeletal muscle. We recently showed that thyroid hormone receptor ? (TR?) plays a crucial role in satellite cell proliferation and differentiation and skeletal muscle regeneration after injury. In this proposal we hypothesize that TR?, modulating skeletal muscle satellite cell senescence, is a key regulator in maintaining skeletal muscle mass during aging. Our preliminary observations demonstrate that a mice carrying a Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH)-associate mutation for TR? has reduced muscle mass and strength and capability to regenerate after injury with aging. We are planning several studies devoted to extend our knowledge on molecular basis of thyroid hormones and TR? regulation of muscle stem cell senescence with aging. We will evaluate whether satellite-cell-intrinsic alterations may cause the loss in muscle and regenerative decline with age in mice with TR? mutations with a serial of in vivo transplantation strategies. We will analyze gene and protein expressions associated with transcription factors for quiescence, self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation of satellite cell and associated with chromatin remodeling by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in vitro and in vivo animal model. Our goal is to identify therapeutic targets with the potential to promote satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and response to injury, in conditions such as sarcopenia and skeletal muscle loss."
"9321768","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am committed to a career in academic medicine, and my five-year career goal is to become an independent investigator in the areas of maternal body composition, maternal metabolism, placental nutrient transport, and fetal growth. My long-term career objective is to build a strong translational research program to study the effect of maternal fat and muscle mass on placental function, neonatal development, and the offspring's risk of future cardiovascular disease. I have completed my clinical training in maternal-fetal medicine, a Master of Clinical Research degree, and have received valuable basic training in molecular techniques. Additional training is required however before I can achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator in maternal-fetal-placental health. The proposed training program has been designed to provide training in: 1) placental physiology and developmental health, 2) maternal metabolism and 3) project management and leadership skills. Oregon Health and Science University is an ideal environment for this training. It offers is strong reputation as a leading biomedical research and training institution; the Center for Developmental Health is internationally recognized for its work in fetal physiology and the developmental origins of health and disease; and the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI) is dedicated to the development of successful young investigators. One in five women who deliver in the United States is obese. Babies born to obese women are at risk for being at the extremes of birth weight (>4500g or <2500g) and developing chronic diseases as adults. Our preliminary data show that increased maternal fat: fat free mass ratio is associated with increased placental inflammatory cytokines and abnormal placental nutrient transporter expression. Due to their rapid growth in utero, boys are at a greater risk of undernourishment. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the degree to which maternal fat: fat free mass ratio impacts placental inflammatory cytokine levels and nutrient transporter expression and activity in order to better understand how maternal obesity and fetal sex impacts fetal growth. These studies will help determine the effect of maternal obesity, fetal sex, and inflammatory cytokines on placental nutrient transport and hopefully provide future interventional targets to improve the health status of women and their children. Upon completion of the proposed studies, we will have measured: 1) maternal fat: fat free mass ratio, maternal markers of glucose and amino acid metabolism, and maternal, fetal, and placental inflammatory cytokine levels in lean and obese mothers; 2) transporter gene and protein expression levels in the placenta as well as glucose uptake in placental explants in vitro according to the sex of the fetus in lean and obese mothers; 3) amino acid and glucose levels in umbilical cord plasma and offspring fat: fat free mass ratios at birth and in the first year of life."
"9360833","Abstract  Coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) is a systemic infection caused by the fungi, Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii, which are endemic to Arizona, California and other parts of the United States. Illness ranges from pneumonia to life-threatening spread to other parts of the body (disseminated infection), including the brain. Valley Fever causes an average of 160 deaths annually, and produced $2 billion in hospital charges from 2000 ? 2011. Current therapies are not curative and may be need to be continued for life. This proposal responds to RFA-AI-16-034 which explicitly invites vaccines for Coccidioides spp.  Our vaccine candidate appears i) safe, ii) highly effective, and iii) feasible to produce commercially. It is based upon a deletion of the CPS1 gene from the fungus, resulting in complete loss of virulence in mice. When used as a vaccine against experimental murine coccidioidomycosis, it is very protective. The vaccine candidate (?cps1) is ?manufactured? by simply growing arthroconidia on solid media and so the cost of goods is likely to be low, making commercial development feasible. We propose to develop our vaccine candidate first to prevent Valley Fever in dogs. This will provide pre-clinical information for its safety and efficacy in a large animal and further support an FDA IND for humans. The specific aims are to first use fungal genetic analysis of the CPS1 mutation to determine why it is essential for virulence. A complete understanding of its role in the fungus could provide a better assessment about its safety as a live vaccine. Second, we will develop a formulation that would be used in both dogs and humans. Third, we will determine exactly which lymphocyte subsets and their cytokines mediate protection. This information will be useful for the rational identification of future surrogate markers of protection in immunized dogs and humans. Finally, we will develop an experimental model of coccidioidal infection in canines and use it to test the efficacy of ?cps1 to prevent disease.  In addition to the studies proposed in this application, we have identified an industrial partner, Anivive Lifesciences, that has agreed to partner with us and will provide additional investment and expertise to fully develop a veterinary vaccine. We believe that with the success of this program, risk of developing our vaccine candidate for humans will be substantially reduced to the point that further investment will be forthcoming to complete the ultimate objective of our work."
"9321092","PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT ? Outreach and Recruitment Core The Outreach and Recruitment (OR) Core supports the overall mission of the ADC through activities related to community outreach, recruitment and retention, and dissemination of information to the lay and professional community. The OR Core has considerable expertise in minority outreach and supports the Clinical Core in recruiting and retaining an ethnically and demographically diverse cohort in multiple ways, including staff trainings, collaboration with community agencies, development of outreach materials, publication and dissemination of semi-annual newsletters. The OR Core has promoted the work of the UCD ADC through two highly successful annual community outreach events that specifically target minority groups--African American Wellness Forum and Spanish Mini-Medical School, both of which also serve as forum for minority research participant recruitment. The OR works closely with the Clinical and Neuropathology Cores to monitor and promote minority participation in the brain donation program. For example, together with three other ADCs, the OR Core has completed a study of barriers to brain donation among minorities through a National Alzheimer's Coordination Center Collaborative Grant. The UCD ADC via the OR Core works collaboratively with other Centers within University of California Davis such as the Center for Reducing Health Disparities, Clinical Translational Sciences Center, and Latino Aging Research Center; and the OR Core partners with local and regional community agencies such as the Alzheimer's Association to educate lay communities about Alzheimer's disease and healthy brain aging by co-sponsoring major conferences. Through collaboration with the Administrative Core, the OR Core will continue to further develop the Community Engagement Lecture Series and Annual Caregiver Workshop (through sponsorship from local long-term care facilities) to both Sacramento and East Bay communities. Emphasis will also be placed on retention activities by offering support groups, brain health classes, and caregiver stress management classes for ADC participants and family members. Finally, the OR Core maintains the ADC website, supporting other Cores and the Center as a whole."
"9324353","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a non-specific term to describe elevation in pulmonary artery (PA) pressure. Broadly, PH may be caused by elevations in left atrial pressure, increased flow through the PA and true pulmonary vascular pathology. Yet one of the most vexing problems in the ontology of PH is the presence of pressures that seem excessively high in patients with known lung and heart diseases. The current descriptors of these patients include out of proportion PH and combined disease from the World Symposium on PH in 2013. Our application focuses on patients with C-PH in the context of elevated left atrial pressure with PH that is greater than would be expected by purely passive mechanisms. Because C-PH is so poorly defined, almost nothing is known about this phenotype. C-PH is commonly found in patients with diastolic and systolic left heart dysfunction and has been associated with worse prognosis in these conditions, but we presently lack any specific therapy for C-PH. Our group has published on the differentiation of pulmonary arterial hypertension (due to pulmonary arterial remodeling, PAH) from Group II PH (passive pulmonary hypertension due to left atrial hypertension) and has studied patients with PH out of proportion to left atrial hypertension. Further we have identified metabolic syndrome associations with PH in animal models and affected patients. We have developed an infrastructure for PH patient clinical and research phenotyping including a large biobank that we have used to identify genetic variants associated with heritable pulmonary vascular disease collaboratively with other groups. We now hypothesize that genetic variants and metabolic traits contribute to development of C-PH associated with left atrial hypertension and can be exploited to define endophenotypes and dynamically identify subsets of PH patients that are likely to respond to targeted therapeutics. Our proposal includes three specific aims to test this hypothesis. First we will physiologically and clinically phenotype C-PH to demonstrate the presence of fixed pulmonary vascular disease unlike Group II PH. Second we will use forward and reverse phenotyping with whole exome sequencing, transcriptomic and metabolomic data to define a molecular classification of PAH, Group II PH and C-PH. We will confirm our findings using BioVu, a Vanderbilt DNA databank with deidentified patient information. Third, we will dynamically phenotype C-PH patients to identify those likely to respond to PAH-directed therapy. At the conclusion of these studies we will have identified common genetic and metabolic features of C-PH and used dynamic phenotyping to recognize C-PH patients likely to respond to PAH-directed therapy. These studies will form a construct for building a molecular classification of all PH and proof of concept that certain molecularly- defined phenotypes can be identified prior to treatment and guide optimal therapy."
"9347418","Background The ApoE4 genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for developing AD. However, the mechanisms that underlie this link between ApoE4 genotype and SAD are not well understood. Objective/Hypothesis The objectives are to understand the molecular underpinnings of the association between ApoE4-specific changes in miRNA profile and ApoE4-induced brain phospholipid dysregulation which leads to ApoE4 increased susceptibility to develop SAD. Our recent findings demonstrate that ApoE proteins are critical determinants of brain phospholipid homeostasis and that the ApoE4 isoform is dysfunctional in this process. We have found that the levels of PIP2 are reduced in human and mouse brains of ApoE4 carriers, and in primary neurons expressing ApoE4 alleles when compared to those levels in ApoE3 counterparts. These changes are secondary to increased expression of a PIP2 degrading enzyme, the phosphoinositol phosphatase synaptojanin 1 (synj1), in ApoE4 carriers. Genetic reduction of synj1 in ApoE4 mice restores PIP2 levels and more importantly, rescues AD-related cognitive deficits. These findings are the first to link synj1 and PIP2 homeostasis to the pathogenic effects of ApoE4 in sporadic AD. Further studies suggest that ApoE4 behaves like the ApoE null conditions, which fails to degrade synj1 mRNA efficiently unlike ApoE3 does. We have also found that the levels of miR195 and miR374 are significantly lowered in ApoE4 mouse (9-12 months of age) and human brains (MCI and early AD subjects) compared to those in non-ApoE4 counterparts. Over- expression of miR195 but not miR374 in ApoE4 treated neurons reduces synj1 protein expression. Moreover, we have found that disruption of ApoE binding to its receptors LRP1 or genetic knockdown of LRP1 abolishes ApoE-induced changes in miR195/synj1 pathways. Therefore, we hypothesize that ApoE3 binds to LRP1 to up-regulate miR195 expression which subsequently modulates synj1 mRNA degradation rate and synj1 expression levels in the brain. In ApoE4 neurons and brains, decreased levels of miR195 may contribute to the reduced degradation rate of synj1 mRNA, thereby increasing synj1 protein expression and reduce brain PIP2 levels. These changes may contribute to ApoE4-associated synaptic and cognitive dysfunction. Rationale/Experimental Design In this application, we will study the effects of specific miRNA changes on ApoE4-associated phospholipid dyshomeostasis, synaptic dysfunction as well as cognitive dysfunction (aim 1). We will determine if elevating miR195 (which are low in ApoE4 mouse brains when compared to ApoE3 counterparts) by intraventricular injection of viral-containing miRNAs, can correct phospholipid dyshomeostasis, and rescue synaptic and cognitive deficits in ApoE4 mice without and with AD transgenic background in vivo. We will also determine if inhibiting miR195 by antagomirs in ApoE3 mouse brains without AD transgenic background can result in phospholipid dysregulation and subsequent synaptic and cognitive deficits, similarly to what we observed in ApoE4 mice. We propose to deliver miRNA-containing viral packages or miRNA antagomirs to hippocampal regions of 3-month old mice, and to determine their cognitive function at 6-9 months of age, as well as spine morphology and brain PIP2 homeostasis at 9-month of age. In aim 2, we propose to determine the signaling pathways that link ApoE isoforms to LRP1 leading to changes in miR195 and synj1 which contribute to ApoE4-related deficits. We propose to determine effects of miR195 on synj1 transcript by luciferase assays, to identify binding motifs of synj1 3?-UTR regions for miR195, to determine the downstream signal pathways from ApoE receptors to changes in miRNA and synj1 expression, and to identify key drives and candidate genes important in regulating brain phospholipid homeostasis and cognitive function after miRNA manipulations in ApoE mouse brains using NGS data assembly and network prediction analysis. Relevance/Impact The studies proposed in this application could help us design therapeutic interventions for the treatment of AD targeting at brain lipid homeostasis and ApoE4 through microRNA regulation."

"9368396","PROJECT SUMMARY Daily rhythms in animal behavior, physiology and metabolism are driven by cell-autonomous circadian clocks that are synchronized by environmental cycles, but maintain ~24h rhythms even in their absence. These clocks keep time and control overt rhythms via transcriptional feedback loops. Because clock dysfunction negatively impacts human health and well being, it is imperative to define the mechanisms that drive rhythmic transcription. The goal of this proposal is to understand how a critical event controlling rhythmic transcription, i.e. feedback repression, is achieved using two complementary model systems, the monarch butterfly and Drosophila. In animals, two feedback loop paradigms having orthologous components can be discerned: A Drosophila-like (dl) paradigm in which CLOCK (CLK) activates and PERIOD (PER) represses transcription, and a mammal-like paradigm (ml) in which BMAL1 activates and PER-CRYPTOCHROME (PER-CRY) complexes repress transcription. Monarch butterflies possess an ml clock, but unlike mammals, monarchs carry single copies of both circadian activators and repressors, thus making it an attractive model to dissect circadian mechanisms relevant to mammals. Common features of dl and ml clocks are that PER initiates transcriptional repression `on-DNA' by binding CLK complexes present on E-box regulatory elements, and that the subsequent removal of repressor-activator complexes from E-boxes initiates an `off-DNA' repression phase that is maintained for many hours until activators bind E-boxes to reactivate transcription. How PER initiates on-DNA repression and how off-DNA repression is initiated and maintained remains poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrate that PER-dependent repression in monarch requires a conserved region encoded by CLK exon 19 (hereafter e19ar), that Drosophila CLOCKWORK ORANGE (CWO) binds E-boxes in antiphase to CLK-CYC, and that loss of cwo increases trough levels of CLK-CYC binding. Based on published and preliminary data, we will pursue two aims to determine 1) how PER initiates on-DNA repression of CLK- BMAL1 and CLK-CYC transcription with a focus on CLKe19ar, and 2) how PER and CWO collaborate to maintain off-DNA transcriptional repression and promote CLK-CYC/CLK-BMAL1 transcription. Successful completion of these aims will provide mechanistic insight into how circadian repression determines the phase, period and amplitude of transcriptional rhythms. Ultimately, such knowledge may be broadly applied for diagnosis and treatment of many diseases and ailments associated with clock dysfunction."
"9310064","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the first trial, 44 Head Start classrooms were randomly assigned to the REDI intervention or usual practice and 356 4-year-old children were followed from prekindergarten into elementary school. The classroom program enhanced teaching quality and promoted improvements in child vocabulary, emergent literacy skills, social competence, learning engagement, and reduced aggression at the end of Head Start. Sustained benefits were documented in kindergarten and second grade, with improved social-emotional functioning still evident for some subgroups at the end of fifth grade. The first aim of the proposed study is to assess the long term impact of the REDI classroom program by conducting follow-up assessments with the participants in grades 9 and 11, and testing the hypothesis that the improved social-emotional functioning and self-regulation skills promoted by REDI will mediate long term effects on academic attainment and reductions in risky behaviors in adolescence. In 2009, a second REDI trial was initiated. A new sample of 210 children attending Head Start REDI classrooms were randomly assigned to receive a complementary REDI home visiting program or usual practice Head Start home visiting. The REDI home visiting program promoted improvements in child social competence, self- directed learning and academic competence in kindergarten with sustained effects evident in second grade. The second aim of the proposed study is to assess the longer-term impact of the REDI home visiting program by conducting follow-up assessments with the 210 participants in grades 5 and 7, and testing the hypothesis that improved parent support and parent-child communication will mediate program effects on later child outcomes. The third aim is to explore the impact of the school context on the long term outcomes of the REDI classroom and home visiting programs. Analyses of the REDI classroom program revealed some moderation in elementary school, with benefits amplified in schools characterized by low levels of student achievement"
"9381237","The Impact of Nursing on Racial Disparities in Surgical Outcomes The National Institutes of Health and the American College of Surgeons recently suggested that one potential explanation for racial disparities in surgical outcomes is that minority and white patients may receive care in hospitals that provide differing quality of care. Few studies have been able to identify the factors underlying the between-hospital quality differences that are actionable targets for intervention through system redesign. Our work focuses on a systems feature given little attention in surgical disparities studies?differences in the nursing resources across hospitals, including registered nurse staffing and skill mix, the percentage of nurses with at least a bachelors in nursing (BSN) degree, and nurse work environments. Despite the large body of evidence linking these nursing features to surgical outcomes, it is not clear whether: 1) differences across hospitals in nursing resources are contributing to observed surgical disparities; 2) whether minority patients, because of differences in relative risk, are more sensitive to limited nursing resources; and 3) whether there are particular combinations of nursing resources that are most effective in reducing disparities. Our study will answer these questions. This application builds upon the successful scientific programs of two research teams: one with unique data and capabilities for evaluating the impact of nursing on surgical outcomes and disparities, and another which has pioneered Tapered Multivariate Matching methods to carefully control for differences in clinical risk between minority and white surgical patients in order to clearly identify the basis of outcomes disparities. We merge these two highly successful programs and combine novel Tapered Multivariate Matching approaches with unique new data on hospital nursing and surgical patient outcomes in over 700 hospitals in four large states to explicitly identify the conditions, in terms of nursing resources, that best serve to reduce surgical disparities. Our first aim is to determine whether and to what extent disparities in surgical outcomes (mortality, failure to rescue, readmissions, length of stay, intensive care use) between minority and white patients undergoing the exact same procedure result from: a) differences between minority and white patients themselves; and b) differences in nursing resources (including nurse education, staffing, skill mix, and the nurse work environment) and other characteristics (e.g., volume) of the often very different hospitals where minority and white patients predominantly receive care. Our second aim will allow us to identify if subpopulations of minority patients (e.g., high vs. low risk; specific procedure/comorbidity combinations) benefit more from specific nursing resource configurations. Our final aim will capitalize on panel data, spanning nearly a decade for over 700 hospitals and the patients in them, to determine whether changes in nursing are associated with changes in disparities?strengthening a case that associations we find in cross-sectional studies may be causal. Better evidence about the relationship between nursing and racial disparities in surgical outcomes can spur evidence-based interventions targeting modifiable aspects of nursing to reduce disparities."
"9353407","Project Summary  Physiological homeostasis is essential for maintenance of ocular lens transparency and accommodation, the dysregulation of which can lead to cataract formation and impaired vision. Despite continued efforts, a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of ionic and osmotic homeostasis within the lens is lacking. Owing to this gap in knowledge, we are yet to identify therapeutic avenues to prevent or delay cataract formation, a leading cause of blindness worldwide. In this exploratory application, our broad objective is to investigate and understand the role of calcium binding protein, S100A4, in lens integrity and function. Deficiency of S100A4 leads to late onset cortical cataract formation in mice.  Motivation for this proposal stems from our recent novel observation that S100A4, a small molecular weight calcium binding protein involved in cell motility, differentiation and osmoprotection, exhibits a rather discrete and intense distribution pattern in differentiating lens fibers within the eye. Most significantly, absence of S100A4 leads to cortical cataract formation in mice, with progressive histological changes in lens fiber cell morphology and organization presenting by six months of age. Interestingly, hyperosmotic stress also significantly elevated the levels of S100A4 in normal mouse lens. Although S100A4 has been studied extensively in metastasis of various cancers and is considered a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for different cancers, the physiological role of this protein is largely unknown. Therefore, this application not only addresses the role of S100A4 in lens osmotic and calcium homeostasis and lens function for the first time, but also leverages the lens as a model system to elucidate the physiological role of S100A4.  Since nothing is known about S100A4 function in lens and cataractogenesis, this developmental proposal seeks to gain molecular and cellular insights into how deficiency of S100A4 accelerates cortical cataract formation, under two specific aims. Aim 1 will investigate the cellular and molecular basis underlying the requirement of S100A4 for lens transparency by performing detailed histological, biochemical, cytoskeletal and gene expression analyses of S100A4 null mouse lenses during maturation and aging. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that elevated levels of intracellular calcium, calcium-dependent protease activity and impaired osmoadaptation are causative factors in cortical cataract formation in S100A4 null mice.  Our expectation is that successful completion of the studies described in this exploratory proposal will have a significant impact on: 1.Deciphering the physiological role of S100A4, 2. Fundamental molecular mechanisms involved in lens homeostasis, and 3. Unraveling the etiological mechanisms of late onset cortical cataract formation. Importantly, we envision that the data derived from this developmental proposal will lay a strong foundation for a comprehensive future project addressing the role of S100A4 in lens integrity, function and cataractogenesis."
"9360611","Project Summary: This proposal outlines the development of a fundamentally new optogenetic technology capable of flexibly manipulating the activity of thousands of neurons contributing to the dynamic activity of distributed neural circuits with single neuron resolution. No method that currently exists even remotely meets the need of flexible, selective control of thousands of neurons distributed across large volumes of the brain. Filling this methodological gap is a central research objective of the BRAIN Initiative, because doing so will transform our ability to investigate how the nervous system encodes, processes, utilizes, stores, and retrieves information. The overall objective for this application is to acquire critical structural knowledge of photoactive states of a red-shifted channelrhodopsin and use these to engineer a photoselectable channel prototype that demonstrates the potential of our approach for future development in behaving animals. This would allow opsin-expressing neurons to be flexibly selected, activated, and deselected with light. By leveraging new structural knowledge, we anticipate that we can develop a fundamentally new approach to optogenetics that takes us beyond genetically targeted control and into an era of functionally targeted, flexible control of any neural ensemble. The aims of our research are to obtain the first atomic structures of red-shifted channelrhodopsin mutants in three channel states, engineer a three-state ReaChR mutant with high open conductance and optimized action spectra, and demonstrate reversible photoselective control of neurons in vivo with PReaChR prototypes. We anticipate that completion of these aims will yield the following expected outcomes. First, it will produce new knowledge of the underlying structural transformations between channelrhodopsin photostates that will enable efficient computational design of photoselectable optogenetic tools. Second, it will produce the first examples of photoselective channelrhodopsins useful for neural excitation. Third, it will assess the utility of these new opsins for flexible control of distributed sets of neurons. Collectively, these will provide a roadmap to extending the transformative new trait of photoselectabilty to a wide range of existing optogenetic tools for excitation, inhibition and modulation of neural activity. Further research in this direction should ultimately enable flexible control of spatially complex distributions of neurons in head-fixed and freely moving animals during behavior, a key to furthering our understanding of the intricate neural dynamics that underlie our thoughts, feeling, and actions and how circuit dynamics are disrupted by neurological disorders."
"9314363","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The endemic forms of dengue virus that infect humans today resulted from the zoonotic transmission of four different dengue viruses that infect old world monkeys in Asia and Africa. These non-human primate dengue viruses (aka sylvatic dengue) continue to spill over into human populations, and will occasionally cause local dengue epidemics. Despite these obvious threats to public health, little is known about what adaptive barriers to viral replication exist during transmissions from monkey reservoir hosts to humans. It is well established that the innate immune system is the major barrier to cross-species transmission of dengue virus. Specifically, if a host is able to mount a robust interferon response upon infection, the virus will be unable to replicate. One of the nonstructural proteins from endemic, human-adapted Dengue, NS2B3, has been shown to antagonize the interferon response in human cells. Recently, it was shown that this antagonism could be explained by NS2B3s ability to cleave a human antiviral protein: the Stimulator of INterferon Genes (STING). I have shown that STING has been undergoing rapid evolution in primates, and this evolution has allowed for STING to avoid cleavage by NS2B3. This suggests that the evolution of STING may have been shaped by antagonism by viruses, and the barriers to cross species transmission are partially due to this antiviral protein. The goal of this proposal is to determine how the evolution of STING has contributed to barriers to sylvatic dengue spillover. The specific aims of this research proposal are to: 1) Determine how the evolution of STING has created species barriers for human endemic strains of dengue. 2) Determine the role of NS2B3 in extending or changing the host range of sylvatic dengue. 3) Determine if a human dengue strain can adapt to replicate in the presence of new world monkey STING. Uncovering the details that govern these transmission events could help in predicting which sylvatic strains have the potential to emerge as new endemic forms of the virus. Furthermore, knowing the factors responsible for species-tropism of the virus may help in developing an effective animal model for testing antiviral therapies, treatment protocols, and vaccines."

"9357421","DRP: Developmental Research Program SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the UCLA SPORE in Brain Cancer Developmental Research Program (DRP) is to foster the exploration of innovative research ideas through the funding of pilot developmental research projects in the field of brain cancer. This program will identify new, innovative projects for funding that will constantly renew the vigor of our Brain SPORE research portfolio and add to, augment, or replace current major research projects. The DRP represents a timely mechanism to expand discovery within the SPORE. Each year, three highly innovative proposals will be selected for funding. Prospective developmental research projects will be solicited through a request for applications (RFA) sent throughout the UCLA main campus and affiliated institutions (i.e., LA BioMed/UCLA Harbor Medical Center, Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science, West Los Angeles Veterans Administration Hospital, Southern California Kaiser Permanente, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center). We will also solicit proposals for our DRP through other institution-wide, state-wide, and region-wide channels. This will include e-mail solicitations to all faculty at UCLA and other University of California campuses (Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Riverside, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz), as well as to researchers at Caltech and USC. We will also solicit applications through the major NCI-funded Cancer Centers in Southern California (UCLA Jonsson Cancer Center, USC Norris Cancer Center, City of Hope Cancer Center, UCI Chao Family Cancer Center, UCSD Moores Cancer Center, Sanford-Burnham Research Institute, and the Salk Institute). Potential DRP investigators will be asked for a proposal, biosketch, and letters of recommendation. Three awards of $50,000 each (totaling $150,000 per year) will be made annually for the duration of the SPORE award. Funding will be made primarily for new and innovative ideas, but also to initiate intra- and inter-SPORE collaborations. Faculty at all levels will be encouraged to apply, both those beginning a research career, and established investigators who wish to re-direct their research into the field of brain cancer. This should provide a broad base of applicants and new ideas, providing funding opportunities for investigators from a variety of local and regional institutions. The DRP Selection Committee will meet and select the most meritorious translational brain cancer research applications, with input from outside ad hoc reviewers as necessary. Following scoring by the DRP Selection Committee, the Executive Committee (EC) will meet to determine the funding line. The Internal Advisory Board (IAB) and External Advisory Board (EAB) will review the funding decisions and progress of developmental projects at their regularly scheduled meetings. The DRP will receive matching funds from the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) and the UCLA Department of Neurosurgery. Successful translational research projects may receive further funding in the SPORE and replace unproductive funded major projects. The anticipated outcome of the DRP is to enlarge the overall pool of brain cancer SPORE investigators at UCLA."

"9334283","PROJECT SUMMARY Perinatal brain injury induced by hypoxia ischemia remains a leading cause of intellectual and physical disability throughout the world. The use of rodent models will contribute to both prevention and treatment of life-long impairment in infants. The Animal and Behavior Core (Core B) will provide rats subjected to hypoxia ischemia (H/I) with and without prior inflammation for four integrated Projects. To maintain consistency across experiments, Core B will also treat pups with the proposed neuroprotective treatments, including hypothermia. To facilitate data interpretation, the Animals and Behavior Core will also provide standard ratings of crude histopathology to facilitate determination of efficacy of neuroprotective interventions. The variability of injury is well recognized, and such rankings are often used to determine neuroprotection effects in mildly injured rats separately from severely injured rats. This will particularly inform experiments that require tissue to be homogenized, such as western blotting, lipid raft isolation and NMR, and therefore do not include histological information. These a priori rankings will be used to track both the consistency of the injury over time, and also give us a broader picture of potential efficacy of neuroprotective compounds. Core B will organize and maintain banked samples from Projects I-IV, and make them available to the laboratories of Projects I-IV. Such Core activities are designed to circumvent the need to produce new animals for pilot experiments that may arise as data collection progresses. The Animals and Behavior Core will execute novel combinations of behavioral assays to determine the extent of dysregulation within the cerebellum and reciprocal connections between the cerebellum and other brain regions. Finally, data collection and communication concerning progress of experiments will be facilitated by implementation of an IntraNet accessible relational database. This database will be maintained by Core B personnel. This Core will also collect tissue at the appropriate time post H/I for specific experiments and track use of tissue samples in the intrarelational database. The overall goal of the Animal and Behavior Core is to assure quality control and cross-project integration to maximize the potential for detecting molecular and behavioral impairments caused by H/I and/or perinatal systemic inflammation, and the effects of therapeutic interventions. A critical strength of this Program Project Grant is the use of the same procedures to generate hypoxia ischemia and treatments. This will enable Projects I-IV to make conclusions quickly and revise experimental approaches if necessary based on data collected from other Projects."
"9371634","ABSTRACT This application is for a Mentored Career Development Award to Promote Diversity in the Dental, Oral and Craniofacial Research Workforce (K01) for Dr. Julie Marchesan. She is conducting research into the role of IFI16 as a modulator of periodontal tissue destruction via AIM2 inflammasome and cytokine/chemokine expression. The rationale for the proposed experiments is supported by the literature and preliminary data of the applicant. This award will allow Dr. Marchesan a) to become an expert in periodontal inflammation and host response, b) to train in application and interpretation of mechanistic approaches in order to increase the quality of the translational research she currently conducts, c) to develop an independent research career that will allow her to collaborate with clinical and basic researchers, and d) to increase the representation of Latino women that are in academia and independently funded in oral health research. A multidisciplinary team of experts has agreed to support Julie during this research proposal based upon funding of this application. The team and main expertise that justified inclusion of the researcher in this application are: a) Dr. Steve Offenbacher (co-mentor, translational research in periodontology), b) Dr. Jenny Ting (co-mentor, host response), c) Dr. Jennifer Webster-Cyriaque (support team, microorganisms-host interactions), Dr. John Preisser (support team, biostatistics) and Dr. Andrea Azcarate-Peril (support team, characterization of microbial populations). The combination of this mechanistic proposal with the guidance afforded by these successful researchers will provide the necessary environment for Dr. Marchesan to become a successful, independent investigator and highly represent diversity in academia. Periodontal disease affects almost half of the American adult population and is a major cause of tooth loss. The paucity of pharmacologic agents available to treat periodontitis provides sufficient justification for studying the host response and potential inflammatory modulators of periodontitis. Dr. Marchesan's preliminary data demonstrate that IFI16 is expressed in multiple cells of human periodontal tissues, including epithelial, endothelial, fibroblasts and cells of the inflammatory infiltrate. She also showed that IFI16 overexpression decreases the chemokine response. The finding that the lack of this protein in knockout animals significantly increases the amount of periodontal bone loss strengthens the evidence that this protein modulates inflammation. The proposed application will utilize mechanistic approaches (overexpression, silencing, knockout animals, bone marrow-transplants, protein inhibition) to study the role of IFI16 as a modulator of the periodontal host response. This project will evaluate IFI16 as a modulator of the periodontal host response in vitro (SA1); we propose to explore a) IFI16 hindering inflammatory tissue destruction in vivo and b) the utilization of a currently available therapeutic agent (SA2); and we will identify the main cellular source of IFI16 that is responsible for inflammatory response modulation (SA3). While there are no current therapies specifically targeting IFI16, there are available drugs that target products of AIM2-inflammasome, such as caspase-1 inhibitors. The long-term goal of these experiments is to better understand modulation of inflammation to control periodontal tissue destruction. Dr. Marchesan's research will provide a basis for understanding inflammasome modulation in periodontal tissue destruction and allow the development of a novel future project exploring inflammasomes and potential therapies for treating periodontitis by the end of this 5-year funding period."
"9513777","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuropsychological, neuroimaging and electrophysiological research supports a crucial role of lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive control of human behavior. Altered PFC function underlies a host of debilitating developmental, neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite significant progress in PFC research, the real-time processes supporting PFC control of human cognition remain undetermined. We propose that PFC uses oscillatory dynamics to implement cognitive control of task-dependent neural networks. To address this hypothesis we employ a unique combination of direct cortical recording in neurosurgical patients (Electrocorticography; ECoG) with superb spatio-temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, along with cutting-edge analysis to define PFC-dependent neural networks supporting cognition. We will examine three tasks probing hallmarks of frontal lobe function (categorical perception, working memory and controlled vs. automatic attention) across three sensory modalities (audition, vision, touch) to address the generalizabilty of PFC dependent oscillatory network control. We will then examine the causality of the oscillatory dynamics observed with ECoG using scalp EEG and behavioral methods in patients with focal lesions centered in lateral PFC regions activated in ECoG recording. Aim 1 will use ECoG recording to define the role of PFC control of phase locking of low frequency neural oscillations between local modules of task dependent networks and examines whether phase locking and cross frequency coupling (CFC) between high gamma oscillations (60-200 Hz) and low frequency oscillations tracks task performance at the single- trial level. Aim 2 examines the causality of ECoG defined oscillatory processes in patients with focal lateral PFC or posterior parietal cortex (PPC) damage. Finally, we predict that deficits in neural oscillations in the lesioned hemisphere will predict behavioral deficits and that neural oscillations in the non lesioned hemisphere will reveal novel patterns of neuroplasiticity and behavioral compensation. In summary, the proposed work aims to define the role of PFC in both distributed and local network function in the support of human behavior with implications for understanding normal as well as disordered brain function."
"9389941","Project Summary / Abstract: The blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signal source has been long debated since the invention of fMRI in the early 90s. While fMRI is one of the most successful technologies utilized in numerous studies, the debate over the source of fMRI signal source continue to generate controversies over the utility of fMRI and the interpretation of fMRI studies. One important aspect in the study of fMRI signal source is that it is fundamentally difficult to study the fMRI signal source in isolation in one brain region with one cell type. fMRI signal represents an intricate interaction between the vascular system and the neural activity and it is bound to depend on cell type and vascular composition of each region of the brain. In this context, basal ganglia thalamo-cortical circuit provides a unique opportunity to understand the fMRI signal source. Many of the basal ganglia circuit elements contain largely inhibitory cell populations with remote projections. This enables the possibility of driving neural activity throughout the brain with distinct temporal dynamics, which can potentially help delineate fMRI signal with more specificity on each cell type?s role. In addition, the basal ganglia thalamo-cortical system is an important network in the brain that consists of multiple nodes throughout the brain forming a distributed network that real- time controls important behavior such as movement. It is one of the key networks that require large-scale imaging methods such as fMRI to understand its overall dynamics. Specifically, studying the fMRI signal source associated with this network function will directly enable us to apply the knowledge to understanding an important neurobiological question. Our experimental strategy consists of three main components. In the first aim, we will measure cell type specific whole brain network function during D1- or D2- MSN stimulation utilizing simultaneous ofMRI and electrophysiology. In the second aim, we will conduct optical imaging at locations identified by preliminary ofMRI studies to confirm sources of fMRI signal with cell type specificity at each location. Then, we will computationally model the measurements to systematically understand the source of the fMRI signal against frequency components of the electrophysiology signal and also cell types at each downstream location from the stimulation site. We will utilize this knowledge to then construct models of whole brain circuit function with both stimulation cell type and downstream locations cell type specificity These aims are designed to understand the fMRI signal source in the context of D1 and D2 MSN regulation of global brain function across multiple synapses. We will also demonstrate the power of such studies in enabling a comprehensive model that can describe the interactions among all regions involved with both stimulation cell type and downstream local regional cell type specificity. This study will provide an important groundwork for understanding fMRI signal sources and how it can enable cell type specific whole brain function investigation with unprecedented precision."
"9398641","The Rocky Mountain Virology Association will hold its 17th annual meeting in September 2017. The meeting brings together regional and national investigators in virology and prion biology for a 2-day retreat- style conference with extensive interaction and collaboration. The original meeting was organized by investigators in Colorado and Wyoming who were interested in the free and open exchange of scientific data and ideas concerning general virology in a venue that promotes collaboration among students, post-doctoral researchers and faculty members. Specifically, our annual three-day autumn meeting at the Mountain Campus of Colorado State University encourages young scientists to present their research and receive feedback from established scientists. The goals are promotion of scientific interactions and training. A major benefit of participation has been the novel collaborations that arise between scientists in different disciplines, i.e. RNA stability and Flavivirus biology. The topics discussed include medical virology (vaccines, epidemiology, viral zoonoses), arthropod-borne diseases (RNA viruses and RNA metabolism, viral vectors and vector biology), host defenses (viral immunology and pathogenesis), and prion biology. Special sessions on HIV pathogenesis, vaccine development, pandemic influenza, prions, virus discovery and the global impact of viral diseases have been featured at past meetings. The next meeting will feature a roundtable discussion of emerging arboviral diseases, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Founders and attendees include scientists from Colorado State University, The University of Colorado, the University of Wyoming, the University of Northern Colorado, the Centers for Disease Control (Fort Collins) and the Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as well as scientists from regional biotech companies, and universities in Iowa, Idaho, Nebraska, Kansas, Montana and Utah.  The Rocky Mountain Virology Association was incorporated in 2010 as a tax-exempt educational charity (Section 501(c)(3)). Our board of directors is charged with encouraging student and junior faculty involvement by minimizing costs as we encourage women and minorities to participate in all stages of program development. Everyone involved in programming is a volunteer. Our attendance is limited by venue to a maximum of 114 individuals. This assures active involvement and interaction for all. Comparable general virology meetings such as the annual American Society for Virology meeting have attendance of about 1500 and high registration, housing and travel costs. Collaborative interactions at these meetings tend to be very focused on individual virus families. Our meeting promotes diverse collaboration.  Funds are requested to provide minority grants and childcare, reduce registration fees for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and early-stage investigators, and for travel and housing for invited speakers. Registration fees and individual charitable contributions cover costs for the meeting. The RMVC has been an outstanding source of communication and collaboration for the Rocky mountain region."

"9217571","Abstract  One of the stumbling blocks to development of a live-attenuated RSV vaccine is induction of long-lasting  immunity, which does not occur even with wild-type RSV infection. Since induction of robust adaptive immunity  responses requires a strong innate immune activation, the short-lived anti-RSV response may be due to viral  inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) induction. Antagonism of IFN production is largely due to the RSV NS1  protein, which is not absolutely essential for virus replication in culture although deletion of NS1 results in  decreased viral replication even in IFN-deficient cells such as Vero. This proposal will identify domains and/or  specific residues of NS1 responsible for IFN antagonism by targeted mutagenesis. Mutants that ablate the IFN  antagonist function without affecting protein stability will be inserted into recombinant RSV (rRSV) and tested  for their capacity to replicate in Vero cells and induce IFN in A549 cells. NS1 mutant rRSV that induce high  levels of IFN expression and replicate well in these cell lines will be tested for IFN antagonism and replication  in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. Further, the NS1 mutant rRSV will be tested in cotton rats, which  are the best small animal model for RSV infection to determine replication in vivo, pathogenicity,  immunogenicity, and protection from WT challenge. The best candidate NS1 mutants will be combined with the  `repaired' G gene (Project 2) and the best attenuating L methyltransferase (MTase) mutations (Project 3) to  produce double and triple mutant viruses that replicate well in Vero cells, induce high levels of IFN, efficiently  infect HAE culture, and are attenuated and protective in cotton rats. Although beyond the scope of this P01,  these vaccine candidates will be tested in non-human primate trials in the future.   "
"9409649","Summary Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem. Bacille de Calmette et Guérin (BCG), the only TB prophylactic vaccine licensed, is 80% effective against extra-pulmonary TB (extra-PTB), but has variable efficacy against PTB, the site of primary TB infection. A big handicap in the development of TB vaccines more effective than BCG is that immune protection against TB is incompletely understood. BCG generates TB- specific adaptive cell-mediated immunity (aCMI), which is thought to contribute especially to its strong protective effect against extra-PTB, but does not confer sterile immunity against M. tuberculosis (Mtb) and does not protect against latent TB infection (LTBI). We hypothesized that Mtb memory-like innate CMI (iCMI) is a mechanism of protection against primary Mtb infection that prevents LTBI. An important corollary is that TB- specific iCMI will provide a robust measure for vaccine-induced sterile protection against TB, a much needed tool for the development of highly efficacious TB vaccines. Using samples collected in the Cohort For TB Research By The Indo-US Medical Partnership Multicentric Prospective Observational Study (C-TRIUMPH) at the Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Govt. Medical College (BJMC), Pune, India, together with a group of BCG recipients with negligible exposure to TB to be enrolled in the US, we will investigate TB-specific iCMI as a mechanism of sterile protection against Mtb, and the extent to which Mtb memory iCMI can be elicited by BCG vaccination. AIM 1. To identify the Mtb iCMI characteristics that differentiate LTBI- from LTBI+ adults with high exposure to smear-positive PTBI.  Hypothesis: LTBI- individuals highly exposed to TB have more robust Mtb memory-like iCMI than LTBI+ individuals. Using CyTOF technology and systems biology analytical tools designed for large datasets, we will measure a large array of NK, NKT, ?? T and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell responses to ex-vivo Mtb antigenic stimulation and analyze the differences between a subset of LTBI- and LTBI+ adults highly exposed to smear-positive PTBI. The most significant independent differences will be used to build a smaller flow cytometry panel that will be used to test the remaining LTBI- and LTBI+ highly TB-exposed adults. AIM 2. To characterize the Mtb-specific iCMI generated by BCG.  Hypothesis: Compared with LTBI- individuals highly exposed to TB, BCG administration generates  memory-like iCMI to Mtb of lower magnitude and/or restricted to a fraction of the vaccine recipients. We will recruit adults who received BCG and had negligible exposure to TB and compare their Mtb iCMI with that of highly TB-exposed LTBI- adults using the tools described in AIM 1. The results of this study have the potential to shift the paradigm for immune protection against Mtb infection by substituting and/or adding iCMI to aCMI as long term protective responses and, thereby, to revolutionize the field of TB vaccine development. The study will provide added value to C-TRIUMPh by using already collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to accomplish its immunologic goals. We will also leverage the NIH efforts to develop advanced immunologic capacity at BJMC."
"9326923","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men with 220,000 new cases and 27,000 deaths estimated this year in the U.S. The vast majority of these deaths occur among the approximately 10-15% of cases diagnosed with aggressive PCa. There are few known risk factors for PCa beyond age, African descent and a family history of PCa, and there are no risk factors that can determine which men will develop aggressive versus non-aggressive disease. Multiple lines of evidence indicate a substantial heritable component of aggressive PCa. Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 100 common susceptibility loci that collectively account for 33% of the familial risk of PCa. These loci contribute equally to risk of aggressive and non-aggressive disease which suggests they play a role in the very early stages of PCa tumor evolution. Recent sequencing studies have revealed rare coding variants (well under 1%) in genes such as BRCA1/2 and other DNA repair pathway genes that convey larger risks (3-5 fold) of aggressive PCa relative to non-aggressive disease. These observations suggest that the allelic architecture of aggressive disease may be quite different than overall PCa, and highlight the need for larger efforts focused on rare genetic variation (<1%). This spectrum of variation represents ~80% of all genetic variation in the human genome and is not adequately surveyed through GWAS. In this study, we will apply a multi-staged approach to reveal genes harboring rare variants that are associated with aggressive PCa. Whole-exome sequencing (Aim 1a) of 2,000 aggressive cases and 2,000 non-aggressive cases of European ancestry will be conducted followed by rare variant analysis of single sites and gene burden testing to identify novel susceptibility loci/genes for aggressive disease. We will validate the most significantly associated genes (~500) through targeted sequencing in an additional 7,500 aggressive and 7,500 non-aggressive cases (Aim 1b). Next, we will investigate the clinical predictive utility of the genes/variants identified in 2,300 cases in the STHM3 trial who are undergoing biopsy based on PSA and genetic risk score stratification (Aim 2). Last, we will examine whether the             genes identified in Aim 1 contribute to the greater risk of aggressive PCa in 4,000 men of African ancestry (Aim 3). Through this tiered approach we expect to significantly advance knowledge of aggressive PCa etiology and health disparities as well as guide the development of early detection and prognostic strategies for the subset of men who are most susceptible to this fatal form of disease."
"9362997","Project Summary/Abstract  Coronary artery disease, as a result of atherosclerosis, is a major cause of debilitation and death, affecting millions of Americans. Despite decades of research, there are still large gaps in our understanding of the disease. For one, RNA expression signatures of genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are altered in atherosclerosis have not been adequately evaluated in human tissues. New insight into these expression changes can be coupled with genetic studies and animal studies to provide a clearer framework to the causes and potential treatments of atherosclerosis. The new, deep resource of the GTEx (Genotype Tissue Expression) NIH Roadmap Project provides an opportunity to evaluate expression data from over 800 coronary artery segments that have a full range of atherosclerotic plaque types. As recently described, the most accurate way to interpret tissue-level expression data is to statistically correct for the cellular composition of each tissue to then uncover cell-level changes in expression. We hypothesize that cell- specific expression patterns of genes and their regulatory elements will implicate disease-causing pathways in subtypes of macrophages and smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis.  The project will elucidate gene, miRNA, and lncRNA expression alterations in atherosclerosis in GTEx coronary artery tissues after performing a computational cellular composition correction. First, the project will generate cell-specific expression data on primary cells necessary for robust deconvolution methods to uncover expression alterations. After correct of the components of each cell type, each individual RNA will be evaluated for over- or under-expression in atherosclerosis. Then important genes and lncRNAs will be localized using RNA in situ hybridization to specific subtypes of macrophages and smooth muscle cells in plaque microenvironments. miRNAs will be localized with a novel expression microdisseciton technique. Finally, the expression and localization data will be integrated with genetic (GWAS) data to explore causal regulatory pathways in atherosclerosis.  Altogether, this project will redefine the expression alterations that occur in human atherosclerosis and will provide a great resource to the wider scientific community."
"9382038","PROJECT SUMMARY Fetal transitioning from the relatively hypoxic in utero environment to an oxygen-rich perinatal atmosphere represents an oxidative burden on the developing lung. Preterm lungs are already deficient in antioxidants and are poorly equipped to deal with this oxidative transition following parturition even before considering the adverse effects of therapeutic oxygen and ventilation required to treat poor respiratory function. Sustained therapeutic oxygen may result in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a significant morbidity and mortality in preterm infants marked by alveolar simplification and dysmorphic vascular growth. It is imperative to identify and define how oxygen-sensitive signaling pathways contribute to alveolar growth and injury in settings of altered oxygen tension. Reversible oxidation of cysteine thiols has emerged as an important signaling paradigm to modulate protein activity in response to redox perturbations. Such thiol switches are regulated by the enzyme activities of thioredoxin and glutathione superfamilies. We recently identified thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) and thioredoxin-2 (Trx2) as critical regulators of cysteine oxidation during hyperoxic injury. We hypothesize that Trx1 and Trx2 act as molecular sensors of atmospheric oxygen tension that modulate alveolar development and injury/repair responses during redox perturbations associated with developmental oxidative transitions during parturition and hyperoxic injury. However, the physiological contribution of redox signaling via thioredoxin-dependent thiol switches is unknown since genetic disruption of either Trx1 or Trx2 expression is embryonic lethal and in vivo data are exclusively generated with overexpression of transgenes. The following Aims investigate how thioredoxin regulation thiol switches influences tissue and cellular physiologies and molecular functions in response to redox perturbations caused by atmospheric oxygen tension Determine if : (1) Trx1 activity influences alveolar growth and injury during oxygen transitions, (2) Identify oxygen-sensitive Trx1- dependent signaling pathways regulated via reversible oxidation of cysteine thiols, and (3) Examine how Trx2 regulates oxygen-induced mitochondrial injury and lung epithelial cell death. Fundamental knowledge gained from this project will provide new understanding on thioredoxin-dependent thiol switches regulation of responses during redox perturbations. The overarching goal of this project is to accelerate the discovery of key thioredoxin regulatory nodes of redox-dependent signaling networks and harness this information for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for BPD. alveolar development and injury"

"9375704","PROJECT SUMMARY The continuing discoveries of RNA chemical modifications and their critical roles in cellular and tumor machinery ? the `epitranscriptomics' revolution ? suggest novel routes to anticancer therapies based on disabling, manipulating, and repurposing chemical modifications at a molecular level. Unfortunately, our ability to computationally model chemically modified RNA lags behind the explosive rate of experimental discoveries; this absence of unbiased and automated tools to aid expert exploration is resulting in inconsistencies, gaps, and accumulating errors in our basic understanding of the epitranscriptome. To address this challenge, we have recently developed a framework for modeling chemically modified RNA nucleotides within the Rosetta package for high- resolution macromolecular structure prediction. Here, we outline how tools developed in this framework can resolve two fundamental bottlenecks in modeling chemically modified RNA. To address the unacceptably high frequency of stereochemical errors in experimental 3D structures of epitranscriptomic enzymatic complexes and RNA machines, we will expand and test ERRASER (Enumerative Real-space Refinement ASsisted by Electron density under Rosetta) to automatically rebuild these functionally critical regions in crystallographic and cryoelectron microscopy maps. To enable first automated calculations of secondary structure arrangements proposed to underlie epitranscriptomic gene regulation, we will expand and test the Reweighting of Energy- function Collection with Conformational Ensemble Sampling (RECCES) method for nearest-neighbor parameter prediction, focusing on the 10 most common modifications while enabling generalization to all other modifications, including ones that remain undiscovered. We will evaluate success through blind challenges, independent tests by expert biological and bioengineering collaborators, and by assessing adoption of our methods and software tools by the broader research community. In the same way that specially developed computational biology tools have helped establish a biomedically impactful understanding of proteins and their posttranslational chemical regulation, we propose that the technologies outlined here will strengthen our understanding of structure in posttranscriptionally modified RNAs, providing a firmer basis for their biomedical activation or disruption."
"9527426","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the current PAGE study (PAGE 1) we investigated many genetic loci identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in ancestrally diverse populations, and successfully generalized and fine-mapped many GWAS loci from studies of European-descent populations. These successes support extending the genomic search to less frequent and rare variants, which have not been captured in GWAS, but represent the largest fraction of genetic variation in the genome and contribute to the heritabilit of many complex traits. Most GWAS have been conducted in Europeans; yet studies investigating the impact of genetic risk factors, including low frequency variants, on common complex traits in diverse populations are needed including understudied US minorities having high burden of disease. The goal of this project is to comprehensively investigate less frequent and rare non-synonymous variants across the protein coding regions of the genome, i.e. the exome, and their associations with common complex traits, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, body composition, blood lipids, glucose, insulin, and many other outcomes in a multi-ethnic population. Specifically, we propose to use a newly developed ExomeChip genotyping platform, augmented with additional content focused on ancestral diversity and putative regulatory elements in non-coding regions. This platform is highly cost-efficient and will provide genotyping data on about 350,000 variants with allele frequencies as low as 0.1%. Most of these low frequency variants are neither genotyped nor well tagged on existing GWAS arrays. We will use this ExomeChip in an ancestrally diverse population including African Americans (n=7,510), Hispanics (n=5,394) and Native Americans (n=596) from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). These data will be combined with ExomeChip genotypes and exome sequencing data from 23,303 European Americans and 3,631 African Americans from ongoing WHI studies, for a total of 40,434 WHI participants. This resource will permit us to investigate relationships between low frequency and rare genetic variants with complex diseases of public health importance as well as with well-curated intermediate traits and over 4,800 phenotypic variables available in the WHI. We will develop new methods and apply them in this rich resource to estimate heritability and to identify effects of variants across multiple phenotypes (pleiotropy) and gene-environment interaction which are motivated by our PAGE 1 findings for common variants. Through these efforts, we expect to identify multiple susceptibility loci that may better quantify the proportion of variation in complex diseases explained by genetic variants, identify population-specific loci and provide insights into shared molecular pathways that will more efficiently direct subsequent prevention and treatment strategies in the diverse US population. All genotype and associated phenotypic data will be made publically available through databases, such as dbGaP and as part of the WHI system, building a resource for the scientific community."
"9519124","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As detailed in a recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, chronic pain represents a major public health concern, affecting 100 million U.S. adults and costing more than $500 billion annually. Aging confers increased risk for chronic pain, with half of older adults reporting persistent or recurring pain, and aging is associated with greater pain-related loss of physical and psychosocial function. Current knowledge regarding pain and aging is surprisingly limited, and future progress in the field hinges on the availability of well-trained scientists who have an appreciation for preclinical and clinical research approaches to the study of both aging and pain. At present, there are no existing NIH-funded T32 programs devoted to training in pain and aging. To address this unmet need, we propose to develop a new postdoctoral training program: the Integrative and Multidisciplinary Pain and Aging Research Training (IMPART) Program. The overall goal of the IMPART program is to develop outstanding independent investigators capable of sustaining productive clinical and translational research careers addressing the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying age-related changes in the experience of pain and/or designing clinical interventions to ameliorate acute and chronic pain among older adults. In order to accomplish this overarching goal, the specific aims of this new postdoctoral training program in pain and aging research are to: 1) Recruit and train promising junior investigators to conduct mechanistically-based and clinically relevant translational research in pain and aging; 2) Implement an integrated didactic and experiential training program, which will equip trainees with new research skills and the knowledge and expertise to apply these skills to address important and unanswered questions regarding pain and aging; and 3) Create a culture of research excellence in order to ensure that trainees aspire to the high standards of scientific integrity and quality, which will set the tone for their future careers in pain and aging research. IMPART leverages two excellent and collaborative research programs at the University of Florida - the aging research community represented by the Institute on Aging (IOA), and the pain research community, organized under the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence (PRICE). Each member of the training faculty boasts an excellent track record of both research funding and mentoring experience. The proposed program requests support for four postdoctoral trainees from a variety of training backgrounds, each of whom will work with their multidisciplinary mentoring team to create and implement a tailored independent development plan as the blueprint for their training. Trainees will achieve their research and career development objectives through a combination of didactic, research, and professional development activities, and program evaluation will be ongoing and multimodal. The IMPART Program is committed to promoting diversity among our trainees, and the program will provide a training experience that emphasizes excellence in research integrity and ethics."
"9317024","Abstract The overall goal of the proposed Partnership in Implementation Science for Geriatric Mental Health (PRISM) project is to establish a hub to integrate implementation research for scaling up sustainable, evidence-based mental health interventions with research capacity-building activities for East Asia. The proposed mental health implementation research hub, based in Thailand and including China, will focus on reducing the gap in treatment and support for community-residing older adults in general, and elders with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (to be referred to as dementia in this proposal) in particular. Specific aims are to: 1) empirically test a culturally adapted Getting-To-Outcomes (GTO) implementation support model aimed at enhancing the delivery of an evidence-based physical exercise intervention for narrowing the treatment gap for older persons with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in Thailand (GTO-ThAI); 2) build individual and institutional capacity for the implementation of mental health intervention research in Thailand and China; 3) improve Thai and Chinese policy makers' capacity for using research for evidence informed decision making (EIDM); 4) develop a knowledge base for shared learning among stakeholders within each country and with other countries through NIMH and other regional NIMH hubs; and, 5) collaborate with NIMH program staff, through scientific and programmatic involvement, through a cooperative agreement for the implementation of all project activities. The focus on older adults was made as the Thai Ministry of Public Health has identified the reduction in the mental health treatment gap for older adults, specifically, for those with dementia and their family caregivers, as a key priority for the nation, due to the rising number of cases of dementia, concomitant with Thailand's rapidly growing aging population. The hub will bring together Thai and Chinese interdisciplinary researchers, policy-makers and NGO practitioners with US-based researchers who have a history of successful research collaborations with each other as well as with researchers and policy makers in the participating countries. Specific project aims will be implemented in three phases. The inception phase (study year 1) will involve: establishing the Administrative Core at BWH, Boston MA; developing a detailed research protocol for implementation at the research sites (Thailand); conducting an assessment of readiness for implementation of innovative mental health intervention solutions in both countries; and, making contacts and exploring possibilities for collaboration with other NIMH regional hubs. The implementation phase (study years 2-4) will involve piloting and conducting the implementation and scale up research activities (Thailand) and implementing the capacity-building plan (Thailand and China). The final stage (study years 4-5) will be devoted to evaluation, data sharing, and dissemination. 1"

"9334337","AP1: Exploiting Microbial Diversity for Natural Product Discovery Project Summary/Abstract The primary objective of the proposed research is to discover new, small molecule drug candidates from marine microorganisms cultured from Fiji and the Solomon Islands. This objective will be facilitated through the continued development of a productive microbial drug discovery program at the University of the South Pacific. Bioassays targeting cancer, infectious disease, neurological disorders, and neglected tropical diseases will be used to guide the isolation of compounds relevant to these targets. The structures of new compounds will be solved using modern spectral analyses and produced in sufficient quantities for effective pre-clinical evaluation. The research will target chemically rich microbial taxa including the marine actinomycete genus Salinispora and explore the relationships between biotic diversity and natural product discovery. The research benefits from a wealth of genome sequence data that has been acquired through the Joint Genome Institutes Community Sequencing Program. Bioinformatic analyses will be used to prioritize strains for chemical evaluation and to establish relationships between secondary metabolite biosynthetic potential, taxonomy, and the habitats and locations from which the stains originate. This information will be used to develop more effective sampling strategies and to provide new insight into the extant biosynthetic potential of marine bacteria and the evolutionary processes that generate structural diversity. Genome mining approaches will be used to link molecules to the pathways responsible for their production and to facilitate discovery and de-replication. The web-based tool NaPDoS (Natural Product Domain Seeker), which simplifies the analysis of genes involved with secondary metabolite biosynthesis, will be further developed to include additional pathway types and reference sequences. New cultivation methods will be developed that mimic natural conditions and provide ecologically relevant stimuli in an effort to induce secondary metabolite production. These studies will be coupled with transcriptome analyses, which will be used to determine the effects of culture conditions on biosynthetic gene expression. Highly sensitive methods in mass spectrometry will be used to better visual the secondary metabolome and generate networks that can be used to recognize new molecules, de-replicate known compounds, and search for correlations between geographic origin, phylogeny, and secondary metabolite production. Extensive post-doctoral, graduate, and undergraduate training will be provided throughout the program including training for host country scientists. Ultimately, this program aims to develop improved methods for natural product discovery and apply these approaches to the microbial resources in Fiji and the Solomon Islands in an effort to discover new drug candidates to treat diseases relevant to the US and the host nations."
"9376098","In the last thirty years the United States witnessed a transformation of the critical care delivery system marked by a simultaneous decrease in the number of hospitals providing critical care and an increase in the total number of intensive care unit beds. As a consequence, the US is not only providing more intensive care, but also concentrating this care in ever fewer numbers of hospitals. In an ongoing career-development award (K08) funded by the NHLBI, the applicant is studying the clinical impact of these changes on patient outcomes at the regional level. However, in the course of this work it has become increasingly clear that information is needed on not only the population-based implications of these changes, but also their underlying causes and effects at the individual hospital level. The overall goal of this project is to determine the causes and effects of hospital-level changes in the number of ICU beds from the perspectives of key decision makers. To accomplish this goal we will conduct and analyze semi-structured interviews with administrators from hospitals with increasing, unchanged and decreasing intensive care bed supply. Our study has two specific aims: 1) to determine the causes of hospital-level changes in the number of ICU beds, and 2) to evaluate the perceived effects of changes in the number of ICU beds. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with administrators in hospitals with varying ICU bed supply changes. We will then use thematic content analysis of the interview transcripts to develop a conceptual model for the causes underlying ICU bed supply changes. We will further analyze the interview transcripts to expand our conceptual model to include the effects of changes in ICU bed supply from the perspectives of key decision makers. Successful completion of these aims will produce rich insight into how changes in ICU infrastructure affect operations, financial metrics and clinical outcomes and will provide new hypotheses for organizational strategies to improve the care of patients with critical illness. These data will in turn inform a future R01 submission studying the impact of changes in bed supply at the hospital and region level on clinical outcomes for critically ill patients, contributing to the NHLBI's strategic vision to understand factors that account for differences in heath among populations. Additionally, the proposed research project will provide a unique opportunity for the applicant to receive additional mentored research training in qualitative research methods and organizational theory. Rigorous qualitative research is an increasingly important component of modern health care delivery science but is not part of the applicant's current K08, making this proposal synergistic with the applicant's K08 both scientifically and from a career development standpoint. Finally, the additional training, mentoring and experience are in-step with NHLBI's strategic vision to develop a scientific workforce capable of responding to current and future health challenges"
"9374195","PROJECT SUMMARY An abnormal chromosome number (aneuploidy) in developing embryos is the leading cause of birth defects and pregnancy loss in women. The majority of aneuploidies are attributed to error-prone meiotic division in oocytes and increase significantly with advanced maternal age. Accurate chromosome segregation is critically dependent on assembly of the microtubule (MT) spindle apparatus and the establishment of correct chromosome-MT interactions. Our studies in mice demonstrate that disruption of meiotic spindle stability can promote chromosome segregation errors, which are not fully resolved -despite spindle checkpoint (SAC) activation. Notably, meiotic spindle formation differs from mitosis as mammalian oocytes (mouse and human) lack typical centrosomes, with centriole loss occurring during fetal stages. Alternatively, spindle MT formation can occur from (i) unique acentriolar microtubule-organizing centers (aMTOCs) and (ii) aMTOC-independent mechanisms in mouse oocytes. In previous studies we identified pericentin (Pcnt) as an essential aMTOC scaffolding protein. Thus, to test aMTOC function we developed a unique oocyte-conditional Pcnt knockdown mouse model using a transgenic RNAi approach. Our recent analysis of oocytes from Tg mice demonstrates that meiotic division is highly error-prone in the absence of maternal Pcnt and disrupted aMTOCs, leading to female subfertility. Importantly, a new study reports that human oocytes (obtained from IVF patients), lack pericentrin and show strikingly similar meiotic errors as our Tg mice. The experiments outlined in this proposal will use this unique genetic model to address the underlying mechanism(s) of spindle formation in oocytes. In Aim 1 we will test the function of key aMTOC-independent mechanisms that promote meiotic spindle formation. We will (i) establish whether Ran activity regulates spindle formation in Pcnt-deficient mouse oocytes and (ii) undertake the first studies to test if the Augmin complex-mediated MT amplification also functions to promote spindle stability in mammalian oocytes. Why human oocytes reportedly lack pericentrin and why aMTOC-independent spindle formation is unstable in oocytes is not known. Thus, experiments in Aim 2 will (i) test the hypothesis that essential aMTOC-associated proteins (pericentrin and ?-tubulin) are disrupted with increasing maternal age. Additionally, we will (ii) determine whether MT dynamics differ in Pcnt-deficient oocytes, leading to spindle instability. Knowledge gained from these studies will provide critical new insight into (i) the key functional mechanisms that promote meiotic spindle formation and (ii) whether disruption of spindle assembly/stability contributes to age-associated aneuploidy in oocytes."

"9233911","Virus infections of the liver continue to cause substantial human morbidity and mortality worldwide despite advances in vaccines and antiviral therapy. Hepatitis A virus (HAV), a positive-strand RNA virus classified within the genus Hepatovirus of the family Picornaviridae, is a common cause of acute hepatitis and a Category B NIAID Priority Pathogen. Our previously published research reveals that HAV infects the liver in an extraordinarily stealthy fashion, evoking little type l/lll interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene expression despite robust replication within hepatocytes over a period of several weeks. The onset of acute hepatic injury 3-4 weeks after infection is marked by impressive increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines simultaneous with the initial appearance of virus-specific antibodies and a predominantly CD4+ T cell response that correlates with resolution ofthe infection. Our goal in this project is to better understand how HAV is recognized by the innate immune system and how this may contribute to ultimate control ofthe infection. The proposed studies build on our recent discovery that HAV, classically considered a non-enveloped virus, is released from infected hepatocytes and circulates in the blood of infected humans completely enveloped in host membranes. These novel 'enveloped HAV virions (eHAV) are fully infectious but completely resistant to neutralizing antibodies. Our preliminary data show that gradient fractions containing purified eHAV uniquely induce human pDCs to secrete IFN-a and stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine and NLRPS inflammasomedependent IL-1B expression by THP-1 cells, while highly concentrated, standard, non-enveloped virions do not. In Aim 1, we will determine host factor requirements for activation of pDCs when co-cultured with HAV infected cells, and the RNA and protein composition of pDC-activating microvesicles in collaboration with Core B. We will also quantify pDC recruitment to the liver in hepatitis A. Aim 2 will study how eHAV is sensed by THP-1 cells and primary human monocyte/macrophages, and in collaboration with Projects 2 and 3 identify the origin of signals leading to inflammasome activation by HAV. These studies will exploit unique capabilities of Core C to provide purified recombinant NLRs for quantitative in vitro studies of their potential as direct receptors of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Aim 3 will define innate immune responses and the molecular basis of inflammasome activation by HAV in hepatocytes. These studies support the goals of this multi-project U19 application by leveraging unique biochemical capabilities to investigate the role of NLRs as novel pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), applying cutting-edge quantitative proteomic approaches to identify paradigm-shifting signaling pathways involved in sensing and control of human viruses, examining cross-talk between PRR pathways in the human response to a NIAID Category B Priority Pathogen, investigating intracellular trafficking of a viral ligand to the site of engagment by a PRR, and taking maximal advantage of opportunities to validate experimental findings with primary human materials."

"9395728","Project Summary/Abstract The continuum of HIV care has forced new focus on the urgency to identify and effectively serve high-need, under-resourced, and often transient populations to facilitate their receiving the necessary ongoing care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress HIV RNA viral load (VL). Crucial target groups for improving care along the continuum are young (aged 16-25), sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations being released from jail settings. HIV prevalence among incarcerated youth living with HIV (YLWH) is three times that of the general population and one in seven of all HIV+ persons experience incarceration each year. HIV incidence, prevalence, and incarceration rates are higher for blacks and Latinos than for any other group ? these disparities are especially prominent among youth. Furthermore, only an estimated 6% of HIV+ youth are virally suppressed, due to poor retention and adherence to ART. Existing linkage and retention services are insufficient to meet the acute needs of criminal justice-involved (CJI) HIV+ youth, particularly in the high-need period following release from incarceration. Moreover, because of their lack of experience, many youths may struggle to obtain needed services and stabilize their living conditions. Disparities in HIV continuum outcomes are inextricably linked to incarceration, substance use disorders (SUDs), homelessness, and mental health (MH) problems among YLWH. If HIV is to be controlled and the benefits of ART experienced broadly, the problems of CJI YLWH must be addressed with innovative, youth-, and sexual and gender minority (SGM)- sensitive approaches. We propose to enroll 240 CJI YLWH, aged 16-25, incarcerated in Los Angeles and Chicago jails and juvenile detention facilities. We will randomize participants to the YSN intervention (n=120) vs. a usual-care control group (n=120). The youth services navigators (YSNs) will assist with addressing immediate unmet needs such as housing, transportation, and food prior to clinical care and ongoing; will guide intervention participants to a range of community services to support progress along the continuum of HIV care; and will provide direct ART adherence support. The proposed study has two Primary Specific Aims: 1. Adapt an existing peer navigation intervention for adults to create a Youth Service Navigation (YSN) intervention sensitive to SGM culture that guides youth to needed services along the continuum of HIV care. This intervention combines medical, substance use and mental health care with comprehensive reentry support for CJI YLWH, aged 16-25 upon release from large county jails and juvenile detention systems; 2. Using a two-group RCT design, we will test the effectiveness of the new YSN, youth SGM-sensitive intervention among CJI YLWH aged 16-25, compared to controls offered standard referrals to services. We will evaluate the YSN Intervention's effect on post-incarceration linkage, retention, adherence, and viral suppression, as well as on SUDs, mental health, services utilization, and met needs. Secondary Aims: We will assess YSN's effects on recidivism, costs and potential cost-offset/effectiveness.  "

"9383283","Sepsis has its greatest impact in the prematurely born (preterm) population. Neonatal sepsis (sepsis within the first month of life) causes over one million deaths worldwide annually, and is one of the most common, difficult and costly problems to diagnose, treat and prevent. The preterm infant can suffer rates of sepsis up to 1000-fold higher than the full-term infant, and bears the brunt of the associated mortality and lifelong sepsis-survivor morbidity. Substantial clinical questions in the management of the potentially infected neonate remain unanswered: 1) Is the infant infected?, 2) Which infants have the greatest risk for a complicated clinical course with infection?, and 3) Why are preterm infants (especially very low birth weight infants) at such high risk of developing infections? The paucity of investigations in the preterm infant can be attributed in large part to very limited blood volume for study (80-100 milliliter total blood volume in a typical 28 week, 1000 gram infant), and prior assumptions that the neonatal host immune response is similar to that seen in older children and adults. We propose that deficiencies in innate immune function of neutrophils (PMN) in neonates are one underlying cause of this decrease in host protective immunity, and their function can be used to predict the development of sepsis and protracted clinical course. We intend to deliver accurate methods to diagnose sepsis, identify prognostic and critical illness stratification markers, and uncover immunological differences with the potential for translational interventions that may improve neonatal infection-related outcomes, all based on a novel microfluidics platform. Specifically, we propose a prospective, observational study of 300 preterm (<30 weeks gestational age) and 60 full-term (>36 weeks) infants in whom we will identify specific deficiencies in PMN function, develop prediction models for sepsis, and ultimately, clinical outcome, based on microfluidics measurements of PMN function and transcriptomics, and classical clinical measures. The project is enabled by several novel, validated, microfluidic technologies that are robust and easy to use with little training. These technologies provide comprehensive measures of the functionality of blood PMN population; a critical cellular component of innate immunity. We will also extract high-quality nucleic acids from microfluidic-sorted PMNs for transcriptomic analyses, and deliver a complete blood count with 5-part differential integrated with clinical chemistry and inflammatory biomarkers. Collectively, these techniques require a total of ~100 microliters (?L) of blood, which makes them particularly useful for preterm infants where sample volume is limited, and facilitates serial assessments with unprecedented temporal resolution of key functions of PMNs. These studies, integrated with bioinformatics approaches, will generate new tools for diagnosing sepsis in the newborn and predicting clinical outcomes. Such approaches have the capability to dramatically change the clinical management of the preterm infant, and potentially improve long-term outcomes while reducing hospital costs."
"9533062","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Chronic stress affects numerous brain areas involved in memory, emotion, and motivation, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex; it abnormally alters a variety of cellular events, including dendritic morphology and gene expression patterns; and, it can precipitate several maladaptive states, such as depression- and anxiety-like behaviors. Yet, the neural circuitry sufficient to mitigate or even prevent such phenotypes is unclear. In both mice and humans, the hippocampus has been implicated in storing and retrieving positive memories and in modulating stress-related states. Promisingly, the recent work of the PI has demonstrated that artificially stimulating cells in the hippocampus that previously were active during positive memory formation are sufficient to increase reward-like behavior and motivation. To that end, in this DP5 proposal, a novel experimental bridge will be built between artificially activated positive memories and animal models of psychiatric disorders. The recently developed virus system by the PI will be utilized in which the promoter of the immediate early gene c-Fos drives the expression of the light-sensitive ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 in a manner that is under the control of the antibiotic Doxycycline. In the absence of Doxycycline, learning-induced neuronal activity selectively labels active c-Fos-expressing neurons with channelrhodopsin-2, thus conferring activity-dependent and inducible labeling of, in addition to optical control over, hippocampus cells and their corresponding axon terminals. The experimental goals of this project are threefold and combine in vivo optogenetics, in vitro immunohistochemistry, and a battery of behavioral assays. First, the hypothesis will be tested that optically modulating a defined set of positive or negative memory bearing hippocampus cells is sufficient to ameliorate or mimic the effects of chronic stress at the cellular and behavioral levels. Next, the goal is to test whether or not activating memory bearing hippocampus axon terminals?which route distinct mnemonic information to the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens?can differentially modulate independent features of psychiatric disease-like states, such as social impairments, anxiety-like, and anhedonic-related behavior. Finally, the goal is to test if chronically stimulating positive memory bearing hippocampus cells prior to stress can prevent such maladaptive behaviors from precipitating, while subsequently performing a brain-wide anatomical and histological analysis to identify key cellular loci mediating memory's putative prophylactic capacity."
"9323533","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):  Visual attention is a general information gathering mechanism that is central to cognitive, emotional, and perceptual development. Visual scenes are cluttered with more information than can be managed at once. The role of visual attention is to organize eye gaze patterns in such scenes, thereby supporting the first step in information gathering, perception, and learning. Although the timing of the development of visual attention is understood, the explanatory variables that underlie its development are not well known. This project aims to characterize the variables that contribute to typical and atypical visual attention. Previous findings related to visual attention and computational vision lead to the hypothesis that integrity of visual processing is fundamental to the development of visual attention. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their at-risk infant siblings show both atypical visual and attentional abilities. We hypothesize that differences in visual attention in ASD are a result of atypical visual processing. This proposal will test this hypothesis in infancy when these skills emerge, and then from childhood through adulthood as these skills continue to refine. We will test our predictions using standard attention and visual function tasks, in concert with behavioral eye-tracking and neuroimaging methods. This work has the potential to provide a foundation for understanding what may be a pivotal and foundational disruption in behavioral and neural circuitry development underlying ASD."

"9335249","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Large defects of the craniofacial skeleton and extremities occur frequently in our Veterans and may result in functional deficits that require extensive reconstruction. Although autologous bone grafting is the current gold standard for reconstruction of skeletal defects, significant donor sit morbidity including chronic pain, infection, repeated surgeries, and prolonged hospital stays may ensue thus creating a significant need for alternative methods of skeletal replacement.  The success of tissue engineering for bone regeneration depends on the optimal interplay of scaffold technology, growth factors, and cellular material in a deliverable fashion. Two barriers to true clinical translation are the variable side effect profiles of exogenous growth factors delivered at high concentrations and the acceptance of laboratory fabricated bone by the host environment. Clinically, supraphysiologic doses of osteogenic growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic protein-2, are utilized as a supplement or replacement for bone grafting procedures. Although bone healing can be accomplished to a certain degree, untoward effects such as soft tissue swelling, ectopic bone formation, resorption of adjacent bone, and long term effects on maxillary growth have all been reported. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells can be induced to undergo osteogenesis on three-dimensional scaffolds. Osteogenesis was stimulated regardless of species (mouse, rabbit, or human) or the source of mesenchymal stem cells (bone marrow or adipose). In addition, scaffolds carrying osteogenic cells can be utilized to heal critical sized defects of the rabbit cranial skeleton. However, similr to studies from other investigators, the long term stability of engineered bone after implantation is limited by resorption over time.  In this application, we focus on delineating the osteogenic mechanism of a novel, nanoparticulate mineralized collagen glycosaminoglycan scaffolds that imparts efficient osteogenesis of both primary rabbit bone marrow stromal cells and primary human mesenchymal stem cells without additional bone morphogenetic protein stimulation. We propose to investigate the coupling of osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis in this system with both in vitro and in vivo cranial defect studies."
"9387539","PROJECT SUMMARY  Emerging research implicates iron deficiency in childhood externalizing disorders featuring deficits in attention and cognitive control, such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. In children, iron deficiency is hypothesized to contribute to these deficits as a result of iron?s critical role in the synthesis and expression of important neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine, in the functioning of the striatum, and in myelination of the frontal lobe, all of which have been linked to impairment in attention and cognitive control in ADHD. Previous research has largely utilized peripheral (blood-based) iron measures in evaluating these associations; however, peripheral iron measures may not accurately represent iron concentrations in the brain. Recent developments in neuroimaging methodologies now allow for non-invasive, ultra-high resolution maps of tissue magnetic susceptibility differences, which correlate strongly with tissue iron concentrations in gray matter. Only two studies to date have assessed the relationship between brain iron concentrations and disorders of attention and cognitive control in children via neuroimaging, with both providing preliminary evidence of reduced brain iron among school-aged children with ADHD symptomatology. The goal of the proposed project is to better understand the early developmental course of brain iron concentration in (human) children and its relationship to critical cognitive systems implicated in externalizing behavior problems. To accomplish this goal, we will recruit 40 children between the ages of 6 and 8 years, half of whom have a history of iron deficiency (measured peripherally) in infancy and half of whom do not. Participants will complete: 1) a high resolution neuroimaging study at 7 Tesla to estimate concurrent brain iron concentrations; 2) a blood draw to assess concurrent peripheral iron concentrations; and 3) a focused neuropsychological assessment to evaluate concurrent attention and cognitive control, as well as other cognitive systems (e.g., language and visual perception) which are hypothesized to be less impacted by early iron deficiency. In addition, participants? parents and teachers will be asked to complete ratings of behaviors associated with deficits in attention and cognitive control. This study represents the first use of anatomic imaging techniques to evaluate brain iron concentrations in young children, in association with early peripheral iron indices, to determine the relation between iron status and critical cognitive systems."
"9336829","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colonoscopy with removal of any polyps discovered during the procedure is used widely to reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Life-threatening complications of polypectomy include perforation and bleeding. Delayed (occurring at some point after completion of the colonoscopy) post-polypectomy bleeding can result in hospitalization, blood transfusion, and repeat colonoscopies to treat the bleeding site. Increased risk for post-polypectomy bleeding has been associated with the removal of large polyps, sessile polyps, and pedunculated polyps that have a thick stalk. Use of anticoagulants and co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, coronary disease, lung disease, and renal disease also are associated with an increased risk for post-polypectomy bleeding. It is now a common clinical practice for colonoscopists to place hemoclips (metal clips passed through the colonoscope to close defects in the colon mucosa) prophylactically after polypectomy, particularly after the removal of large polyps, in an attempt to prevent delayed post-polypectomy bleeding. However, few published data support this expensive practice, and there are no clear guidelines on when or how to perform prophylactic hemoclipping. When performing prophylactic hemoclipping, furthermore, colonoscopists commonly apply multiple clips to each polypectomy site. At a cost of $150 per clip, this practice can dramatically increase the cost of colonoscopy. At our VA Medical Center alone, we spend approximately $64,000 per year on hemoclips applied prophylactically. Despite the widespread clinical practice of prophylactic hemoclipping, only one randomized trial has evaluated its efficacy. Although the investigators found no significant difference in post- polypectomy bleeding rates between patients who had hemoclips placed prophylactically and those who did not, this study has been criticized because most of the polyps removed were small. The average size of those polyps was only 7 mm, and patients with polyps >3 cm were excluded. Such small polyps are unlikely to bleed, and are not routinely hemoclipped in clinical practice. Thus, the efficacy of the common, expensive practice of prophylactic hemoclipping of large polypectomy sites remains unknown. The goal of this study is to determine whether the prophylactic placement of hemoclips at the polypectomy site after the removal of large polyps (e1cm in size) will reduce the rate of clinically important delayed post-polypectomy bleeding. We hypothesize that this prophylactic placement of hemoclips does not decrease the risk of such bleeding. In order to test this hypothesis, we plan for a prospective, randomized equivalence study of clipping versus no clipping after large (e1cm) polyp removal. We plan to enroll 1622 patients (811 into each arm) into the study. We will include patients on anti-platelet agents and anticoagulation. Our primary end point will be to determine the frequency of clinically-important, delayed post-polypectomy bleeding (defined as bleeding within 30 days of polypectomy that results in blood transfusion, hemodynamic instability, or a drop in blood hemoglobin level of >2 grams per deciliter) between groups of patients who had polypectomy performed with and without prophylactic hemoclipping. Subgroup analyses based on anticoagulant use and polyp characteristics will be performed."
"9378353","Project Summary The Environmental Health Science (EHS) degree program at Western Kentucky University (WKU) is a comprehensive program built upon education and training in basic and applied sciences. The overall educational objective is to provide students the opportunity to develop a comprehensive understanding of the chemical, biological, physical and social factors or stressors in the occupational and natural environments that impact public health. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the program, the core EHS faculty collaborate on research within the program and with other academic disciplines, departments and programs both within the institution and externally. A core component of the program is engagement of faculty and students in research and/or practice experiences with an environmental and occupational health science focus. The courses offered are designed to meet the general requirements for evaluating workplace and environmental hazards by anticipating, recognizing, evaluating, and controlling stressors or factors that may affect the health, comfort or productivity of workers and the general public. This program responds to needs identified by our advisory committee members, area industries, consultants, and administrators, and is consistent with the existing inventory of classroom courses and laboratory courses offered at WKU. The success of graduates employed as occupational safety and health specialists, environmental health and safety specialists, industrial hygienists, and in closely related fields has established the credibility of the institution to offer this curriculum. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Training Project Grant (TPG) at WKU has specific objectives to enhance occupational safety and health, and related training through the EHS degree program. Primary long-term objectives are to support recruitment of students, provide training and professional development opportunities, advance the environmental and occupational health science field in Kentucky and beyond, and enhance the diversity of students in the program. Specifically, the program will provide stipends in the form of tuition scholarships to train six (6) students, or more, each project annum for the 5 year project period. Training though the EHS curriculum will allow students in the TPG to graduate with an environmental and occupational health degree. A broad goal of the TPG is to attract and retain minority students. The EHS program has seen an increase in minority student enrollments, both African American and Hispanic students; however, the relative percentage of minority students in the program is low. The administrators of WKU?s TPG believe that it is important to continue to be diligent and innovative in expanding opportunities for minorities to enter the EHS field. NIOSH TPG sponsorship of the WKU EHS Program will ensure opportunities and training that will promote expertise in the EHS field for the people of Kentucky and this region, so they may be adequately represented in local, state, and national jobs."
"9256996","Project Summary/Abstract Duke?s Superfund research center examines the problem of early life exposure to hazardous chemicals and later life consequences. Over the last funding period, Project 2 investigated the effects of halogenated phenolic chemicals (HPCs, e.g. bromophenols, OH-BDEs) on pathways regulated by thyroid hormones and examined effects on development in later life stages. We found that 6-OH-BDE 47 was the most acutely toxic HPC investigated (LC50=130 nM) in early life stage exposures to zebrafish, resulting in delayed development, loss of pigmentation, and skeletal deformities which was mediated at least in part by down regulation of thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR?). TR receptors in conjunction with multiple nuclear receptors (PPARy, VDR, ER) facilitate a highly coordinated and orchestrated series of events governing the commitment and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to multiple mesenchymal lineages including osteoblasts (bone cells), chondrocytes (cartilage cells), adipocytes (fat cells) and others. A theme that is emerging in this field is that early life toxicant exposures may alter gene regulatory networks that coordinate the balance of mesenchymal stem cell commitment towards adipogenic and osteochondral lineages. Here we expand upon our previous findings that exposure to select HPCs and AOPEs can lead to defined skeletal malformations through modification of highly regulated osteochondral and adipogenic transcriptional programs. We anticipate that the effects of HPCs and APEs on skeletal and adipogenic development may be occurring through TR and PPAR mediated pathways that converge on similar phenotypes. Here we test the hypothesis that early life exposure to HPCs and APEs result in adverse effects on both osteochondral and adipogenic development through dysregulation of TR and PPAR signaling pathways. We propose to investigate this hypothesis using human cell cultures (in vitro) and the zebrafish model (in vivo). Specifically we will evaluate nuclear receptor structure-function, use cell cultures to investigate effects of these chemicals on proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, and ultimately use the zebrafish as in vivo model to quantify effects on craniofacial and skeletal development and adiposity. Results from this project will help us elucidate cross-talk and compensatory responses of chemicals that disrupt both TR and PPAR signaling pathways. They will also provide a hierarchical framework from the level of protein to cell to whole organism through which we will link mechanistic insights for HPC exposures with acute developmental toxicities observed in a small aquarium fish model of human disease. Furthermore we hope to identify key chemical structures that might impart greater bioactivity. We anticipate our approach will facilitate a broader conceptual understanding of putative adverse outcome pathways for HPCs and help inform human and environmental risk assessments."

"9335727","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (AP5) AP5 supports the overall mission of this ICBG - discovering and developing therapeutic agents to treat invasive fungal infections and cancer - in several ways: dereplicating active compounds from bacterial extracts, discovering metabolites identified by genome mining, providing follow-up chemistry, housing the anticancer therapeutic discovery pipeline, administering overall group activities, and assisting in the development of both scientific personnel and research infrastructure in Brazil. These activities are embodied in four specific aims described below. 1. Identify and supply active molecules and derivatives to the antifungal and anticancer screening platforms. AP5 will speed up this traditional bottleneck by waiting for potency/selectivity data before beginning dereplicaton, using NMR techniques on partially purified fractions, and trying an new approach to high- throughput crystallography. 2. AP5 will also carry out studies to identify cryptic metabolites - molecules whose biosynthetic genes can be identified but that have never been characterized. AP5 will use two approaches: elicitor/co-culture stimulation and genetic knockouts coupled with differential metabolomics. 3. A high-throughput anticancer drug discovery pipeline that runs from primary assays to in vivo studies will be used to identify small molecules with therapeutic potential for blood cancers. These assays utilize 24 cell lines from 6 types of blood cancer, and all cell lines have been genomically characterized so that initial phenotypic screening results can reveal something about mechanism. 4.

"9334339","Associate Program 3  Project Summary The goal of Associate Program 3 is to use and further our understanding of the chemical ecology of coral reef organisms to better inform drug discovery and to provide new and more effective management options for conserving and restoring the diversity and ecological function of coral reefs. We will collaborate with APs 1,2, and 4 to apply ecologically meaningful stresses to species (activation, induction) to enhance the diversity or potency of bioactive metabolites they are producing. Our conservation efforts will focus on further determining the critical role that chemical cues from benthic organisms play in suppressing (seaweeds) or stimulating (corals) recruitment of corals and fishes that must colonize for damaged reefs to recover. We will determine which cuing species are most critical, the variance in response of fishes as a function of trophic group and taxonomy, and whether fishes and corals are responding to the same general cues. Collaborations with AP2 will attempt to identify some of the major metabolites involved. We will scale-up our laboratory and small-scale field experiments to test whether we can initiate reef recovery on scales of 100m2 on degraded reefs in 3 replicate villages on the Coral Coast. This will be accomplished via removal of suppressive seaweeds, addition of stimulatory corals, both, and neither. The recruitment, survival and growth of individual corals will then be followed as will the physical condition and growth rates of newly recruiting fishes. At still larger scales we will evaluate the influence of water-shed scale land use patterns (native vegetation vs introduced mahogany, sugar cane, or oil palm) on chemical cues affecting fish recruitment to adjacent reefs and whether the negative effects of agricultural crops are negated by runoff progressing through coastal mangroves. If so, this provides a management strategy for retaining both coastal agriculture and fishes. At smaller scales, we will conduct metatranscriptomic analyses of the coral host, its zooxanthellae, and its microbiomes through time following coral contact with allelopathic seaweeds to determine the roles of microbially mediated processes in the negative impacts of seaweed on corals. We will cultivate and investigate the roles of microbes from healthy versus stressed corals, test the effects of seaweed extracts on coral-associated bacteria, and assess whether commensal microbes chemically protect corals from microbial pathogens. If so, we will work with AP2 to further investigate the antagonistic interactions and the chemicals involved."
"9540153","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although age is the largest single risk factor for cancer, the molecular genetic basis underlying the interrelationship between cancer and aging remains largely unknown. Filling this gap in knowledge is important for understanding both cancer and aging. BubR1, a core mitotic checkpoint component that regulates proper chromosome segregation, has emerged as a key determinant of both cancer and aging. Mutant mice carrying BubR1 hypomorphic alleles (BubR1H/H mice) that produce low amounts of the protein accumulate aneuploid cells and are susceptible to tumors. These animals also develop various progeroid and early aging-related phenotypes, including short lifespan, growth retardation, cataracts, sarcopenia, subdermal fat loss, reduced dermal thickness, and impaired wound healing. Furthermore, mutations in BubR1 have been associated with mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA), a rare human syndrome that is characterized by aneuploidization, cancer, and several progeroid traits, many of which overlap with those seen in BubR1H/H mice. Importantly, BubR1 abundance declines in various mouse tissues with chronological aging. A ubiquitously expressed BubR1 transgene that prevents this decline preserves chromosomal integrity, reduces tumorigenesis, extends lifespan, and delays age-related deterioration of several tissues. The objective of this application is to resolve the molecular pathway governed by BubR1 and to determine how changes in BubR1 abundance alter the rate with which cancer and age-related pathologies develop. Based on persuasive preliminary data we hypothesize that uncontrolled APC/CCdc20 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that results from BubR1 insufficiency plays a central role in cancer susceptibility and premature aging, and that sustained levels of BubR1 attenuate the development of cancer and age-related disorders by maintaining proper control of APC/CCdc20. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims. In the first aim, we will determine how mechanistically BubR1 over- expression protects against cancer and aging. In the second aim, we will determine how uncontrolled APC/CCdc20 activity drives cancer and premature aging. In the third aim, we will establish the role of BubR1 kinase activity in controlling APC/CCdc20 activity, cancer and aging. The expected overall impact of the proposed work is that it will fundamentally advance our mechanistic understanding of a prominent mitotic check- point protein implicated in two major human health problems, cancer and aging, and will provide insight into how contrasting changes in BubR1 abundance alter the rate with which cancer and age-related pathologies develop. This knowledge will pave the way towards transformative clinical interventions for treating or preventing a broad spectrum of human cancers and age-related diseases that limit healthspan, in addition to conceptually advancing the fields of mitosis, cancer and aging."

"9279570","PROJECT SUMMARY Precision medicine is emerging as an approach for disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle. While some limited advances in precision medicine have been made in the field of oncology, precision medicine is not in broad practice. Precision medicine has become an initiative of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its partners. Development of methods of patient-specific biomarker imaging to guide and monitor patient-specific therapies will be needed to move forward this new NIH initiative. A trained physician-scientist workforce is key to taking advantage of these new developments. Precision imaging advances are interdisciplinary with technology innovations crossing the physical, computational, and biological sciences. These studies start with preclinical mechanistic inquiries using targeted pathology-based imaging and then expand into human subjects. Human studies include safety testing and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) and Device Exemption (IDE) process. The ultimate goal is to make research innovations widely available to the public and the entire practicing medical community through commercialization. Although this ?bench-to-bedside? process has been widely acclaimed, there remains a knowledge gap in the medical imaging research community as to how to take preclinical research into humans, and how to then take these innovations to the public. Moreover, clinical scientists ? residents and fellows ? often lack the understanding to navigate research regulatory requirements as well as the knowledge base to understand or perform preclinical research that will inform the mechanism of innovation. A completely new educational and creative paradigm is required to better prepare future imaging scientists for the challenges of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative. Interdisciplinary teams of physician-scientists must work together at the interfaces of biology, technology, and medicine, and physicians must be educated to work to bring innovation through the FDA regulatory processes, into human subjects and to the public through commercialization. In this application, we propose a model of education unlike any other for resident and fellow physician-scientists that will provide them with a two-year training program consisting of a) a required curriculum (year 1) that covers not only training in the ethics, regulatory and practical aspects of imaging research, but also a skill set for innovation translation, and b) dedicated translational imaging research (year 2) under the mentorship of highly-accomplished imaging pre-clinical and clinician scientists. With these needs and goals in mind, we are proposing TOP-TIER (Training OPportunities in Translational Imaging Education and Research), a clinician-scientist post-doctoral training program at Washington University (WU) in St. Louis to prepare resident and fellow trainees to bring preclinical imaging innovations into patients and to the practice of medicine."
"9327399","Project Summary/Abstract Rapid development of genome sequencing technology has led to dramatic increases in the discovery of the genetic causes of many rare disorders and has transformed our ability to diagnose and treat genetic conditions. In particular, whole exome sequencing (WES) has proven to be a highly successful diagnostic modality in patients with conditions having a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. As part of the Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER) consortium, UNC's project, ?North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next-gen Exome Sequencing? (NCGENES) addressed several key issues in the clinical application of exome sequencing, including the diagnostic yield when applying WES in diverse clinical scenarios, optimal approaches to dealing with secondary findings, the informed consent process, and responses of patients and families to genomic information. Due in part to the success of the CSER program, WES has become widely clinically available. However, before it can be widely implemented payers will need to be convinced to routinely cover the use of WES; thus, critical questions must be addressed regarding its clinical utility. The current renewal, NCGENES 2, will provide this necessary evidence base by bringing together a highly inter-disciplinary team to conduct a randomized clinical trial to study healthcare outcomes and communication among patients, family members, clinicians, and laboratorians. Moreover, NCGENES 2 will address these issues in traditionally disadvantaged populations to ensure that the benefits of genomic medicine will accrue to the broadest possible segment of the population. Each aim of NCGENES 2 will address specific outcomes that are highly relevant to the real-world implementation of clinical exome sequencing: 1) technical and analytic outcomes, 2) patient-centered outcomes, 3) clinical outcomes, and 4) societal outcomes, including economic implications. Ultimately, NCGENES 2 will generate the necessary evidence to support the use of WES as a standard tool in the management of patients with genetic disorders and enable its implementation in populations that experience health disparities."
"9329979","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In addition to their bone building properties, osteoblasts have been implicated in hematopoiesis by affecting renewal and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). More recently, osteoblast precursors have been involved in the fate of another stem cell, the leukemia blast. We have found that an activating mutation in canonical Wnt signaling in osteoblast precursors disrupts hematopoiesis in mice by altering the differentiation potential of HSC progenitors to the myeloid lineage and accumulation of granulocyte/monocyte progenitors. Concomitantly, B- lymphopoiesis is compromised. This phenotype is reminiscent of human myelodysplasia and eventually leads to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and early lethality. We hypothesize that stabilization of b-catenin in osteoblast precursors leads to AML development in a Notch signaling-dependent manner. Additional and independent events leading to oncogenic transformation of HSCs may involve chromosomal aberrations and epigenetic alterations. This application proposes to establish that osteoblast-specific activation of b-catenin is responsible for dysfunctional hematopoiesis and AML development. In addition, it will investigate the involvement of Notch signaling in mediating the leukemogenic properties of b-catenin activation in osteoblasts. Finally, it will evaluate the nature of the malignant transformation signal by examining changes in gene expression-regulation and the presence of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in the HSC population. These studies may identify the osteoblast, as a determinant of AML."
"9370631","Abstract  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) needs to be treated with devices that will be utilized with greater compliance by patients than is currently the case with positive airway pressure. To this end, we recently showed that increased inspired CO2 via rebreathing was effective in reducing most obstructive and central apneas in OSA patients. Then, our UW team of bioengineers, physiologists, and sleep physicians built a novel variable dead space rebreathe device?with no added positive pressure?which monitors breath by breath ventilation and automatically adjusts the rebreathe dead space volume to add or subtract the level of inspired CO2 depending on the degree of sleep disordered breathing. This approach provides the minimum effective CO2 dose needed in individual OSA patients to stabilize central respiratory motor output and to recruit upper airway dilator muscles, thereby treating obstructive and central apneas. We propose to determine the effectiveness of this ?Smart CO2? treatment as well as its effects on sleep state stability, sleep quality, and blood pressure in 15 moderate to severe OSA patients studied over several nights. We expect the findings from the proposed study to be sufficient to determine if the ?Smart CO2? treatment is a viable approach to OSA treatment worthy of testing in a clinical trial.    "
"9254654","PROJECT SUMMARY Project Title: Production Technology for Recombinant Intravenous Immunoglobulin Organization: GigaGen Inc. PI: David S. Johnson, Ph.D. Intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIg, is a pool of antibodies isolated from the plasma of thousands of donors. IVIg therapy is used for several indications, including B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), autoimmune neuropathy, and primary immunodeficiency (PID). IVIg sales are $9 billion worldwide and growing at 8-10% per year, due to an aging population and ever-expanding therapeutic indications. Conventional methods for IVIg production threaten continued expansion of IVIg therapy because of supply chain risk, impurities, and batch-to- batch variation. Recombinant IVIg, or rIVIg, could solve all of the problems with the conventional plasma product. However, until recently there has been no technology that could capture highly diverse native immune repertoires and recreate them in vitro. In our SBIR Phase I, we used our GigaLink? molecular genomics technology to build DNA libraries of natively paired Ig, and then express them in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to produce the world's first rIVIg product. In our corresponding SBIR Phase II Renewal, we take steps to further develop the therapeutic product by building a library that meets FDA guidelines, scaling protein production, and benchmarking the product against conventional IVIg. After completing this SBIR Phase II, we will have sufficient data for a pre-IND meeting with the FDA for the world?s first recombinant IVIg drug. Though PID will be the primary clinical indication for subsequent clinical studies, the drug could eventually be used for other kinds of immunocompromised patients, such as transplant recipients. Finally, our manufacturing approach could be used to combat emerging pathogens, i.e., for West Nile rapid response."

"9263943","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major focus of the study proposed here is to characterize the role of the ER lumenal chaperone, GRP170, on the quality control and trafficking of the Epithelial Sodium Channel (ENaC). ENaC is a heterotrimeric protein composed of ?, ?, and ? subunits. ENaC is responsible for salt reabsorption across the epithelia of the kidney and lung, and plays a critical role in controlling blood pressure and airway fluid volume. Defects in ENaC degradation are associated with Liddle's Syndrome and pseudohypoaldosteronism type I that result in hyper- and hypotension, respectively. ENaC is monitored by the ER quality control machinery and targeted for ER associated degradation (ERAD). ER associated degradation (ERAD) is the process whereby proteins entering the secretory pathway are subject to degradation when they fail to attain a mature conformation. In fact, even a large percentage of WT ENaC is targeted for the ERAD machinery. Many other disease relevant proteins can also become ERAD substrates, including CFTR (cystic fibrosis), AQP2 (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), and Pael-R (Parkinson's disease). The focus of this proposal on the role of GRP170 in ENaC quality control and trafficking arises from the following considerations. First, GRP170 is abundant and is a member of the high molecular weight Hsp70-like family of proteins. Second, GRP170 possesses two unique activities: GRP170 acts as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) for the ER lumenal Hsp70, and it acts as a holdase in vitro and binds to misfolded proteins within the secretory pathway. Third, GRP170 targets the ? ENaC subunit for ERAD, but has no effect on the ? and ?ENaC subunits. Fourth, in contrast to its effect on individual subunits, preliminary data suggest that GRP170 promotes the assembly and surface expression of the ENaC channel (???) in Xenopus oocytes. A Fisher Rat Thyroid (FRT) cell system will be used to investigate the differential effect of GRP170 on the monomeric versus assembled ENaC channel. FRT cells form polarized monolayers in culture, allowing for measurement of ENaC subunit stability, surface expression, proteolytic processing, and ENaC function, as measured by amiloride-sensitive Na+ short circuit current. These outputs will be quantified in response to knockdown or overexpression of GRP170. To further characterize the mechanism of GRP170 action on ENaC a series of GRP170 constructs with domain deletions will also be assayed. In addition to its role in regulating ENaC and therefore blood pressure, GRP170 function has been tied to other relevant processes, including insulin secretion, secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor survival, and programmed cell death. Moreover, GRP170 plays a cytoprotective role during ischemia and atherosclerosis. Together, understanding GRP170 mechanism of action will provide novel insights into ENaC function and associated disease states."

JH-BIRCWH will highlight three core strength areas of mentored interdisciplinary research with highly experienced, nationally and internationally recognized, senior faculty active in research related to women's health or sex differences, committed to supporting and sponsoring JH BIRCWH scholars. The 3 core strength areas are: 1) diseases specific to women (e.g. women's cancer and reproductive biology); 2) sex and gender differences in disease expression (e.g. immunology, neuroscience, cardiovascular and genetics); and 3) social determinants of women's health and disparities (e.g. violence against women, trauma, addictions and poverty). JH-BIRCWH Scholars will be provided 75 percent-protected research time for a minimum of two years with two Scholars from both clinical and non-clinical areas per year. JHU is committed to supporting the transformation of Scholars into independently funded, networked, and lifelong ethical investigators leading interdisciplinary teams to improve women's health by advancing our understanding of sex and gender differences and health concerns unique to, more prevalent, or with differential consequences in women."
"9325483","Abstract Despite a tremendous effort in basic science, clinical trials, drug development, and technical advances in radiation oncology, glioblastoma remains incurable and improvements in overall survival have been marginal. While radiotherapy is one of the most effective treatment options for glioblastoma it cannot control the disease over time. This led us to conclude that novel combination therapies are desperately needed to improve radiation treatment outcome for patients suffering from this disease. The studies outlined in this proposal make are base on a hypothesis that is backed by our extensive preliminary data and published data in the literature. Specifically, that radiation causes a phenotype conversion of differentiated glioma cells into therapy-resistant glioma-initiating cells (GICs) and that interfering with this process will increase the efficiency of radiotherapy. The three aims of this study will address this aspect of glioma biology using an innovative tool to track GICs and their progeny and make use of unique resources and expertise available at UCLA. If successful, results from these studies and in particular Aim 2 and 3 will have wider impact on radiation oncology as these principles apply not only to glioblastoma but many other solid cancer."
"9208643","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a type of heart disease characterized by poor pumping function. DCM is the most common cause of heart failure and is also the leading reason for heart transplantation. Many causes of DCM are unknown and the disease may be mild to severe. Optimization of the drug regimen for DCM may take months to years, with some patient refractory to treatment, resulting in progressive heart failure, heart transplantation, or death. Since the drug regimen for DCM treatment frequently varies from patient to patient, the current lack of a model system in the dish prevents accurate validation of treatment plans and prediction of drug side- effects. Current validation of long-term treatment in the laboratory employs traditional electrophysiology, both a time-consuming and destructive method for interrogating heart cell electrical activity. In order to trac the efficacy of applied drugs and detect potential long-term side-effects, what is needed is an engineered heart muscle (EHM) system that recapitulates the salient disease features of DCM and whose function can be both controlled and monitored acutely and chronically, precisely and non- destructively. To create this system, the candidate proposes (1) to create and characterize stem cell- derived heart cells that can be controlled and monitored with light, a technology called optogenetics; (2) to create and characterize optogenetic DCM-EHM made from these modified heart cells; and (3) to use optogenetic DCM-EHM to screen drugs that best mitigate the deleterious features of the disease. The candidate has a significant track record of research in optogenetics, stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and cardiovascular disease, and will expand his technical skills and career development activities by closely interacting with his faculty mentor, advisory committee, and collaborators in those areas. At the end of the K01 award, the candidate's goal is to successfully obtain R01 funding. Together, with full institutional support i a rich institutional environment, the mentor, advisory committee, and collaborators are fully committed to facilitating his successful transition to an independent investigator.

"9388279","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalization and one of the primary driving forces behind rising healthcare costs, is a complex disease that is a result of the interplay among multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors. Previous large-scale human genome-wide association studies to identify genetic variation underlying the heart failure disease spectrum have yielded limited insights. As part of my PhD thesis, we turned to a systems genetics resource, called the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, to characterize cardiac structural and functional changes under chronic isoproterenol stress over 3 weeks. We identified Myh14 as a top candidate for left ventricular mass hypertrophy. Using a genetically modified Myh14 knockout mouse line, we validated Myh14 as a novel modifier gene for left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to chronic isoproterenol stimulation. This proposal describes a five-year mentored physician-scientist training program to further define the role of Myh14 in stress-induced cardiac remodeling. We hypothesize that Myh14 is a negative regulator of hypertrophy. Based on prioritization using systems genetics and experimental findings, we have outlined a series of molecular biology, cell biology, and mouse genetics approaches to test whether Myh14 deficiency leads to alteration in hypertrophic, Wnt/?-catenin and FOXO1 signaling. The proposed research will provide fundamental insights into how Myh14 modulates stress-induced cardiac remodeling and open a new understanding of how common genetic variation plays a role in stress-induced cardiac remodeling. The outlined program will allow the candidate to develop a mastery in the functional validation of novel candidate genes in cardiac remodeling using molecular biology, cell biology and mouse genetics techniques towards the long-term goal of understanding how genetic variation modifies cardiovascular disease in humans. The intensive research plan will allow the candidate to embark upon this research project, while having the necessary mentorship and support needed towards the goal of maturing into an independent investigator. The aims of this project are aligned with the major strategic goal of NIH and NHLBI to improve our understanding of the molecular and physiologic basis of health and disease."
"9334336","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (ICBG) application aims to discover and develop small molecule drug leads from cultured marine microbes and diverse coral reef organisms collected from Fiji and the Solomon Islands. Drug discovery efforts will focus on four major disease areas of relevance to the United States and low and middle income countries: infectious disease including tuberculosis and drug- resistant pathogens; neglected tropical diseases including hookworms and roundworms; cancer; and neurodegenerative and central nervous system disorders. Screening in these therapeutic areas will be performed in collaboration with two major pharmaceutical companies, two highly respected academic groups, and various testing centers and government resources that are available to facilitate drug discovery and development. The acquisition of source material for this  program will be linked to biotic surveys, informed by ecological investigations addressing the chemical mediation of biotic interactions, and enriched using ecology- based strategies designed to maximize secondary metabolite production and detection. The program is heavily invested in microbial genomics, chemical ecology, the application of innovative cultivation methods and bioassays, sequence-based methodologies, and modern molecular and analytical tools as methods to improve the efficiency with which new natural products are discovered. The structures of all new compounds will be solved using modern techniques in analytical chemistry and produced in sufficient quantities for pre-clinical evaluation. The research activities of the four associate programs (AP1-4) are highly synergetic and emphasize training and technology transfer to the host country. The research maximizes the expertise of the program leaders to generate collaborative and highly interdisciplinary research objectives that transcend traditional natural product drug discovery paradigms. These activities are coordinated through the Central Operations Core and facilitated by the South Pacific Center for Drug Discovery and Conservation. The CDDC will work with marine ecologists to develop more effective strategies for reef conservation and to expand the Locally-Managed Marine Area (LMMA) program, which has proven to be a highly effective method to bring village-level awareness to the importance of conservation and the maintenance of healthy coral reefs."
"9398709","Aspiration pneumonia (APn) occurs at a disproportionately high rate in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) versus healthy age-matched older adults. This is of particular public health concern given that aspiration pneumonia infection is a leading cause of death in persons with PD. The development of APn is multifactorial with aspiration of material from disordered swallowing (dysphagia) without proper cough response being the main contributing factor. These findings reflect the fact that both swallowing and cough are sensorimotor behaviors, and thus require appropriate detection and scaling of a sensory stimulus in order to produce an appropriate motor response. The long-term goal of this research is to advance the management of airway protection deficits in patients with neurodegenerative disease in order to decrease morbidity and mortality due to aspiration related lung infection. The objective here, which is a critical step in pursuit of that goal, is to further specify the sensory mechanisms associated with airway protection disorders in order to advance the clinical management of these patients. In order to accomplish the objective of this application we have identified 3 aims: First, determine relationship(s) between airway somatosensation, reflex cough and swallowing function in people with PD, and how these relationships may change with disease progression, over time. Second, determine whether cortical processing of sensory information is associated with deficits in reflex cough sensitivity or swallowing function in people with PD, and third, to determine how the central neural filtering of airway sensory stimuli may relate to the development of airway protective disorders. We will accomplish these aims in 2 experimental studies. First, we will test the magnitude of respiratory resistive loads, in people with PD across a range of disease durations, and in a healthy control group. We will measure reflex cough, using a cough-inducing irritant (capsaicin), and swallowing function. We will perform these tests at 3 time-points, spaced 10-14 months apart, in order to determine the relationships between respiratory sensation, cough sensitivity and effectiveness, and swallowing function, and how they change with advancing disease duration. Next we will perform electroencephalographic recordings time-locked to paired respiratory stimuli to determine cortical processing of airway sensory information. We will measure the amplitude and latency of the sensory evoked potential peaks, and compute ratios of peak amplitude between the first and second paired stimulus in order to determine the degree of sensory gating. The realization of the proposed aims and studies is significant because it is a necessary step in our program of research that is expected to lead to earlier, more accurate identification, as well as targeted interventions for airway protection deficits in PD. Completion of this research is systematically important for our goal of maintaining adequate airway protective function in PD patients; the results are expected to directly impact reductions in health care costs, morbidity, and mortality related to airway protection deficits."

"9360613","Summary Our goal in this project is to develop a new class of electrical recording device that complements and piggy- backs on cutting edge imaging technologies. Whereas multi-electrical recording has provided detailed measurements of neural activity with high temporal precision, it is also invasive, provides relatively low spatial resolution, and provides little information about the identity of measured neurons. Optical imaging techniques, conversely, provide very fine spatial resolution, easing neural identification, but at the cost of significantly worse temporal resolution, and with the requirement of either chemical (through fluorescent dyes) or genetic modification of the tissue. In order to better bridge these two modalities, we envision developing untethered Microscale Optoelectronically Transduced Electrodes (MOTEs) which combine optoelectronic elements for power and communication with custom CMOS circuits for low-noise amplification and encoding of electrical signals. Each MOTE will be powered by optically stimulated micro-photovoltaic cells and will use the resulting 1-2µW of electrical power to measure, amplify, and encode electrophysiological signals, up-linking this information optically by driving an LED. MOTEs will avoid many of the problems associated with standard wire- and shank-based electrodes, where most of the volume of the implanted electrode, and so most of the tissue damage it does, stems from the long rigid shank that connects electrode sites to external electronics. To be most useful, MOTEs' photovoltaics will be designed to harvest power from optical stimuli of the same wavelengths and intensities as are used in stimulating fluorescence when imaging neural activity. Similarly, the LED used for uplink will be designed to emit light at wavelengths and intensities consistent with those detectable by a fluorescent imaging system. These choices will allow the both down- and up-link of optical signals to be handled by existing imaging systems with minimal modification. By employing a pulsed stimulation (as is used in multi-photon systems) and appropriately encoding and timing up-linked LED pulses, fluorescent and MOTE emissions can be segregated into adjacent sub-microsecond time bins. This combination of optical compatibility and temporal multiplexing will allow simultaneous imaging and electrical recording of neural activity from the same volume of neural tissue, using the same optical imaging and recording systems. This simultaneous, heterogeneous measurement capability will enable a much wider range of experiments and studies of neural activity than are presently possible."
"9324715","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): GATA1 is a transcription factor that is required for survival and maturation of erythroid cells. In the absence of GATA1, mouse embryos die from anemia in mid-gestation. In humans, GATA1 mutations are associated with a spectrum of blood disorders, including congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia, porphyria, and Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA). In the presence of trisomy 21, GATA1 mutations that delete the N- terminus lead to Down syndrome associated Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia (DS-AMKL). We recently demonstrated that a GATA1 mutant, which fails to bind FOG1 and is associated with rare cases of cases of dyserythropoietic anemia, fails to bind chromatin in the same manner as wild-type GATA1. This differential chromatin binding allows GATA1 to promote mast cell formation instead of red cell or megakaryocyte development. In a similar fashion, we have recently discovered that GATA1 molecules that lack the N-terminal activation domain, seen in both DBA and DS-AMKL, also fail to bind chromatin in the same way as full-length GATA1. Of interest, genes that are not properly bound or regulated by GATA1s include critical red cell genes such as Alas2, Slc4a1, and Klf1 (EKLF). In this grant, we will precisely define the requirement for the N- terminus of GATA1 in red cell development. Our aim is to discover how the GATA1 mutations that lead to expression of GATA1s in place of the full-length protein cause defects in the erythroid lineage and congenital anemia, including DBA. Our overarching hypothesis is that the reduced chromatin binding and aberrant gene regulation by GATA1s leads to impaired specification and terminal differentiation of red blood cells. Our aims are to: 1 Correlate chromatin occupancy of GATA1s with gene expression defects in primary GATA1s knock-in erythroid progenitor cells to identify key direct target genes that are dysregulated; 2) Investigate the consequences of the GATA1s mutation on erythroid specification and differentiation; and 3) Determine if loss of the N-terminus reduces the interaction with essential cofactors and in turn affects their chromatin occupancy. The research described in this proposal will greatly expand our insights into how loss of the N-terminus of GATA1 alters erythropoiesis and will benefit patients with congenital anemia and DS-AMKL."
"9334063","?    DESCRIPTION:  Almost a million people are ill from malaria each day while severe malaria disease claims the lives of 600,000 people each year. A rugged, portable sensitive and accurate method to diagnose malaria without blood sampling and using the reagents would be ideal and addresses the critical problem of malaria diagnosis in field or in asymptomatic cases. The MalariSense technology is able to make a diagnosis through the skin within seconds without using reagents or a needle to obtain blood. The device works by shining a short safe laser pulse that penetrates the skin to small blood vessels. The malaria parasite has a crystal inside of itsel that is able to absorb the laser energy to make a small vapor nanobubble that expands and collapses. The collapsing vapor nanobubble generates a pressure wave that is able to be detected by an ultrasound detector. Uninfected red blood cells are not affected by the laser and do not make a vapor bubble. The proof of MalariSense concept was demonstrated in animals and humans by shining a laser on the ear and detecting the sound pings. In this project, the discovered mechanism will be translated into a field, easy-to-use diagnostic device to non- invasively detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria infections in seconds, and to screen > 200,000 people per year with a single device with a diagnosis cost below 0.1$. This will be achieved through several connected activities: (1) Determine the methodology and specifications for the MalariSense technology; (2) Develop and prototype the MalariSense technology for field use; (3) Evaluate the MalariSense technology in endemic area, determine its performance and applications, and develop the platform for a global screening of malaria. The applications for analyzing mosquitoes, blood samples and small animals will also be developed and tested the ability to make the sensitive diagnosis of malaria through the skin opens up a whole new dimension to malaria diagnosis. The impact and applications are many. The ability to diagnose and treat asymptomatic people living in malaria areas will help greatly the strategies to eliminate malaria from regions. Another dimension of the device is the ability to enable the immediate global access and analysis of the raw data for the remote monitoring of malaria infection. The developed software, protocol and device will act as a platform for the future implementation of the global malaria diagnostic system to radically improve the malaria control and elimination in multiple settings. Just 1000 units will annually screen 200 million people to cover all current disease cases."
"9312855","Project Summary/Abstract The neuropathology of Creatine deficiency syndrome is not fully understood. We propose that Creatine has a novel role as a neuromodulator/GABA antagonist at GABA A receptors. The significance of this finding is that we will understand more about how GABA synapses are controlled in normal brain function. Additionally, to develop treatments for Creatine deficiency syndrome that is caused by a mutation in the creatine transporter, SLAC6A8 on the X chromosome, we have to fully understand its neuropathology. Symptoms include autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Other symptoms include delayed motor skills (walking, sitting), delayed speech/dysphasia, slow growth and individuals tire easily. Less often there are abnormal heart rhythms, microcephaly, midfacial hypoplasia and self-mutilation. The onset of symptoms occurs between 3 months and 3 years of age, indicating a window of opportunity for maximal treatment benefit. There are around one million people affected globally and as genetic testing improves the number of confirmed cases will likely rise significantly as under diagnosis in males, and in particular, females with less overt symptoms, is addressed. Currently, no treatment modality exists as creatine cannot cross the blood brain barrier or enter brain cells without a functioning transporter, thus hindering ATP production and metabolic activity in the brain. Loss of the functioning transporter makes creatine supplementation as a treatment ineffective. Importantly, brain cells do not have the ability to synthesis sufficient creatine for normal function, unlike the liver, pancreas and kidney. Creatine is an essential biochemical for ATP metabolism, acting as a phosphate sink in the form of phosphocreatine in brain tissues with fluctuating and dynamic energy demands. The main aim of the proposed research is to test the novel hypothesis that Creatine acts as a GABA antagonist at GABA A receptors. We will further test the ability of Creatine analogs, that have the potential to passively move through lipid bilayers without the need for a functioning receptor, to substitute for Creatine at the GABA A receptors. The longer term aim of our research is to identify high priority targets to test as Creatine substitutes in the SLC6A8 mutant mouse. It is thus important to identify molecules that can rescue both ATP metabolism and Creatine function at inhibitory synapses."
"9407904","ABSTRACT  The rise of multi-drug resistant pathogens, particularly ESKAPE pathogens, is a major public health concern. One effective countermeasure against such pathogens is novel antibiotics, but the rate of antibiotic discovery has been in steady decline. One particularly promising source of novel antibiotics is microbial species because most of them have never been cultivated or explored. This is especially true about marine species, specifically microbes living in association with invertebrates: such symbioses are known producers of bioactive compounds, these compounds likely originate from associated microbes, but only few of them are available in culture. We have designed and developed several proprietary technology platforms to grow and isolate such ?uncultivable? microorganisms.  These platforms are based on a simple idea: strains that do not grow in the lab can be grown in their natural environments if placed into small diffusion chambers. Cells inside such chambers, if returned back to the original environment, will be naturally fed by nutrients and growth factors diffusing through semipermeable membranes. This approach has resulted in the discovery of several new compounds, including teixobactin, an exciting new class of antibiotic that is active against resistant pathogens. This general approach can be used to grow invertebrate-associated, previously uncultivated microorganisms as well. For this project, we designed diffusion chambers that are flexible and can assume the topography of the animal, thus providing an immediate contact with the host ? and the compounds it produces. In preliminary studies, we validated this general approach by growing a diverse collection of novel microorganisms showing antimicrobial activities. Here we will capitalize on these advances and achieve the following Specific Aims.  Aim 1. Developing a method to grow and isolate novel microbial species living in association with marine invertebrates. We will use our new method to isolate 5000 microorganisms from 4 invertebrate species.  Aim 2. Screening for antimicrobial activity. We will ferment the strains from Aim 1 and screen them against a panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, prioritizing 100 strains for chemical dereplication.  Aim 3. Chemical dereplication of antimicrobial compounds. Using traditional separation methodologies, bioassay-guided fractionation, and high-resolution mass spectrometry, we will identify extracts with novel antimicrobial compounds and isolate these compounds into pure substances. We aim at discovering 1-3 novel compounds with low toxicity and a good spectrum of activity and potency.  The end products of this project, an innovative cultivation platform, a large collection of novel marine microorganisms, and a selection of antimicrobials they produce, will set the stage for development of novel antibiotics in the future Phase II application."
"9529879","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health problem. The prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes in the US is progressively increasing from 7.8% in 2007, 14.5% in 2010 and expected to rise between 24.7% to 32.8% in 2050. Diabetes is the most common cause of end stage renal disease, responsible for more than 40% of all cases in the US, and this number are likely to continue to increase unabated. Endothelial cell dysfunction is a central pathophysiological mechanism that contributes to diabetes and diabetic nephropathy (DN). Dramatic alterations in arginine metabolism occur in endothelial injury due to changes in the activity and/or expression of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and arginases. Arginase-2 is constitutively expressed and also inducible in endothelial cells as well as in kidney cells and, when elevated, can inhibit NOS activity/expression and induce endothelial NOS uncoupling, thus reducing NO bioavailability and inhibiting the NO/cGMP pathway. We hypothesize that arginases promote the development and progression of diabetic kidney damage. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that arginase inhibition will be effective in the primary and secondary prevention of DN. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that reduction in plasma arginine bioavailability contributes to the development and progression of DN. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that elevated arginase-2 in endothelial cells contributes to tissue damage in DN. Our experimental approach will use both whole animals (Ins2Akita mice and their wild type (WT) littermates, Zucker diabetic fatty rats), genetically altered mice (mice with complete absence of arginase-2 expression (Arg2-/-), and transgenic mice that overexpress arginase-2 specifically in endothelial cells (Tie2Arg2) and cultured cells (glomerular microvascular endothelial cells (GMVEC) and endothelial cells that overexpress arginase-2) to fully define the role of arginases in DN. An understanding of the interaction between diabetes and arginases may help to elucidate mechanisms involved in diabetic renal disease and lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to manage the disease process."
"9218801","The human-specific bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ngo) causes the sexually-transmitted infection gonorrhea. Ngo expresses outer membrane transporters to acquire iron and other metals in a TonB-dependent manner. In order to prevent microbial growth and infectivity, humans use high affinity metal-binding proteins to sequester essential metals, a phenomenon known as ?nutritional immunity.? Ngo subverts nutritional immunity by using dedicated transporters that bind to and remove the metals from human metal-binding proteins such as transferrin and lactoferrin. Our preliminary data indicates that two poorly-characterized Ngo outer membrane transporters, TdfH and TdfJ, enable Ngo to internalize zinc (Zn). Furthermore, we show that TdfH affords Ngo the ability to overcome Zn sequestration imposed by the innate immunity protein, calprotectin (CP), which is produced in abundance by neutrophils and macrophages and accumulates to high concentrations at sites of inflammation. We hypothesize that TdfH and TdfJ are Zn transporters that enable Ngo to overcome the growth inhibitory effects of the innate immunity proteins produced during inflammation. These studies are significant because knowing how Ngo acquires essential metals like Zn from the human host opens new opportunities for developing new therapeutics against `superbug' strains, whether they be targets for a protective vaccine or small molecule inhibitors of crucial transporters. The overarching hypothesis to be tested in the proposed study is that Ngo subverts nutritional immunity imposed by S100 proteins produced by neutrophils and macrophages by the deployment of outer-membrane transporters that bind to and relieve these proteins of their sequestered transition metal cargo. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1 will define the characteristics of ligand interactions with TdfH and TdfJ using crystallography, biophysical approaches to protein-protein interactions and mutagenesis to confirm interactions. We will also ascertain if ligand interactions are specific to human proteins, given that humans are the only natural host for Ngo. Aim 2 will define the nutritional and metal environment sensed by Ngo upon exposure to human immune cells and secretions, employing mass spectrometry and imaging techniques alongside bacterial gene expression. Aim 3 will explore how Zn uptake systems impact survival of Ngo after exposure to human immune cells and secretions that contain S100 proteins. These studies will utilize Ngo survival assays with macrophages and neutrophils, combined with real-time confocal visualization and S100 inhibition studies. Overall these innovative studies will provide an in-depth analysis of two new outer membrane transport proteins involved in Zn acquisition and will provide novel insights into the human environmental niches in which Ngo normally resides."

"9329998","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The obesity epidemic is a continuing and growing major global multi-scale problem. Designing appropriate policies and interventions has been challenging since obesity is a complex problem, crossing the following six scales: genetic, physiological, individual, group/social network, physical (built) environment, and societal. The overall goal of this proposed project is to develop the Virtual Populations for Obesity Prevention (VPOP), a software platform that can generate an agent-based model encompassing the six obesity- relevant scales of any metropolitan area that can help decision makers to design, evaluate, and test proposed (or existing) obesity interventions and policies. VPOP will bring multiple innovations by (1) being the first model to bring together and integrate the six different  scales that affect obesity; (2) including novel representations of numerous pathways and relationships; (3) leading to new insights and targets for obesity-control policies and interventions; (4) being grounded in an unprecedented breadth and depth of real- world multi-scale obesity-related data; (5) heavily involving decision makers in multi-scale model development to maximize policy-relevancy and translation of VPOP results into useful action; (6) developing new ways of representing and visualizing multi-scale results; and (7) transforming obesity-related data collection and decision making. Our multi-disciplinary team is led by Global Obesity Prevention Center (GOPC), which focuses on developing and implementing multi-scale systems science approaches, methods, and tools to address obesity, and brings together experts from the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC)/ Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Cornell, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). The proposed VPOP and our participation in Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group (IMAG), and Multi-scale Modeling Consortium (MSM) activities would substantially leverage our existing GOPC and PSC/CMU resources and efforts. This includes extensive field studies to provide a large and broad data set to help populate, calibrate, and validate the VPOP and forming a Stakeholder Working Group to guide VPOP development, testing, and implementation. Specific Aim 1 will develop VPOP, a platform that can generate a geospatially explicit computational model representing the six obesity-relevant scales for any metropolitan area. Specific Aim 2 will entail utilizing VPOP to generate multi-scale simulation models of two sample metropolitan areas (the Baltimore Metropolitan Statistical Area and New York City) to use to identify the key drivers of obesity in children and adults across the six different scales and determine which factors may be maximally sensitive to specific programs and policies. For Specific Aim 3, we will translate the VPOP- generated models to decision-making by working with key stakeholders, such as city policy makers, health and planning department leadership, healthcare administrators, clinicians, and third-party payers to test and optimize a specific set of obesity-control policies and interventions."
"9515237","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Redox biology is increasingly being recognized as a key signaling theme in the cellular physiology field. Research in redox biology is greatly hindered by the lack of methods for monitoring defined redox processes in cells and cell subdomains. This project addresses this technical issue by engineering genetically encoded redox biosensors that selectively report the localization and molecular dynamics of specific reactive oxygen species (ROS). The following four specific aims are pursued: 1. Develop genetically encoded superoxide (O2?-) sensors. 2. Engineer genetically encoded fluorescent probes for singlet oxygen (1O2). 3. Engineer genetically encoded fluorescent probes for hydroxyl radical (?OH). 4. Use the fluorescent toolkit to examine reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) in doxorubicin-treated tumor and healthy cells. The proposed work is expected to establish new capabilities for in vitro and in vivo detection of these highly reactive, underexplored ubiquitous molecules showing important roles in pathophysiology. We will also perform experiments to capitalize on the capabilities of our new fluorescent probes, in terms of multi-color time-lapse imaging and high selectivity toward particular ROS/RNS. We will use these new fluorescent biosensors to advance our understanding of the roles of ROS/RNS in the anticancer activity and the cardiotoxicity side effect of doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapy drug. The study may shine light on new strategies to reduce the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin without abolishing its anticancer ability. As UCR is one of only a few research universities in the U.S. that are also federally designated Hispanic-Serving Institutions, we will include undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in this project. The training they receive will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the STEM field."
"9528843","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The genetic dissection of complex and quantitative traits remains a formidable challenge in basic and biomedical research. Although the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a potentially powerful model system to address fundamental questions about genetic architecture, its promise has not been fully realized. In particular, there is a need to develop new tools to reveal insights into the fundamental characteristics of genetic architecture. To this end, In Aim 1, we will develop a powerful mapping population in yeast for the high-resolution genetic dissection of complex and quantitative traits. Specifically, we will create 10,000 progeny from a funnel cross among eight intelligently selected parental strains that captures a substantial proportion of genetic variation segregating in natural isolates of S. cerevisiae. Preliminary analyses demonstrate the power to map variants of weak effect and context dependent effects, such as gene-gene interactions, will be extremely high. Importantly, the large number of meioses will allow extraordinarily high mapping resolution, often at the scale of a single gene or smaller. All 10,000 progeny will be densely genotyped, allowing whole- genome sequence data to be accurately imputed. In Aim 2, we will develop new statistical methods for leveraging the inherent power of this experimental cross. In particular, we will develop new methods for detecting gene-gene interactions and predicting causal variants from heterogeneous sources of data. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use the experimental cross to comprehensively delineate the genetic architecture of a suite of biomedically important phenotypes such as antifungal resistance and biofilm formation. Overall, the mapping population and statistical tools that we develop will enable powerful and comprehensive insights into the genetic architecture of complex and quantitative traits, complement the development of complex crosses in other model organisms, provide new methods for the interpretation of whole-genome sequence data, and yield novel insights into potential therapeutic targets relevant to fungal pathogenesis."
"9329415","Administrative Core 7. Project/Summary Abstract The Administrative Core of the UAB Vision Science Research Center P30 grant performs an essential function in overseeing the overall activity of the scientific Cores, and making sure that funds are appropriately utilized to support the highest quality science in a diverse range of vision disciplines. Another major role of this Core in conjunction with the efforts of the Vision Science Research Center is to promote and actively foster new collaboration, and to provide support and guidance to new and less established investigators to develop and strengthen their research programs. Both the Core Director/PI, Dr. Pittler and Co-Director/Co-PI, Dr. Gamlin are NEI R01 supported and maintain active and productive labs. Their combined expertise in diverse areas of vision research, and now 16 year established strong working relationship, makes them an excellent team to lead the P30 grant. They will receive at least bi-annual input from an advisory committee comprised of both UAB internal and external NEI R01 grant holders and additional input from UAB P30 participants and others in a monthly open forum of all UAB vision scientists that precedes Vision Research at UAB seminars. Additionally, the quality of Core provided resources and services is measured by annual surveys and through interaction with faculty at faculty meetings and retreats. Support to continue two staff personnel with several years of administrative experience is requested to facilitate day-to-day operations such as ordering supplies, maintaining compliance and budgets, coordinating repairs if needed and assisting with document preparation and record keeping. Due to strong institutional support, secretarial/business officer support costs represent only 9 % of the total budget each year. The Administrative Core has an essential role in maintaining and coordinating P30 activities and keeping the Cores running smoothly and effectively."
"9329418","Research Programming & Computational Analysis Core 7. Project Summary/Abstract The Research Programming & Computational Analysis (RPCA) Core was redesigned in 2013 as a result of strategic task realignment within the existing P30 Core Grant to better align tasks previously performed in the Computer Core with current and emerging research needs. This re-alignment was brought about because of the increasing complexity of digital data, particularly laboratory-generated images in vision research, and the need to develop custom analysis routines to process, summarize and quantify those data. Custom image analysis and processing routines in particular are an increasingly critical component of vision research, particularly with the emergence of several new clinical and research imaging modalities such as conventional and adaptive optics optical coherence tomography imaging and volumetric microscopy techniques. In addition, a vast array of research data is now digital, necessitating the development of custom data management, filtering, and quantification schemes through research programming. The second longstanding primary function of the RPCA Core is to develop custom software interfaces for control of and data acquisition from new and existing research equipment. Much of this equipment is developed in house through collaborations with the Instrumentation Core, and custom software interfaces are a mainstay of instrument development, implementation, and data acquisition. Custom programming for data analysis and instrument interfaces is out of the reach of most investigators due to the high cost of competent programmers and the relatively limited need within individual projects. The third goal of this Core is to provide a full array of biostatistical services to P30 participants. The goal of this realigned Core is to offer researchers a comprehensive programming and computational data analysis service where custom analysis routines and stand-alone programs can be developed for individual project needs by highly trained personnel. This realigned Core anticipates moderate to extensive use from 9 of the 11 NEI R01-funded investigator/participants."

This goal will be accomplished through a broad outreach and education program involving our  four university-based programs targeted to workers and supervisors involved in Hazardous  Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) activities at cleanup sites, at  hazardous waste generators and TSD facilities, and those who handle or transport hazardous  materials in California, Arizona, the Pacific Northwest, along the U.S.-Mexico border, and in  Alaska and U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands. Over the five-year grant period, WRUC will train  11,115 hazardous waste/materials workers and supervisors in 640 courses for a total of 149,270  contact hours. The Consortium places a priority on reaching workers from underserved  populations across our region using proven adult education methods to impart knowledge and  skills to help workers protect their own health and the health of their communities. WRUC will  also develop new initiatives that respond to emerging topics of concern in the region: 1) A Safe  Jobs Safe Communities initiative that includes environmental justice leadership and new  modules and training to enhance the effectiveness of more protective standards for workers at  refineries and chemical facilities and for surrounding communities and 2) exposure of  vulnerable outdoor workers to extreme heat. Activities will strengthen the capacity of local  community organizations to train young workers by preparing program staff and instructors to  conduct courses on construction safety. And WRUC will enhance disaster preparedness for  workers at manufacturing facilities (?maquiladoras?) on the U.S.-Mexico border and for local  worker and community first responders in U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands. These aims will be  achieved through collaboration with a wide range of government agencies, tribal groups, private  sector employers, labor and community organizations, and environmental justice groups."
"9324261","PROJECT A   Although the locations and relative activities of recombination hotspots are crucial in determining patterns  of inheritance from one generation to the next, as yet we have only a rudimentary understanding of how these  parameters are determined. Allelic variation in PRDM9 now provides us the opportunity to remedy this  deficiency. The long-term goal of this project is to characterize the molecular and genetic mechanisms that  regulate hotspot location and activity. To accomplish this, we will generate a series of KO and knock-in mice  to assure that the only genetic variable will be the identity of PRDM9 allele being tested. Using this constant  genetic background, we will identify allele-specific hotspots and examine the role of allelic preference for  hotspot activation when two alleles are present in the same meiotic cells. Using genetically variable  backgrounds, we will also identify genetic modifiers of PRDM9 function.   In Aim 1 we will: (a) identify a series of PRDM9 allele-specific hotspots whose sequences will help clarify  the rules governing PRDM9 allelic specificity; (b) determine if there are autosomal as well as pseudo-  autosomal PRDM9-independent hotspots, and (c) test using mice as a vehicle for characterizing human  PRDM9 specificity. It is not possible to characterize the biological functions of human PRDM9 in depth using  human material, as hotspots controlled by the same PRDM9 allele vary over fifteen fold in activity from one  individual to the next, presumably from genetic variation at multiple other hotspot regulatory factors (4). Testing  the human allele also provides a useful control by comparing recombination in the presence of a drastically  different ZNF domain. In doing so, as outlined in the Introduction, we believe that it is important to assay both  the DSBs that characterize the beginnings of the recombination process and the genetic crossovers that are  the final, functional outcome. The two measurements provide complementary insights. If we want to  understand the functional consequences of recombination, we do best to provide descriptions of both the  beginning and end of the process.   In Aim 2 we expect to confirm the existence of allelic preference in the ability of PRDM9 alleles to activate  recombination, and then test whether susceptibility to this effect depends on the relative strength of the  hotspots themselves, and importantly determine if preference is mediated by the relative numbers of PRDM9  molecules present or their relative affinity for hotspot DNA sequences. These experiments have considerable  relevance for understanding the phenomenon of crossover homeostasis that operates within constraints on the  numbers of DSBs to assure a constant number of crossovers at each meiosis.   Finally, in Aim 3 we will test a variety of mouse genetic backgrounds to screen for the existence of genetic  modifiers of PRDM9 function with the goal of determining their molecular identity. PRDM9 cannot act in  isolation, and the goal here is to identify proteins that physically or functionally interact with PRDM9   The knock-in strains of PRDM9 alleles generated in this Project will be used in Project B Petkov and  Project C Hibbs.   Carrying out these goals has significance both for understanding the basic biology of meiosis and for its  public health implications, as failures of meiotic recombination and gametogenesis are major contributors to  human in fertility and embryonic lethality."

"9378196","Project Summary The workplace has a substantial influence on workers' overall health and well-being. Moreover, rates of workplace fatalities and injuries in Indiana are higher than the national average, indicating a particular need in this region. However, despite the fact that there is an unmet need for professional industrial hygienists, funding and support for occupational health and safety programs have been declining. Therefore, there is a clear need for enhanced support of graduate programs in industrial hygiene and occupational health and safety. Purdue University's graduate program in Occupational and Environmental Health Science (OEHS) is ideally situated to provide increased training opportunities for the next generation of industrial hygienists. The mission of Purdue's OEHS graduate program is to prepare its graduates to be professionals, leaders and researchers in Industrial Hygiene and related fields. This program has maintained ABET accreditation in industrial hygiene since 1997 and a NIOSH training grant since 1993. Since 2011, our faculty and students have secured over $3 million in external funding to support occupational and environmental health related research, published more than 45 peer-reviewed journal articles, and received more than 30 awards for their excellence in research, scholarship, and service. Graduates of this program have taken leadership roles in industrial hygiene, occupational health, occupational safety, environmental health, and related fields. Over the next five years, Purdue's industrial hygiene graduate program will endeavor to maintain its quality and expand its capacity for graduate student training. Increased activities to recruit and maintain students from diverse backgrounds will be implemented in the next five years. Our faculty are notable for the diversity and breadth of their expertise within occupational safety and health specialty areas including industrial hygiene, exposure assessment, radiation safety and health, occupational epidemiology, and occupational toxicology. Faculty and students conduct research related to occupational exposure and impacts of manganese and other metals; characterization and risk assessment of air quality, particularly exposures to nanoparticles; and radiation health and safety. Required coursework for our graduate programs covers safety and ethics, exposure assessment, physical agents, industrial hygiene measurements and instrumentation, safety engineering, ergonomics, ventilation and control technology, toxicology, epidemiology, environmental health, and statistics. The core curriculum utilize student activities that emphasize critical thinking, communications skills, teamwork, creativity and awareness of current issues in occupational health. Taken together, the combination of experience and expertise of its faculty and students ensure that graduates of Purdue's OEHS graduate program will become tomorrow's leaders in the field of industrial hygiene and occupational health."
"9320914","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many severe mental disorders with considerable disease burden such Autism Spectrum Disorders, Schizophrenia, and Major Depressive Disorder are characterized by profound social impairments. At present, there is little understanding of the origin of these social deficits, and efficient diagnosis and therapeutic options are lacking. Advanced molecular and genetic techniques make the discovery of specific neural circuits involved in social behavior possible, facilitating the development of diagnostics and novel therapeutic approaches specific to disorders with social deficits. We propose to take advantage of newly developed molecular and genetic tools to uncover and characterize the specific neural populations and circuits involved in parental care, a social behavior essential for the survival and well-being of the offspring. Male and female mice show either affiliative or agonistic behavior toward infants depending on prior social experience. In recently published work, we uncovered a specific subpopulation of hypothalamic neurons that are essential for the control of male and female parenting behavior. This finding provides us with a unique entry point to genetically dissect behavior circuits underlying parental care and their modulation by intrinsic and environmental factors. Using a combination of genetic and functional tools, we aim to characterize the circuit involved in parental behavior (Aim I) and uncover neuronal subpopulations driving agonistic behavior toward pups (Aim II). We will determine the functional role of these genetically defined neural populations and associated projections in parenting or agonistic behavior toward pups using cutting-edge molecular techniques by tracing inputs and outputs to genetically defined neuronal populations and manipulating their activity. In Aim III, we will perform an unbiased gene expression analysis to discover factors influencing the differential activity of the neurons and circuits associated with affiliative or agonistic behavior in males and females, and in different physiological circumstances."
"9385802","Project Abstract Racial disparities in cancer treatment may contribute to racial mortality disparities. The Institute of Medicine report, Unequal Treatment, and other research suggests that the quality of patient-physician communication during racially discordant (Black patient, non-Black physician) clinical interactions, which constitute about 80% of Black patients' clinical interactions, likely contributes to treatment disparities. Prior research, including our own, finds that these interactions are less positive and productive than racially concordant interactions; and patient and physician racial attitudes (e.g., patient suspicion of medical care Blacks receive; physician implicit racial bias) affect the quality of communication during interactions. Such racial attitudes are largely expressed through subtle nonverbal behaviors; however, prior research has not focused on these behaviors or examined the dynamic, reciprocal way they are expressed. This project will do this by examining nonverbal synchrony, or the coordination of physical movement; which research shows reflects pre-interaction attitudes and predicts participants' post-interaction perceptions of each other and affect toward one another. Thus, we will investigate nonverbal synchrony in both racially concordant and racially discordant interactions as a means to better understand racial disparities in clinical communication. Data will include: racially concordant (n = 163) and racially discordant (n = 68) video-recorded oncology interactions, patient and oncologist self-reported racial attitudes, post-visit perceptions of the interaction and of each other, as well as observer ratings of physician's patient-centered communication, and patient and physician affect and rapport. Aim 1 is to assess and compare nonverbal synchrony between physicians and patients in racially concordant and racially discordant oncology interactions using innovative software and analytical methods that capture the subtle and reciprocal nature of this channel of communication. Aim 2 is to determine the relative influence of nonverbal synchrony on patient and physician affect and communication displayed in racially concordant and racially discordant oncology interactions. Aim 3 is to examine causes and consequences of nonverbal synchrony in racially discordant oncology interactions. Aim 4 is to develop and test a model that links physician and patient racial attitudes to nonverbal synchrony and, in turn, interaction outcomes. This study is significant because findings will improve knowledge of 1) differences in nonverbal communication in racially concordant and racially discordant oncology interactions, 2) how racial attitudes are communicated during oncology interactions, 3) how this communication affects interaction outcomes, and 4) how subtle nonverbal communication contributes to treatment disparities. This knowledge provides information about communication in racially discordant interactions that can be used in medical education and evaluations of treatment disparity interventions. The study is innovative because it examines an unexplored channel of communication affecting interaction outcomes, using innovative methods to assess dynamic, reciprocal patient-physician communication."
"9407944","P6. Abstract The accessory protein Vpr facilitates HIV-1 replication in dividing T cells, ensuring orderly progression through the HIV-1 life cycle. The most remarkable Vpr phenotype is induction of DNA damage checkpoint and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, although the underlying details are the still elusive. There is compelling evidence that Vpr interacts with several cellular proteins that recognize damaged DNA, targeting them for proteasomal degradation via CRL4DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. While evident that, in principle, Vpr antagonism of DNA repair ultimately can be of benefit to HIV-1, the full extent of Vpr-mediated subversion of cellular DNA repair is not known. In this project, we propose to systematically explore the extent of Vpr's engagement with the DNA repair machinery, focusing on DNA repair pathways that recognize and process ?marks of damage?, introduced into HIV-1 cDNA during reverse transcription. We aim to discover and validate other specific DNA repair protein(s) that are targeted by Vpr, in particular those mediating the induction of DNA damage checkpoint and cell cycle arrest. Further, we will biochemically, biophysically and structurally analyze the interactions between Vpr and the already identified targets HLTF, MUS81-EME1, and hHR23A, as well as any new target(s) discovered in this project. Overall, our studies will define the extent of Vpr-induced changes in cellular DNA repair, identify specific DNA repair pathways/proteins targeted by Vpr, and structurally characterize the responsible CRL4DCAF1 E3/Vpr/target complexes."
"9357412","Overall: UCLA SPORE in Brain Cancer SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objectives of the UCLA SPORE in Brain Cancer are to contribute significantly to progress in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of brain cancer. These goals will be accomplished through multiple and diverse research projects involving mechanistic pre-clinical work and innovative clinical studies, with a particular focus on developing novel strategies to overcome the problem of treatment resistance. The broad, long-term objectives and aims of our brain cancer SPORE are as follows: 1) to investigate mechanisms of immune evasion following active immunotherapy, and develop rational combinations of immunotherapeutic strategies to overcome the immunosuppressive milieu of the brain tumor microenvironment; 2) to elucidate the alterations in metabolism associated with targeted therapy resistance, and exploit these metabolic vulnerabilities to induce intrinsic apoptosis of tumor cells; 3) to explore the concept of radiation-induced phenotype conversion of non-tumorigenic cells to glioblastoma-initiating cells as a mechanism for radiation resistance, and test new therapeutics to block such glioma stem cell conversion; and 4) to investigate the pathways of resistance to IDH inhibitors, and utilize novel epigenetic pathways to sensitize IDH-mutant gliomas to treatment. In order to achieve these translational research goals of our program, we propose four main projects involving: 1) active immunotherapy combined with immune checkpoint modulation for glioblastoma; 2) targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in glioblastoma cells; 3) inhibition of radiation-induced phenotype conversion to glioma-initiating stem cells; and 4) novel epigenetic treatment of IDH mutant gliomas. These translational research projects will be supported by shared resource cores in administration, biospecimen/pathology, neuroimaging, and biostatistics/bioinformatics/data management. Our program will also be responsive to SPORE themes by incorporating Developmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs in order to foster new approaches for assessing and treating brain cancer. Our diverse array of novel projects and state-of-the-art cores will likely make a significant impact on brain cancer patient care. Each project has been developed jointly by teams of basic and clinical researchers working together in a trans-disciplinary manner to address the most vexing problem in brain cancer ? the development of treatment resistance. All four projects are highly translational and will reach human endpoints within the context of this SPORE grant period."

The focus of the new research to be specifically supported by this K24 is incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A long-standing underlying theme of Dr. Hsu's research has been chronic kidney disease (CKD), including the transition from CKD to ESRD, which leads to his current interest in incident ESRD. This proposal addresses how we currently characterize new ESRD patients, how the reported number of new ESRD cases may be heavily influenced by threshold to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and how early outcomes among incident ESRD patients are related to pre-ESRD clinical events. Aim 1: To determine the accuracy of how incident ESRD patients are currently characterized. Aim 2: To quantify how the number of incident ESRD patients vary by the threshold and timing of initiation of chronic dialysis. Aim 3: To better understand early outcomes among incident ESRD patients, including early death and recovery, and how they are related to pre-ESRD clinical events.

"9406904","Novel monobody therapy for pancreatic cancer Abstract The current work is based on the hypothesis that harnessing specific, basic elements of TCR/CD3 signaling can enhance anti-cancer T cell responses. T cell stimulation by antigen induces a conformational change in the CD3 complex associated with the TCR (CD3?c), the earliest molecular event marking productive TCR/CD3 triggering. CD3?c is necessary but not sufficient for optimal CD3 signaling, which additionally requires receptor cross-linking. As a consequence of CD3?c, a cryptic proline-rich sequence (PRS) in the cytoplasmic domain of CD3? becomes exposed to interact with adaptor proteins like Nck that contribute to CD3 signaling. Generation of CD3?c only results from exposure to strong antigens, but not to poorly immunogenic antigens, like most tumor associated antigens (TAAs). We recently discovered that a monovalent Fab fragment (Mono-Fab) that binds CD3 can induce CD3?c without inducing receptor cross-linking and intrinsic signal transduction. Such a Mono-Fab can enhance T cell responses to weak antigens in vitro and in vivo, an effect we call T cell ?co- potentiation?. Mono-Fabs combined with checkpoint inhibition stimulate remarkable anti-tumor responses in mouse models. Fabs suffer from short serum half-life and production issues making them less than ideal for clinical development. To address these problems we will construct a monobody form of a humanized anti-CD3? antibody. During this Phase I project, we will rank-order a panel of humanized anti-human CD3 monobodies and evaluate their activity in vitro and in an animal model of pancreatic cancer both alone and in combination with anti-PD-1. In Phase II, the lead construct and a back-up will be further evaluated in tumor models followed by IND-enabling studies to support clinical development of this novel therapeutic modality. A successful outcome of this work will provide a novel cancer therapy suitable for combination with chemotherapies and other immunotherapeutic agents, and likely to enhance many other approaches."
"9328172","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The C9ORF72 GGGGCC repeat expansion associated with familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (c9ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (c9FTD) and combined presentations of ALS with frontotemporal dementia (c9FTD/ALS) is the most common cause of familial ALS, ALS-FTD and FTD identified to date, and is reported in about 6% of sporadic ALS and FTD. The causes of phenotypic variability in c9ALS are not established. Wide ranging clinical expression of c9ALS is a challenge to elucidating the pathogenesis of the repeat expansion, as genotype-phenotype correlation calls for molecular genetic data and correlative clinical data in manifesting carriers of the repeat expansion and asymptomatic mutation carriers. Similarly, studies of disease pathogenesis using patient-derived biospecimens, including skin fibroblasts and assessment of postmortem neuropathology, require detailed clinical phenotypic data in order to associate biospecimen-derived data with clinical expression of disease. Studies in this P01 to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of c9ALS will require ascertainment of patients with c9ALS, their extended family members who carry the C9ORF72 repeat expansion, and appropriate comparison groups with collection of clinical data, biospecimens and post mortem tissue. In order to identify symptomatic and asymptomatic C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers for collection of longitudinal clinical data and biospecimens for Project 1, to provide clinical data and biospecimens of c9ALS and ALS patients with normal C9ORF72 repeat length for in vitro studies of disease mechanisms in Project 2, and to provide clinical data and post mortem tissue for investigation of the neuropathology of c9ALS in Project 3 the goals of Core B are: to identify for Project 1 at least 50 probands with c9ALS, and at least 10 ALS patients with normal C9ORF72 repeat length (c9(-)ALS) (Aim 1); through genealogic studies of c9ALS probands and c9(-)ALS patients ascertained in Aim 1 identify for Project 1 the following 3 categories of first, second and third degree blood relatives without symptoms of ALS or dementia: 1) at least 50 c9ALS relatives carrying the C9ORF72 repeat expansion; 2) at least 5 c9ALS blood relatives who do not carry the repeat expansion; and 3) at least 5 blood relatives of c9(-)ALS patients (Aim 2); collect as called for in Project 2 single time point biospecimens including skin tissue from 1) at least 10 patients with c9ALS and 2) at least 10 c9(-)ALS patients ascertained through Aim 1 (Aim 3); and, offer all study subjects participation in our deeded autopsy program, and for those who die during the course of the project, conduct autopsies to harvest brain, spinal cord and other tissues in support of Projects 1 and 3."
"9325003","CORE B: ANIMAL CARE CORE ABSTRACT (CORE B) The Animal Care Core (Core B) provides project support for animal care and housing, importation, in vivo procedural sampling, and animal model creation for the MMPC-UCD. The Core accomplishes this through importation and acclimation of mice with minimal delay and reduced quarantine. The Core has access to and oversight of a dedicated in vivo Phenotyping Facility and associated state-of-the-art vivaria, including a high- containment ?approved vendor-status? barrier vivarium. In addition, the Core has primary access to a new, UCD Gnotobiotic Mouse Research Center (GMRC). The Core provides numerous scientific support services as well, including rederivation and creation of genetically-modified mutant mice, re-animation of a variety of models cryopreserved within the KOMP or MMRRC repositories. These new and extant mouse models can then be bred to produce male and female cohorts for in vivo and in vitro phenotyping, including rederivation into the GMRC for gut microbiome studies. The Core also operates a Microsurgery Suite for creating surgically-manipulated mouse models, such as bariatric surgical models. The Core can produce for researchers cohorts of mice that have undergone Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG) and Roux en Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) bariatric procedures. Upon request from users, the Core can work with the other Phenotyping Cores to provide testing, manipulation, and sampling of these models. In addition, the Core can ship these surgically-manipulated models as well as any genetically-engineered mouse lines to requesting investigators from our approved vendor barrier vivarium, facilitating direct entry into the recipient institution's vivarium. This ensures minimal delay for investigators for receipt and use of these animal models at their institution. The Core also provides ancillary services and procedures, including blood sampling for in vivo testing for glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests, which are then sent to the Phenotyping Cores (e.g., Core C, Endocrinology and Metabolism Core) for analysis. The Core can also provide telemetry implantation and indwelling catheter placement for continuous blood sampling. The Core is supported by two trained laboratory animal veterinarians, three trained rodent surgical technicians, one import/export coordinator, and two phenotyping technicians. In these ways, the Animal Care Core is uniquely qualified to support the varied in vivo needs of MMPC-UCD users to meet their specific needs, from rapid importation and testing, genetically- engineered and genome-edited (Cas9) mouse lines, bariatric and other surgically-manipulated models, specialized housing under barrier conditions for direct shipping to investigators, and maintenance under gnotobiotic conditions for microbiome manipulation."
"9234485","Project Summary ? Project 3  There is an urgent need to develop and validate novel pre-clinical models of human diarrheal diseases.  Recently, human intestinal enteroid (HIE) cultures have been created to accelerate in vitro investigations of  intestinal pathophysiology and to discover new therapies. These human adult stem cell derived cultures are  more physiologically faithful than monolayer cell culture or animal models, but their application to study a large  variety of intestinal commensals and enteropathogens is limited. The apical sides of epthelial cells in HIEs are  not easy for pathogens to access since they are located in the interior. In addition, current HIE culture systems  lack the ability to apply mechanical stimulation, which is physiologically relevant. Further, the main scaffold  material used to grow enteroids is Matrigel, which is softer mechanically than actual biological tissues.  Project 3 involves a collaborative goal to develop tailored biomaterial platforms for HIEs that can be  mechanically stimulated and that will promote cell and tissue polarity as well as differentiation through the  villus-crypt axis. The development of new HIE platforms will facilitate enteropathogen infection of cells, and  allow physiologic study of interactions of endothelium with the microbiome, inflammatory cells, or the sub-  endothelial intestinal tissue. These will also provide new models for future testing of drugs that can access the  apical side of the epithelium. These engineered platforms will be opportunities for synergistic interactions  between projects and cores of the overall proposal; screen-based analyses of the biology of commensal-  stimulated or viral/bacterial pathogen-stimulated intestinal epithelium will reveal information about critical cell-  matrix interactions that can be incorporated into the biomaterial platform, and as the various biomaterial  platforms are developed, they can be implemented within Projects 1-2. These platforms are also planned to  integrate with ubiquitous equipment to facilitate broad distribution to infectious disease labs.  Our collaborative team brings together expertise with native and synthetic biomaterials as scaffolds to direct  cell behavior, developing experimental frameworks for mechanically stimulating cells and tissues, promoting  vasculogenesis in engineered tissues, and culturing HIEs. We propose the following specific aims:  1. To examine the roles of independent, physiologically relevant mechanical cues on HIE culture, epithelial  cell differentiation, and pathogenic infection within HIEs, we will culture HIE fragments atop and within  collagen/Matrigel hydrogels and employ mechanical stimulation bioreactors to impose cyclic stretch and shear.  2. To develop a tailored, anatomically faithful model for the intestinal epithelium, we will generate synthetic  biomaterial platforms that drive the formation of a polarized epithelium differentiated through the villus-crypt  axis, and systematically investigate the roles of adhesive ligands, topography, and substrate stiffness.  3. To determine how other villus cells promote epithelial cell differentiation and function within intestinal  culture models, we will encapsulate mesenchymal and microvascular cells within the biomaterial platform."

"9278133","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a prevalent familial cancer syndrome affecting 1 in 3500 individuals worldwide. The most commonly lethal feature associated with NF1 is malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). These soft tissue sarcomas are highly aggressive and frequently metastasize. Despite radiation and chemotherapy, inoperable tumors rapidly progress and are universally lethal. As such, identifying effective treatments for MPNST is critical. The primary goal of this application is to establish a robust preclinical/clinical pipeline (bench-to-bedside and back) to rapidly develop and test new (combination) therapies for this deadly malignancy. This effort will harness the specialized expertise of clinical investigators at the NCI and Children's National Medical Center, extramural experts in NF1 biology and therapeutic development, and will leverage the unique resources of the NIH Clinical Center. Specifically, new discoveries of mechanisms that drive NF1-related tumorigenesis together with recent insights into the immunoreactivity of MPNST will be used to develop rational combination therapies and will be tested in a robust preclinical MPNST mouse model (Karen Cichowski, BWH, extramural preclinical center). These insights will then be used to perform clinical trials in MPNST patients with an emphasis on evaluating more than one combination therapy within the same trial. This will allow for more timely identification of active agents, and allow patients with this highly refractory disease to have mor treatment options available to them (Brigitte Widemann, NCI, intramural clinical center). Furthermore, the preclinical to clinical translation will be complemented by comprehensive genomic and immunological analyses of tumor samples obtained prior to treatment and on treatment with novel agents in order to identify mechanisms of response and resistance and to identify additional potential targets for therapy in individual patients. As such, insight and samples from the clinic will serve as the foundation to develop new or improve existing therapies, thus highlighting the iterative and collaborative nature of this pipeline. Taken togethe, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of basic and clinical scientists from different fields to develop and translate promising therapies for individuals with MPNST. This effort includes experts in NF1 biology and therapeutic development, cancer immunobiologists, a diverse set of clinicians with expertise in MPNST and immunotherapy, and genomicists. Importantly, a subset of these investigators already have a track record of working together to develop new trials for MPNST patients. This grant will allow more effective and rapid translation of promising new therapies for MPNST, and will expand the type of (combination) therapies that are developed, by bringing in additional expertise and leveraging the unique resources of the Clinical Center. Ultimately, these studies have the potential to change the standard of care for the currently treatment refractory tumors associated with the common familial cancer syndrome NF1."
"9393119","ABSTRACT  Recently, the revolutionary technology of super localization microscopy in the optical imaging domain has been translated into the medical ultrasound domain. By localizing the centers of scattering contrast agents, a similar ultrasound localization microscopy technique, also referred to as contrast enhanced super-resolution (CESR) imaging, has been demonstrated with ultrasound. This novel technique enables imaging of microvessels at resolutions as small as ten micrometers, over an order of magnitude smaller than the ultrasound diffraction limit, and at depths much greater than traditionally limited by frequency. In order to achieve advances in all three of these seeming paradoxical dimensions - super-resolution contrast imaging requires that thousands of frames of data to be analyzed, making this technique much slower than standard ultrasound imaging. The result is that super-resolution imaging would be difficult if not impossible to translate to the clinic in its current form with current clinical hardware, especially if 3-D imaging is desired (which it is for microvascular morphological analysis), as a single 3-D image volume would take tens of minutes to acquire.  However, there is a solution to this, which our group proposes to achieve in this project. Recent advances in ultrasound hardware have enabled ultra-high frame rate processing. Our academic and clinical teams at UNC Chapel Hill are partnering with Verasonics, Inc, a world leading industrial partner in next-generation ultrasound systems, to develop and translate the first high-frame rate 3-D super resolution imaging modality to the clinic. We will do this by first designing and constructing a 1024 channel ultra-high frame rate ultrasound system, designed to operate with a 32x32 matrix transducer. Ultra-fast processors, large RAM buffers, GPUs, and high- bandwidth data transfer hardware will be utilized to handle the massive data acquisition and processing. New software and implementation approaches designed at UNC, including our innovative adaptive multi-focus beamforming approach, will further increase sensitivity and resolution at clinically relevant depths, and enable full 3-D volume acquisitions at volume frame rates over 5000 FPS, suitable for fast 3-D super-resolution imaging in humans. Our approach will be validated in phantoms, rodent models of human disease, and in two different clinical applications where ultrasound specificity is limited, breast, and thyroid.  Our motivation is to develop super-resolution imaging as a novel new approach for imaging angiogenesis ? one of the hallmarks of cancer, as a new biomarker target for both diagnostics and assessment of response to therapy. The ability to differentiate lesions based on microvascular fingerprint, rather than tumor anatomy, would be a paradigm shift in ultrasound diagnostics, and will improve the specificity of ultrasound to malignancy, and advance clinically needed in breast, prostate, thyroid, and other oncological applications. However, the advancement of the proposed technology will undoubtedly open doors to other clinical applications as well, such as wound healing and vasa vasorum imaging in atherosclerosis."

"9379329","Project Summary/Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to understand how information is processed in neuronal circuits. Ultimately, we would like to understand the relationship between circuit structure and network function. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of networks in the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuron?s function is fundamentally dependent on how it is connected within its network, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How can we get a handle on such a complex computational machine? Recent advances in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and cellular physiology. The cerebellum is an excellent system to validate our novel platform as part of a systematic effort to reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently described to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to validate our next-generation large-scale EM platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently developed in our lab to a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit organization and may help us determine the role of specific circuit elements in neurodegenerative disorders."
"9377619","Abstract Genome maintenance in the germline is vital for fertility and the health of offspring. Although DNA damage response (DDR) and repair has been well characterized in meiocytes, the DDR pathway(s) that function in primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are the precursors to sperm and eggs, have not been identified. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genomic instability syndrome associated with PGC depletion and infertility in addition to some other devastating clinical manifestations such as bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition. The FA pathway is a major DDR pathway known to function in double-strand DNA break repair. The signaling mechanisms underlying PGC depletion and infertility in FA patients or mouse models are not known. We recently developed Flag- and hemagglutinin-tagged Fancd2 knock-in mice that allowed a high throughput mass spectrometry approach to search for Fancd2-binding proteins in different mouse organs. In addition to DDR partners, we observed several proteins of the germ-cell-specific Prmt5/piRNA pathways orchestrating the repression of transposable elements (TEs). Deletion of Fancd2 resulted in decreased protein levels of the Prmt5/piRNA factors, massive upregulation of TEs, PGC depletion, and led to defective spermatogenesis and oogenesis in Fancd2-null (Fancd2-KO) mice. These preliminary studies suggest that in addition to its well-established DNA repair roles, Fancd2 and the FA pathway has an in vivo TE silencing function in early-stage germ cells. We hypothesize that the FA pathway is essential for germline integrity involving a pathway hierarchy in which the FA core signals to Fancd2, which then guides Prmt5 and piRNA in TE silencing. The goals of the project are to establish functional interaction between the FA pathway and germ cell- specific TE silencing machinery in safeguarding the germline genome, and to define Fancd2 as a crucial regulator of this vital epigenetic programming during germ cell development.  The project presents an innovative study aimed at linking a major DDR pathway to germline genome maintenance in early-stage germ cells. The knowledge gained from the proposed study will not only improve mechanistic understanding of the molecular collaboration between the FA DDR pathway and the Prmt5/piRNA pathway in the context of TE repression, but also lead to a new avenue of research designed to target these interacting pathways for developing innovative therapeutic strategies for reproductive diseases such as infertility and birth defects."
"9236417","ABSTRACT: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a permanent dilation of the abdominal aorta with over 80% mortality after rupture. The current therapy is restricted to surgical repair, highlighting the need to explore mechanic insights into the development of effective, non-surgical therapeutics. In AAA patients, structural integrity of the aortic wall is disrupted due to dissociation of smooth muscle cell (SMC) contractile filaments from extracellular matrix by proteases. This association is mediated by cytoskeletal linker proteins. However, the mechanism underlying loss of vessel wall structural integrity in AAA formation is not understood. Recently, using Angiotensin II (AngII)-induced animal model of AAA, we found a profound increase in protein and activity of aortic calpain, a calcium dependent cysteine protease in aneurysmal tissue. In addition, calpain inhibition significantly attenuated AngII-induced AAA formation. Calpains are the only known proteases targeting an array of cytoskeletal proteins that maintain structural integrity of the aorta, including filamin. Using calpain-1 or -2, the two major ubiquitous isoform-specific deficient mice, we determined that genetic deficiency of calpain-2, but not calpain-1, completely blunted AngII-induced AAA formation. Calpain-2 deficiency attenuated AngII- induced fragmentation of cytoskeletal proteins, filamin A, and talin. Immunostaining of human and mouse AAA revealed expression of calpain-2 protein by infiltrated macrophages and aortic adventitial fibroblasts (AoAFs). Macrophage specific calpain-2 deficiency in mice had no influence on AngII-induced AAA formation, which suggest a critical role for vessel wall mainly AoAFs derived-calpain-2. In cultured AoAFs, AngII promotes ASK-1/ NF-kB mediated inflammatory cytokine induction via activation of calpain-2. Further, calpain-2 silencing suppressed (myo)fibroblast differentiation and migration via TGF-? / Rho kinase signaling. Based on the described background, we will test the hypothesis that calpain-2 activation promotes AngII-induced AAAs by accelerating adventitial fibroblast-derived NF-kB/ASK-1 mediated adventitial inflammation, and (myo)fibroblasts migration to aortic media, which in turn causes medial destruction by upregulating cytoskeletal filament fragmentation in SMCs. To test this hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: Aim 1: Determine the contribution of fibroblasts derived-calpain-2 in AngII-induced AAA. A. Does calpain-2 deficiency in fibroblasts attenuate AngII-induced AAA formation? B. Does calpain-2 regulate TGF-?/Rho A in promoting fibroblasts differentiation via LTBP3/RhoGDI1? C. Does calpain-2 depletion in AoAFs attenuate AngII-induced cytoskeletal protein fragmentation in aortic SMCs in vitro? Aim 2: Define the mechanism by which calpain-2 promotes AngII-induced adventitial inflammation? A. Does calpain-2 contribute to ASK-1/ NF-kB activation and correlate with adventitial inflammation during AAA development? B. Does calpain-2 regulate AngII-induced ASK-1/NF-kB activation via TRX/IkB in AoAFs? C. Does cytoskeletal protein fragmentation in human AAA tissue associate with calpain? Aim 3: Determine the effect of calpain-2 deficiency on progression of established AAAs."
"9321295","PROJECT SUMMARY  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant form of brain tumors with more than 18,000 newly diagnosed patients and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States. The prognosis for GBM remains dismal with a median survival time of GBM patients of 14 to 16 months after diagnosis. A hallmark of malignant GBM is their high heterogeneity within the tumors. This unique characteristic manifests to molecular subtypes of GBM that display unique patterns of pathogenesis, biology, and prognosis. While specific molecular markers are of value in clinical care (e.g., IDH1/2 mutations, 1p/19q co-deletion), significant improvement in prognostic stratification and targeted therapeutics are urgently needed. With the ultimate goal of realizing the full potential of personalized and precision medicine, we propose to interrogate long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in a cohort of clinical GBM specimens. LncRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that have emerged as critical modulators in various cellular processes through gene regulation. Previous studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), though limited by their profiling technique not designed for non-coding RNAs, have suggested that lncRNAs are abundant in human cancers and are highly cancer-type-specific. In particular, lncRNAs have been implicated in brain function and glioma development. Specifically, in this exploratory project, we will apply the Ribo-Zero-based transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs in 100 clinical GBM samples that have been collected at the Northwestern University Brain Tumor Tissue Bank (Aim 1a). In contrast to the oligo(dT)-based RNA-seq that was used by previous studies, including TCGA, the Ribo-Zero-based technique is optimized for non-coding RNA transcripts, thus offering a great advantage for profiling all potentially functional lncRNAs in GBM. Notably, a novel detection algorithm based on machine learning will be developed to provide a more flexible and universal framework of lncRNA detection using RNA-seq. Though restricted to those lncRNAs shared between our GBM data and the oligo(dT)-based TCGA, we will evaluate the tissue-specificity of lncRNAs detected in GBM using TCGA data on several solid tumors (Aim 1b). After characterizing the landscape of lncRNAs in GBM, we will evaluate whether lncRNAs are associated with the clinical outcomes of GBM patients, and evaluate the feasibility of integrating lncRNAs and gene-level transcripts into a prognostic tool (Aim 2a). This proposal will enable us to employ these novel biomarkers for the prognosis of GBM as well as future functional studies. In addition, we will utilize co-expression network analysis to assign functions to the detected lncRNAs in GBM. An integrated, internet-based catalog will be constructed to provide a resource of lncRNAs in GBM that will benefit the general research community in this new area (Aim 2b). Finally, the PIs have assembled an outstanding research team with significant achievements in relevant research areas and complimentary expertise, therefore ensuring the success of this multidisciplinary and highly innovative project."
"9340104","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Navidea Biopharmaceuticals has developed 99mTc-tilmanocept as a radiopharmaceutical diagnostic imaging agent targeted to the macrophage mannose receptor (CD206) to be used as an aid for lymphatic mapping in cancer surgeries. The United States Food and Drug Administration approved Navidea's new drug application (NDA) for 99mTc-Tilmanocept for use in surgeries to remove melanomas and breast tumors in May of 2013. This SBIR Fast Track application proposes a highly innovative new indication for 99mTc-tilmanocept. Based on ex vivo work with 99mTc-Tilmanocept in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesions from HIV+ (AIDS) patients, Navidea, in collaboration with Drs. McGrath & Maurer of the Univ of California-San Francisco have found th a t a ll KS lesion cells express CD206. KS lesions can occur in the lungs and along the gastrointestinal tract (GI) of AIDS patients where they pose a serious and life threatening risk. Timely and accurate identification of these internal KS lesions is essential for delivery of therapies that may significantly extend the lives of AIDS patients wit KS. Current diagnostic protocols are invasive and challenged to accurately identify internal KS lesions. Our preliminary findings indicated that 99mTc-Tilmanocept could be used to more easily, less invasively and more accurately identify internal KS lesions, thereby improving both the long term outcomes and quality of care for KS patients. 99mTc- Tilmanocept has an extraordinary safety record, with no significant adverse events attributable to 99mTc- tilmanocept having been observed. The primary goal for the proposed efforts is to demonstrate that 99mTc- tilmanocept when injected intravenously can be used as a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging agent for visualization and identification of internal KS lesions in AIDS patients. In addition, despite the very significant progress that has been made over the last two decades in AIDS therapies, KS remains a common, serious and life threatening condition in AIDS patients worldwide. Better therapies for KS are greatly needed. If this project is successful and 99mTc-tilmanocept is demonstrated to bind specifically to cells in KS lesions, follow on studies will be performed (not part of this application) to determine if tilmanocept can be used to target delivery of therapeutics to KS lesions. Targeted delivery of therapeutics may greatly improve their efficacies providing a very significant additional benefit t KS patients. This Fast Track SBIR application proposes preclinical animal studies examining the safety of intravenous injection of 99mTc-tilmanocept (part 1) followed by a clinical study providing the initial evaluation of the safety and efficacy of SPECT imaging studies with 99mTc-tilmanocept to identify internal KS lesions in human patients (part 2)."
"9360108","Project Summary  Even in the absence of changing sensory inputs, many networks in the brain exhibit emer- gent dynamics: that is, they display patterns of neural activity that are shaped by the intrinsic structure of the network, rather than modulated by an external input. Such dynamics are be- lieved to underlie central pattern generators (CPGs) for locomotion, oscillatory activity in cortex and hippocampus, and the complex interplay between sensory-driven responses and ongoing spontaneous activity. The goal of this research is to develop a theory of how emergent dynamics can arise solely from the structure of connectivity between neurons. We will do this in the con- text of a simple but fundamentally nonlinear model: the Combinatorial Threshold-Linear Network (CTLN) model. This model has binary synapses and simple, perceptron-like neurons, ensuring that any emergent dynamics arise purely from the structure of connections, as described by a directed graph.  Despite its simplicity, the CTLN model captures the full range of nonlinear dynamic behav- iors observed in neural systems within a single model framework. Crucially, the model is also mathematically tractable, allowing us to prove very general results (theorems) that help guide the applications. We have already obtained theoretical results that enable us to reason about the underlying connectivity graph and obtain valid (and intuitive) predictions about the resulting dynamics. Our speci?c aims will extend these results and develop several applications. Specif- ically, we will further develop the theory of emergent dynamics in the CTLN model, completing our classi?cation of ?xed point attractors and investigating the transition to chaos as a function of connection sparsity. We will use the same framework to study pattern generation in small net- works, in order to understand how sequences and complex rhythms emerge from the structure of connectivity. Finally, we will apply our theoretical results to investigate a variety of dynamic phenomena in hippocampus in a single unifying model."
"9316683","ABSTRACT Poor maternal nutrition and obesity during pregnancy have been associated with a higher incidence of chronic diseases including cardiovascular disorders, childhood asthma and diabetes. Many of these complications could be due to common underlying immune deficits elicited in utero by a high fat diet (HFD) and/or complications of the mother's obese state. This will be investigated using a nonhuman primate (NHP) model whereby baboons are fed a high calorie/high fat diet (HFD) prior to breeding, during pregnancy and lactation. It has been demonstrated that the female offspring of HFD-fed mothers have significantly higher birth weights and continue to be heavier through at least 6 months of age. However, the male HFD offspring do not show a significant difference in weight relative to their controls suggesting that there will be a sex bias in developmental effects of maternal obesity/over-feeding during pregnancy. Thus, we will assess immune system ontogeny and function in both male and female offspring of HFD and control-fed mothers; currently these animals are all under 2½ years of age, so developmental delays due to the in utero environment should still be evident. However, we will also examine pre-natal HFD effects using tissues that were harvested from fetuses collected by C-section at day 165 of fetal gestation from both HFD and control cohorts. The immune parameters to be examined in Specific Aim I include the following: i) T cell maturation and selection in the fetal thymus (an early event that is critical for proper development of the adaptive immune system), ii) blood cell subsets reflecting effects on hematopoietic stem cells and lineage development, iii) tissue, serum, and induced cytokines as a measure of increased baseline inflammation, and iv) transcriptome analysis of lymphocytes as an unbiased approach to identify genes whose expression patterns are altered by the in utero environment. For all assays, both male and female offspring/fetal materials will be used to address a suspected gender-bias. Given that newborn children are initially colonized at birth from the maternal microbiome and that immune development is highly dependent on triggers provided by the microbiome, we hypothesize that there will be an underlying mechanistic link and that both will be affected in concert by the maternal diet during pregnancy. Thus, in Specific Aim II, we will characterize the diversity and structure of the gut microbiome and determine whether the in utero nutritional status affects these profiles. NHP studies like this one are intended to model human health challenges. With approximately 33% of women of child-bearing age characterized as obese, it is indeed critical to assess the potential developmental consquences of these high risk pregnancies in order to develop strategies to minimize downstream pathologies."

"9358752","CORE B: Cell and Tissue Acquisition Core Abstract: The purpose of this Core is to provide cell populations, cell lines, DNA/RNA or other materials to each investigator and to provide cell sorting and flow cytometry services in a timely fashion. We have an active laboratory that is well versed in cell isolation, storage, generation of cell lines, cell analyses, fibroblast cultures, RNA and DNA isolation and storage. While fresh samples are often needed for work in the Program Project, this Core has ample storage facilities in liquid nitrogen and a log system for these materials so that they can be retrieved for later studies as needed. There is also an active flow cytometry facility and sorter with state of the art equipment for analysis and separation. For tissue/blood specimens there are also four sources of materials ? the out patient offices, the hospital, the operating rooms for surgical procedures and the endoscopy suite for gastrointestinal endoscopic biopsies. For many years, we and our collaborators have been working closely with Pathology at Mount Sinai, to secure a number of surgical specimens for our research. This has facilitated access to such tissues as well as input from the Pathologists in terms of histologic, staining and molecular analyses. This cell isolation, phenotyping, cell culture, RNA/DNA and tissue Core serves to support Projects 1-4 in this ongoing Program Project."

"9330776","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The endothelial lining produces key substances such as nitric oxide (NO) for the maintenance of vascular homeostasis. Cardiovascular diseases affecting the heart (coronary artery disease) and skeletal muscle (peripheral artery disease) can be attributed to a pathological transformation of the endothelium from a NO producing cell which is vasoactive, antithrombotic, and regenerative; to a cell which exhibits impaired vasodilation, increased thrombus formation, and a lost capacity for cellular repair because NO production is inhibited. Cardiovascular risk factors such as age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, PTSD and tobacco use induce inflammatory signals which stimulate this pathological transformation. One manifestation of endothelial dysfunction is the chronic ulcerative wounds seen in patients with diabetes and peripheral artery disease. Our nation's veterans are at high risk for chronic ulcerated wounds because they possess many of these cardiac risk factors. This Veterans Administration Career Development Award (CDA-2) is conceived on the premise that light energy produces a novel means for increasing NO which is scavenged by endothelial dysfunction, and in the future may lead to the development of novel vascular therapies targeted to improve wound healing. These investigations are directed to test the hypothesis that light energy can release NO specifically to ischemic tissues. This alternative source of NO has the potential to improve endothelial function in regions where NO production is attenuated, thereby improving vessel reactivity and wound healing. Our hypothesis will be tested by targeting a defined set of proteins known to produce and bind NO and measure its production before and after energy exposure. We will also measure the impact of energy to stimulate vasodilation and wound healing under physiological conditions and inflammatory stress. The information gained from this investigation will expand our understanding of where important NO stores in the cell exist, and how energy can stimulate these stores to improve endothelial cell homeostasis in inflammatory disease."
"9321527","ABSTRACT (Overall) Untreated HIV infection is generally characterized by a continuous battle between the virus and the host immune response, with billions of new virions and infected cells produced and cleared every day. Treatment with ART eliminates the vast majority of (or potentially all) HIV replication, and plasma viral loads often fall to levels that are undetectable with standard clinical assays. However, certain reservoirs of replication-competent virus persist during therapy. Therefore if ART is stopped then virus can emerge from these reservoirs and rapidly spread, causing renewed progression towards AIDS. The goal of this program project is to gain a better understanding of the factors that cause this viral rebound, and to develop new methods to control or minimize viral rebound following cessation of therapy. We intend to approach this problem by utilizing cutting edge humanized mouse models, coupled with unique viral reagents, including a barcoded HIV swarm, as well as additional novel reagents (chimeric antigen receptors) and vaccine strategies. This program will involve three scientific projects, an administrative core (Core A), and two scientific cores. Projects include 1) ?Defining the causes and consequences of viral rebound?, which will study what factors influence activation of cells to give rise to viral rebound; 2) ?Impact of engineered immune cells on HIV rebound?, which will determine the effect of engineered innate and anamnestic cells on viral rebound; 3) ?Effects of vaccines on formation and clearance of the HIV latent reservoir?, which will determine the effect of vaccination, with either a non-HIV- specific or an HIV-specific vaccine on viral reservoirs and rebound. The two scientific cores will be the Viral Genetics Core (Core B) that will perform sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of barcoded virus for all projects, and the Humanized Mouse Core (Core C), which will perform in vivo manipulations for all projects. Together we hope to define factors contributing to viral rebound, and possibly identify adjunctive therapeutic approaches to provide patients with sustained virologic remissions."
"9241961","Clinical presentation, particularly early in the course of disease, is only rarely pathognomonic of infection with a specific infectious agent. As a result, diagnosis is complex with many different organisms causing similar symptoms. Given that effective intervention requires accurate diagnosis and that the probability of success diminishes over time, tests that enable rapid, efficient differential diagnosis have potential to decrease morbidity, mortality, and social and economic costs of infectious diseases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not well suited to highly multiplexed microbiological analyses because primer interactions can reduce sensitivity and the repertoire of reporter systems is typically limited to 10 to 20 targets. DNA microarrays allow extensive multiplexing but existing assays are less sensitive than agent-specific PCR and require amplification, fluorescent labeling and several hours for processing. Next generation sequencing has unlimited multiplex potential. However, current platforms require hours to days for sample processing and bioinformatic analysis and are too complex for most point-of-care applications. In this project we will develop a single-molecule field-effect transistor (smFET) diagnostic assay platform. This application draws on our recent work, in which we have shown that the conductance of a carbon nanotube with a single covalently tethered DNA probe molecule is exquisitely sensitive to the increased charge that results from hybridization of a complementary DNA strand. smFET arrays on active complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) substrates will allow genomic materials to be assayed to concentrations approaching 1 fM (or 600 molecule per mL), comparable to qPCR, but while allowing multiplexing comparable to microarrays. We will specifically apply this technology to a genomic diagnostic platform that will allow efficient, low-cost differential diagnosis of infectious diseases.     Our objectives we will be to optimize and develop the sensor to detect target concentration as low as 1 fM and develop approaches to distinguish mismatches through analysis of binding kinetics; integrate these devices onto CMOS measurement substrates, further improving electronic performance and allowing parallel multiplexing; test the platform with clinical samples in a staged strategy that begins in minimal biocontainment with nucleic acid templates, proceeds to work with potentially infectious materials in biocontainment; reduce the form factor for the device to that of a portable USB stick; and build software and bioinformatics infrastructure to support this platform for deployment in the field and clinics."
"9335478","Summary: AP3 This associate program of PMS-ICBG will characterize the chemical diversity inherent in mollusk symbiotic bacteria. We have demonstrated that mollusks contain diverse symbiotic bacteria, including strains that are closely related to previously identified strains, but also very commonly to rare or unique types of strains that have otherwise resisted cultivation and that are not available in other culture collections. We have demonstrated that these strains provide a rich, privileged source of novel, biologically active natural products with potential in treating human diseases. The goal of this program is to isolate and purify biologically active components from these bacteria. In addition, we will determine which types of compounds are important to symbiosis, and we will follow up on potential pharmaceutical hits by discovering or synthesizing active analogs in a drug development strategy. Another critical aspect of AP3 is training. Our goal is to help MSI-UP become a globally known center for natural products chemistry. With the recent acquisition of chemical infrastructure, such as the first modern NMR and MS instrumentation in the country, and an excellent educational environment, MSI-UP is poised to make this leap, which will be greatly facilitated through carefully planned interactions in this PMS-ICBG. To achieve these goals, we plan to:  1) Prioritize bacterial samples for chemical and biological analysis;  2) Elucidate structures;  3) Provide training to aid the development of natural products chemistry at MSI-UP;  4) Optimize hits via chemical approaches."
"9358713","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to map the organization of human white matter (WM) with cutting-edge ex vivo imaging technologies. This work will produce microscopic-level information on several long-range WM projections, as well as a more targeted mapping of circuits that serve the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These circuits are of particular interest in psychiatric applications but they have been heretofore mapped extensively only in non-human primates. Specifically, recent work with tracer injection studies in macaque monkeys has established how small fiber bundles that originate in different areas of the PFC reach their destinations by using the large WM pathways, such as the cingulum bundle (CB), corpus callosum (CC) and uncinate fasciculus (UF), as their conduits. For example, the UF is composed of several sub-bundles: some that follow the entire trajectory of the UF and others that join the UF only for part of its trajectory to then jump off and join other large pathways, like the CB, CC, etc. Mapping these distinct components of larger WM pathways in the human brain is challenging both in vivo and ex vivo. Invasive injection studies are not applicable to humans and conventional 2D histological techniques like myelin staining cannot be used to infer the 3D orientation of axon bundles. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) can provide estimates of these orientations indirectly, by measuring the diffusion of water molecules through the WM. However, it is prone to errors in areas of complex WM architecture and requires validation by an independent source of measurements. In this work we will combine high-resolution, high-SNR ex vivo dMRI with polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) in post mortem human brains to extract microscopic information on WM areas that confound conventional dMRI, and to perform a detailed mapping of the projections of the PFC. We will take advantage of the MGH Connectom scanner, a unique instrument that can achieve 8 times stronger diffusion-encoding gradients than routine scanners, and was designed specifically for high-SNR, high-resolution dMRI. We will develop a specialized receive coil array for imaging ex vivo human brains on the Connectom scanner, which will allow us to collect whole-brain dMRI data with unprecedented resolution and SNR. The gold-standard dMRI and PS-OCT data produced by this work will be used to construct a novel atlas of WM anatomy, which will be incorporated in a tool for automated global probabilistic tractography, building on prior work by the PI. This tool will allow both the new, detailed taxonomy of smaller WM bundles, as well as the classical definitions of large WM pathways, to be reconstructed automatically from routine-quality in vivo dMRI data that can be collected on conventional scanners. The proposed work promises to advance our understanding of the organization of human neurocircuitry; to move human dMRI studies from the current view of a WM pathway as a single bundle to one where multiple smaller bundles merge on and off a pathway at different parts along its trajectory; and to provide the tools for studying this detailed WM taxonomy using routine neuroimaging data."
"9341368","ABSTRACT Black and Latino sexual minority men are likely to have higher rates of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) than their White counterparts. CSA history among sexual minority men is associated with adverse consequences including substance misuse, poor mental health, revictimization, and high-risk sexual behavior. Because Black and Latino cultures stress traditional forms of masculinity, men may be under pressure to deny certain childhood sexual experiences as abusive out of fear of being perceived as gay or as victims. Most CSA research with sexual minority men relies on quantitative measures that often preclude consideration of cultural variations in how formative sexual experiences are understood, and are based on inconsistent and/or overly restrictive definitions of abuse. Moreover, limited assessment methods may result in failure to detect some abusive experiences (e.g., those involving female perpetrators), which can have harmful health consequences if they remain unrecognized. These issues indicate a need to broaden the conceptualization of CSA to recognize men's appraisals and interpretations of their childhood sexual experiences (CSE). To that end, we will conduct mixed-methods interviews regarding CSE with 40 Black and 40 Latino sexual minority men in New York City.  Researchers are calling for interventions that incorporate CSA history into substance abuse treatment and other health services used by men who have sex with men (MSM) and men who have sex with men and women (MSMW). However, these men may be reluctant to access such services for fear of stigma, exposure of their same-sex behavior, general provider mistrust, and perceptions that providers lack training in sexuality. Further, service providers may not be equipped to recognize the need for safe trauma-informed care, particularly as it relates to sexual abuse. To understand provider experiences and treatment protocols, we will interview 30 service providers regarding whether and how sexual histories are addressed in treatment and other health care settings.  We propose the following specific aims: 1) to investigate appraisals of childhood sexual experiences among Black and Latino MSM and MSMW and to evaluate these experiences using established criteria for defining sexual abuse; 2) to examine appraisals of childhood sexual experiences relative to sexual identify formation, adult sexual relationships and behaviors, concealment of same-sex behavior, alcohol and drug use, psychological and emotional functioning, and cultural ideologies of masculinity among Black and Latino MSM and MSMW; 3) to examine perspectives of Black and Latino MSM and MSMW and relevant service providers to: a) understand the role of, and need to include, sexual history in treatment and counseling settings; and b) determine service providers' preparedness to address childhood sexual experiences in treatment and counseling settings. This formative research will inform testable approaches to assessing and incorporating sexual abuse history into substance abuse treatment and other health and mental health services used by men with such histories."
"9360099","Principal investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Hanson, Stephen, José RFA-EB-15-006 Project Summary/Abstract Since the earliest days of neuroscience research, core methods have focused on matching specific functions to local brain structure and neural activity. The relationship between brain structure and function has been a key motivation for the development and application of novel methods and discovery. Despite the apparent success of this program in identifying brain areas associated with memory, attention, executive control, action- perception, language, etc.. it is typical for many other areas to be engaged during basic cognitive/perceptual tasks, areas that are often considered ?background,? ?secondary? or often just irrelevant and are consequently ignored. Given the fundamental nature of the connectivity in brain, theories of cognitive neuroscience will very likely involve hypotheses about the influence?sometimes called ?effective connectivity? (Friston et al, 1994, Sporns, 2011)--- that one brain area may have upon another in the course of basic mental processes. Whether we consider language processing, working memory or simple detection tasks, cognitive and perceptual processes are likely to include networks of regions that operate interactively to define, both, a distributed as well as a kind of local computation. It has become increasingly common to posit that networks, circuits, or clusters of brain areas communicate with one another in the implementation of various potential social or social-perceptual functions. Many of these hypothesized networks are thought to be organized around hubs that synchronize other areas but are neither exclusive, nor necessary and sufficient, for a given function. Part of this apparent flexibility of brain networks can be attributed to continued ambiguity about the components or particular function of a given network. For example, many of the brain networks associated with social functioning, include similar function, similar areas, and overlapping networks. As social/affective and cognitive neuroscience continues to evolve it will be more and more critical to disentangle these networks in order to identify the role that individual networks play in various social, perceptual and cognitive function. Unfortunately, the muddle of networks and their functions has increased rather than decreased in recent years. The field of social and cognitive neuroscience has evolved to a point where principled methods for identifying network connectivity, and the tools to do so, could well be trans-formative but certainly are urgent. In this proposal we aim to advance the development of a novel framework based on a model of effective connectivity and Bayesian search called IMaGES (Ramsey et al 2010) using simulation and experimental tests. We also aim to develop novel Cognitive Neuroscience tactics and strategies to specifically test graphical models in the brain and finally we will also develop two new directions including estimation of Recurrent (feedback) network information flow and the Latent structure supporting the complexity and communication within brain networks."
"9342869","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a transition from a P30 Core Center of Excellence in Hematology (DK056465-16) to an NIDDK-sponsored U54 Cooperative Hematology Specialized Core Center (CHSCC). This transition will facilitate collaborations, training, and resource sharing on a national level. The goal of this CHSCC is to advance research in stem cell and transplantation biology and thereby accelerate the development of new therapies. This requires resources that anticipate and meet the needs of an ever evolving research base. Our past experience has shown that new investigators can be recruited into this area of research if critical cells, technologies, and expertise can be accessed  at reasonable cost. To address these needs we are proposing to provide an Administrative Core and five biomedical research cores. These include Cell Procurement and Processing, to provide large quantities of purified normal hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and stromal populations harvested from adult blood and marrow as well as cord blood and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC); Vector Production to provide lenti, retro, foamy and adeno-associated virus vectors for gene transduction, marking, and editing; Specialized Mouse Services including in vivo xenogeneic transplantation assays and the generation of custom transgenic models; the Canine Large Animal Model for preclinical studies including protocol development and IACUC approval; and Molecular Library Development and Screening, that provides access to CRISPR genome editing and shRNA libraries. The services provided by these cores will enable individual investigators to: 1) isolate and characterize stem/progenitor cells, 2) genetically mark, edit or otherwise alter their gene expression, 3) accurately detect and quantitate their progeny in vitro and in vivo, and 4) determine the effects of these manipulations on hematopoiesis at the molecular, cellular, and whole animal levels. The Administrative Core provides budgetary and scientific oversight of all CHSCC activities, and manages a charge back system to generate program income. Program income is used to enhance and expand Core operations as well as support the Pilot & Feasibility (P&F) and Enrichment programs designed for trainees and young investigators in the CHSCC network. Finally, the Administrative Core will work with Sage Bionetworks to create a publicly searchable data archive linking investigators to annotated data, techniques, and protocols generated through the CHSCC programs. The 30 member research base of this CHSCC receives more than 29 million/year direct costs in non-malignant Hematology-related research, 3.8 million comes directly from the NIDDK."
"9325594","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Brain Vascular Malformation Consortium (BVMC) focuses on three relatively rare vascular malformations: Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM), Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS), and Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). Each is poorly understood in terms of biological mechanisms, resource intensive to manage effectively, and has high probability of serious neurological morbidity, such as hemorrhage, seizures and focal neurological deficits. All three diseases share a common biological theme: a brain vascular phenotype based on failure of the normal physiological mechanisms of blood vessel formation or maintenance. Recent data also suggests that the three diseases share commonalities in their molecular signaling pathways. Each disease is characterized by a wide spectrum of phenotypes, for which biological risk factors are poorly understood. The identification of these risk factors would be of immediate significance for patient surveillance an for optimizing management. Further, although there are no specific medical therapies for these diseases, appropriate treatment trials will require biomarkers to risk stratify patients for selecton and surrogate outcomes. In our original project period, we established information-rich patient registries for all three diseases, and made significant progress towards the identification of MRI,  genetic, and biochemical biomarkers associated with specific clinical outcomes. Based on this strong foundation, we now propose the renewal of the BVMC focused on three Specific Aims: 1) To continue to develop robust patient registries for HHT, SWS, and CCM; 2) To continue to identify and validate clinically relevant biomarkers for HHT, SWS, and CCM; and 3) To aid the development of future clinical research studies for HHT, SWS, and CCM. These aims will be accomplished through our three Projects, Cores, pilot project and training components, and active collaborations with the Patient Advocacy Groups - Angioma Alliance, Sturge Weber Foundation, HHT Foundation International - and the RDCRN Data Management and Coordinating Center. Establishment of the BVMC has been a major step forward in promoting cross-disease collaborations, providing a centralized clinical research infrastructure for studying  these three rare diseases, and generating a valuable resource for the larger neurovascular community."
"9381740","Project Summary/Abstract Vaccines against infectious diseases have been hailed as the greatest achievement in public health over the last century. This competing renewal will investigate a novel adjuvant that elicits cellular immune responses needed for better vaccines. The lack of an appropriate adjuvant is one major barrier to developing a safe and effective vaccine against infections with fungal pathogens, which represents an unmet need in medicine and public health. Despite the rising rates of severe fungal infections, no vaccines against fungi are commercially available. While current vaccines against infectious diseases preferentially induce production of antibodies, their contribution to host defense against fungi is limited. Cellular immunity is essential for the resolution of fungal infections. Vaccine-induced resistance against fungi in experimental models requires Th17 and Th1 cells that produce IL-17 and IFN-? and mediate protection in part by recruiting and activating phagocytes to augment killing of fungi. In the last funding cycle, we discovered that fungal recognition by the C-type lectin receptor (CLR) Dectin-2 is required for the differentiation of protective Th17 and Th1 cells against dimorphic fungi. Through biochemical purification and mass spectrophotometry analysis, we identified a novel bona-fide fungal ligand for Dectin-2, the glycoprotein Blastomyces Eng3 (Bl-Eng3). In this application, we propose to characterize and functionally test Bl-Eng3 as an adjuvant for vaccination against fungi. We hypothesize that Bl-Eng3 activates dendritic cells, drives differentiation of antigen (Ag)-specific Th17 and Th1 cells, and thereby promotes protective cellular immunity against fungal infection. We also posit that the protein backbone and glycan modifications account for ligand activity and that Bl-Eng3 will be an effective adjuvant alone or together with other CLR ligands for vaccines against fungi. We provide strong preliminary data to support our hypotheses. Using Dectin-2 reporter cells, we have established an in vitro screening system to dissect the contributions of the protein backbone and its glycosylation to Dectin-2 ligand activity and an in vivo adoptive transfer system to delineate the effects of the ligand adjuvant on the differentiation of naïve antigen-specific CD4+ T-cells into protective Th17 and Th1 cells. Our approach offers a powerful complimentary strategy that will identify the ligand moiety of the glycoprotein in aim 1, assess adjuvancy for the maturation and priming of Ag-presenting cells (APCs) and Ag-specific T cells in aim 2, and determine receptor collaboration with other CLRs and protective efficacy in experimental models of pulmonary and systemic fungal infections in aim 3. Our work will provide new insight needed to promote the maturation of APCs and differentiation of protective Th17 and Th1 cells. This knowledge will provide the basis for developing and designing new vaccine strategies against fungi, and other pathogenic microbes that require cellular immunity for host defense."
"9397266","Project Summary/Abstract The recent emergence of targeted nucleases (such as Zinc-Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), Transcription Activator- Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system) allows for site-specific gene modification in cells. Nucleases induce a double-stranded break (DSB) in the DNA, stimulating repair via one of the two pathways: error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), or precise homology-directed repair (HDR), when a donor template is available. A donor template can be supplied exogenously to allow the cells to correct disease-causing mutations. If used in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), this technique could provide long-term self-renewing population to generate a life-long supply of healthy (corrected) cells. However, clinical translation of this approach is impeded by high cytotoxicity in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) associated with nuclease and donor template delivery, subop- timal HDR levels, and low HDR to NHEJ ratio in the primitive HSC population. Therefore, this project is aimed at (1) studying the mechanisms for increased toxicity in human HSCs and minimizing cell death, (2) improving HDR to NHEJ ratio, and (3) studying what governs repair pathway choice (HDR vs. NHEJ) in human HSCs, and how to increase the levels of HDR-mediated DSB repair in HSCs. Preliminary experiments have identified that tran- sient overexpression of BCL2 during nuclease and donor template delivery decreases toxicity and improves cells viability. The studies in Aim 1 of this project are designed to decipher the mechanisms of BCL2 action, to test its effect on gene modification of HSCs, and to assess its safety by conducting in vivo experiments. The studies in Aim 2 will focus on improving the HDR/NHEJ ratio by controlling DNA repair pathway choice in cell cycle-de- pendent manner using two independent approaches: first, by temporarily synchronizing the cells in S/G2 phases of cell cycle when HDR is known to occur, and second, by minimizing nuclease activity during G1 phase of cell cycle (which usually leads to NHEJ) through the addition of cell-cycle specific degradation signal to the nuclease. Since the majority of HSCs are in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, studies in Aim 3 will attempt to initiate HDR in G1 by manipulating the formation of a protein complex that affects the DNA DSB repair pathway choice. This project is unique in its opportunity to combine the basic mechanistic study of DNA repair in human HSCs with development of translational methods for improving targeted gene correction in HSCs, which can result in an advancement over the current treatment options. Successful completion of the proposed aims can potentially be the necessary component for enhancing nuclease-based gene therapy to be clinically viable for monogenic diseases of the blood."
"9348408","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nazareth College of Rochester is a small, independent, co-educational, private liberal arts college with a substantial regional impact. The Princeton Review featured Nazareth College in its The Best 379 Colleges: 2015 editions, as one of the best institutions for undergraduate education. U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges (2015 edition) guide ranks Nazareth in the top tier of colleges and universities in the category of  Best Regional Universities - North. Nazareth offers a wide range of majors and professional programs in biomedical and biobehavioral research (BBR); science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM); and Health and Human Sciences (HHS) disciplines. Recent campus improvements have expanded and upgraded the facilities that house these programs. Despite upgraded facilities and engaged faculty Nazareth College has not been successful in securing external funding for its biomedical and biobehavioral research. This inability to compete successfully for external awards is in part due to a lack of resources and infrastructure in the Office of Sponsored Programs and Faculty Research (OSPFR) and partly due to a lack of access to faculty development opportunities related to grant seeking and management. Nazareth College recognizes that its OSPFR must be developed to meet the needs of the college, faculty and ultimately its students. To this end it has recently hired a new Director for the OSPFR, Dr. Jennifer E.B. Harman, responsible for building the research enterprise. The driving force behind Nazareth College's expansion of its research enterprise is the increased recognition of the value of research in a teaching college, the expansion of accredited programs in the health and human sciences requiring faculty research productivity, and Nazareth's growing regional reputation for engaged scholarship. This project times well with the College's strategic plan to increase opportunities for undergraduate research and its commitment to enrolling a diverse population. Nazareth College has the goal of increasing internal and externally funded research 25% by 2020. Nazareth College also seeks to increase its diversity through partnerships with schools in Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse and New York City with the intent to identify under-represented minorities who show interest in careers in BBR, STEM or HHS fields. The goal of the BRAD award is to expedite these initiatives, increase the momentum of change that has already begun, and emerge as a viable, sustained research program. The aims of the proposal are 1: professional development for research administrators, 2: increasing faculty profession development opportunities for STEM and HHS faculty and 3: infrastructure upgrades to the OSPFR. Aims of this program focus on educational opportunities for faculty, Dr. Harman and other members of the OSPFR. Professional development for OSPFR will enrich Dr. Harman's background while professional development opportunities for faculty will provide the resources necessary for faculty to seek external funding. OSPFR infrastructure will reduce the administrative effort required for proposal development and management of awards."

Nonetheless, insufficient research efforts have been directed to improve asthma outcomes in this vulnerable population. There is a consensus that adverse asthma outcomes can be ameliorated by an individual's active engagement in adequate self-management. This multi-site randomized controlled study proposes to implement and evaluate a peer-led asthma self-management for adolescents (PLASMA) program that has demonstrated its feasibility and preliminary efficacy in a previous study. PLASMA will be implemented in three cities (Buffalo NY, Baltimore MD, and Memphis TN) that have particularly high rates of pediatric asthma and asthma-related morbidity, and are thus most likely to benefit from the program. PLASMA comprises three main components: (a) peer-leader training; (b) a one-day asthma camp where peer leaders will deliver manualized self-management content recommended by the national guidelines; and (c) bi-monthly peer-leader contacts. Specific aims are: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of PLASMA in inner-city adolescents with asthma in improving quality of life (primary outcome), and asthma knowledge, attitudes, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, self-management skills, and asthma control, FEV1 (exploratory outcomes) over time, compared to a control group for whom adult leaders will deliver the same program content; (2) to examine the mediating effects of the exploratory outcomes on quality of life; (3) to examine the moderating effects of personal factors (e.g., age, sex, family support) on the intervention's primary and exploratory outcomes; (4) to evaluate the effects of PLASMA on study outcomes in peer leaders (16-20 years); and (5) to determine the economic impact of the intervention. These aims will be accomplished using a two-group randomized controlled trial with 378 adolescents (12-17 years) from the three cities (126 for each site). A total of 42 qualified peer leaders (14 in each site) wll be enrolled based on adult nomination. Eligibility criteria for both peer leaders and adolescent learners include: a current asthma diagnosis; persistent asthma; absence of other chronic or mental illness; inner-city residence; and capability of verbal and written communication in English. Participants will provide data at enrollment (T1), 3 months later (T2), immediately following the camp (T3), and at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-months post-camp (T4- T8). Data will be analyzed using a multi-site hierarchical three-level linear mixed-effects model where level 1 represents repeated measures, level 2 = subject, and level 3 = site. To determine the economic impact of the program, we will measure the direct healthcare costs and total costs of the program, and perform net cost analyses for each type of costs. In addition, we will estimate cost-effectiveness ratios of the PLASMA group compared with the control."

"9322575","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: I am an underrepresented scientist proposing an area of research that is of primary interest to the NHLBI (pulmonary research). My keen interest in pulmonary diseases research stems from having lived in an area where chronic lung-related diseases (such as tuberculosis; active- and secondhand- tobacco-smoke as well as wood- and charcoal- smoke related ailments) are endemic due to the poor socio-economic status of the people. As such, I am currently supported by the Tobacco-related Disease Research Program (TRDRP) of the University of California to pursue an important research in this area. During this fellowship, I worked on a project that aimed to conduct high throughput screen (HTS) of small molecules to modify the enzymatic activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH); an enzyme involved in cardiovascular physiology by modulating the nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) pathway. I worked diligently with my mentor, Dr Cooke, to design an approach for large-scale production of recombinant DDAH and an assay to conduct the HTS. As described in our recent publication in the journal of Biomolecular Screening, our strategy bear fruit by discovering several novel small molecules that regulate DDAH enzymatic activity. This was particularly very exciting to me as DDAH has been shown to be principally involved in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis in a murine model of lung injury and was found to be upregulated in lung tissues from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients. These two important links: DDAH and its role on IPF, and the discovery of small molecules to regulate DDAH activity, fueled my interest in pursuing the development of a novel therapy to restore lung function. Environment: As described in my proposal, my research is significantly accelerated due to it being conducted at Stanford; a superb research environment with multiple core facilities for pharmacological, molecular and cellular studies. In addition, Stanford nurtures multi-disciplinary collaborations and highly committed to translating basic research into clinically useful therapy. Two examples of such bench-to-bedside translational research programs at Stanford are the SPARK and the Bio-X Research Programs. One of the areas that may benefit from such translational research efforts is IPF. At Stanford, there are groups who are actively working towards understanding the pathobiology of IPF and the development of potential therapeutics. One of these groups is my co-mentor, Dr Rosen's, lab that is working on a different target to treat IPF. Their expertise in this area will be valuable i my project. Furthermore, Stanford offers several relevant courses and seminars including Cardiopulmonary Research-in-Progress; Drug Development, and Future Faculty which are of great interest for my career development. Research: IPF is an aggressive and incurable disease that progressively destroys the normal architecture of the lung. Although, the precise etiology and sequence of events in the development and progression of IPF remains incompletely characterized, emerging data indicates that dysregulation of DDAH activity might play crucial role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Recent mechanistic study in an animal model of bleomycin- induced IPF-like lung injury, validated by lung tissues from IPF patients, indicates that DDAH is centrally involved in the disease process. Remarkably, treatment of bleomycin-challenged mice with DDAH inhibitor (L- 291) ameliorated fibrosis and restored lung function. Moreover, analyses of human lung tissue showed that DDAH was significantly elevated in IPF. Therefore, targeting this pathway might have some therapeutic potential as described in my research proposal. One way of regulating DDAH over-activation is by using small molecule antagonists that directly inhibit its enzymatic activity. Therefore, our discovery and validation o several small molecule antagonists of DDAH (including FDA approved ones (for other indication)), deserves further investigation for therapeutic development. Career goals: Practically, drug development is a lengthy process (12 years on average) that requires fundamental understanding of disease mechanisms and optimization of drug-leads to selectively and efficiently target the disease of interest. Therefore, my immediate-term goal is to study the feasibility of DDAH as a drug target in IPF using small molecule-based approach. If the outcome of this study is encouraging, I will then aim for my long-term career goals to conduct step-wise optimization of the drug-leads by forming a network of collaborations to synthesize and test several analogs of the most promising compounds and decipher the mechanism by which such drug-leads regulate DDAH activity. I plan to continue the drug discovery and development path with the ultimate goal of conducting clinical trials and developing a therapy for chronic pulmonary diseases in general and IPF in particular. Therefore, this Research Scientist Development Award from NHLBI will provide me an unparalleled opportunity to develop my career in Biomedical Research and bring innovation to the scientific community. The proposed research is in an area of primary interest to the NHLBI and is feasible given Stanford's research environment and the dedication and expertise of all the personnel tapped in this project.

"9411353","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  As part of its infection cycle, HIV-1 integrates into the genome of CD4+ T cells. After initial infection, a subset of these cells returns to a `resting memory' state. The viral DNA is still present in the genome of these memory cells but it is silent, a phase in the viral life cycle called the latent phase. These memory cells harbor the virus and can produce infectious particles upon stimulation as long as the infected cell is alive. Latent infection, therefore, requires lifelong treatment of infected individuals to suppress rebounds in viral load. The current strategy to cure HIV-1 is to reactivate latently infected cells, which will subsequently result in their clearance. Reactivation can lead to either cell death caused by the toxic effects of viral replication or immune clearance by the presentation of viral epitopes on the surface of the infected cell.  Approaches to reactivate the latent virus reservoir have focused on increasing HIV-1 gene expression, as it is thought that latency is maintained by multiple blocks to global transcription. Drug candidates for reactivation, called latency reversing agents (LRA), target different steps in the transcription process (e.g. histone tail modification, polymerase elongation) but are designed to avoid causing general activation of T cells, which would result in massive immune dysfunction. To date, clinical trials with the most promising LRA drugs have failed to reduce the latent HIV-1 reservoir. Curiously, LRA treatment can robustly induce viral RNA expression in primary HIV-1 latency models, however a comparable increase in viral proteins and replication is not observed, which is required for successful clearance. These findings have led to the proposal of an additional post-transcriptional block to viral protein expression in resting T cells.  The ~10kb HIV-1 RNA genome folds into a complex three dimensional structure and specific features of this structure are critically involved in regulating multiple post-transcriptional steps including transport of the viral RNA out of the nucleus, translation of viral protein, and packaging of the RNA genome into the viral particle. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that the post-transcriptional block, which is not bypassed by LRA stimulation, is due to specific aspects of HIV-1 RNA structure, which is an innovative idea for the HIV cure field. We will employ a novel technique (DMS-MaPseq) developed recently in the Rouskin lab, which allows for targeted RNA structure probing in living cells. Importantly, the simplicity of the DMS-MaPseq approach will enable RNA structure probing of the entire HIV-1 genome in several different cellular conditions. This work will be significant because it will provide critical information on the native HIV-1 RNA structure, which has never been examined in its physiological context within T-cells where host factors can dramatically influence RNA folding. In addition, this high-risk, high-reward project can directly benefit the prominent ?shock and kill strategy? for latently infected T cell clearance by providing insight into the post- transcriptional block to LRA activity."
"9395535","ABSTRACT Worldwide, there are 1.8 million children living with HIV-1 and ~150,000 new pediatric infections per year, approximately half of which occur due to HIV-1 transmission during breastfeeding. While antiretroviral therapy (ART) greatly reduces mortality and morbidity of HIV-1 infection, it is not a cure due to virus persistence in latent reservoirs. Strategies to reduce the persistent reservoir and promote virologic control in absence of ART (i.e., HIV-1 remission) would greatly benefit HIV-1-infected infants and children that now must remain on daily ART from the time of diagnosis through their entire life span. The Objective of this proposal is to test interventions that decrease residual immune activation and/or enhance antiviral immune responses in SIV-infected ART-treated infant rhesus macaques (RMs). Our Scientific Premise is that our novel model of postnatal oral SIV infection and suppressive ART in infant RMs will allow us to generate key data on the impact of immune interventions on residual immune activation, antiviral immune responses, virus reservoirs, and viral rebound following ART discontinuation. The interventions we will test, IL-21 and Ad26/MVA therapeutic vaccination with TLR7 stimulation (TV+TLR7), recently showed promising results in adult RMs and are predicted to favorably impact the immune dysfunction induced by HIV-1 infection in infants. The Central Hypothesis is that by targeting this immune dysfunction to reduce residual immune activation and/or boost virus-specific immune responses, we will decrease viral reservoirs and promote virologic control. We will test this hypothesis is in the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine the immunological impact of IL-21 or TV+TLR7 in SIV-infected ART-suppressed infant RMs; 2) To assess whether and to what extent IL-21 or TV+TLR7 reduces viral reservoirs in SIV-infected ART-suppressed infant RMs; and 3) To determine whether and to what extent IL-21 or TV+TLR7 results in delayed virus rebound or reduced viremia set point after ART interruption in SIV-infected infant RMs. A key feature of this proposal is that, by using our novel, highly relevant animal model of SIV infection and ART treatment, we are able to perform in-depth analyses of virus reservoirs and treatment interruption that would be impossible to conduct in pediatric participants. We expect the findings from this Project to critically inform HIV-1 cure efforts in the pediatric population."
"9269794","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a fundamental gap in understanding how oxidative damage contributes to pathogenesis.  Thus, the long-term goal is to elucidate how the release/clearance dynamics of several reactive oxygen species and small molecules in the brain underlie neurodegenerative disease states involving oxidative stress.  Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a reactive oxygen species that also serves as an important signaling molecule in normal brain function.  Because H2O2 serves these distinct biological roles, H2O2 concentrations likely rise and fall in the extracellular space with precise spatial and temporal resolution, such that functional levels can be achieved for signaling while the pathological consequences resulting from unregulated generation are prevented.  However, studies aimed at elucidating these dynamics have been hindered by the lack of a method for probing dynamic H2O2 fluctuations in living systems with molecular specificity.  The goals of this research proposal are to enable the quantitative analysis of endogenous H2O2 fluctuations in real-time, and to elucidate how these molecular dynamics modulate those of dopamine (DA) in intact, functional brain tissue.  H2O2 is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.  Simultaneous H2O2 and DA measurements will enable regulatory kinetics and mechanisms to be unraveled, investigation of the alteration of these mechanisms by disease or pharmacological agents, and clarification of the neurochemical processes that underlie motor dysfunction.  Carbon-fiber microelectrodes will be employed with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, as this approach provides a quantitative view of neurotransmission in discrete brain locations in real-time.  The specific aims combine the development of new technology with innovative applications.  They are:  1.  To enable the precise characterization of H2O2 fluctuations in the extracellular space of specific brain nuclei, shedding light on its modulatory signaling role, extrasynaptic lifetime, sphere of influence, and diffusion profile under both normal and pathological conditions.  These experiments will also demonstrate the extent to which various sources of H2O2 contribute to signaling within select brain nuclei.  2.  To elucidate the precise physiological interaction between H2O2 and DA, and the role that these molecular dynamics play in the onset of motor complications associated with Parkinson's disease.  In order to achieve these aims, powerful mathematical models will be developed and validated that can be used to interpret the effects of pharmacological agents on the balance between H2O2 generation and clearance.  Existing analytical techniques will be modified to enable improved quantitative assessment in the face of chemical variability.  The proposed research is significant because the results are expected to vertically advance and expand our understanding of the physiological roles played by H2O2 in the brain, and to shed light on whether oxidative stress is an initiator of dopaminergic dysfunction, or a consequence of that process.  Ultimately, such knowledge will inform the development of improved therapeutic interventions, neuroprotective strategies, and promising antiparkinsonian drugs based on redox biology."
"9393673","Project Summary  End stage renal disease (ESRD) is among the ten leading causes of death for Americans, and its incidence and prevalence are rising, especially among non-White groups. Kidney transplantation is the most effective treatment option for many Americans, but the number of Americans needing kidneys is currently much larger and rising much faster than current transplant levels. Patients who seek transplants have one of two options: wait for a kidney from a deceased donor to become available, or obtain a transplant from a living kidney donor. Deceased donor kidney transplant levels are projected to grow little over time, constrained by population aging and mortality patterns, but living donation donor kidney transplantation (LDD KT) holds the prospect of substantial growth if healthy population members are willing and able to donate. Unfortunately, there are large and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in LDD KT rates that compound disparities in rates of ESRD. Prior research hypothesizes that differential access to healthy, compatible donors in candidates' social networks may explain racial disparities in usage of LDD KT. However, a limitation of this work is that it focuses on those who are evaluated for donation, not the many members of transplant candidates' social networks who could be evaluated for donation, but are not. We propose a multi-center study to collect novel data on transplant candidates' social networks and to test promising social interventions that could reduce barriers to LDD KT. Based on qualitative interviews and a pilot survey of 72 transplant candidates we previously collected in a large transplant center, we suspect that the differential access hypothesis does not hold, and that there are promising points of social intervention for researchers to reduce racial disparities in LDD KT. These pilot data show large LDD KT underutilization for all candidates, and that Black candidates have access to promising living donors at higher rates than White candidates. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the primary barrier to eliminating disparities in LDD KT and promoting greater utilization of LDD KT for all groups is social, not biomedical, in origin. In this proposal, we will extend our prior work to develop and test evidence based, randomized social network interventions that will target social barriers to LDD KT and follow up with candidate medical records to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions. Specifically, we will compare a control group of candidates to those assigned to two treatments that we will pilot and test: a) a search intervention where a subset of candidates is coached to approach promising family members that seem to be underutilized based on our pilot data, and b) a rhetorical intervention where we encourage a subset of candidates to use scripts for discussing transplantation with family members that we find to be effective in survey vignette experiments and focus groups. With eighteen month medical records follow up of all candidates and the large amount of data we will obtain on their social networks, we will assess the social barriers that lead to underutilization of LDD KT, how those factors vary by race, and how they can be reduced through promising social network interventions. LDD KT has substantial potential to solve public health challenges around the growing prevalence of ESRD, and the basic and applied knowledge that we will develop as part of this proposal will help to unlock this potential.  "
"9360053","ABSTRACT Addiction develops when recreational drug use switches to compulsive drug taking. While the former is predominantly motivated by reward seeking, the latter is also driven by other factors that include enhanced stress reactivity, aversive aspects of drug withdrawal and emergence of a negative affect upon protracted abstinence. In recent years the notion that reward and aversion processing engage overlapping brain circuits has been established, together with the concept of a reward/aversion network. The habenula (Hb) encodes both rewarding and aversive aspects of external stimuli, and may therefore represent a central integrator of reward/aversion circuits. Remarkably, the medial subdivision of habenula (MHb) shows highest density of mu opioid receptors (MORs) in the brain, but the role of this particular receptor population is unknown. This project will test the hypothesis that MORs expressed in the MHb regulate specific aspects of reward and aversion processes related to drug abuse.  We will capitalize on tools and preliminary findings from the previous funding period. In Aim 1, we will extensively characterize MOR-expressing neurons in the medial septum-MHb-interpeduncular nucleus (MS-MHb-IPN) pathway using viral tracers combined with knock-in MOR-mcherry, Cnrb4-Cre or novel MOR-Cre mice that we currently develop. This Aim will provide circuit-level understanding that will complement Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2 will identify behaviors, and underlying circuit mechanisms, controlled by MORs in the MHb. We will examine a range of reward/aversion behaviors potentially mediated at the Hb level (reward and reward-driven decision-making, morphine and nicotine withdrawal, aversion to morphine withdrawal and abstinence) using a novel conditional Cnrb4-MOR mouse line. Reduced physical morphine withdrawal has already been detected and DREADD approaches will be used to recapitulate this behavior, and possibly other phenotypes. Aim 3 will identify the causal impact of MOR and MOR-positive neuron activities in MS-MHB-IPN networks, and their broader impact on the brain. We will use pioneering functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in live mice, and further fMRI strategies developed in the Technical Advancement Core, to map brain-wide functional connectivity, seed-based connectional patterns and inter-node directionality in Cnrb4-MOR mice at rest and after morphine treatment. Consequences of DREADD-mediated stimulation of MOR+ neurons in the MHb will also be examined by fMRI in live animals.  In sum, this proposal will reveal the role(s) of the densest and less-well studied MOR population. The three aims together will determine importance of these receptors in reward/aversion-related behaviors and elucidate the underlying circuit mechanisms. The project will also provide novel genetic mouse lines for CSORDA (Cnrb4-MOR, Project III) and the neuroscience community (MOR-Cre), and cutting edge non- invasive animal imaging that will be applicable within (PTSD model, Project IV) and outside of CSORDA."

"9382650","Abstract Low back pain is the second most common reason for a visit to a physician, with direct medical costs exceeding $90 billion per year in the United States alone. These costs are driven primarily by 7-10% of patients who develop a chronic pain disorder that can last for many years. Fear of movement (i.e., kinesiophobia) due to expectations of pain and harm is an important risk indicator for the development of persistent pain and disability, with studies consistently showing that high fear is one of the strongest predictors of the transition to chronic low back pain (CLBP). Specifically, fear encourages the adoption of maladaptive movement patterns wherein tasks of daily living are performed with reduced lumbar spine flexion and compensatory increases of knee, hip, and arm shoulder flexion. While avoidance of lumbar flexion may benefit these back pain sufferers in the short-term by reducing their fear of injury, in the long-term limited lumbar flexion becomes an entrenched pattern that can lead to shortening of spinal peri-articular connective tissues, changes in surrounding muscles, and increased risk for chronicity. With the support of an NIH R21, we recently completed a Phase I trial of an immersive virtual reality dodgeball game designed specifically to increase lumbar flexion among individuals with CLBP and high fear of movement. The results of this proof-of-concept study demonstrated that 3 daily sessions of virtual dodgeball was safe, did not exacerbate existing back pain, was highly rated by participants, and increased lumbar spine flexion during gameplay. We now propose a Phase II RCT to determine the efficacy of a 9?week course of treatment of virtual dodgeball to reduce pain and disability. CLBP participants will be randomly assigned to play one of two versions of our virtual reality game. In the experimental group, gameplay will promote progressive increases in lumbar flexion. The control group will play the same immersive video game, but the parameters of the game will be modified such that only small excursions of lumbar flexion are needed to successfully complete gameplay. The co-primary clinical outcomes of changes in pain and disability will be assessed at 1-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 48-weeks post-treatment. Additionally, individual differences in expected pain, expected harm, and lumbar flexion will be measured at pre-treatment baseline and at each of the follow-up intervals in the laboratory. Finally, participant activity in their natural environment will be monitored for 7 days following each follow-up laboratory visit. We have developed an innovative immersive video game that safely reduces expectations of pain/harm and increases lumbar flexion among individuals with CLBP. The proposed Phase II trial will have a significant impact on public health by testing the ability of this unique intervention to motivate CLBP sufferers to re-engage in the specific spinal motions necessary to promote recovery and to maintain these treatment gains."
"9323799","Project Summary/Abstract The development and testing of potential HIV cure therapeutics would be greatly expedited by a robust set of biomarkers predicting their clinical effectiveness. Biomarkers that can serve as surrogate endpoints remain unidentified. Such biomarkers will: 1) accelerate progress in the HIV cure arena much like plasma viral load testing propelled antiviral drug development; 2) afford patients participating in analytical treatment interruption (ATI) trials a higher degree of clinical protection by both reducing the number of trials; 3) provide biological clues into the molecular and biochemical pathways that control the latent reservoir; and 4) serve as a magnet for attracting Biotech and Pharma to more vigorously engage in HIV cure research. The BioMark program project team (Warner Greene, Gilad Doitsh, Garry Nolan, Katie Pollard, Satish Pillai, Nadia Roan, and Robert Siliciano) will search for strong biomarkers that accurately predict time to rebound following treatment interruption. Such biomarkers would be of great value for the cure field as they would allow clinicians to predict the period of time a patient can remain off ART without viral recrudescence. Blood cells and plasma from 125 HIV-infected volunteers participating in four different ATI trials obtained before ATI and at the time of viral rebound will be analyzed. These patients include 30 individuals treated during acute infection who are expected to exhibit slower rebound times. To identify both virus- and host-derived biomarkers, the team will 1) deploy an exciting ?first in class? digital droplet PCR assay that selectively detects and quantitates intact proviral DNAs (IPDA) in the reservoir??because it is this key small fraction of the total provirus population that contains the infectious proviruses mediating rebound, a low number of intact proviruses might emerge as a strong biomarker predicting a longer time to viral rebound; 2) utilize next-generation ultra-deep sequencing to profile cellular RNAs and miRNAs in CD4 T and other immune cells and in parallel to sequence DNA, RNA and miRNA circulating free in plasma (and in cerebrospinal fluid in a limited subset of subjects) or bound as cargoes in extracellular vesicles to identify predictors of time of viral rebound; 3) use 7 validated CyTOF panels comprising over >200 parameters to phenotypically study CD4 T cells and other immune cells under both resting and stimulated conditions to identify single-cell signatures of time to viral rebound; 4) assess changes in the titer and avidity of circulating anti-HIV antibodies or markers of lymphoid tissue inflammation (including products of pyroptosis) as indicators of the size of the expressed reservoir, which can serve as predictors of time to viral rebound. These studies will generate large bodies of high-dimensional data that will be compiled, curated, and analyzed in BioMark's Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core. Several biostatistical approaches will be employed to identify these biomarkers and to perform the larger meta analysis (see Core description). In summary, BioMark proposes an innovative and comprehensive approach to fill a major gap in HIV cure research produced by a lack of key biomarkers predicting time to viral rebound after treatment interruption."

"9318426","PROJECT SUMMARY  The overall goal of this project is to develop and compare three new HIV envelope (Env) trimer delivery  vaccines that are designed to mimic the natural presentation of the transmembrane glycoprotein complex (the  spike) that occurs during HIV infection. Our vaccine design approach emphasizes delivery of authentic Env  trimer primarily because antibodies (Abs) with broad HIV-neutralizing activity (bNAbs) have been elicited only  in patients infected with HIV. Recently, several new Env glycoprotein designs have been developed that should  enable improved presentation of the native trimeric Env. These new immunogens assemble into correctly  folded trimeric complexes that are significantly more stable, which should make it possible to stimulate B cells  with a more uniform well-ordered mimic of the functional Env trimer. An additional challenge to realizing the  potential benefits of the improved immunogen will be identification and development of vaccine delivery  platforms that can present the correctly-configured glycoprotein complex in vivo and also stimulate immune  system functions required to drive the B cell response beyond development of antibodies with limited  neutralization breadth. Accordingly, the goal of this research project is to apply this promising Env trimer  stabilization technology to the development of three novel vaccines that will present nearly identical stable,  well-ordered viral spikes, but use substantially different delivery mechanisms that will stimulate distinctive  profiles of immune system functions. This will make it possible to conduct comparative studies to specifically  analyze how vaccine platforms and their unique immunostimulatory properties affect the qualities of the Env  antibody response. Each vaccine will deliver a stabilized HIV clade C strain 1086 (C.1086) Env immunogen  that will be developed using the new native flexibly-linked (NFL) Env trimer technology (EnvNFL), which will be  adapted for expression of transmembrane glycoproteins. The three Specific Aims for the project are focused  on development and evaluation of the new vaccines and production of vaccine material needed to support  preclinical testing in animal models, which will be conducted in collaboration with the Research Project Teams  and Technical Cores that are members of this HIVRAD Program. This Project Team will develop novel  stabilized spike delivery vaccines based on three immunogenic vaccine platforms, including: 1) an innovative  mRNA vector and adjuvant delivery system called RNActive®; 2) EnvNFL trimers arrayed on inactivated  vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles formulated with adjuvant; and 3) EnvNFL delivered with a live  replication-competent VSV vector that incorporates Env in its viral envelope. The Project Team will generate  and optimize the three novel vaccine candidates, ensure that they effectively deliver stabilized transmembrane  spikes with the expected antigenicity profiles, and provide well-characterized, high-quality vaccine material for  evaluation in preclinical immunogenicity and efficacy studies."
"9383171","Metalloprotein catalysts for asymmetric synthesis Project Summary The exquisite chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity of enzymes make them attractive tools for organic synthesis, in particular for the generation of chiral synthons and intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other biologically active molecules. Reflecting this notion, there have been significant interest within the pharmaceutical industry toward integrating efficient, selective, cost-effective, and sustainable enzyme-catalyzed transformations for drug synthesis and manufacturing. Progress in this direction is critically hampered, however, by the inherently limited range of chemical transformations catalyzed by natural enzymes as compared to those accessible through chemical methods. Ramifications of our prior NIH-funded research have led to the discovery that myoglobin?a small, robust, and structurally tunable heme-containing protein?, constitutes a very promising and versatile scaffold for developing efficient and stereoselective biocatalysts for carbene transfer reactions. Building upon these exciting results, the proposed research aims at investigating and extending the scope of these hemoprotein catalysts across a broad range of carbene- mediated transformations useful for the construction of carbon?carbon, carbon?nitrogen, and carbon?sulfur bonds. A set of complementary strategies will be investigated and leveraged to enhance and modulate the catalytic activity, chemo- and stereoselectivity of these catalysts. Furthermore, valuable insights into the mechanism of these reactions and into correlations between catalyst structure and reactivity/selectivity will be gained through a combination of experimental, computational, and spectroscopic studies. These efforts will contribute to the definition of guiding principles and a general, rationally driven strategy for the design and development of myoglobin-based catalysts with high activity and fine-tuned chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity for executing a variety of asymmetric carbene insertion reactions. These systems will provide access to chiral building blocks of immediate value for medicinal chemistry and drug discovery efforts. The synthetic utility of this new class of metalloprotein catalysts will be further demonstrated through their application for the preparation of synthetically challenging drug molecules. Ultimately, this research is expected to have a major impact toward making available new efficient, selective, and sustainable biocatalytic strategies for promoting asymmetric carbene transfer reactions, thereby overcoming outstanding challenges in this field."
"9383180","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the USA. Increased levels of reactive oxygen  species  (ROS)  are  often  associated  with  microvascular  pathology  in  CVD,  causing  endothelial  dysfunction  and coronary artery disease and leading to myocardial ischemia and infarction (MI). However, failure of large clinical  trials  using  antioxidants  in  patients  with  CVD,  challenges  the  prevailing  view  that  ROS  production  is     damaging  to  the  microvasculature.  The  overarching  hypothesis  put  forth  in  this  proposal  is  that  EC  NOX-­ derived  ROS  is  beneficial  for  revascularization  immediately  following  myocardial  ischemia  but  becomes  detrimental upon over the LT due to increase in mitochondrial ROS. The therapeutic benefit of intervening on  ROS  level  is  best  realized  by  specific  down  regulation  of  mito-­ROS  in  ECs  that  have  been  exposed  to  LT  increase in NOX-­ROS such as in DM. This hypothesis will be fully tested in vivo using our novel EC-­specific  transgenic  MnSOD  (MnSOD-­OE)  animals  and  supported  using  mitochondria-­specific  nitroxide  and  nanoparticle antioxidant in coronary vessels from CVD patients with DM undergoing cardiac surgery.  Specific Aim 1: Elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which ST vs LT increase in EC-­specific NOX-­ROS  (NOX-­OE  mouse  model)  exert  differential  effects  on  EC  function  and  angiogenesis  and  the  recovery  of  the  post-­infarct  ischemic  myocardium.  We  hypothesize  that  whereas  ST  NOX-­ROS  increase  induces  AMPK®?eNOS  and  AMPK®?CPT1-­mediated  increase  in  mitochondrial  fatty  acid  oxidation  and  dNTP   synthesis, LT increase in NOX-­ROS results in nitro-­tyrosine-­induced inactivation of MnSOD, increase in mito-­ ROS, decrease in mito-­membrane potential and dNTP synthesis leading to reduced EC proliferation.   Specific Aim 2: Determine if EC-­specific MnSOD overexpression protects against the detrimental effects of  LT  exposure  of  NOX-­ROS  on  vessel  density  and  cardiac  functions  in  post-­infarct  ischemic  myocardium.  We  hypothesize  that  SOD-­OE  will  improve  post-­MI  recovery  of  the  cardiac  function  by  reducing  mito-­ROS  and  improving dNTP synthesis/EC proliferation in LT NOX-­OE animals and in animals with DM. Double transgenic  NOX-­OE:SOD-­OE vs NOX-­OE, and SOD-­OE with DM will be examined for post-­MI recovery.   Specific  Aim  3:  Elucidate  the  effects  of  mitochondrial-­targeted  nitroxide  antioxidant  and  SOD  biomimetic  nanoparticles  on  post-­infarct  vessel  density  and  recovery  of  cardiac  function  in  mice  and  on  chronic  myocardial ischemia in large animals (swine) with metabolic syndrome.  Specific  Aim  4:  Determine  the  effects  of  mitochondrial-­targeted  nitroxide  antioxidant  and  SOD  biomimetic  nanoparticles on angiogenic potential of human coronary vessels from patients with or without DM. Coronary  vessels  from  atrial  tissues  of  patients  (uncontrolled  DM  HbA1c>8.5,  controlled  DM  HbA1c<7,  and  non-­DM  HbA1c<5.5) undergoing cardiac surgery will be examined.      "

"9526307","One of the hallmarks of HCV infection is impaired T cell function which contributes to viral persistence. Recent data found that exosomes released from infected hepatocytes contain positive and negative strand HCV RNA, and that serum exosomes transfer HCV RNA to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. HCV RNA is found in T cells obtained from infected individuals, and we recently demonstrated that incubation of T cells with HCV RNA-containing serum, HCV RNA-containing exosomes derived from serum, or cell culture-derived infectious HCV particles inhibited TCR signaling. We found that the HCV genome was processed into a short RNA (vs-RNA) sequence with considerable complementarity to two sites on the 3'-untranslated region of a phosphatase known to acti- vate Src kinases (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor epsilon or PTPRE). HCV vs-RNA reduced expression of PTPRE in T cells in vitro and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HCV infected people in vivo. PTPRE levels were restored to following HCV cure by antiviral therapy. Mutation of HCV vs-RNA sequences predicted to form an RNA structure recognized by Dicer restored Lck phosphorylation following TCR stimula- tion, and changing the targeting sequence within the HCV vs-RNA to a different target (CXCR4) restored TCR signaling, PTPRE protein expression, and reduced surface expression of CXCR4. Together, these data sug- gest that HCV inhibits T cell function by exosome-mediated transfer of viral RNA that is processed into a vs- RNA resulting in reduced PTPRE expression and reduced TCR-mediated signaling. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that HCV vsRNA regulates PTPRE expression and that PTPRE regulates TCR signaling by recruiting regulators of LCK activity to the TCR complex. These studies identified a novel pathogenic mechanism for HCV and identified PTPRE as a key regulator of early TCR-mediated signaling. However, two major knowledge gaps remain. 1) what are the vs-RNA sequence requirements for HCV-mediated suppression of PTPRE in human T cells, and 2) how does PTPRE regulate human T cell function? We propose to address these knowledge gaps and hypotheses by 1) determining the HCV vs-RNA minimal sequence requirements for TCR-mediated signaling, 2) ascertaining the T cell factors required for the generation of HCV vs-RNA targeting PTPRE, 3) investigating the molecular mechanism for the role of PTPRE in human T cells. Completion of these studies will provide novel insights into the function of HCV vs-RNA in the regulation of T cell function and in- crease understanding of HCV pathogenesis. These studies will also examine the role of PTPRE in normal T cell function. Since the role of PTPRE in controlling human T cell function is completely unexplored; this appli- cation will address this knowledge gap. The completion of this application will also provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of early T cell signaling by PTPRE, providing a potential new target for the modulation of T cell function. The complementary experience of the Stapleton and Houtman laboratories make these studies highly feasible."
"9404221","Project Summary BACKGROUND The Hepatitis B Research Network (HBRN) was created in 2008 to address several research challenges regarding chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The HBRN was charged with establishing a large cohort of patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection to study the natural history of HBV infection and designing treatment protocols(s) to compare monotherapy to combination therapy using clinical outcomes as endpoints. There are 12 consortia (22 clinical sites) recruiting adult and pediatric patients including the Toronto site (University Health Network, Toronto General Hospital & Hospital for Sick Children) to address the following specific aims: Specific Aims: 1. To describe participants with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a prospective cohort in  the United States (US) and Canada and identify predictors of disease activation and progression 2. To define the role of limited duration peginterferon alfa-2a in the presence of tenofovir  for treating people with chronic hepatitis B (Immune Active (IA) Trial) 3. To evaluate ?off treatment? safety and sustained responses after treatment with entecavir  and peginterferon alfa-2a in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in HBeAg positive adults  who are in the immune tolerant phase. (Immune Tolerant (IT) Trial) 4. The clinical and virological status of chronic HBV infection is defined by distinct  patterns of immune effector and regulatory responses. 5. To examine if therapeutic HBV suppression will enhance antiviral immune effector  responses and reduce immune inhibitory factors in participants with chronic hepatitis B With the highest number of enrolled patients and among the best retention rates in all categories of HBRN studies, Toronto is the leading site among the HBRN consortium. As of October 31st 2016, Toronto clinics have enrolled 437 patients including 300 adult and 137 pediatrics patients in the cohort study from a total number of 2427 (18%) enrolled patients across the network. Toronto also is the leading enrolling site in the two main treatment trials of the HBRN, the Adult Immune Active (IA) study and the pediatric/adult Immune Tolerant (IT) study. Toronto investigators are actively involved in numerous ancillary studies, including the ongoing immunology studies as well as studies on virological and clinical outcomes. Toronto investigators also participate actively on numerous committees throughout the network. Overall, in addition to retaining and recruiting patients, Toronto site has played an important role in the HBRN and will continue to be actively involved in all aspects of the network to ensure its continued success."
"9398494","PROJECT SUMARY Bacteria by definition are single-celled organisms, but they, like other forms of life, have evolved surprising complex methods to coordinated behaviors. Research over the past 25 years has revealed that a wide range of bacteria can communicate by diverse mechanisms. In most cases these microbial conversations occur through the exchange of diffusible signals, although there are also clear examples of contact-dependent communication. Many microbes use these signaling mechanisms to monitor and respond to population density, a process often described as quorum sensing. Much of this research has focused on single species communication, but a growing reseach area is the more complex behavior of communication between multiple species of bacteria or bacteria and other eukaryotic organisms. Interbacterial communication is not however restricted to quorum sensing mechanisms and there is mounting evidence that signaling can function in a range of different capacities. This communication has profound impacts on our understanding of how pathogens and commensals often regulate factors critical for interaction with each other and their hosts. This application requests financial support for the sixth American Society for Microbiology-sponsored conference on Cell-cell Communication in Bacteria, to be held from October 16 ? 19, 2017, in Athens, GA. There are two main goals of the CCCB conference. The first is to have the meeting serve as a platform to promote and attract young and ethnically diverse investigators involved in bacterial communication research. Young and diverse researchers will be chosen to be speakers at this conference, and a mentoring lunch will provide students with the opportunity to explore the diversity of career options in the bacterial communication field. The second goal of this conference is to foster interactions between reseachers with diverse expertise. Thus, small groups of researchers will be created that are seated together during lunch, with each member of the group coming from from a different research area: structural biology, computational biology, synthetic biology, chemistry, bacterial molecular genetics, microbial ecology, and microbial pathogenesis. In these small groups scientists will discuss their most pressing research challenges in bacterial communication with the goal of creating new solutions, research ideas, and even future collaborations."
"9409126","ABSTRACT There is a critical need to discover and develop safe and effective antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug- resistant bacterial infections. Each year approximately 1.5 million patients in the US get hospital acquired infections (HAIs), with a mortality rate of ~6%. Nearly 70% of the bacteria causing HAIs are resistant to at least one commonly used antibiotic. Natural products (NPs) and their derivatives are the basis of many pharmaceutical advances, representing ~50% of FDA approved small molecule drugs over the past 5 decades including many important antibiotics. Genome mining for novel natural products is quickly replacing traditional approaches to antibiotic discovery. However approximately 90% of all actinomycete gene clusters are cryptic or silent, i.e., expressed at levels too low to detect using traditional antibacterial screening assays, or not expressed at all. Warp Drive Bio (WDB) has sequenced over 135,000 actinomycete strain genomes from diverse sources worldwide, and our proprietary genomic database contains ~3.5 million secondary metabolite gene clusters. Importantly ~75% of cluster families in our database have yet to be reported in the literature. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to discover structurally and mechanistically novel NPs. Our objective is to discover and develop novel ?-lactams (BLs) as broad-spectrum antibiotics with improved therapeutic profiles aimed at combating current and emerging multidrug-resistant Gram (-)/(+) pathogens. BLs represent a clinically validated class widely used in antimicrobial therapy with good, broad-spectrum activity and favorable safety profiles. Unfortunately, the emergence of multi-drug resistance severely limits the clinical efficacy of current BL antibiotics, as single agents or in combination with ?-lactamase inhibitors. WDB is deploying our proprietary natural product genome-mining platform to discover novel BL antibiotics. This platform offers a new paradigm in which drug discovery is initiated at the genome level, allowing rapid identification of novel compounds that would be otherwise overlooked in a traditional activity-based discovery paradigm. We first deploy our bioinformatics search engines to rapidly identify gene clusters within WDB's genomic database that encode novel BL molecules. To access the potential of silent biosynthetic gene clusters, we have developed methods to systematically replace promoters, inducing compound expression. Clusters are transferred into engineered heterologous expression hosts to produce novel molecules that are isolated as extracts in a miniaturized high throughput plate format for bioassay, and we utilize mass spectrometry analytics to rapidly identify the masses of novel BLs of interest to facilitate rapid purification for further characterization. We will apply our genome-mining platform to engineer, express, purify, and characterize the products from 10 novel BL biosynthetic clusters in this Phase I proof-of-concept study."
"9342973","Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and their protein partners play critical roles in an enormous variety of cellular processes. The focus of this application is an abundant class of RNPs that is widespread in animal cells and also present in many bacteria. The major protein, the ring-shaped Ro 60 kDa autoantigen, is a clinically important target of autoantibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Ro assists survival of both animal cells and bacteria after some forms of environmental stress, and mice lacking Ro develop an autoimmune syndrome resembling SLE in patients. In all organisms examined, Ro binds ~100 nt ncRNAs called Y RNAs. In the last funding period, by studying Ro RNPs in the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, we uncovered a novel role for ncRNA, that of tethering a protein cofactor to an enzyme to alter its substrate specificity. Specifically, we discovered that the bacterial Ro was tethered by Y RNA to the ring-shaped exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), forming a double-ringed RNP machine specialized for structured RNA decay. Biochemical and structural analyses support a model in which single-stranded RNA threads through the Ro ring into the PNPase cavity for degradation. Consistent with a conserved role, we have now identified a set of mouse and human mRNAs whose levels depend on Ro. We also identified several ncRNAs that require Ro for their stable accumulation. Our current goals are to define these newly identified roles for Ro and Y RNA in mechanistic detail. Our first aim is to dissect the mechanism by which binding of mammalian Ro to specific mRNAs assists their decay. Our second aim is to determine the mechanisms by which mammalian Ro assists the biogenesis of specific ncRNAs. Our third aim is to determine how the new bacterial RNA degradation machine contributes to survival of the human pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) during treatment with mitomycin C, a nucleic acid crosslinker used to treat human gastric and pancreatic cancers. Together, our studies will elucidate novel pathways that regulate mammalian mRNA levels and ncRNA biogenesis and continue our characterization of a new RNP machine. Our studies will also define mechanisms by which RNA populations are adapted during environmental stress, a poorly studied but vital part of maintaining RNA homeostasis."

"9335667","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The only available treatment for end stage lung diseases is a total lung transplant. This procedure is limited by poor survival and an inadequate supply of donor lungs. An alternative is to promote regeneration of normal lung tissue from endogenous progenitor cells. Partial pneumonectomy (PNX), the surgical removal of one or more lobes, stimulates compensatory lung growth in the remaining lobes in many mammalian species. This model of adult alveologenesis is mediated by proliferation of several progenitor populations, including alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2s), which are distal lung epithelial stem cells. Significant questions remain regarding the regenerative potential of human lungs, the identities of human lung epithelial stem cells, the molecular signals that control their activation, and the influences of the microenvironment on regeneration.  Our objective is to apply data from murine studies to stimulate regeneration of human lungs. Recently macrophages have been implicated in tissue repair and regeneration, but little is know about their role in lung regeneration. We are using fluorescent reporters and genetic gain- and loss-of function in mice to identify populations of immune cells that modulate epithelial stem cell behaviors in adult lung regeneration. We will assess how macrophages may contribute to the regenerative niche of distal lung epithelial stem cells to promote adult alveologenesis post-PNX.  We propose to first measure immune cell population dynamics and activation states post-PNX (Aim 1). Our preliminary data shows that that CD115+ myeloid cells increase in regenerating lung post-PNX and a subset of these cells co-express Arginase-1, a marker of M2-polarized macrophages shown previously to promote wound healing. We will further characterize the myeloid population dynamics post-PNX and determine if these cells increase by local proliferation or are derived from circulating monocytes. We will then test the requirement for macrophages in PNX-induced lung regeneration (Aim 2). Interestingly, the chemokine CCL2 is upregulated in lung epithelium post-PNX. We will disrupt CCL2 in the epithelium or its cognate receptor, CCR2, and determine how this impairs lung regeneration. Finally, our preliminary data suggests post-PNX macrophages secrete factors that could promote angiogenesis. We will investigate whether macrophages directly influence AEC2 proliferation post-PNX or if they indirectly influence AEC2 by promoting angiogenesis, which is required for PNX-induced lung regeneration (Aim 3). We will determine if endothelial proliferation is impaired in CCR2 knock-out mice and identify macrophage-specific pro-angiogenic pathways.  We hope to identify mechanisms that mediate these effects that might be exploited to stimulate lung regeneration and may be developed into novel therapies for patients with end-stage lung disease."
"9331716","Abstract  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that causes progressive neurological deficits, which affects 400,000 people in the USA. In 2007, total MS costs in the USA exceeded $20 billion, and today it would cost $18 billion per year if every MS patient in the USA was treated with just one disease modifying drug, not to mention the additional costs of lost productivity and other medical care. The cause of MS remains unknown; it is generally accepted that the combination of genetic and environmental factors determines the disease susceptibility. Vitamin D deficiency is emerging as an important environmental risk of MS. What is not known is how early life vitamin D deficiency influences the susceptibility to MS. Previous studies have shown that higher serum vitamin D levels in MS patients are associated with lower risk of relapse, in agreement with its immune-modulatory functions. However, this immune-regulatory activity of vitamin D does not explain the onset of a CNS-specific autoimmune disease. A high vitamin D diet attenuates microglia activation and reduces demyelination, suggesting a neuroprotective role of vitamin D. Interleukin-34 (IL-34) has recently been shown to be essential for the homeostasis of microglia. IL-34 is produced by neurons in the CNS, and its expression reaches its peak during postnatal development then declines in adulthood and vitamin D can positively regulate IL-34 expression. Together, the expression timing/pattern and functions of IL-34 make it a prime candidate as a vitamin D-mediated neuroprotective molecule, which may ultimately contribute to decreased MS susceptibility. The longterm goal of this study is to understand the mechanism by which sufficient vitamin D in early life imprints the protection against MS development later in life. The overall objective of the proposed project is to use a transgenic mouse - neuron-specific inducible vitamin D receptor knockout mice to elucidate how impaired vitamin D signaling on neurons during early life alters microglia phenotypes. Our main hypothesis is that vitamin D primes microglia into the neuroprotective phenotype through enhancing the production of IL-34 and/or other factors in neurons in a developing CNS. The rationale that underlies this study is that, once the correlation of early life vitamin D deficiency and MS susceptibility is fully defined, this will be the foundation for making a public health policy to manipulate this easily modifiable risk factor for MS. The aims are: 1) Elucidate the functional role of IL-34 in vitamin D-mediated neuroprotection, 2) determine if vitamin D modulates IL-34 and inflammatory cytokine responses in the CNS during early life infection, and 3) determine if vitamin D insufficiency in early life enhances susceptibility to EAE, an animal model of MS. These outcomes will have an important positive impact because they will define the cellular mechanism of vitamin D-mediated neuroprotection in early life. Understanding how this environmental factor influence MS risks will be a significant step towards the ultimate goal - prevent MS."
"9271051","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal and early life exposures and environments are fundamental to life course health and prosperity and are increasingly recognized as such in national and international public health priorities. Fetal and early childhood environments affect children's cognitive and non-cognitive development, abilities, and performance in elementary school and, as a result, significantly affect subsequent educational trajectories, adult health, wealth, and social status. However opportunities for optimal development for children in the U.S. are not uniform, but rather are socially and spatially patterned from before birth-in the form of fetal programming and birth outcomes-through adolescence and into adulthood. It is therefore a pressing public health challenge to better understand the family and neighborhood environmental determinants of early childhood development in order to identify opportunities for child, family, and community interventions which improve children's health outcomes. Meeting this challenge requires linking the micro and macro demographic processes by which families and neighborhoods affect early child development with the conceptual, methodological, and statistical perspectives of spatial demography and population geography. With this career development award I will gain critical inter-disciplinary skills necessary to pursue a novel research agenda that: a) integrates population science theory and methods necessary to study residential context, segregation and mobility, b) describes the role of spatially and temporally dynamic residential context in early life course development of U.S. children, c) prepares me to compete successfully for R01-level research funding by year 5, and d) establishes me as an independent investigator at the intersection of spatial and social demography, life course demography / epidemiology, and public health. The research aims of this study are to: 1) develop and evaluate a geo-informatics data model for studying spatiotemporal population patterns including residential segregation, neighborhood deprivation and residential stability and mobility; 2) test the association of spatiotemporal neighborhood exposures with early childhood cognitive development and school readiness using Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) Birth and Kindergarten cohort data; and 3) construct spatial, agent- based models to explore dynamics of the place-child development relationship. Residential environments are a source of social capital and collective efficacy for residents and could affect child development through the distribution of educational and recreational resources, through the effects of stress or support from varying crime, economic, and social characteristics of neighborhoods, or through local norms and role models for both parents and children. These factors will be measured using census, crime, and other population-based data sources to describe the spatial patterns of residential segregation; residential mobility, housing tenure, and stability; and neighborhood social environment including poverty, affluence, crime and family structure. Associations between spatial residential environments and childhood development will be tested using the ECLS birth and kindergarten cohorts using spatial regression, and econometric approaches which can test hypotheses of spatial externalities, clustering, and heterogeneity. The multilevel use of large, population-based longitudinal data with spatially-explicit environmental measures and hypotheses can shed light on both the magnitude of associations as well as the possible pathways through which environments strengthen or undermine optimal child development. The execution of these research aims will be intertwined with a comprehensive training and career mentoring plan carried out at Emory University and Penn State University Population Research Institute. Training goals include study of spatial, social and family demography, geo-informatics, and advanced statistical approaches to frequentist and Bayesian spatial analysis. Mentoring will support research productivity in the form of publications, collaboration with public health and population science scholars, and successful submission of R03 and R01 grants during the training period. Overall this proposal will allow me to become a uniquely skilled, independent researcher bridging spatial demography and social epidemiology."

Dr. Marina Gorbatyuk has been added as an Associate Director to assist with Core governance and metrics analysis. She brings additional cell and molecular and biochemical expertise including extensive experience with AAV production and use. In addition to having advanced equipment for analysis, the Core has a highly educated, fully trained MD, PhD scientist, Dr. Vincenzo Guarcello as the Laboratory Director. His broad knowledge and experience base and overall scientific skill is a major asset. The Core equipment is primarily housed dedicated space in close proximity to most users and is accessible 24/7. Conflicts in usage scheduling is minimized through a comprehensive online scheduler for all major equipment. Outstanding institutional support has been critical in many ways: (1) to provide the facilities that house Core equipment and an office for the laboratory director, (2) to maintain the equipment, (3) to obtain new equipment to increase core capability and (4) to partially support the Laboratory Director. Core usage is carefully monitored to ensure priority of use among Core participants as follows: NEI R01-funded participants have first priority for use (1), followed by participants with NIH new investigator status that are actively seeking an NEI R01 (2), then by participants that are collaborating as key personnel on an NEI R01 and actively seeking lead PI NEI R01 support (3), and lastly by participants that have recently in the last three years been NEI R01-funded and are actively seeking new NEI R01 support (4)."
"9318425","PROJECT SUMMARY (Core C - Gene Expression Signatures)  HIV has proven its ability to defeat all vaccine candidates tested to date. However, evidence in humans and  model systems demonstrates that immune system is capable of generating antibodies that neutralize multiple  HIV-1 viral strains. While the mechanisms that lead to the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies remain  to be determined, a number of studies have shown that the early innate immune responses to vaccines are  predictive of the subsequent adaptive response which is responsible for protection. Thus, transcriptional  signatures of innate responses can be used to discover gene regulatory networks, or ?rules?, driving adaptive  responses and vaccine efficacy. In this program we seek to comprehensively evaluate, and compare 4 novel  vaccines that deliver a common HIV immunogen, but differ in their mode of delivery and their potential  immunostimulatory profiles. We will use early transcriptional signatures (gene signatures) as part of this  program to reveal the innate immune networks elicited by each vaccine candidate and delivery strategy, to  correlate vaccine elicited immunogenicity with early innate immune signatures, to provide a framework for  predicting the efficacy of vaccine candidates, and to lay a foundation for future rational vaccine designed to  activate desired innate immune responses and subsequent adaptive responses.   "
"9316595","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in women are a source of illness, pain, and embarrassment, which can affect work, social interactions, and athletic and recreational activities in women from adolescence to old age. Almost 50% of women will experience LUTS at some point in their lifetime. Symptoms are harmful enough in themselves, but untreated, they can lead to more serious problems such as incontinence, infections, pelvic inflammation and psychological distress. The NIDDK program on Prevention of Lower Urinary tract Symptoms in women Research Consortium (PLUS-RC) is intended to broadly identify and evaluate the relative importance of the risk and protective factors for LUTS by conducting the necessary research studies to establish the scientific basis for future prevention intervention studies for lower urinary tract symptoms and conditions in women. Knowledge of such risk factors can lead to interventional strategies, which may be testable in future clinical trials. Specific aims of the PLUS-RC Scientific and Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) are to (1) conduct reviews of literature and meta-analyses of previous publications; (2) with the other PLUS-RC investigators, plan, design, and prioritize new epidemiologic and clinical studies of LUTS and implement an ancillary studies program; (3) provide data coordination and monitoring capabilities in support of PLUS-RC research studies; (4) provide comprehensive and innovative data analyses in support of presentation and publication of results, and construct high-quality datasets, which will be available to other researchers; and (5) provide logistical support for meetings and conference calls of the Steering and Planning Committee, all subcommittees, and an External Expert Panel for the efficient and ethical execution of consortium objectives. We bring together a uniquely strong team with a long history of accomplishment in biostatistics, epidemiology, and the conduct of large multi-center studies, extensive expertise in meta-analysis, observational data analysis, epidemiology specifically related to women's health, skills in behavioral modification and prevention science, and clinical care experience in the diagnosis and treatment of LUTS in women."
