9050918,"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is the period in which individuals are most likely to initiate the consumption of drugs of abuse. The onset of drug use during adolescence, however, also confers the highest risk of progressing from recreational use to addiction. This suggests that drug exposure during the critical window of adolescence may interfere with ongoing neuronal development and cause behavioral changes which facilitate subsequent substance abuse and addiction. However, there is still a significant lack of knowledge about the mechanisms accounting for these age-dependent effects of drug exposure. To address this gap in our knowledge, it is important to understand (1) the mechanism underlying the interaction between drugs of abuse and the adolescent brain, (2) how these interactions disrupt the development of neuronal circuitry, and (3) the resulting long-lasting changes in addiction-relevant behaviors. The guidance cue receptor DCC has recently emerged as a key molecular player in the adolescent organization of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, and expression of DCC is regulated by adolescent exposure to drugs of abuse. Exposure to the stimulant drug of abuse, amphetamine, during early adolescence disrupts the development of dopamine input to the medial prefrontal cortex of mice via alterations to DCC signaling. The long-term goal of the studies proposed here is to determine if amphetamine in adolescence reroutes dopamine axons to the medial prefrontal cortex from limbic regions by disrupting DCC-mediated guidance events, and identify the enduring consequences on prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive behavior. These neurobiological and behavioral alterations may underlie heightened vulnerability to progress to addiction in individuals that initiate drug use in adolescence. The experiments will employ neuroanatomical, gene transfection, and behavioral techniques in a mouse model to assess three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine whether amphetamine in adolescence increases prefrontal cortex dopamine innervation by promoting the rerouting of mesolimbic dopamine axons during adolescence. Aim 2 will assess whether DCC signaling is the molecular mechanism by which amphetamine in adolescence reroutes mesolimbic dopamine axons to the prefrontal cortex. Aim 3 will determine the role of DCC in mediating the long-term behavioral consequences of adolescent mesocorticolimbic dopamine reorganization.  The results of the proposed research will move the field toward a clearer understanding of the mechanisms accounting for the age-dependent effects of drug exposure on addiction vulnerability. These results could be used to facilitate development of individualized prevention and treatment strategies aimed at adolescent drug users, who are at heightened risk to progress to addiction."
9192659,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Loading peptides onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules involves the actions HLA-DM (DM) and HLA-DO (DO). DM regulates the exchange of MHC-II-associated invariant chain peptide with other peptides, while DO acts to inhibit interaction of DM with MHC-II. New high-resolution microscopy results from our lab revealed that DM localization is altered at the presence of DO, and additional data demonstrated a change in specific MHC-II peptide presentation at different DO/DM ratios. The major hypotheses addressed herein are that: (1) DO dominantly directs the DM subcellular destination to the low pH compartment where DO is being irreversibly degraded. (2) Changes in the DO/DM ratio can affect both quantity and quality of the peptides that are being displayed via MHC-II. The specific aims to be studied are: Aim 1: Delineate the subcellular localization of the DO/DM complexes as controlled by DO The subcellular localization of DM and DO will be evaluated in a genetically engineered cell line system, with cell lines that express DM with different levels of DO or altered DO localization motifs. (1) high-resolution microscopy and (2) subcellular fractionation followed by western blot analysis will be applied to determine the subsequent DO/DM localization. Aim 2: Characterize the peptide repertoire that is being displayed on surface MHC-II at different DO/DM levels The peptide repertoire of cell lines genetically engineered to express different levels of DM and/or DO will be evaluated by mass spectrometry. The output of the peptides extracted under different DO/DM ratios will be analyzed to assess their structural/biophysical properties and their protein (intracellular compartment) source. Additionally, the affinity of these peptides to the MHC-II allele expressed in this cell line will be measured as an IC50 value in competitive peptide binding assays.   The overall objective of this study is to gain a more precise understanding of how the changes in the DO/DM ratio regulate the antigen presentation process in MHC class II+ cells. Understanding of this mechanism may suggest strategies to modulate acquired tolerance by regulatory T cells and antigen presentation to T effector cells.  "
9192739,"PROJECT SUMMARY  DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are potentially catastrophic cellular insults that must be recognized and repaired to maintain genome integrity. DSB repair (DSBR) depends on two complicated and highly coordinated pathways: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error prone, and homology recombination (HR), which is error free. DNA DSB end resection initiates HR and is a critical determinant of DNA DSB repair pathway choice; however, the precise mechanisms by which DNA DSB repair is regulated are still not well understood. Due to the role of DNA DSB repair in mediating resistance to many types of cancer treatments, including cancer ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapy, elucidating how cells direct the repair of DNA DSBs also has significant clinical implications for developing better diagnostic and/or therapeutic tools. Here, a novel role for SAM domain and HD domain 1 (SAMHD1) in DNA DSBR is shown. Mutations in SAMHD1 are associated with AIDS, (AGS), and (CLL). SAMHD1 possesses both dNTP triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase) and exonuclease activities. Its dNTPase activity is well established and has a role in restricting HIV-1 replication by depleting nucleotides required for reverse transcription. However, how SAMHD1 functions as a nuclease is not well understood. Preliminary data show that, in response to DNA damage, SAMHD1 forms foci at DNA damage sites and that SAMHD1 interacts with known DSBR proteins. Depletion of SAMHD1 in cells impairs DNA end resection and HR. Interestingly, depletion of SAMHD1 sensitizes cells to IR and PARP inhibitor, further suggesting its role in DSBR, but mediates resistance to HU treatment, suggesting that SAMHD1 may function as a critical mediator of resistance to distinct types of DNA damaging agents. The hypothesis being tested is that SAMHD1 maintains genome integrity in response to DNA DSBs at least in part by promoting homologous recombination through DNA end resection. Furthermore, SAMHD1 through its unique combination of exonuclease and dNTPase activities may play a critical role in discriminating resistance to IR and chemotherapy, which may be exploited for cancer therapy. To test this hypothesis, following specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the mechanism by which SAMHD1 functions in DNA DSB repair; 2) Delineate the mechanism by which SAMHD1 is regulated in DNA DSB repair; 3) Determine the extent to which SAMHD1 functions as a biomarker for discriminating DNA damage sensitivity. These aims will be completed by a combination of cell biological, genetic, and biochemical approaches. Completion of these aims will provide novel insights into how SAMHD1 maintains genome integrity by promoting HR and prevents disease, including AGS, CLL, and HIV1 infection. Moreover, given the unique ability of SAMHD1 to regulate cellular dNTP pools and metabolize DNA, SAMHD1 may also function as an important biomarker for discriminating resistance of cancer cells to different types of cancer therapies that induce DNA damage, including chemotherapy and IR.

9258104,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Perception, cognition, and other high level brain functions are thought to arise in the neocortex, a laminar sheet of neurons forming the surface of the brain. However, the billions of neurons and trillions of synaptic connections in the cortex form an overwhelmingly complex system, and therefore more insight into the organization of the cortex at the local circuit level is needed. Previous research has suggested that ontogenetic columns (columns of clonally-related neurons) play a critical role in excitatory neuron integration in local microcircuitry, and may represent a fundamental module of cortical computation. However, the functional relationships within an ontogenetic column and the principles of ontogenetic column integration into the local circuit of inhibitory interneurons have not been examined.  This project will use multi-photon in vivo calcium imaging to characterize the visual feature selectivity of clonally-related neurons across all layers of primary visual cortex, and examine the distribution of feature selectivity within a layer, and how that distribution changes between cortical layers. Additionally, using octuple simultaneous whole cell patching, this project will test different classes of cortical inhibitory interneurons for patterns of connectivity to ontogenetic columns, in order to gain insight into how clonally related neurons integrate with unrelated neurons in the local circuit. Together, these experiments will delineate the influence of ontogenetic history on the functional organization and microcircuitry of adult neocortex. The results of this work have the potential to reveal fundamental new insights into how the brain processes incoming sensory information, and how that information is transformed as it passes from one cortical layer to another. These results will thus enable a more principled understanding of normal and abnormal circuit function, with broad implications for a wide range of currently intractable neuropsychiatric illnesses such as autism and schizophrenia."

9193920,"Project Summary  Sleep disturbance is a robust precursor to subsequent self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs), including suicide completion. Yet, to date, few studies have been conducted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this association. However, improved understanding of this phenomenon could allow for better ability to predict and intervene on SITBs risk, which fluctuates on a daily basis due to the presence of acute stressors (e.g., one or several nights of poor sleep). Growing evidence indicates a strong relationship between nightly sleep quality (SQ) and next day self-regulatory capacity. Specifically, poor SQ is associated with next day depleted self-regulatory capacity, such that individuals are more emotionally reactive to negative stimuli and are less able to modulate their emotional responses. Negative affect in particular is associated with frequency and intensity of SITBs, especially in individuals who are at higher baseline risk for SITBs. Thus, we propose that self-regulatory capacity may be one mechanism underlying the link between nightly SQ and daily SITBs, and that this relationship is particularly pronounced among high-risk individuals. The goals of this research are to test this hypothesis in a pair of studies using a variety of methods. In the first study, we will use daily experience methods to establish within-subject associations between nightly SQ and daily SITB among high- risk adults (i.e., chronically suicidal adults in an intensive outpatient program), and test negative affect as a mediator for these associations (Aim 1). In the second study, we will directly examine self-regulatory capacity in a controlled context using laboratory methods. Specifically, we will measure the extent that prior SQ (sleep actigraphy, averaged over 3 days) contributes to negative affect in response to a laboratory stressor in both low- and high-risk adults. Further, we will examine self-regulatory capacity (i.e., resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia) as a mediator for this association, and test whether these associations are strongest among those with higher baseline risk for SITBs (Aim 2). Ultimately, findings obtained from this project could lay the groundwork for future research to establish precise clinical indicators and biomarkers for SITBs risk associated with sleep disturbance. Importantly, the goals of the proposed research will be accomplished as part of a tailored research training plan focused on developing expertise in SITBs and psychopathology, sleep, important and cutting edge research methods (e.g., psychophysiology, sleep actigraphy, etc.), and advanced statistical approaches. The proposed plan would also include advanced coursework, close supervision and guidance from experts in the field, scientific writing and presentation experience, and opportunities for advanced clinical training with high-risk individuals and sleep disordered populations."
9261071,"Project Summary/Abstract  Each year, approximately 800,000 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are diagnosed in the United States. Although PID is an acute disease, poorly managed PID has significant chronic implications; women with PID may develop chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and tubal infertility. At least 20% of PID cases occur in adolescents, who are at increased risk for subsequent STIs and PID. Many adolescents and young adult women (?young women?) fail to fully engage in self-care behaviors and adhere to the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) treatment recommendations. The proposed study will employ a convergent mixed methods design within the infrastructure of the Technology Enhanced Community Health Nursing (TECH-N; 5R01NR013507) parent study, an ongoing randomized controlled trial to improve health outcomes among young women with PID. The proposed study will engage 100 non-pregnant 13- to 25- year-old females diagnosed with mild to moderate PID to examine social support, coping strategies, and self- care behaviors required for successful PID treatment: medication adherence, adherence to the 72-hour clinical follow-up visit, partner notification, sexual abstinence during the treatment period, and consistent condom use at the resumption of sexual intercourse. Guided by the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, the study will integrate quantitative data from structured baseline and follow-up interviews with in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews of participants. To support the study, the Brief COPE instrument has been added to the TECH-N protocol to measure coping strategies. The combination of quantitative and qualitative research will examine barriers to and facilitators of PID self-care, while providing detailed, contextual information to achieve the following specific aims: 1) Determine the coping strategies and types of social support utilized by young women diagnosed with PID; 2) Examine the relationships among coping strategies, social support, and engagement in PID self-care behaviors among young women; and 3) Explore the experiences of young women diagnosed with and treated for PID. The study is aligned with the Wellness theme of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), in that it seeks to identify factors that promote health and prevent illness among young women with PID. Understanding the factors associated with engagement in PID self-care behaviors is critical for the development of personally relevant, effective outpatient interventions for PID that empower young women to engage in behaviors that prevent adverse reproductive health outcomes. The training experience associated with the proposed research will capitalize on the applicant?s potential and provide essential training towards becoming an independent nurse scientist, with an emphasis on young women?s sexual and reproductive health."

9123069,"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amblyopia is a developmental visual disorder due to abnormal binocular input during an early critical period. It is characterized by low level deficis in acuity, contrast sensitivity, orientation discrimination, as well higher- level deficits in formand motion processing. Abnormalities have been found in V1 and V2, but fail to account for perceptual deficits implying further deficits must downstream. Our central hypothesis is that amblyopia stems from small deficits in early visual areas that are magnified downstream due to abnormal signal integration. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of behavior and physiology experiments to test both low and high level amblyopic deficits. We predict that amblyopic animals will be impaired on behavior tasks that require discrimination between global form stimuli. Neural responses to low-level grating stimuli will show deficits more severe than what has been reported in V1 and V2, more similar to perceptual deficits. Responses to high-level stimuli will exhibit shape selectivity, but to a more broad degree for amblyopic animals compared to visually normal controls. These experiments are critical to the overall understanding of the neural basis of amblyopia."
9189320,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the United States Staphylococcus aureus infections are highly prevalent, both in healthcare settings and within the community. These infections range in severity from recurrent skin abscesses to life-threatening necrotizing pneumonias. A clear understanding of how S. aureus is able to subvert the host immune system is necessary in order to develop effective therapeutic approaches. Important factors contributing to S. aureus virulence are the bi-component pore forming toxins (B-PFTs). B-PFT subunits assemble on the surface of host cells and form oligomeric pores that ultimately result in cellular death. Leukocidin AB, LukAB, is the most recently identified B-PFT and kills primary human neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Among S. aureus B-PFTs, LukAB contains the most amino-acid divergence, is the only toxin known to enhance S. aureus survival upon phagocytosis by human neutrophils, is the only toxin isolated as a dimer, and is the only B-PFT that uses a host integrin as a receptor (specifically CD11b, a component of the CD11b/CD18 integrin). Allelic variants of LukAB are also found in clinical isolates, although their functional role is unknown. Additionally, the mechanistic details of how LukAB induces cell death remain largely unknown. As such, the primary goal of this proposal is to identify the cellular signals emanating from LukAB interaction with host receptor that result in immune cell death. Experiments described in this application seek to (i) determine the role of the cytoplasmic tail of CD11b, and associated tyrosine kinases, toward LukAB-mediated cell death in human monocytes and (ii) determine the contribution of LukAB-allelic variants to immune cell response and lysis. Methods in the proposed experiments involve immunological biochemistry, mammalian and bacterial genetics, and in vitro and ex vivo cytotoxicity assays. Fully addressing these questions will provide a greater understating of the mechanistic details for an important S. aureus virulence factor and provide the necessary foundation for future development of specific inhibitors to LukAB-mediated cell death."
9191431,"The selective formation of C-C bonds is of fundamental importance in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, natural products and bio-active molecules for both health related research and clinical use. Iron-catalyzed C-C cross-coupling has emerged as a highly promising alternative to traditional precious metal catalysis, offering reduced cost, low toxicity and novel reactivities. Despite many recent achievements in the development of effective iron-catalyzed C-C cross-couplings, these methods only begin to address the potential of iron-based catalysts, and numerous challenges and areas for significant improvement remain. Examples include the current requirements for large amounts of toxic NMP co-solvent in many ferric salt catalyzed cross-couplings, the lack of broadly applicable methods for stereoselective cross-coupling with iron, and the need to broaden the scope of the nucleophiles and electrophiles that can be cross-coupled (including for alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling reactions). Motivation for the proposed research derives from the hypothesis that a detailed understanding of active catalyst structure and mechanism can provide the basis for improvements in current catalytic systems, as well as the inspiration for the development of new catalysts and methodologies that will greatly expand the scope and utility of iron in C-C cross-coupling. The objective of my proposed project is to utilize a novel experimental approach combining inorganic spectroscopies, density functional theory and synthesis combined with kinetic studies to develop molecular-level insight into active catalyst structure. This will shed light on the mechanisms involved in current leading edge iron-catalyzed C-C cross-coupling reactions involving simple ferric salt catalysts and combinations of simple ferric salts and NHC ligand additives. Building upon previous studies by the Neidig group on the isolation and characterization of FeMe4-, I will investigate the reduced iron species formed in reactions of simple ferric salts and methyl and ethyl Grignards in order to identify the active iron species and mechanisms underlying cross-coupling catalysis. Additional studies will extend this work to the effects of NMP and the presence of ?-hydrogens (i.e. in EtMgBr) on the in-situ formed iron species and mechanism in cross-couplings with simple ferric salts. In the area of iron-NHC catalyzed C-C cross- couplings, I will evaluate the active catalyst species, mechanisms of catalysis and the effects of NHC structure on reactivity in aryl-aryl and aryl-alkyl cross-coupling with iron-NHCs. Studies will include the spectroscopic identification of the in-situ formed iron species, their structural characterization and detailed evaluation of their reactions with electrophiles. The expected outcome of the proposed work is a detailed understanding of active iron catalyst structures and reaction mechanisms in leading edge iron cross- coupling systems that will facilitate and inspire the development of novel reaction methodologies based upon this fundamental insight."
9192358,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has special implications for behavioral health, through expanded coverage, legislative mandates specific to behavioral health, and behavioral health parity with medical and surgical benefits. These changes to behavioral health coverage have the potential to shift the treatment landscape for mental health and substance use disorders. Behavioral health benefits are critical to HIV+ individuals, because mental health and substance use disorders are highly prevalent. Untreated substance use and psychiatric disorders have both been associated with poor general and HIV-related health outcomes and with increased population-level transmission of HIV. In addition, mental health conditions are often co-morbid with substance use disorders. Consequently, developing an evidence base for behavioral health will have implications for policymakers seeking to ensure availability of appropriate care for two, often strongly comorbid, groups of treatable conditions. Few studies have examined the effects of the ACA on the health outcomes of people with HIV, and there are no studies on changes in their behavioral health and ACA implementation. The overarching objective of this study is to estimate and interpret the effects of the ACA on behavioral health service utilization and behavioral health outcomes in people with HIV. The quantitative component of this study will estimate the effects of ACA implementation on mental health and corresponding treatment, with a focus on depressive symptoms, in addition to substance use disorders, examining alcohol use, illicit drug use, and associated treatment. Finally, the aims of this study include a qualitative component, which is also the focus of the proposed training plan. The qualitative aim will assess awareness and perception of the ACA's effects on behavioral health coverage and care by conducting in-depth interviews with people with HIV and behavioral health needs. This mixed-methods approach leverages the quantitative data from two longitudinal studies of HIV infection with in-depth interviews with a subset of HIV+ study participants to estimate and interpret behavioral health trends. This study will be the first to examine the effects of the ACA on the behavioral health of people with HIV and will contribute to a nuanced evidence base of the shifting behavioral health services landscape, the behavioral health needs of people with HIV, and remaining barriers to behavioral health care. These aims align with AHRQ funding priorities in that they will examine changing access to behavioral health care and associated health outcomes in a priority population of people with HIV who have behavioral health needs. In addition to the research aims, this project will provide me with the training and mentorship to apply mixed methods approaches to new questions on policy and health insurance in people with HIV. I am confident that the research project, training, and mentorship that I will receive under this fellowship will position me to submit a K series award, to continue studying the effects of health policies on vulnerable populations."
9192395,"Project Summary  The successful development of artificial metalloenzymes tests our understanding of enzymatic catalysis, protein folding, and bioinorganic chemistry. A distinct and unmet challenge in this arena is the development of redox-active, artificial metalloenzymes that exhibit catalytic activity with small molecules. Nature employs a diverse array of copper-containing enzymes that make use of the tunable redox properties of this ubiquitous metal ion. This proposal outlines the design of flexible metal binding sites that accommodate two redox-active and coordinatively-unsaturated copper ions at the interface of complementary protein monomers or within a reengineered maltose binding receptor protein. These designs will be guided by computational methods, X-ray crystallography and bimetallic templating strategies. As a test for the catalytic properties of the designed site, we will investigate the CuI2- catalyzed reductive coupling of CO2 to oxalate."
9197907,"Project Summary The long-term goal of this proposal is to apply causal inference methods to inform implementation of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention (PrEP). PrEP is a proven biomedical intervention that has the potential to dramatically reduce the number of HIV infections globally, but insufficient adherence to PrEP is the biggest barrier to its effectiveness. Widespread implementation of PrEP is required to realize PrEP's full public health potential, and the most recent strategic plans and research priorities of NIH, PEPFAR, NIMH, and the Office of AIDS research all reflect the urgent need for more work in implementation science as it relates to HIV prevention.  No single HIV prevention program is ideal for all contexts, and before PrEP is rolled out widely, policy- makers need to assess how PrEP should fit into their own HIV prevention programs. This will require estimating the anticipated public health impact of PrEP in each context, and identifying priority populations for targeted adherence support. Transportability provides a timely solution to these challenges currently facing the PrEP implementation field.  Transportability is a novel mathematical framework for predicting the anticipated real-world effectiveness of interventions. The objective of this proposal is to use transportability to inform PrEP implementation by estimating PrEP's real-world effectiveness and identifying priority populations for adherence support. Using data from the iPrEx, iPrEx OLE, and PrEP DemoProjects, Aim 1 will illustrate how transportability can be applied to estimate the effectiveness of a randomized intervention in a distinct target population, and Aim 2 will clarify which characteristics and populations should be prioritized for adherence support.  The proposed study will provide valuable and timely insight for PrEP implementation, and will serve as a model for estimating real-world effectiveness of PrEP in other target populations. The interdisciplinary training environment, expert mentorship, and use of cutting edge methods will provide the applicant an opportunity to develop unmatched subject matter, technical, and methodological expertise for her career as a future independent researcher in HIV prevention epidemiology."
9258094,"ABSTRACT Chronic illness disproportionately affects lower-socioeconomic (SES) populations and typically strikes at a younger age than their higher-SES counterparts. This means that many working-age (40-64 years), lower-SES adults face limitations to activity and daily functioning related to the negative physical, mental and emotional effects of living with chronic illness. Evidence-based self-management programs are effective at mitigating the health and economic outcomes of chronic illness amongst this population, yet few have successfully engaged lower-SES, working age adults. Upon further exploration, this lack of engagement could be due to the failure of previous studies to design recruitment materials tailored to the motivations of this vulnerable population who, in addition to managing their chronic illness, typically juggle higher levels of work and family-related demands than younger or older adults. Thus, the purpose of the proposed study is to identify communication cues that effectively engage this underserved population in self-management-related research. This study will be conducted as an ancillary study to a parent randomized control trial (RCT) currently underway at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. This CDC-funded parent-RCT is testing the health and economic benefits of the Chronic Disease Self-management Program amongst lower-income workers ages 40-64. The proposed study will analyze quantitative data gathered from participants of the RCT regarding their preferences for communication cues featured in study advertisements, their processing and appraisal of such cues, their motivation to enroll in the study, and their subsequent enrollment and program participation. The aims of this project are to identify cue preferences that are most highly associated with these five levels of cognitive and behavioral engagement (cue processing, appraisal, motivation, enrollment and program participation) in a study testing a self-management program, to assess the extent to which cognitive engagement constructs (cue processing, appraisal and motivation) are associated with behavioral engagement (enrollment and program participation), and to assess whether key demographic variables moderate the findings of Aims 1 & 2. The results of this research may help answer NINR's Innovative Questions concerning how to translate evidence-based self-management programs to new populations. Furthermore, the knowledge gained during this study may also be used to guide future nurses as they attempt to engage this hard-to-reach demographic not only in self-management research, but in a variety of studies aimed to enhance health behavior."
9193819,"Project Summary Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the leading causes of liver cancer and liver transplants in the United States. While current treatments show considerable promise, many patients worldwide will not benefit from these treatments due to cost and required long-term administration and monitoring. Furthermore, cured patients are not protected from new HCV infection. A protective vaccine would greatly augment the efforts to reduce the global health impact caused by HCV. An immunocompetent animal model would aid development of an effective HCV vaccine however; this effort is impeded by HCV's strict species-tropism, as efficient HCV infection is restricted to only humans and chimpanzees. The experiments proposed in this application are aimed at studying the basic mechanisms by which HCV tropism is regulated, and are based on our hypothesis that HCV species-specific tropism is influenced, at least in part, by differences in the capacity for HCV to enter host cells and suppress innate immune responses in disparate species. We recently observed that ferrets are able to support HCV infection in vivo, but at much weaker levels than observed in humans and chimpanzees. We seek to understand what controls viral tropism of HCV during both entry and post-entry events and will explore species-specific blocks to HCV infection in ferrets. Our preliminary studies identified that the ferret version of the tight junction protein occludin (OCLN) does not function efficiently as an HCV entry factor. To define the cellular determinants of ferret OCLN's activity as an HCV entry factor, we will map critical residues that influence its function as an entry factor during HCV entry. We will also select for mutations in the HCV genome that will allow more efficient use of ferret OCLN. Furthermore, we have found that HCV suppression of the innate immune response is also influenced by species-specific factors, as we have found that HCV is unable to cleave ferret MAVS. We propose experiments to examine host and viral determinants that influence HCV cleavage of ferret MAVS and determine how inadequate suppression of the innate immune system in ferrets by HCV influences viral replication. By identifying species-specific entry, replication and innate immunity restrictions to HCV infection across a wide range of species and defining how these blocks contribute to HCV viral tropism, we can devise methods for efficient HCV infection in a range of species as well as provide insight on how host-pathogen interactions impact the life cycles and host susceptibility for a range of other viruses with similar replication and immune evasion mechanisms."
9259432,"Project Summary  Changes in the microvasculature of the brain with age have been observed in post-mortem studies using histology. These changes include decreases in length density, increased tortuosity, reductions in blood flow, and formation of string vessels. The severity of these changes has been observed to be greater with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Currently, there is no established way to measure the state of the capillaries and microvessels in the brain without using invasive or destructive histology. We propose to use diffusion weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to derive quantitative biomarkers to measure the state of the microvasculature in the brain. By creating noninvasive biomarkers to quantify the state of the biomarkers on a voxel-by-voxel basis, changes over time can be measured. This project will develop the imaging and estimation technology to quantify these biomarkers, and perform important validation steps to demonstrate proof of concept on a population of health young and aged subjects. Subsequently, the biomarkers will be applied to a small cohort of subjects with Alzheimer's disease. By developing novel, neuroimaging based biomarkers to quantify the state of the microvasculature, longitudinal studies examining the process of microvascular changes in the brain will be made possible."
9261985,"PROJECT SUMMARY Alterations in the epigenome have been associated with changes in cellular identity and have emerged as important drivers in human cancer. In melanoma, we have shown that overexpression of SETDB1 and SUV39H1, two histone 3 lysine 9 methyltransferases (H3K9 HMTs), accelerate melanoma formation in zebrafish and are also amplified in human cases. Recently, our lab has used the histone 3 lysine-to-methionine mutation at K9 (H3.3K9M) to interrogate the consequences of H3K9 HMT loss of function. Remarkably, we find that expression of H3.3K9M suppresses tumor onset. Because histone methylation is known to play a critical role in proper maintenance of cellular identity, we hypothesize that loss of H3K9 HMT activity suppresses melanoma through inhibition of the progenitor phenotype, which has been shown to promote melanomagenesis. We propose using both zebrafish and human melanoma cell lines to identify the mechanisms through which loss of H3K9 HMT activity suppresses melanoma formation."
9124067,"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic mapping the process of determining the genes that underlie a trait of interest is essential to medical genetics, and has played a fundamental role in our understanding of genetic diseases, pathogen virulence, and other topics across the entire range of biological phenomena. I am proposing a novel strategy to rapidly map genetic variants underlying important traits. This strategy involves generating variant genotypes from a single cell through loss-of-heterozygosity resulting from CRISPR, a genome-editing technology. The panel of variant cells can be used for mapping in much the same way as is done in linkage analysis. However, because the genomic rearrangements resulting from CRISPR will be targeted to precise regions of the genome, the method can provide arbitrarily high mapping resolution through iterative nested mapping panels, leading to the rapid identification of the genes and variants underlying the trait of interest. In theory, this method could enable the mapping of disease genes from single patients. The method will first be developed in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has been an essential test bed for fundamental tools and concepts in genetics. After this proof-of-principle experiment, the method will be applied to human cells to uncover genes influencing cancer drug effectiveness. This mapping approach will be further applied to uncover genetic variants that control other genes' expression, which could illuminate the mechanism through which genetic variants cause disease. Once developed, the ability to map genetic variants from a single individual will be extremely useful in myriad future mapping efforts."
9192638,"Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this project is to develop a unified, asymmetric route to several akuammiline alkaloids. The akuammiline alkaloids are a family of indole alkaloids that have garnered attention from the synthetic community for both their complex structures and their intriguing biological activities. Members of the family have been shown to hold potential for treating cancer, pain, inflammation, diabetes, depression, and herpes simplex virus.  The proposed routes should allow access to a variety of the core structures of the akuammilines, through the exploration of challenging synthetic transformations. I expect to accomplish the synthetic studies via the completion of two aims. First, I will use the unified route to access both (?)-picrinine and (?)-11-methoxyvincorine. The former of these should be accessible using a challenging, late stage oxidation. Following the synthesis of (?)-picrinine, I will explore and optimize an unusual structural rearrangement from (?)-picrinine to allow access to (?)-11-methoxyvincorine. With flexible access to those two natural products, I then propose to broaden the scope of the Fischer indolization methodology by using it to access compounds with vicinal quaternary centers. The introduction of vicinal quaternary stereocenters remains a formidable challenge in chemical synthesis. With that methodology in hand, I will use it to complete the first total synthesis of (?)-picraline, a compound which has derivatives that show promise for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Finally, I propose to use this methodology to access (?)-(?)-akuammigine, arguably the most complex akuammiline alkaloid isolated to date. Additionally, all compounds made during the course of my research will be submitted for biological testing."
9257231,"Project Summary  During the menopause transition, many healthy women with no history of cognitive dysfunction experience subjective difficulties with sustained attention, motivation for work, organization and working memory. Indicators of risk for executive function difficulties at menopause are lacking, as is an understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the unmasking of this vulnerability with loss of estradiol. The overarching purpose of this project is to determine whether early life adversity (adverse childhood experiences; ACE) and insults to the serotonergic system contribute to executive system dysfunction among menopausal women. Multi-modal imaging data from healthy, menopausal women with high and low numbers of adverse childhood experiences who have undergone tryptophan depletion, a paradigm used to lower central serotonin levels, will be used to characterize the effects of adverse childhood experiences and tryptophan depletion on behavioral and brain measures of executive function. I will determine the effect of the adverse childhood experiences and tryptophan depletion on executive performance, activation, and dynamic functional connectivity in menopausal women. Next, I will investigate the role of differences in grey matter volume and resting-state connectivity as explanatory factors underlying differences in executive activation associated with adverse childhood experiences and tryptophan. Then I will determine the role of estradiol in protecting against the effects of tryptophan depletion in women with high and low numbers of adverse childhood experiences.  Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide strong support for the mechanisms underlying new-onset cognitive dysfunction during menopause. Given the evidence supporting the early initiation of estrogen therapy in those who are candidates, results of this project have the potential to impact treatment and outcomes applicable to a large portion of the population. !"
9257855,"Project Summary/Abstract  Senescence and life span modulation are crucial biological processes for all cellular life, controlled through tightly regulated molecular mechanisms. Many of these mechanisms and their modulation are evolutionary conserved, including dietary restriction (DR) and inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway. While there are likely multiple cellular processes through which such life span modulators act, the full range of molecular phenotypes that cells display as they age under different contexts and genetic backgrounds remains to be characterized. Budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are an excellent model system for this application, as replicative life span (RLS) ? the number of times a mother cell buds before reaching senescence ? is a quantifiable measure of aging that can be collected for yeast on experimental timescales. For my dissertation research, I propose to use state-of-the-art biochemical and proteomic tools to characterize the molecular phenotypes of life span extension in yeast. In SPECIFIC AIM 1, we will construct molecular phenotypes for yeast mutants whose genotypes are associated with extended replicative lifespan. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, we will determine key proteins that induce lifespan extension in yeast upon intervention with modulators. The proposed research revisits previous yeast aging collaborations within my mentoring team, while being innovative in the use of a novel mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics that I recently developed. I expect to the resulting molecular phenotypes will replicate known processes such as mitochondrial respiration, reveal novel protein members of established processes, and discover processes not yet associated with yeast longevity."
9258052,"Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) remains one of the most common diseases affecting adults in the United States with over 850,000 new diagnoses annually. One of the most beneficial therapies for treating advanced heart failure is heart transplantation; yet potential transplant recipients far exceed the supply of donor organs and many patients do not qualify for transplantation. Therefore, alternative strategies have been developed for the treatment of advanced HF including durable mechanical circulatory support also referred to as ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy. VADs are generally available for implantation only in larger healthcare institutions that are capable of meeting the complex demands of implantation, routine device care, and management of emergent problems. Although rural patients are implanted with the device, sufficient access to routine follow-up care and during times of medical need is a concern. Yet, the impact of rurality on clinical VAD outcomes and HRQoL is unknown. The purpose of the proposed study is to identify outcome disparities between rural and urban VAD patients with the long-term goal of developing a program of research to promote better outcomes for the rural VAD population. The proposed study will identify outcome disparities for rural VAD patients by investigating the following specific aims: 1.) To determine the relationship of residency status (rural versus urban) and clinical VAD outcomes in the first year following device implantation with sub-aims that specifically examine death, device- related hospital admissions and adverse events, and 2.)To determine the relationship of residency status (rural versus urban) and patient-reported HRQoL in the first year following device implantation. Longitudinal data of VAD patients from the Penn State Hershey Medical Center that are part of the Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) and data from Oregon Health & Science University collected by Dr. Christopher Lee's R01 ?Profiling Biobehavioral Responses to Mechanical Support in Advanced Heart Failure? (5R01NR013492-04) will be utilized. Clinical outcome data are collected routinely at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-implantation and with adverse events and hospitalizations. The proposed study will also evaluate the relationship of residency status (rural versus urban) to patient-reported HRQoL in VAD patients from data collected at 3, 6 and 12 months post-implantation. Study findings will inform the development of a post-doctoral program of research aimed at rural VAD patient needs. The post-doctoral research plan will involve acquisition of advanced skills in qualitative research that will be utilized to gain in-depth knowledge of the patient's experience of living with a VAD in a rural area. Ultimately, data from both studies will be assimilated to serve as a platform for the development of interventional nursing strategies during the periods of highest risk for poor outcomes in rural VAD patients."
9191266,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv) is a protozoan pathogen that causes the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection in the United States and worldwide. Studies on Tv pathogenesis and immunity have been limited. However, the rise in drug resistant strains of Tv, and an emerging appreciation of the link between asymptomatic Tv infections with inflammation-driven pathologies demands better understanding of this prevalent human infection. Notably, Tv infection has been linked to reproductive complications, increased susceptibility to HIV, increased incidence of cervical cancer, and increased aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Clinical observation, previous work by others, and preliminary studies in our laboratory point to neutrophils (PMN) as the key player in anti-Tv immunity. PMN are extremely destructive cells, propagating a cascade of tissue damage and inflammation, which has been associated with inflammatory pathologies, initiation of new cancers, and exacerbation of existing neoplasms. If an infection is not cleared efficiently, the cycle of inflammation could persist chronically. While the importance of PMN in Tv infection is recognized, how they work to fight Tv infection is not characterized. Therefore, we aim to (i) determine how PMN kill Tv, and (ii) determine the role of PMN in establishing inflammation during Tv infection. Our preliminary data suggest that PMN kill Tv using trogocytosis (trogo= nibble), a process by which effector cells take small ?bites? from target cells. We will isolate PMN from human blood and co-culture with Tv. We will then use flow cytometry- based cytolysis assays, live cell imaging microscopy and imaging flow cytometry to determine whether PMN trogocytosis leads to death of Tv. We will also determine whether PMN use neutrophil extracellular traps NETosis to kill Tv, a process by which PMN release nuclear contents externally to ensnare, immobilize and kill pathogens. To assess NETosis, we will use extracellular DNA quantification, imaging, and flow-cytometry based cytolysis assays. In addition, to determine the consequences of PMN-Tv interaction on inflammation, we will probe supernatants of PMN-Tv co-cultures to determine the cytokine program that Tv elicits. We will use live Tv versus heat-inactivated Tv to determine the contribution of Tv-mediated tissue destruction on inflammation, and we will also perform Tv-PMN co-cultures in the presence of vaginal epithelial cells to determine how destruction of the epithelial layer by Tv and PMN contributes to inflammation. The knowledge gained from this study on how acute Tv infection is cleared by PMN and what inflammatory signals are established, will help to suggest potential strategies to monitor inflammatory pathologies, cervical cancers and prostate cancers associated with Tv infection, and inform the design of potential immunotherapy interventions."
9204016,"Despite major advances in treatment, Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) remains a significant public health issue that currently has no cure. Lifelong treatment is required due to the remaining latently infected cells. Unlike currently available drugs, a self-sustained therapeutic that targets events undergone by infected cells could potentially control the viral load in patients, leading to a functional cure. The HIV-1 life cycle consists of early events, the events from entry to proviral integration into the genome, and late events, which encompass transcription through budding and virion maturation. HIV-1 assembly, one of the late events, involves sequential assembly of Gag and Gag-Pol structural proteins along with HIV-1 genomic RNA to form assembly intermediate complexes, that eventually reach the plasma membrane to bud out as infectious virions. While much has been studied about assembly and viral determinants required for these events, the nature of assembly intermediates and the association of viral and cellular protein in these complexes is not well understood. Furthermore, while Gag is the major viral structural protein that is involved in assembly, Gag-Pol, which is incorporated at 1:20 ratio to that of Gag, also plays a role in these events. Mutations in Pol portion of Gag-Pol such as integrase (IN) and reverse transcriptase (RT) have been shown to interfere with the assembly events. The role of Gag-Pol or the host factors associated with Pol is largely unknown at this point. My project is focused on understanding of the role of a Pol-binding host factor in assembly and use this knowledge to develop therapeutics to inhibit assembly. .  A fragment of the HIV-1 IN-binding host protein, INI1/hSNF5, has been previously shown to inhibit HIV- 1 late events prior to budding. While it is known that the minimal IN-binding fragment of INI1/hSNF5 (termed S6) inhibits late events prior to budding, the exact stage or the mechanism is unknown. In this proposal, I propose (1) examining assembly intermediate complexes to determine if this inhibitory fragment affects assembly complex formation and (2) site-specifically inserting DNA coding for this fragment into the genome of T-cells and assessing off-target effects and ability to inhibit HIV-1 particle production. Determining the effects of S6 on assembly intermediates will shed light on mechanisms of early assembly and improve our knowledge of the role of IN-binding proteins in HIV-1 assembly. Gene therapy approaches to express S6 in T cells hold promising therapeutic potential for HIV-1. Inserting S6 site-specifically, using CRISPR/Cas9, a targeted nuclease that precisely modifies genomes, to inhibit assembly not only provides a novel approach to inhibit assembly, but also helps improve our knowledge of genome engineering to inhibit HIV-1 replication."
9256878,"Project Summary Low-dose NMDAR antagonists, including ketamine, elicit rapid antidepressant responses in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and in preclinical rodent models, although the efficacy is variable between mechanistically different NMDAR antagonists. These antidepressant effects are proposed to be triggered by either blocking NMDARs on fast spiking parvalbumin basket cells (PV BCs) or on pyramidal cells, but this remains unclear. No studies to date have examined the most immediate effects on the excitation/inhibition balance in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, brain regions negatively impacted by depression. Using electrophysiological recordings, this proposal will examine the effects of three mechanistically different NMDAR antagonists: ketamine, a non-competitive antagonist, glyx-13, a partial antagonist, and Ro 25-6981, a GluN2B subunit selective antagonist, all of which have antidepressant effects at low dose. Proposed experiments will examine whether NMDAR antagonists decrease interneuron excitability that disinhibits pyramidal cells or whether direct blockade of NMDARs on pyramidal cells trigger the immediate circuit changes. Additionally, pharmacological and genetic approaches will be used to identify how excitability of different interneuron subtypes is modulated by NMDAR antagonists. The goals of the proposal are to identify the location of the NMDARs mediating the rapid effects on key synaptic circuits, and to test whether mechanistically different NMDAR antagonists have shared or distinct effects on the excitation/inhibition balance, which could potentially provide a mechanistic understanding of the lower efficacy of GluN2B-selective NMDAR antagonists in treating depression. Knowledge of how NMDAR antagonists change synaptic circuit dynamics in brain regions involved in MDD may help identify novel targets for future therapeutics."
9261771,"Project Summary/Abstract  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) ranks among the 7th and 10th most common cancer among men and women respectively, with an estimated 61,500 new cases and 14,000 deaths in 2015. Specifically, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for approximately 70% of renal malignancies among adults.  Extensive research has been conducted on understanding the genetic alterations underlying the pathological features of ccRCC. Early and more recent studies have shown that the most common mutation to occur within ccRCC patients is the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene, VHL. Such discoveries have led to the generation of targeted therapies that are directed toward VEGF (or its receptor) and mTOR. However, responses of primary ccRCC tumors to theses agents are variable. As such, the need to discover alternative and efficient molecular targets for targeted drug therapy is essential. Our group has generated a novel genetically engineered murine model (GEMM) of ccRCC that shares histology to ccRCC patients. I will utilize this model as a platform to investigate the molecular interactions between HIF? subunits and the proto-oncogene, MYC. I hypothesize that HIF1? and HIF2? (H1H2) and HIF2? (H2) expressing ccRCC cells differentially regulate MYC's transcriptional activity and chromatin localization throughout the genome. Additionally, I hypothesize that the overexpression of MYC confers additional stability to HIF? subunits despite the loss of Vhl. Utilizing cell lines generated from our GEMM ccRCC model and Next Generation Sequencing analysis (RNA-seq and ChIP-seq), I will set out to interrogate the following aims: 1) Investigate whether MYC's transcriptional activity is differentially altered between ccRCC cells expressing H1H2 versus H2 only and 2) Determine how MYC positively regulates HIF1? and HIF2? levels within ccRCC.!"
9256932,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aerobic exercise is thought to promote healthy brain aging and to attenuate cognitive decline in seniors, and may protect from neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's dementia (AD). AD is characterized by a profound pathology of the hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal cortex, two brain regions that are critical for episodic memory formation. In animal models, aerobic exercise has been shown to increase the number of adult-born hippocampal neurons. In turn, newborn neurons have been shown to improve learning and memory. Studies in humans have shown that better aerobic fitness is associated with greater performance on memory tasks in both young and older adults, but this has yet to be studied in middle-aged adults. Given the increasing prevalence of AD, research has focused on preclinical stages, prior to emergence of cognitive symptoms. In this context, examining the middle-age range is crucial, because it may be the beginning of subtle cognitive or brain changes predictive of future AD. Additionally, neuroprotective interventions may be most successful the earlier they are implemented. The goal of the proposed project is to determine the neurobiological mechanisms of hippocampal-related plasticity from a cognitive neuroscience perspective by focusing on the hippocampal subfields, which are known to be negatively affected by aging, and elucidate how fitness may modulate these mechanisms across adulthood. Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on determining the effects of aging on the behavioral capacity to disambiguate overlapping stimuli during memory formation cross-sectionally throughout adulthood. The goal of Aim 2 is to elucidate how the relationship between task performance and age may be modulated by objectively assessed aerobic fitness. Aim 3 focuses on hippocampal subfield function associated with memory formation. Aim 3 will utilize high-resolution fMRI and data-driven analytic approaches uniquely suited for detecting subtle functional changes within hippocampal subfields. Training goals include gaining expertise in 1) state-of-the-art exercise physiology methods, and developing skills in 2) experimental design for behavioral and fMRI experiments, and 3) novel data-driven approaches to analysis. The central research hypotheses are that age will be positively associated with increased performance variability during the middle age range (Aim #1), that this performance variability will interact with fitness (Aim #2), and that aerobic fitness will also modulate hippocampal activation patterns underlying memory formation (Aim #3). This research project will enhance the knowledge of the effects of early aging on hippocampal plasticity and will set a foundation from which to identify individuals who may benefit from early neuroprotective interventions."
9258744,"PROJECT SUMMARY  Due to significant advances in the treatment of pediatric cancer patients, the five year survival rate now exceeds 80% in the USA. Among the myriad long-term physical and psychosocial effects of treatment, reproductive dysfunction is reported as a major concern and is highly correlated with quality of life in this population. The etiology of reproductive dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors (CCS) is complex and few predictors of this effect of treatment have been identified. High levels of psychological stress have also been observed in CCS; psychological stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which can suppress hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal function and disrupt reproductive function. The proposed research project will examine ovarian function in survivors of childhood cancer, a population at increased risk of reproductive dysfunction due to late effects of cancer treatment and psychological stress. The specific aims are (aim 1) to explore the relationship between perceived stress, biomarkers of HPA activity, gonadotropin levels, and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH); and (aim 2) to determine the model that best explains the relationship between the most salient variables identified in aim 1. This cross-sectional cohort study will enroll 50 female patients between the ages of 16 and 35 who were treated for childhood cancer at the Edinburgh Children?s Cancer Centre, Royal Hospital for Sick Children. Perceived stress will be measured using the Perceived Stress Scale-10. HPA activity will be measured using salivary and hair cortisol and salivary IL-6. Ovarian function will be measured using serum gonadotropin levels, serum AMH levels, and menstrual cycle characteristics, which are collected routinely during the subject?s annual follow-up visit. Biological samples will be analyzed using commercially available ELISA kits in the Queen?s Medical Research Institute. For aim 1, data will be analyzed using linear regression models using a best-subset variable selection procedure and aim 2 will employ nonlinear models to determine the model that best explains the relationship between variables identified from the analysis of aim 1.The findings from this study will increase our understanding of AMH as a biomarker of reproductive function, especially ovarian function. The sponsors are experienced mentors and experts in ovarian function (Anderson) and laboratory assessment of biomarkers (McCarthy). While conducting this study, the applicant will attend weekly seminars on reproductive physiology. This training program will prepare the applicicant to conduct cutting edge research on biobehavioral processes affecting ovarian aging."
9121078,"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Iron deficiency (ID), with and without anemia affects an estimated 2 billion people including 40% of pregnant women. ID is particularly deleterious during early-life brain development, leading to significant neurological impairments in children (e.g. learning and memory deficits). More troubling is that the learning and memory impairments persist into adulthood despite iron treatment in infancy, implying that iron therapy alone is not sufficient for full recovery. Thus, the long-term effects of lost education and job potential are te real cost to society of early-life ID. Understanding the iron-dependent molecular/cellular mechanisms that directly cause neurological dysfunction will allow future design of more effective therapies to prevent the long-lasting effects. The newborn brain is highly metabolic, accounting for 60% of total body oxygen consumption. Iron provides the catalytic component for several mitochondrial enzymes required for energy (ATP) production. Early-life ID reduces the energy status of the developing hippocampus, a highly metabolic brain region important for learning and memory. Early-life ID also impairs hippocampal neuron maturation, a metabolically demanding process, leading to reduced dendritic complexity and blunted spine formation in adulthood despite normalization of iron status. However, the molecular/cellular mechanisms contributing to the hippocampal energy impairments and how impaired energy status causes long-term neuronal structural deficits following developmental ID remain unclear. I will test the hypothesis that impaired mitochondrial respiration causes reduced energy status, leading to structural abnormalities in developing iron-deficient and mature formerly iron- deficient mouse hippocampal neurons. I will address this hypothesis through two specific aims. In Aim 1, I will determine the effect of ID on mitochondrial respiration and intracellular trafficking in developing  hippocampal neurons. Key parameters of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis and mitochondrial recruitment to growing dendrites/spines will be measured in iron-sufficient and -deficient hippocampal neurons. In Aim 2, I will test whether restoring energy status in addition to iron repletion attenuates the acute and chronic neuronal structural deficits f developmental ID. Select steps of energy metabolism will be genetically or pharmacologically manipulated in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, with or without iron repletion, and dendrite complexity and dendritic spine density and morphology will be assessed. This proposal is significant because it defines the role of specific energy metabolic processes in normal neuronal development and determines how a clinically relevant level of ID compromises them, thus providing a mechanistic basis for energy-specific therapies for fetal/neonatal ID. These discoveries and my professional and technical training in neuronal live-cell microscopy, morphology analysis and cellular bioenergetics will form the basis for an independent research career studying nutritional-metabolic regulation of neurodevelopment."
9123197,"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The microbial world presents one of the largest challenges to modern medicine in the 21st century in the form of novel, untreatable pathogens. Bacteriophages, the viruses that infect bacteria, are a major driver of this challenge. In particular, bacteriophages mediate the exchange of novel genetic materials (a process known as horizontal gene transfer, or HGT) between bacteria, transforming otherwise benign bacteria into human pathogens and driving the rapid emergence of pathogens resistant to existing treatments. Accordingly, there is a critical need to elucidate when, where, and how phage-mediated HGT occurs.  One critical aspect of phage-mediated HGT is lysogenization, the process by which phage DNA is integrated into the host bacterium's genome. Which bacterial cells are capable of being lysogenized and how the process of lysogenization is coupled to the physiology of the host bacterial cell are key questions in phage biology that remain unanswered. Recent technological advances in computer vision and single-cell imaging along with our lab's existing expertise in bacterial physiology enable us to interrogate this model system with unprecedented precision and find concrete answers to these long standing questions. We therefore propose to study these questions using E. coli and phage lambda as our initial model system.  Our guiding hypothesis is that the physiology of the host bacterial cells plays a critical  role in the occurrence of lysogeny. Interrogating this problem of bacteria-phage interactions requires a systems level view of bacterial physiology and detailed dynamic measurements of lysogeny development. The goal of this proposal is to develop a system capable of measuring the activities of viral transcription factors, host proteins, and infection outcomes simultaneously  in single cells. The analysis and interpretation of these data will lead to the discovery of novel host-virus interactions underlying lysogenic development and ultimately identify molecular targets that can be exploited to suppress phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer."
9124519,"?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Circulating sex hormones, particularly estrogens, provide neuroprotective effects in the hippocampus to promote synaptic plasticity and verbal/spatial memory throughout adulthood. For women, these effects are lost with the cessation of ovarian estrogen synthesis at menopause, compounding age-related hippocampal neurodegeneration and cognitive decline(6, 7). Furthermore, these neurological changes increase a woman's susceptibility to develop age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD)(8, 9). No hormone therapy exists to maintain cognitive function during menopause. Only short-term use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is FDA recommended for the management of menopausal symptoms because estrogens in HRT can increase carcinogenic proliferation of breast and uterine tissue and increase cardiovascular disease risk in older women(21-26). These adverse health risks preclude current formulations of HRT from becoming a long- term treatment for preventing hippocampal decline following ovarian estrogen loss. While both estrogen receptors ? and ? (ER?) have been associated with estrogen-mediated neuroprotection and memory following loss of ovarian estrogen, the ER-expressing cell-type mediating these functions is unknown, and the estrogen-regulated gene network has not been characterized at the cell-specific level. We have recently identified estriol, a clinically safe alternative to estrogens in HRT(23-26, 30, 31), as protective for hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory following loss of ovarian estrogen in a rodent ovariectomy (OVX) model. We hypothesize that estriol treatment is sufficient to maintain hippocampal plasticity and function following the loss of ovarian estrogen, and that these peripheral estrogen effects are mediated primarily by ER? expressed on neurons through the regulation of synapse-associated, cytoskeletal, and survival genes. We will characterize estriol-mediated neuroprotection in the hippocampus using behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuropathological outcome measures in adult and middle-aged OVX mice. Furthermore, we will determine the cell-type and the ER responsible for mediating this effect using ER- conditional knockout mice generated in our lab. Finally, we will characterize the estrogen-sensitive transcriptome of hippocampal neurons in adult and middle-aged mice. This work is significant because it will evaluate a treatment with high clinical relevance specifically for cognitive decline during menopause, use innovative conditional knockout models to reveal the cellular and molecular targets of the protective effects of estrogen in the hippocampus, and identify gene expression changes in adult and middle-aged mice to help characterize the estrogen-sensitive gene network in hippocampal neurons occurring during both surgical/early menopause and natural menopause. It will also warrant clinical trials of estriol to prevent cognitive decline from menopause. Together, this proposal supports the National Institute on Aging mission to explore research questions that significantly contribute to informed decision-making for relieving menopausal symptoms."
9256843,"PROJECT SUMMARY  A toxic stress response can result from exposure to extreme stressors in early childhood, such as poverty, violence or parental mental illness. Persistent elevation of the stress response system causes physiological disruptions that can result in alterations to brain architecture and neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic and cardiovascular functioning. Studies from animals and maltreated children demonstrate that the presence of a nurturing caregiver can buffer against the physiological disruptions associated with a toxic stress response; however, the specific positive caregiving characteristics that best promote a protective relationship in humans remain largely unexplored, particularly in families living in high-risk environments. Framed by an ecobiodevelopmental model, the proposed study employs a cross-sectional design to describe and examine relationships among past maternal experiences with caregiving, current caregiving patterns, and children's indicators of a toxic stress response in a multiethnic, urban sample of maternal-child dyads with children at early school age.  The first aim of this study is to describe physiological (hair cortisol, salivary c-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure), health (body mass index, growth delay) and behavioral (internalizing and externalizing behaviors) indicators of a toxic stress response in children. The second aim of this study is to describe maternal caregiving characteristics in the sample, including past maternal experiences with caregiving (adverse childhood experiences, family strengths) and current caregiving patterns (parental reflective functioning, parenting behaviors). The third aim is to examine correlations among past maternal experiences with caregiving, current caregiving patterns, and indicators of a toxic stress response in children. The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies designed to examine causal relationships between maternal characteristics and indicators of a toxic stress response in children, and may inform the development of interventions aiming to promote health and reduce disparities within families at risk for toxic stress. The proposed training plan includes coursework and a variety of scholarly and research activities to establish a strong foundation in nursing science and concepts related to the study, including maternal-child relationships, health disparities and social determinants of health. The training plan also includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the stress response system and develop my expertise in research methods, especially with complex families living in challenging community environments. Aligned with NINR's strategic plan to promote health and reduce disparities in minority and underserved populations, the proposed study and training plan will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating protective factors for toxic stress in families living with adversity."
